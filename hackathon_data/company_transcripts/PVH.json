Please go ahead, sir.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you, Kayla. Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. We're going to break the call down into 2 parts. Mike and I will take you through 2012 first. Then we'll do an overview of the business, and Mike will take you through the financial results. And then we'll go through a discussion of 2013, some of the early trends that we see in the PVH business, as well as talking about some of the trends that we see in the Warnaco businesses and our perspective on how the integration and acquisition will be moving forward throughout the year. And then we'll open up the call for questions.","Let me start by saying, given our fourth quarter results, we're very pleased. We beat the top end of our fourth quarter earnings guidance by $0.05 a share and came out of the year very clean from an inventory and receivable point of view, which we think positions us very well for the first half of the year.","Let me start by talking about the Tommy Hilfiger business, which has been our stellar performer for 2012. In the fourth quarter, the Tommy business continued its strong performance, posting a 9% revenue increase. Excluding the extra 53rd week, revenues increased 6%. In the fourth quarter, operating income increased 45% over the prior year.","Focusing on the international business. Internationally, revenues, excluding the 53rd week's revenue, increased 5%. Our retail comps in Europe posted a 9% increase, while European wholesale sales were up 3% for the quarter. Geographically, we continued to see strong growth in Central and Northern Europe, with particular strength in France, Germany and Turkey, partially offset by the continued weakness in Southern Europe, particularly Spain and Italy.","Moving to North America, excluding sales for the 53rd week, revenues were up 7% in North America, driven by a 5% comp store sales increase in our retail business, square footage growth at both wholesale and retail and mid-single-digit growth in our wholesale business for the quarter. We continue to see momentum in the North American business and strongly believe that the significant investments we are making in product, in our stores, in the shop presentation and our marketing programs are paying dividends for us.","Just to give the full-year perspective on Tommy, our Tommy Hilfiger segment consolidated posted a 5% revenue increase, with operating income growing 24%, to $437 million. Operating margins in the Tommy business consolidated increased 200 basis points, to 13.6%.","Moving to our Calvin Klein business. Our Calvin business continued to exceed our financial guidance and post strong results. Total revenues in the fourth quarter for our combined Calvin Klein businesses were up 14% despite overall softness in the global jeans and women's underwear businesses. These increases were driven by our Calvin Klein North American Retail and Wholesale businesses, which posted revenue increases of over 20%, driven by square footage growth at both wholesale and retail.","Operating income increased 5% in the fourth quarter despite a $6.5 million advertising expense increase relating to our Calvin Klein underwear campaign, which centered around our Super Bowl commercial. Absent this brand marketing investment, operating income would have been up 15% for the quarter.","The Calvin Klein brand posted revenue increases across all geographic regions, with the exception of Europe. Specifically by region, North America sales were up 4%, with all product categories posting strong results, with the exception of jeans and women's underwear, which were down double digits. In Asia, sales were up 3%, driven by mid-single-digit growth in China, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, partially offset by continued weak sales in Korea, where business was down double digits. Latin America and South America continued their strong performance, posting a 12% sales increase, driven by Brazil and Mexico. In Europe, sales were down about 13%, principally related to the poor performance in the Warnaco apparel and underwear businesses.","In our Licensing segment, overall royalty revenues were up 4% on a constant-currency basis. The increase was driven by strong performance globally in women's sportswear, dresses, footwear and handbags, all of which posted double-digit increases. This positive performance was negatively impacted by a 9% decline in Warnaco's global sales of jeans and underwear.","Moving to our Heritage businesses. Excluding the impact of the exited business, ongoing revenues excluding the 53rd week for the Heritage business increased 3%. Comp sales in the Heritage retail businesses were relatively flat, while our ongoing wholesale businesses posted a 4% sales increase, due principally to strong growth at Izod and Van Heusen sportswear businesses.","Operating earnings in the quarter more than doubled to approximately $27 million, driven by the strong performance in our wholesale dress and sportswear businesses. Partially offsetting this strong performance was a continued weakness in our retail business, particularly Bass.","With that, I'd like to turn the business -- the comments over to Mike to quantify some of the fourth quarter results.","Michael A. Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'll make are based on non-GAAP results and they're reconciled on our press release.","Our earnings per share for the quarter was $1.60. Included in our fourth quarter earnings is a $0.06 benefit for change in accounting for our pension expense, which I'll talk about in a moment. The fourth quarter EPS of $1.60 represents a 34% increase over the prior year amount, which is also adjusted for pension expense. Excluding the change in pension accounting, our earnings per share were $1.54, a $0.05 beat to the top end of our guidance.","Driving the earnings improvement over last year was revenue growth of approximately 7% and a significant increase in operating margin. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.","Operating margins increased 250 basis points over the prior year due to a 320 basis point gross margin increase. The gross margin increase was due to decreased product costs coupled with higher average-unit selling prices, as well as faster growth in the higher-margin Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses.","In the fourth quarter, we made a change to the accounting for our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Our new accounting method aligns with fair value concepts and is the preferred method of accounting. In addition, this change aligns our accounting method with the method utilized by Warnaco. The new method recognizes actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the fourth quarter of each year in which they occur versus our old method, which smooths such gains and losses out over many years.","The change in accounting method created a $0.15 benefit for the full year 2012 and a $0.06 benefit in 2011. Additional details on the change, including the impact on our quarters and segments, are presented in our press release.","I'll now turn it back to Manny, and we'll talk about 2013.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, thanks, Mike. I'm going to focus on some of the 2013 trends that we see in the business today and also on our guidance. I'll also talk about the PVH standalone business, as well as the Warnaco acquisition and those businesses as well.","Let me start with Tommy Hilfiger internationally. In Europe, our retail comps continued to run ahead of plan, with comp sales up about 5% to 6% on a shifted calendar basis against the low-single-digit comp store plan. From a wholesale perspective, we're running right on plan. Our spring and summer sales are planned up about 4% to 5%, and we continue to see good sell-throughs with our key customer accounts.","As we look to the fall holiday season, we have seen an acceleration in our European business, with our fall and holiday order book up over 10%. Again, against the 5-year plan, sales increased for the back half of the year. We are seeing double-digit growth in fall sales in Germany, France, Scandinavia, Russia and Turkey, offset by softness in Italy and Spain.","Moving to North America. In North America, our retail business is being impacted by this unseasonably colder spring weather, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest, where 65% of our stores are located. For our North America retail businesses, I'm going to talk about our comps on a calendar shifted basis to make it sure it's apples to apples.","Calvin Klein is running on plan at about 1% to 2% positive comps, with very strong margins. The Tommy Hilfiger business is running ahead of sales plan, posting a 4% comp store increase, along with also very strong margins.","Our Heritage retail business is the one that we're seeing considerable pressure in. Comps in our Heritage retail business are down 9%. We're fortunate that we've come out of the year so clean on inventories, though we haven't seen significant margin pressure to date. We believe this is a weather-related issue and that this business will start to show positive signs as we move into more seasonable weather in the coming months.","Our Heritage wholesale business, which represents over 60% of the Heritage segment, has seen a major turnaround in financial results and continues to perform. We feel we are very well positioned in the Heritage wholesale business. Our spring orders are on plan; inventories are in line with retail sales plan; and our in-store presentations are significantly enhanced and we've expanded our in-store shops with key customers. The Izod JCPenney shops are performing at plan levels and are one of the best-performing brands on their selling floor. All of this gives us a high degree of confidence that we'll continue to see a wholesale business improvement in 2013.","In North America, our wholesale businesses at Tommy and Calvin continued to perform and to record strong sales gains, particularly with Macy's, where both brands are performing very well in the spring season.","Moving to the Calvin Klein Licensing business. In 2013, we continue to see strong growth in all license categories now that Warnaco jeans and underwear businesses have been taken in-house. However, we are contending with a $20 million reduction in revenues in 2013, which is a direct result of the expiration of some long-term contractual agreements that guaranteed minimum revenues related to the European bridge business, the North American women's wholesale business and the Calvin Klein collection business.","Let me move to Warnaco. We've owned the business about 45 days, and we continue to be excited about the long-term opportunities that the acquisition presents. We continue to see significant growth for the Calvin Klein brand, both through geographic growth and product category expansion. However, in order to capture these significant global growth opportunities, we need to invest in Warnaco's infrastructure, logistics, supply-chain, product design team and systems in order to create a stable global growth business.","Let me give you an overview of how we are viewing each of Warnaco's business units. I'm going to start with Calvin Klein Asia. This is about a $530 million business that has grown at a double-digit rate over the last 5 years. This business has aggressively grown by significant square footage growth through a combination of new store openings and franchise distributor acquisitions. Over the last 3 years, there's been a lack of investment in the infrastructure of this business. We will need to invest in the operating infrastructure and fully integrate this business into our systems and supply chain over the next 24 months so that we can efficiently capture the growth in the market.","The Calvin Klein brand is very strong throughout Asia, and we are planning the business to grow about 5% in 2013. We are currently seeing comp store sales growth in China and all of Southeast Asia of about 5%. The only difficult Asian market for Calvin Klein is Korea, where comp sales are down double digits in the context of a difficult consumer environment and a difficult denim landscape.","Moving to Europe. Europe is about a $500 million jeans and underwear business. For the period 2007 to 2010, this business operated at a 10% to 12% operating margin. However, business has been quite difficult over the last 2 years, and operating margins in 2012 were below 4%. Our plan is to fully integrate this business onto our Tommy Hilfiger European operating platform over the next 12 months. We will also move the European headquarters of Calvin Klein from London to Amsterdam, where it will be under the direct management of our PVH European senior management team led by Fred Gehring and Daniel Grieder.","The Calvin Klein European business in 2013 is planned to be down low to mid-single digits as we are planning to shut down about 15 to 20 unprofitable stores, as well as reduce our sales to the off-price channel and unproductive small specialty accounts. We believe that by initially shrinking the business in Europe that we will improve the overall profitability of the business and better position the business for sustainable long-term growth.","Moving to North America. The Calvin Klein North American business for jeans and underwear is about a little bit over $500 million, with 10% operating margin. The business is comprised of a very profitable underwear business and an underperforming jeans business. The jeans business has been overly dependent upon the off-price and club channel, and as such, Calvin Klein has lost its leadership position in jeans with all of its major department store customers.","We are highly confident that over the next 2 years, we can turn the Calvin Klein Jeans department store business around. What makes us confident is, first and foremost, the strength of the Calvin Klein brand; second, as a management team, we have significant credibility with our retail partners and they have significant confidence in us that we will deliver for them. We can leverage off of the tremendous success that we've experienced in our Calvin Klein men's and women's apparel business and accessory businesses across North America. We are committed to invest in shops and fixtures, as well as point-of-sale marketing and in-store merchandising coordinators to enhance the in-store presentation and experience for our customers. We are investing in product design talent and product quality to upgrade our jeans product presentations to our consumers. All of this gives us the confidence that we can turn this jeans business around, rebalance our distribution in North America to a more regular-price business and take the business forward in a positive growth mode into the future, 2014 and beyond.","Moving to Latin America and Mexico, the Calvin Klein business in Mexico and Latin America is a little bit over $200 million. It's principally a wholesale business with strong double-digit operating margins. The brand is very strong throughout South America, and it enjoys a premium positioning throughout Latin America. We see this business continuing to grow at about 10% in 2013 and beyond. We have a very strong local management team based in Brazil and Mexico, and this business does not require significant additional investments in the future.","Finally, the Warnaco Heritage business of Speedo and Core Intimates are very similar to PVH's wholesale Heritage businesses. They have strong management teams in place that deliver solid operating results. These businesses recorded sales of a little over $400 million in 2012, and we are planning these businesses to grow 2% to 4% in 2012.","Finally, let me close my comments by saying having now owned the Warnaco business for 45 days, we are disappointed that we've had to come back to you with revised downward 2013 earnings guidance for the acquisition. However, the additional investments we are making today are necessary to build a sustainable growth business in Calvin Klein. We feel much more comfortable today that the long-term opportunities both for Calvin Klein and PVH are significant. We believe that the required near-term additional investments in infrastructure will accelerate the future growth of our business. We believe that will translate into earnings-per-share growth in excess of 15% in 2014 and beyond.","With that, I'd like to open up the -- let me turn it back to Mike, I'm sorry, I almost forgot my main man. Let me turn it back to Mike to just quantify some additional items about 2013.","Michael A. Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. I wanted to put some color to 2013 revenues and operating margins.","Our revenues for 2013 are projected at $8.2 billion. The standalone PVH company revenues are slightly over $6 billion, with standalone Warnaco revenues comprising about $2.15 billion. Year-over-year comparisons on revenue are impacted by the elimination of about $200 million of intercompany sales in 2013. In addition, standalone PVH Corp. benefited by a 53rd week in 2012, which is worth about $40 million, and the impact of not owning Warnaco for the first 10 days of our fiscal year, which is worth about $60 million. Our plans reflect standalone PVH revenues growing about 3%, excluding intercompany elimination and Warnaco sales, are basically flat to the prior year.","As a reminder, the Chaps business has been excluded from our go-forward guidance and the prior year comparison, as PVH has not kept the license. Sales for Chaps were approximately $230 million.","Manny covered current trends and projections, so I thought I would cover the impact on operating margins. Our operating margins for 2013 are planned at about 12%. This reflects a 40 basis point reduction to 2012. The Warnaco businesses for 2013 are planned to operate at about 8.5% to 9% operating margins, which is bringing down the overall PVH operating margin to 12%.","Lastly, I just wanted to spend a minute on the dilution associated with the transaction. Our original guidance was that this transaction would result in about $0.35 of accretion. Our new guidance is $0.25 of dilution, a $0.60 decrease. The cause of the decreases are a $45 million, or 20%, shortfall in earnings and $25 million of reduced synergies for year 1. The biggest change related to synergies is higher-than-estimated amortization of noncash intangible asset expense of about $10 million. In addition, we lost $5 million of earnings due to the closing of the transaction 10 days into the start of our fiscal year.","We continue to think the transaction will generate $100 million in annual synergies. However, we now estimate that we will need 4 years to attain these savings rather than our initial 3-year timeframe.","As a reminder, total debt is now approximately $4.5 billion, and we expect interest expense of about $200 million in 2013.","And with that, operator, we'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, if we could just focus a little bit more on the Warnaco piece of it, Manny. When you guys look at the last 45 days, can you just talk a little bit more sort of about the biggest surprises that you have found and sort of -- on the $100 million, Mike, the trajectory of the accretion as we go forward from the dilution this year and as you look over the next several years, like, how should we think about it from like a ramping perspective?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, Bobby, I guess, look, it's really -- the surprise has been in the lack of investments that were made in the basic operating platforms at Warnaco. Really some significant growth has gone on there with their business, a good portion of that growth driven by either new stores or acquisitions of franchisees and licensees. A lot of those acquisitions weren't fully integrated into the Warnaco business, so as we got visibility into their systems and a better understanding of how they were structured and maintained from an operating platform point of view, we really started to learn that there was multiple systems being run as opposed to regional systems being run. So the integration for us really is now required to be focused on a country-by-country basis as opposed to what we would have anticipated with more a regional integration, Europe, Asia, North America. We really have to now really focus, particularly in Asia, to go China, Korea, South -- the balance of Southeast Asia, then move to Europe. So it's really slowed down the pace of integration from what we would have thought would have been 15 to 18 months to more like -- today we're thinking that's more like 24 to 30 months as we go forward. So that has had a significant impact in that we haven't been really able to achieve the synergies and the cost savings, expense savings that we anticipated as quickly as we thought. So that has put pretty significant pressure on the accretion and dilution. In addition, the other challenge that we found, particularly in Asia but also in North America, is a level of inventory that really needs to be disposed of. And although some of that could be just naturally dealt with, with the acquisition accounting, it is going to put some pressure on normal operating margins as we're going to need to liquidate a higher level of inventory, particularly in the first 9 months of the year. And that's going to put pressure on the overall Calvin Klein margins. We think it's critical to move quickly on that, turn that inventory into cash and at the same time, clean the pipeline up as quickly as possible as we go forward. So those were the 2 biggest surprises we saw and really required us to get in and have hands on into the business as opposed to being able to view it public company to public company.","Michael A. Shaffer","And, Bobby, in terms of the $100 million in modeling, we were thinking about the synergies right now as $25 million this year and then building $25 million per year to get to the $100 million.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And, Manny, if I could just jump in with one more question is, can you elaborate a little bit more on the European business? The acceleration in the order book, what really is driving that in terms of the business, and what do you think about it from like the macro perspective as well?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think there's 2 -- when you think about the business, if you look at the fall 2012 sales at wholesale level and our spring 2013 -- spring-summer 2013 sales, both were up about 4% overall when you look at those 2 seasons combined, that 12-month period. And if you think about that, those were the 2 seasons that needed to be rationalized by the retailers, where they started to see a softness in their business beginning in fall holiday 2011. So what tends to happen in a wholesale model is not -- you deal with the fact that open-to-buy dollars are being shrunk, but also, at the same time, the need to bring inventory levels down to the new reality of what was being faced in Europe. As we got to the second half of this year, we started to anniversary that phenomenon. So that part of the takedown is behind us, so I think that's healthy for the business, and the business is now growing with retail sales in our wholesale account. In addition, there's no getting around it, we are gaining market share significantly throughout Europe, just based on the strength of the brand there, the quality of the product and design that's gone into the product and the outstanding performance by our management team that continue to position us throughout Europe. So in a, what I think everyone is talking about, a very challenged market, we've been able over the last 2 years, '12 and really projecting into '13, being able to continue to grow that European business at a mid-single-digit rate when the consumer overall is being challenged. I think -- finally, I think we do benefit from the fact that 75% of our business is in Northern and Central Europe, where the consumer is stronger, where we do have a very strong base there. And we have a growing business -- we had a growing business in Southern Europe; that's clearly slowed. But being such a small portion of our business, it hasn't impacted us as much as some other brands.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Manny, your senior management team has gained a lot of credibility and well earned over the last several years in terms of how you've executed, and I think that's why people are a bit surprised with the change in the Warnaco outlook. And how do you get us comfortable with your view that you think you've kind of reset the bar, that you factored in, I think hopefully conservatively, how the Warnaco business is going to unfold this year? And then within those additional investments, how do we think about what's onetime and what is ongoing?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. Let me take it. I guess, I'll start by saying, look, there's no guarantees in life, so I can't give you guarantees. I think we clearly are disappointed about that we've had to move the numbers. We've tried to be as transparent as possible to really lay it out in excruciating detail so you can understand what we're doing. I have no doubt that what we're doing is right, is correct, appropriate, and it will pay dividends into the future as we set -- reset the bar and reset the growth target for Calvin as we look to 2014 and beyond. This is a major complicated acquisition. It's over $2 billion in sales in 4 geographic regions. It's more -- I'm not going to be Pollyanna about this. This is more complicated than other acquisitions we've done, and it's required us to really dig in. We believe we understand the expense structure now. And we believe we understand the investments we're making. Always have to be concerned about the macro environment, and if that were to change, what that might not only do to the Warnaco business but also our PVH business. Putting that aside, we think we've gotten all of the news out about our infrastructure, the investments that need to be made, the time frame that it's going to take to do this integration. And we think we have a very disciplined approach to the integration to take it forward. Not only it gets -- it moves the business forward, but also protects the base business as we go forward not to put things at risk. So with that framework, I feel that, that presents -- puts us in a positive position as we go forward and that we've tried to be as transparent to lay all of this out. Finally, I'll just say, it's repetitive, but some of these problems that we are facing in the short term create more long-term opportunity. We were surprised on the logistics side, on the infrastructure side, on the supply chain side. But by the same token, as we fixed those things, without a doubt, those weaknesses today create more long-term opportunity for us as we go forward, as we hopefully improve that infrastructure and supply chain as we go forward. So on that level, try and look at the glass half full, I think it gives us greater confidence that we really -- that our long-term strategic rationale for this transaction is even more solidified as we go forward.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","All right. And just one quick follow-up. So basically you have a business, call it $2.2 billion at 8.5% operating margin. Your business, the core PVH business had a 13% operating margin. Clearly, a major gap, with an opportunity to close it. How do we think about the opportunity to move the top line in the Warnaco business versus the operating margin, and which do you see improving more quickly and what kind of pace?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, Dave...","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Over time.","Emanuel Chirico","I understand. I think the way -- look, we believe that there is significant long-term top line opportunity for Calvin given the -- if nothing else, the geographic growth that we see with the business and the product category introductions that we can have that we haven't allowed Warnaco, as our major distributor in Europe, Asia and Latin America, to really have access to. So men's and women's sportswear and accessories clearly are a tremendous growth vehicle for us outside of North America. They are significantly underdeveloped compared to all of our -- compared to the Tommy Hilfiger businesses in those regions. So there's tremendous top line growth. How that plays out over the next 3 years, I have to be directly honest with you, that's what's in process now, is the strategic overview. What I do have strong confidence -- and I think it will be there, I'm just not ready to quantify it by year and really lay it out in great detail at this point. Perhaps 6 months from now, we'll have an Analyst Day and we'll go through it and we'll be able to put more color on that as we have our arms around the acquisition. As we look at the -- but as we look at the operating margins, to your point, if you think about let's take the $1.8 billion of Calvin Klein business that exists at Warnaco, that business is operating at an 8% operating margin. That business has a clear opportunity to move towards our consolidated PVH operating margins over the next 3 to 4 years. And I think it will be a cadence over that 3- to 4-year period that we move from 8.5% to something approaching, let's use 12% as a reference point at this point now. So I think you could anticipate operating margin expansion during that period of time as we go forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Bilun Boyner","This is Bilun Boyner for Christian Buss. I was wondering if you put together any thoughts around how you will improve the acquired retail store portfolio. I know you mentioned some store closures, but other than that, are there any other early initiatives specifically for the retail network?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes. I think when we look at the business, particularly in Europe, there was a series of stores that were opened for revenue growth that appear to us to just be unproductive. So I'm think in first pass, very simplistically, I think there is a number of stores in Asia and in Europe that by closing will make ourselves more profitable and more productive, and we are aggressively moving in those 2 areas as we go forward. Secondly is Warnaco's strength, I believe, as a company has been on the wholesale side of the business. That's where their expertise have been, particularly in Asia. When you think about the Asian business, they've done a tremendous job of growing that business, but if you go through and look at the retail expertise that are in the business, it's not as deep. We clearly are a business that when you look at our business, we are -- just under 50% of our business is being done in retail, and we believe we bring a level of expertise that can help that business, particularly on the planning and in-store merchandise and presentation side of the business. And we're excited about that and we think you should really start to see those benefits really in 2014 as we're able to reposition the product, we're able to reposition some of the stores. That will come through. So the investments we're talking about making, planning systems, in-store merchandising, really try to enhance the customers' experience at point of sale, those things are all the investments and those things are really retail related, whether it's that we're directly operating the retail store ourselves or in Asia, where we have a significant network of franchise partners and we are -- we believe we can help them run better retail businesses although we are selling into them wholesale.","Bilun Boyner","Okay, that's very helpful. And then can you provide some more color on how Warnaco's new design team is progressing? I guess it was largely put in place earlier last year.","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, I think we are very satisfied. Karyn Hillman, who's joined us as our Chief Merchandising Officer over jeans and jeans accessories, we couldn't be more thrilled that she is there. The spring '14 product, and even to a degree, holiday '13 where they've had minimal influence, maybe more in North America than anywhere else, we really see the dramatic improvement in product. We've seen a significant improvement in quality. And she's brought a level of expertise with the team that she's brought in to focus on jeans that we think will pay dividends, and we're very happy that, that was an initiative that was put in place by Warnaco early on in the process, which we believe we can help that process, particularly on the supply side of the equation, really on the sourcing side, given our network and our capabilities that exist in Europe to source for the European denims business and in North America, given the large sourcing base that we have here. So we continue to believe we can improve the flow of goods systemically and getting them through our distribution network to help the product sell better on the floor and to get to the floor in a more appropriate basis.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Manny, based on your comments, it sounds like the Latin America business of Warnaco is in much better shape. And you said you're not requiring any additional investments there. So will we start to see you growing the Tommy Hilfiger brand through their distribution system there this year or are you can wait for the entire platform to be revamped?","Emanuel Chirico","No, I think it's -- look, over time, both Latin America, Asia, I believe there's opportunities to appropriately bring businesses in-house. And in some cases, when we look at some geographic areas, it might not make sense to directly operate some of these businesses and will be more efficient to kind of have a licensing relationship or licensing\/joint venture relationships, and we're looking at each of those geographies as we go forward. But in the short term, I don't think in the next 24 months you'll see a dramatic change in any of those businesses. We have a great partner in Tommy in Brazil. We believe we have tremendous growth opportunity with our Brazilian business in Calvin. We believe the real opportunity for Calvin, when you think about the Latin America business of Calvin, it is principally a Jeans business. There is huge opportunity to grow the Sportswear and Accessory component of that business, men's and women's, and I think that's where we really should focus on, is taking the strength that we have in Calvin and growing the Calvin business and allowing our partner to grow the Tommy business. And then 3 years or so from now, look at both of those businesses and decide should we be thinking about bringing businesses in-house. Clearly, the deals we've struck have given us that flexibility. It's also done the same thing in Asia for us to give us the flexibility there. And I think as we look at our long-term growth, that's clearly part of our strategy. But the first priority is to get the operating platforms and infrastructures set up and then grow the existing Calvin business and then think about consolidating.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question is on cleaning up some of the inventory. How exactly are you going about it? Are you pushing through some of the underwear and jean inventory through your outlets? Or with regards to markdowns, how aggressive do you need to be to clear that inventory?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. To be clear is whatever inventory -- the inventory issues that we're dealing with are in jeans. We don't have any significant inventory issues on the underwear side of the business. So this is really a jeans, denim issue, and it will require liquidation. We will use our stores as appropriate, and we'll also use the off-price channel. Our goal is speed. We want to be able to make the goods hit and disappear as quickly as possible. We don't want the goods to linger. It's not good for the brand, and it's not good for our cash flow and cleaning up the pipeline on product. I also think, secondarily, is we want to be in as clean a position when we -- not only in our channel, but with our customer's channel when we turn to spring 2014. So it's critical for us to really move quickly to clean this up. It will require some significant markdowns, some of which will be provided for the extraordinary nature of the markdowns, but all but some are a couple hundred basis points that is affecting the existing businesses as well because as you mark down certain level of goods, it puts pressure on your current goods as well. So we're contemplating all of that, trying to make it flow through, but that's the nature of how we're looking at it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Manny, can you talk a little bit about how the Europe team, the Tommy Hilfiger team, the talent you have over there, the infrastructure you have over there, how you're going to be able to leverage that with the Calvin Klein Warnaco piece in Europe that you brought in-house now? What are some of the key opportunities, and how will that progress over time? Is it a 2-year story? And is it revenue and margin category expansion, geographic expansion, or do you really need to shrink that business before you can start to grow it again?","Emanuel Chirico","I think as -- Omar, I think I said in my opening comments, I think it will be shrink the business initially, meaning 2013. And I think actually by shrinking the business, we'll actually improve the profitability of the business. We are really lopping off unproductive wholesale accounts and we're lopping -- we're taking out unproductive retail stores. That's our goal. We have a -- similar to North America, we have a profitable underwear business that we believe, with better inventory flow, we can make more profitable. And we have a disappointing apparel business, be it bridge and jeans combined, that has really been a money loser for us. That's the business where I think our Tommy team can very quickly -- quickly meaning spring 2014, very quickly bring improvements to. The supply chain in particular, Warnaco tended to source all of the European product out of Asia. A majority of our product comes out of the Mideast basin, much more quick response, react to the business, we have a proven supply, a quality supply base that has grown the Tommy Hilfiger denim business to a very profitable EUR 300 million business. So we believe we have the tools in place to really enhance that business. We think we are uniquely positioned, given the strength of the management team, given the product categories that we're really focused on to bring -- to see improvement in that business much quicker than Warnaco would have been able to deliver on a standalone basis, just given the quality and expertise of our management team and the credibility that the management team has with the key wholesale accounts throughout Europe. Country by country, having that sales network established, already having in the process of consolidating showrooms and sales offices in each major market, I think will really position us well as we go forward and should really start to pay dividends for us as we go forward. And the last thing I'd say is, consistently across the board, the Calvin Klein brand, all the research that we've done geographically, Europe, Asia, Latin America and North America, continues to support how strong the brand is. And even independent third-party research that you see in Women's Wear Daily or in some of the luxury magazines that do their own, the Calvin Klein brand is always -- is not the top brand, one of the top 2 designer brands in the world. This is infrastructure turnaround of a business. This is not a problem brand by any means. This is a brand that's got great opportunity for growth that we're just not taking advantage of, particularly in Europe, where the brand on a relative basis is so small compared to what the opportunity against the market is.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's really helpful, Manny. And then still on the Europe, if you think about the success that Tommy has had with those guys and they've have done an amazing job, the wholesale and the retail business in this kind of lifestyle presentation a lot of times have been flagships for Tommy Hilfiger and that's kind of replicated in the smaller scale and a lot of the wholesale channels, is there -- does the Tommy team who's going to help with the Calvin transition in Europe, do they see that opportunity to kind of transition how the consumer interfaces with the brand over there? Is there a flagship opportunity in kind of connecting the denim and the underwear and the sportswear and the accessories all kind of under one consumer-facing retail format?","Emanuel Chirico","Definitely. Retail will be a significant portion of the growth. It's been with Tommy. Again, balanced retail, balanced flagships, balanced outlet store business, very profitable. And even our regular priced -- our regular specialty stores with Tommy are very profitable. We have 30 flagship stores throughout Europe as well. We think that there is a need for more retail presence -- more regular priced retail presence in major cities. And I think over the next 3 years, you'll start to see -- there's already a store in London, you'll see more presence in the U.K. You'll see more presence in France. And you'll see more presence, obviously, in Italy and Germany as we go forward. So there's clearly the need to also build retail up. One of the benefits we have is we have this tremendous underwear business that if managed inventory correctly and managed the flow, very profitable. And we have this jeans business that we think if we get right, we start off, we believe, with the business that's very profitable. So we don't have to build a brand in Europe the way the Tommy team over a 10-year period had to build the knowledge of what Tommy Hilfiger is with the European consumer. Europeans seem to have a very high opinion of what the Calvin Klein brand is, has a very high perception of that, so although we'll have retail stores and we will make investments, we are starting from a much stronger brand position than the Tommy management team had to start with in Europe. So we can use that I think to our advantage to move more quickly over the next 3 to 4 years.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eric Beder with Brean Capital.","Eric M. Beder - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about some of the other licensees for Calvin Klein now in perfume and, I guess, in the outerwear? How are -- how did those do, and what are you expecting those guys to do in 2013?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. The Calvin -- let me start on the women's side of the business, North America, our key strategic partner there, G-III, that business grew double digits last year, driven by women's sportswear, dresses, suits and outerwear. The handbag business also had tremendous growth. We are planning that business right now at mid-single-digit growth. As usual, our partner G-III tends to be -- has consistently tended to be conservative in their estimates and have overachieved. We would hope that's the case this year. There seems to be more demand. And based on the performance of those categories right now, that would seem to be a conservative number. But that's the way the business is being planned, up 5% to 6% for 2013. The fragrance business, which is very large and very aspirational for the brand, we are planning very modest growth in that business, 1% to 2%. It's a big business. We have a big share of market there. Offsetting that is we have a number of new launches and particularly a big launch in fall that's going to have a significant marketing investment behind it. So we'll see how that will play out. So we think we are being reasonably conservative about the projections in the fragrance business as we go forward. Footwear has been an area that, and particularly on the men's side, has seen substantial growth. We're planning that business to grow mid-single digits, where this year it grew at a double-digit rate. So I guess I would characterize that we think we've taken a prudent approach with the licensing revenues. We think the categories that will continue to be strong for us have been strong for us, and we think if trends continue, there's an opportunity to outperform our estimates on the Calvin Klein Licensing side. So we'll see how that will progress. I hope that was helpful.","Eric M. Beder - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","In terms of the marketing spend, you talked about the Super Bowl ad. How should we think about the marketing spend going forward now that you've integrated Warnaco into the mix. And I guess it's kind of a more unified -- it was always pretty unified but even more unified marketing spend. How should we think about that going forward?","Emanuel Chirico","I think the marketing message will be more unified. I think principally be -- I guess the biggest differences we see going forward and it will -- 2013 will be an evolutionary year as we pull it in, but if you think about it is, by license agreement, as you would expect, the significant amount, the very large jeans business require that all of that advertising go directly to its jeans advertising. And I think that was out of balance for the brand. We think we'd like to spend that same amount of dollars and spend it on the Calvin Klein brand, similar to more with what we do on the Tommy side of the business, where we have denim and jeans ads, but we do it in a much more connected lifestyle brand focus. So that will be a bit of a change. From a spend point of view, I think you'll see a couple of things. I think the spend on balance will be about the same. I think what you'll see is clearly spending more digitally as we go forward, less in print, probably a little bit more outdoor than we've been to really complement the digital advertising. And I think as we go forward, more in-store marketing investments in fixtures, investments at point-of-sale marketing, investment in our own stores and our customer stores, taking some of the ad dollars and really putting in the hot zone and to drive business directly when the consumer is in there and acting on it. So as a licensor, we needed to -- the approach was all about brand enhancement and brand image-building, and I think the Calvin group does a great job of that. As we now are becoming much more brand operators and controlling over 50% of the brand directly, I think you'll see more of the brand spend at point-of-sale and really trying to deliver against a return more directly against sales as opposed to just image-building.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the Warnaco North America Calvin business, the one you said $500 million. So first, what do you expect for 2013 growth? I don't know if I heard that. And then secondly, you said it's pretty off-price club dependent. Like, if you -- can you give us a little bit more sense of the size of that? And going forward, should we expect maybe another year of reduction in 2014 before that starts to grow? And also, is the profitability of that off-price club higher than maybe the rest of the kind of department store business, and again we should we expect first a reduction in profitability as you balance that out?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. I guess, the $500 million -- I'm not going to -- to make it really clear, I'm not breaking out distribution by channel. But what I would say is it's out of balance. What we'd like to see is more healthy balance as we go forward over a 24-month period. We are planning -- we are looking at the jeans business and planning it relatively flat to down low single digits in 2013 as we do some of that rebalancing. We really see a significant opportunity on the jeans side to grow the regular-price business. And that's a business that we really think will enhance the overall jeans presentation throughout North America, which we think is very important. So the short answer is, I think you'll see this business relatively flat over a 2-year period, but the plan is to really have more sales going through the regular-price distribution and slightly less sales going through the off-price. And again, that's really on the jeans side of the business. The jeans side of the business overall has been a much lower operating margin business. The club business, obviously, is a profitable business, but sometimes selling it to the off-price business is not so profitable. We really need to bring balance to that, and I think overall, we believe we can enhance the profitability of the U.S. business by just changing the mix of business, bringing some of our expertise to manage the businesses and flowing inventory better and potentially improving the product, which we think will have the real benefit of improving the sell-throughs of the gross margins as we go forward. Not necessarily looking at initial gross margins, but looking at maintained gross margins after sell-through, after markdowns and selling at higher price points. Better product will do that and it's easy to say and sometimes hard to execute, but we really think we see a clear lane to deliver against that. So I think relatively speaking, you'll see $40 million to $50 million moving out of the off-price channel -- club channel, moving to the regular-price channel over a 2-year period. So I don't want to overstate that as well, but it's important to get that. What's even more important, it's less about the club business. It's more about having jeans presented appropriately, consistently with everything else we do in the department store business, be it underwear, be it men's sportswear, be it women's sportswear, our accessory business. I don't think anybody presents product and presents their brand in a better way at the department store level than Calvin Klein, with the exception of the jeans business. And I think the jeans business, there's been a lack of shop investment, lack of point-of-sale investment. We clearly will change that. I know that will enhance the business, the presentation, put it front-and-center with the consumer. When we get the product right and the presentation right, the Calvin Klein brand consistently performs and shines. So we have little doubt that, that will be the case here.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. The other question is on the Heritage side, wholesale. I think you said a major turnaround. That's interesting to hear because of all the challenges in the mid-tier channel, but maybe give us a little bit more color on that kind of what's driving that. I think Van Heusen sportswear is new, I haven't heard about that as much, the strength there. And the other one is I think we're expecting an operating margin improvement in 2013 in Heritage, and if can you spell that out a little bit as well, is there still lower product cost benefit in -- early in the year? Maybe, what's the markdown opportunity?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. Look, I think to put it simply, our Heritage businesses historically have operated on a 10% operating margin basis. We got -- we were -- we underperformed in the second half of 2011, and we underperformed in the first half of 2012. Operating margins this year are relatively flat with last year, at around 7%. So there's clearly a 200 to 300 basis point improvement that we think we'll deliver over the next 2 years. The part of the business that clearly is performing for us is our wholesale business, both dress furnishings and our sportswear businesses despite the weakness in the mid-tier channel. Our businesses there are healthy, performing. We've suffered with the contraction that's happened at Penney's on the dress shirt\/neckwear side of the business from 2011, it's probably cost us $40 million in sales on the dress furnishings side, but by the same token, with the investments that we've made along with JCPenney on the sportswear side with Van Heusen and Izod, we've made up that $40 million difference between -- in the mid-tier channel to really position ourselves to be relatively flat overall, with the dress shirt business being weak, but margins, because it's a replenishment business, under control and not really being able -- taking a big hit there. We think we're well positioned as we go into '13 to continue the momentum we saw in the second half of the year on the wholesale side of the business. So we -- I would anticipate operating margins at least 100% higher for the year in 2013. The challenge for us continues to be our retail businesses, which are -- Heritage, which are underperforming and we need to get those back in line, and we're working very hard on that. But clearly, we're seeing significant wholesale margin expansion.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Kernan with Cowen.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to shift gears a little bit to Tommy Hilfiger, which obviously continues to be on fire both in North America and international. If we look at some of the operating margin expansion there, particularly in North America in 2012 and in international as well even in the face of pretty difficult currency comparisons, how...","Emanuel Chirico","John, I'm sorry for whatever happened. You broke up on my end. I apologize. Could you just repeat the question?","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, sorry. On Tommy Hilfiger, obviously been a great -- the momentum there continues. North America operating margin, up another 400 basis points this year. International side of the business, the operating margin increased in the face of difficult currency comparisons. How should we think to model the Tommy Hilfiger profitability going forward?","Emanuel Chirico","I think we would continue to look for 20 to 40 basis points improvement in overall Tommy Hilfiger margins. The inter -- mix may play more positively to that as we go forward. But given where we are performing now at these levels, I think that's a reasonable place for us to be. I think that there's opportunity, but clearly we've captured tremendous opportunity in 2011 and '12. So I think you have to think about it more in those terms.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just shifting back to the Warnaco portfolio with EBIT guided down about 20% and revenues flat. What's the magnitude and when do you think the top line growth in that Warnaco portfolio can start to begin again?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, I think really it's a 2014 story and beyond. I think it's -- and I've got to be honest, we may be even shrinking the first half of 2014, but again, it will be -- what we will be shrinking is unproductive, unprofitable sales, not necessarily productive sales. And what you have to think about also is, there was a pressure on Warnaco, given the licensing agreements in place, that certain sales threshold needed to be maintained and grown in order to maintain the business. So there was an appetite on that side to grow the top line in order to maintain the license and some of that growth was cannibalizing other businesses or just not very efficient growth overall. As the operator of the brand, obviously, we want to clean that up and really bring it to a much more productive base. So I don't think you should be viewing this contraction in the business that we're going to have to go through for the next 18 months as a negative. And we will try to be clear that -- what channels or what's causing some of the decline and try to give you a clear picture into how we're seeing the growth in the regular-price department store business, with some of our wholesale key accounts around there and with the ongoing comp retail businesses as we see it and pulling out -- we will pull out the businesses in the stores that we're identifying to be closed out of the comp numbers so we can really try to isolate that for the investor base as we go forward. So I guess I would just say is, don't view some of that contraction as a negative. There is growth as we go forward. We see it in Asia and Latin America in particular. And the growth in North America, although it may be net-net getting rid of some bad distribution for some good distribution, I think you'll see the operating margins improve there as we go forward, and a very similar story in Europe as well. Shrinking to more profitability, I think, in the next 18 months in Europe and North America is the critical focus.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one final question for Mike. In terms of CapEx for this year and next, where do you see the CapEx needs of the business? And then, how should we model debt paydown on an annual basis?","Michael A. Shaffer","Okay, what we're talking about for CapEx for this year is about $300 million. I think as you look to next year, that number will probably be similar to this year, at about $300 million. In terms of -- just a heads-up, that doesn't include the onetime cost which we're talking about and captured separately. So true CapEx for the ongoing business is about $300 million. And debt paydown, we're looking at about $400 million for this year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Manny, I wanted to circle back with some other comments you made earlier on -- just on the sourcing and supply chain opportunity for Calvin Klein Jeans. I mean, as you've dug in there a little bit deeper over the last 45 days in related to this opportunity, can you just share a little bit more detail around your learnings of what has maybe surprises you there most, and maybe compare how you're viewing the Calvin Klein Jeans opportunity for improvement relative to what's happening at the Calvin Klein underwear business from just a sourcing and supply chain perspective?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, I guess the biggest surprise and the biggest opportunity as we go forward is a significant lack of inventory planning systems. And the lead times required in the Calvin Klein Jeans and underwear business are 4 to 6 months longer than what we are used to operating at. So the management team has been forced to have to make decisions 12 months out on inventory purchases and commitments with their factory base, where we tend to make commitments out 6 months usually and sometimes 8 on some categories. We're making commitments, but not committing exactly to what's being made. So there was really an over -- a very long lead time that I think really when business gets a little bit tighter is where you really see that coming back to hurt you in the business. When you're in a growth mode and growing square footage and committing to inventory in some respect, in that process, there's inventory -- there's never enough inventory because you're growing so fast and you're adding square footage above your plans, but in the case where you start to see some contraction in the business, where you start to see some softness, as what's happened the last 18 months, that's how inventory builds and you can't react to it as quickly. So that was the biggest surprise and opportunity that we see to get out to really bring some of the planning systems and disciplines that we have here that I think will help more efficiently run the business and potentially allow for more margin -- gross margin opportunity as we go forward, not from lower cost, but from a better flow of inventory.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess from a sourcing perspective, are you going to be changing some of the sourcing infrastructure from a factory perspective? Will you be moving over some of the former Calvin Klein businesses to any of your Tommy Hilfiger factories? Or how will you be thinking about the refinement there?","Emanuel Chirico","I think you'll see refinement on both sides. It was a -- the sourcing team at Warnaco in the Far East was very strong. It's got a long experience. There is some real -- there's some positive things there that we can take advantage of. And on the flip side, there's some real opportunities to -- again, I just want to be clear, it's not necessarily about lower cost. It's about quicker response times, shorter lead times that we think will really improve the efficiency of the business. So this is not about taking our woven shirts and their woven shirts and squeezing another $0.25 out of that. I think Warnaco did a strong job of negotiating low cost, but I think the miss is, I think there's more opportunity sometimes to pay a little bit more for goods with a better factory, better sourcing base that delivers you more flexibility and ability to react the business, both from a fashion point of view and from a flow point of view to get your markdowns under better control. And I think that's what we really see as the big opportunity.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just one last question. As you think about kind of investing a little bit more this year from a talent perspective, are there any kind of key adds you're still -- or holes in the business that you're still waiting to hire into, or where should we be thinking about some of the pockets of opportunity in developing or hiring in some new talent?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, look, the 2 biggest holes in the business, and they've been there now I guess 9 to 15 months, is the regional president\/managing director in Europe for Calvin Klein. That position has been opened. That's a key position, and I don't know how you have a turnaround without strong leadership there to really run it. And in a similar way, in Asia, the regional president\/managing director position has been opened for 9 to 12 months. And we are aggressively out performing a search to try and bring in very strong talent there, looking for, particularly in Asia, retail expertise, as well as brand expertise to bring in to that part of the world. We've got a very high-quality management team in Asia, country by country, China, Korea and Southeast Asia, as well as a strong group function, but we really need the leadership on the ground to really bring that all together that could really help each of the country managers more efficiently operate their business. Those are the 2 key hires that are missing and have been open and I think have caused some of the issues that the brand is dealing with.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Howard Tubin with RBC Capital Markets.","Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just one final question on Tommy Hilfiger in North America. It seems like you've done a great job elevating the brand here through your catalogs and your fashion and the advertising you've done. How do you leverage that? Is there a price point opportunity in Macy's or an opportunity to open more standalone kind of flagship stores in North America?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, I think the way we have leveraged that is, our average unit retails over the last 3 years have moved from below $30 to close to $35 in sportswear. That's a 20% increase over a relatively short period of time. That's been key. I think clearly, the demand that's being created, the kind of comp store growth that we've seen of double-digit growth since the acquisition in North America clearly is a big piece of that. So -- and the kind of margins today that we're reporting in North America that are 14% operating margins in North America, I think that is, to me, the best evidence that these marketing investments have paid huge dividends. I think the key -- what's terrific about that is the 14% operating margins or the almost 14% overall Tommy Hilfiger operating margin of about 13.6% overall, those operating margins include the significant investment in advertising that we've made, so the thing that we've been able to do is grow the business, expand the profitability and invest and grow the advertising and marketing commitment for the brand. I think being able to accomplish those 3 things has been key and allow us to continue to grow the business at both wholesale and retail in North America.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Marotta with CL King & Associates.","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Very quickly, most of my questions have been asked and answered. Of the $0.40 delta in EPS from the Warnaco acquisition, specifically cited those 6 investment areas, can you talk about, is any one disproportionate with the other?","Emanuel Chirico","I think...","Steven Louis Marotta - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In other words, is eliminating surplus inventory a bigger drag than any of the others?","Emanuel Chirico","I think the -- well, I guess I would say is the amount -- the biggest surprise was the amount of open positions in the business. The hiring freezes that were put in place over the last 12 months that we lifted immediately really put pressure on the business. And that was a big surprise to us, seeing as many open positions in Asia, Europe and North America as we did. That was the biggest surprise and having to deal with the fact that year-over-year, having to put those bodies, those positions back into the cost structure and the pressure that puts initially on the business, it's just the right thing to do, but having those open for so long a period of time has really put pressure on the business.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Can you talk little bit about the stepping stones that we should be watching over the next few quarters as you make your way through the balance of the year? And then, Manny, as you think about 2014 and beyond, the 15%-plus earnings growth that could be achieved, how do you think about the base business versus Warnaco? Where do we see it?","Emanuel Chirico","Dana, I think -- let me take the last part first. I think it's going to become more and more difficult if we do our job right to really tell the difference between the base business and the Warnaco business. If we integrate this the way it's supposed to happen, the 2 businesses are going to come together, and you should be able to really view what I would say the Calvin business through the lens much more clearly going forward to really look at a business that has been a licensed business, which comes with it significantly lower revenues but outsize the operating margins, and it's not comparative to any other brand in the industry because of that fundamental model. By changing here, I think not only can you compare it to the Tommy Hilfiger business and how it performs, but you could also really compare it to other brands as you all seem fit. It will be a much clearer picture to look at the operating margins and have licensing as a key component, but not the sole driver of the business. I think what you're going to see as you go forward, you're going to see us consistently growing our top line as we take businesses -- as we take these businesses in and our operating margins really moving more towards the Tommy operating margins over a period of time. And that will be key to watch as we go forward with that, with the nuances between the 2 brands geographically. I think the key issues for me, I think you'll hear us talk about it and we will be clear to talk about it is, where the profit drivers in this acquisition will really come out of Europe and Asia principally, we have very solid businesses and we don't see anything changing in Latin America. The North America business, I think, will get enhanced, but it's already a big business and profitable. The underperformance in Europe, clearly starting to see that business start to turn around, will be an indicator of how this whole process is moving. And Asia, maintaining its operating profitability while at the same time initially slowing the growth a little bit, but then really kicking in the growth as we go forward. I think those will be the key drivers for the business. The base business, I think, I don't see any reason the next -- look, 3 -- 36 months, we continue to see the Tommy Hilfiger growing top line mid- to high single digits. If we grow the business mid- to high single digits, we can grow the earnings 15% to 20% there. That's a healthy business. We think the European business continues to have opportunity to grow its operating margin expansion as we've layered on some of these new businesses, tailored and some of the others and some of the startup costs get behind us as we go forward. Those businesses will kick in more efficiently, so I think the Tommy business is very healthy. And I think we need to watch the Heritage businesses. We're going to look at that whole portfolio. It's going to represent 25% of our sales and 15% of our profits. So it's a small component, but we will continue to look at that business and make decisions about running that business from a cash flow operating point of view and look for opportunities to enhance that overall model.","Operator","It appears there are no more questions at this time.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. Perfect timing. Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody's time for the call today, and we look forward to speaking to you in late May or early June with the first quarter press release.

Please go ahead, gentlemen","Manny Chirico","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Joining me on the call as Kelly says Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations and Ken Duane, who runs our wholesale businesses in North America. ","I will start by saying, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter which we updated due to the Warnaco acquisition three times during the third quarter. We beat the top end of our guidance by $0.04, and given the momentum in the business, we also increased our full year 2012 earnings guidance to $6.37 to $6.38 a share. ","Let me get into the businesses. I will start with the Tommy Hilfiger business, which continued its strong performance during the quarter. We posted a 1% revenue increase and a 16% increase in operating income. When you take out the foreign currency headwinds, our operating performance was even stronger. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up about 6% and operating income for the quarter was up over 25%. ","Moving to the international businesses of Tommy; internationally revenues were up 4% in local currencies, our retail comps in Europe posted a 14% increase, while European wholesale sales were flat for the quarter. Geographically in Europe we continue to see strong growth in Central and Northern Europe with particular strength in France, Germany and Turkey, partially offset by softness in Southern Europe in the markets of Spain and Italy. ","Our business in Japan continues to struggle with negative comps and operating income declined, as we reposition the brand to a more premium position. We expect these trends in Japan to continue into the fourth quarter and to the first half of next year, as this market is being repositioned upwards from premium position because it\u2019s the gateway to Asia. ","Moving to North America, we posted an 8% revenue increase for the quarter, driven by a 9% comp store increase in our retail business and mid-single digit growth in our wholesale businesses. We continue to see momentum in the North American business and strongly believe that the significant investments we are making in product, in our stores, in our shop presentations and in our marketing programs are paying dividends for us. ","We have seen average unit retails increase about 10% over the last 12 months at both wholesale and retail. Most importantly in North America for the nine months of 2012, we have seen sales increase 10% and operating income grow by over 50%, which we believe quantifiably demonstrates that these investments we are making are paying off.","Moving to our Calvin Klein business; we continue to exceed our financial guidance here and post strong results. Total revenues in the third quarter for the combined Calvin Klein businesses were up 6%, while operating income was up 7% despite overall softness in the global jeans and women\u2019s underwear business. These increases that we have experienced were driven by our Calvin Klein North America retail and wholesale businesses, which posted 13% revenue increase. ","The Calvin Klein brand posted revenue increases in all geographic regions with the exception of Europe. Specifically by region, North American sales were up 3% with all product categories posting strong results with the exception of jeans and women\u2019s underwear which were down double-digits. Asia sales were up 13% driven by double-digit growth in China, Honk Kong and India partially offset by weak sales in Korea. ","Latin America and South America sales were up about 10%, driven by Brazil and Mexico. Europe, we see the continuation of sloth business for Calvin Klein, with business down about 8% related to the poor performance of the Warnaco\u2019s power and underwear business.","In our licensing segment, royalty revenues were flat on a constant currency basis. This increased was driven by strong performance globally in women sportswear, dresses, footwear and handbags, who always post to double digit increases. This positive performance was negatively impacted by 8% decline in Warnaco\u2019s global Calvin Klein sales.","Let me put some color on each of the businesses; I will start with jeans and underwear. As I mentioned the overall business was down about 8% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter. The reduction was due to continue weak performance in North America and Europe jeans and women\u2019s underwear business. Strong sales in Asia and South America were more than offset by the poor performance in North America and Europe. ","Moving to fragrance; our fragrance businesses continue its strong performance with our royalties up about 4% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. We continue to see strong performance from our Euphoria, CK1 and Beauty franchises. We are very well positions in this category for the holiday selling season, as Korea has made a major global marketing campaign investment centered around our largest fragrance Euphoria which should help to maintain the momentum in this business in the all important holiday selling season.","Our women\u2019s business in Calvin Klein in North America both women\u2019s apparel and footwear businesses were very strong in the quarter. Our royalty revenues with our licensees G3 and Jilmara for women\u2019s were up about 10% for the quarter. ","On the apparel side, this growth is being fueled by strong selling of women\u2019s sportswear, women\u2019s performance, dresses and suits. In addition, our handbag and accessory business continues its strong performance. G3 has seen excellent sell through at all department store accounts. We are targeting double-digit growth for this product category in 2012. ","Our CK Bridge business in Asia continues to grow dramatically posting a 7% increase in revenues for the quarter. We expect this business to grow mid-teens for the year. The growth is being driven by the China, Hong Kong and India markets where we are experiencing significant door expansion and comp store sales growth. ","For 2012 as we previously discussed our CK royalty revenues are being planned flat for the second half of the year due to the uncertainty in Europe and weakness that we see in our North American and European jeans business. ","In order to take the financial risk out of our guidance, we are currently projecting all of the European jeans and apparel businesses that Warnaco operates at contractual guaranteed minimums of fiscal 2012. As such our Calvin Klein European royalties are being planned down about 10% for the year. Overall, we are planning total royalty revenues on a constant currency basis to grow about 2% for the year. ","Moving to our Heritage business, excluding the impact of the exited businesses, ongoing revenues for the Heritage businesses increased 3% in the quarter. Comp store sales in the quarter in the Heritage business were up or flat while our ongoing wholesale businesses posted a 4% sales increase due principally to strong royalty in the IZOD and Van Heusen sportswear businesses. ","Operating income increased 4% to $47 million driven by strong performance in our wholesale dress and sportswear businesses partially offset by continued weakness in our retail businesses particularly the Bass business. ","Clearly, our Heritage business is in the midst of a major turnaround. We are very confident and feel we are very well positioned in this business. Our fall order book is on plan, inventory levels are in line with our retail sales plan, AURs are currently up about 5%, product costs are decreasing between 5% to 7% and our in-store presentations are being enhanced and expanded with key customers. ","The IZOD J. C. Penney store openings are performing and doing very well for the last [12] months, all of this gives us a high degree of confidence that we will see a dramatic improvement in the business beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. ","Let me talk a little bit about fourth quarter trends that we are seeing in the business. I will start with our international Tommy business. At Tommy retail in Europe, our comps continue to post low-teen comp store increases against about 5% to 6% comp store plan. Tommy wholesale which represents about 70% of our business continued a strong momentum. We are seeing no indication of slowdown or cancellations with any of our European customers and feel very good about our European sell through season to-date. The fall season is off to a strong start; given our strong European sales trends we are continuing to grow our market share in all key countries. ","Looking at the spring 2013, our order book is complete and would indicate a wholesale sales increase for the first half of 2013 of between 4% to 5%. In the US wholesale businesses both Calvin Klein and the Tommy Hilfiger business continued to perform well ahead of plan. We continue to see increases on our out the door retails, our margins at retail are very strong and we feel very confident about how this business is moving forward. ","As I mentioned, we are seeing strong business in the Heritage portion of our wholesale business as well. We have very strong sell through to November and we experience AUR increases particularly in our sportswear businesses.","Moving to our North American retail businesses, November comps which were impacted by the Hurricane Sandy, our comps for Calvin Klein were relatively flat for November. The Tommy Hilfiger business posted a 4% increase in comps and our Heritage businesses are running down low single-digits. ","Business in the first half of November was significantly impacted by the storm which we estimate impacted November comps by between 250 basis points to 300 basis points for the month of November.","We continue to feel confident about this business and for the second half of November we have seen our retail business come back on plan and get back on the trends that we saw in the third quarter. As we look out into the fourth quarter, the holiday season is off to a good start. ","We are highly confident that we will deliver our fourth quarter plan which projects ongoing revenues to grow 7% on a constant currency basis and earnings per share increase over 25% to about a $1.49 per share this year. So we feel good about we are well positioned and with that I am going to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of these results.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks Manny. The comments I am going to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our earnings release. We are very happy with third quarter results. For the third quarter, we exceeded our revenue guidance and delivered earnings per share of $2.34 which was $0.04 above the top end of our guidance and 24% greater than the prior year. $0.03 of the $0.04 EPS increase over our previous guidance was due to favorable timing of certain discreet tax items that were planned in the fourth quarter.","Our total revenues exclude currency translation and discontinued businesses were up 4% to the prior year. Our Tommy Hilfiger revenues which were ahead of guidance were strong in both Europe and North America. On the cost currency basis Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 6%. Our Calvin Klein revenues for the quarter were plus 6% to last year and also better than guidance.","Overall, third quarter operating margins increased 150 basis points over the prior year driven by 260 basis point increase in gross margin. ","Moving our guidance for 2012, we have raised our full year EPS guidance to range of $6.37 to $6.38 or an increase of 18% to 19% over the prior year. We raise the top end of our full year earnings per share guidance for $0.04 third quarter a bit, less the $0.03 that was attributable to the timing of taxes between the third quarter and fourth quarter. ","Revenue for the year is planned to be up 6% excluding the impact of foreign exchange in our discontinued businesses. Total Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to be at 8% on the cost currency basis with both Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International increasing about 8% on a cost currency basis.","Calvin Klein revenues are planned to increase 7%, well our ongoing Heritage businesses are planning revenues up 1% excluding the impact of Timberland and IZOD women business. ","Gross margins for the year are planned up about a 170 basis points with expenses for the year planned up a 100 basis points due in large part to an increase in pension expense. ","Impacting our gross margin and expense in 2012 is our mix of business as a result of faster growth and our higher gross margin and higher expense on the Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses. Operating margins for 2012 are planned to increase by about 70 basis points over 2011. Interest expenses is planned at about $115 million, reflecting reductions to the prior year as a result of debt repayments. Our tax rate for the year climbed to 23.5% and reflects the continued benefit of additional foreign earnings which attest to the lower rate than domestic earnings. ","For the fourth quarter of 2012, earnings per shares is planned at $1.48 and $1.49 or an increase of about 25% to 26% over the prior year. We are planning our revenues to increase 7% to 8% over the prior year excluding the impact of foreign exchange in (inaudible) businesses. ","Our gross margins for the fourth quarter will be up about 300 basis points, with all businesses planned to show gross margin improvements due to higher average unit retail selling prices combined with four product costs decreases of about 5% to 7%. Overall operating margins for the fourth quarter are planned up about 200 basis points, influenced by a mix of business and gross margin improvement. ","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter is planned to 22% and we are continuing to project term loan repayments for the full year of 2012 of about 300 million, which would bring our term loan repayments since the date of the Tommy acquisition to about $1 billion. And with that we will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will go first to David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Manny I was wondering if you can give us a little more color on the performance of the jeans and underwear business both domestically and internationally; and whether your view on that has changed since you announced the acquisition. And how you look at the business progressing next year? Is it kind of a repositioning year and when we can start to really see the benefits of your involvement in that business? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","On the jeans business I think Warnaco has been very transparent about the challenges in that business particularly in Europe and some of the difficulties that they have worked through in North America; and I think a number of the initiatives that they have put in place really will start to benefit next year, particularly second half of the year. Focus really on product enhancements of the regional design, the centralized design focus that they are bringing to bear. It seems to be well received in market from our diligence and sitting with a number of the retail accounts talking about business, I think they are being planned up in some of the major retailers for spring and we think that momentum should only accelerate as we go into fall here in North America. ","So very positive about I think how this business will start to progress beginning in 2013, and really into 2014 next year. So really no change from how we viewed it here in North America. Also similar to what Warnaco; so I think Europe will be a slower turnaround. I think there the whole business needs to be repositioned. They were in the process of doing that, we will do that again as we integrate them on to our European platform under the Tommy Hilfiger leadership management team. ","Fred Gehring will really take over full responsibility for that. And that will go through a transition and that will be a transition year, where we will probably see sales go down slightly further in 2013 as we repositioned the brand for profitability and for profitable growth, really positioning it well for 2014. ","I think all of that is being captured in the initial callout we gave about accretion in 2013, assuming that deal would have closed on the first day of fiscal year. As we said we are still very comfortable with the $0.35 accretion that we talked about a month ago. So really no change except may be some validation of what we saw in diligence as we\u2019ve gotten more involved. Just a continuation of that, though we really see great opportunity in the jeans business both domestically and internationally.","","David Glick - Buckingham Research","On the Bridge business in Calvin Klein, you commented on the strength in Asia, does the integration of the Warnaco business change your thinking on when your management team can launch that business in Europe?","Manny Chirico","I think that\u2019s all under review right now. As you can imagine the plan was to really bring that out 2013, but now with the taking on of the jeans business I think we are really just reevaluating that whole timing, and if that make sense it is better to make a grand launch together repositioning of the brand. We will make that decision in the next 30 to 45 days. So the team is really working on that looking at it and we will see how that comes together.","","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Okay, last question on Cramer last night you were pretty positive about the North American consumer. Just wonder if you can give us some perspective on kind of what you\u2019ve seen in this holiday season so far and obviously a lot of disruptions, distractions, what gives you the confidence that it\u2019s going to continue to be a strong holiday season?","Manny Chirico","I guess the best confidence we have is the last two weeks of business both the wholesale and retail. Coming to everything sitting here and talk about the fiscal cliff and we can talk about of the economic issues, but really and particularly at wholesale, we have just seen a lot of momentum in our big sportswear businesses, our sales through on AUR and how that works on the ground. (inaudible) that really should benefit allowances at the end of the year. We are really looking for a dramatic improvement; all brands are very positive, and as I said the AUR is up pretty dramatically.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","And on the seasonal businesses you are saying some benefit relative to last year where it was a challenge?","Manny Chirico","When you say seasonal you are talking cold weather for all. ","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Cold weather, yes.","Manny Chirico","We have a small outwear business relative to our size that we are, and we have only have the big sweater business, and the sweater business has been good, but I wouldn\u2019t say great yet, and what we are really seeing is the basic sportswear businesses that the brands really represent driving it across the board. So it\u2019s so much noise in holiday season with the extra weekend at the end with the two extra days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, I think personally if you are (inaudible) I think its going to come, I think its going to come later, I think its just the nature of how the calendar is laying out and I am sure, we are going to have a lull in the beginning of December, where everybody is going to panic for a moment. But I just feel like that is it will come back strong as we go into the last two weeks before the holiday.","Operator","We will go next to Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Credit Suisse","","Yeah, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the marked down dollar benefit that you got year-over-year and how you are thinking about that as it plays out for the balance of the year?","Manny Chirico","I guess we are getting a marked down benefit particularly on the Heritage side. I think last year well that hit us by far the hardest was in the fourth quarter. I think the fourth quarter has the ability to really see in Heritage business 400 plus basis points improvement in gross margin, probably 400 basis points to 500 basis points improvement in gross margin driven a little bit by somewhat by cost declines but significantly be driven by out the door retail increases that we are really starting to experience as we go into December. ","Christian Buss - Credit Suisse","That's helpful. And could you talk a bit about what you are seeing as you start to place your buys for spring 2013 from the sourcing environment?","Manny Chirico","Yeah, I think it\u2019s consistent to what we said about three months ago. We are looking for costs down about 4% to 6% for spring 2013 and that's been both put to bed and is done.","Operator","We will hear now from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","I wanted to ask you, you mentioned that the efforts in Japan for Tommy to kind of reposition in a more upscale premium positioning, obviously, the brand\u2019s had a lot of success with those efforts in Europe. It seems like it\u2019s also still happening in North America. Can you talk about on the Calvin Klein side with the impending acquisition of Warnaco and a more holistic control over the brand, how do you think about the opportunity to bring that brand up market a little bit and make it more of a premium brand globally?","Manny Chirico","Well, look outside of North America, the brand is in premium position. In Asia, our out the door retails and sportswear is over a $100. So we are positioned probably just slightly higher than Tommy is positioned in our sportswear businesses throughout Asia and South America. So I think that the positioning of Calvin Klein brand is terrific there. The Calvin Klein brand is actually growing in Japan. It\u2019s not as bigger business as we like but it continues to grow in Japan. It\u2019s a challenged market. So we don't have a repositioning from a brand point of view to do it all with Calvin Klein in Asia or Latin America. The real repositioning happened from both a process operations point of view as well as the brand really in apparel taking its rightful place in Europe. So that's only I just disagree with the premise of the question, the brand is growing strongly in Asia, up double-digits, its premium positioned, I wouldn't want to take it any higher, I'm not looking to, we don't view Calvin as a luxury brand, we view it as a premium status brand and I think that position works really well for us. ","Omar Saad - ISI Group","And in terms of how are you looking at, I know you are going to kind of probably do some things to manage it more of a profitability maybe slow some of the square footage growth, investments that need to be made in that business, you know I know its all kind of embedded in the outlook that you provided but is this a multi-year kind of investment process, accelerated investment process and scaling back on the square footage growth for Calvin Klein?","Manny Chirico","I think to be determined, we are very comfortable with the guidance we gave that talked about the accretion growing from $0.35 to $1 a share beyond that the opportunities to do things that are outside the plan and accelerate the growth beyond that plan that\u2019s really what we need. We don\u2019t own the business yet directly we are working very closely with want to go about planning the integration particularly at back office and looking at things with strategic point of view, but it\u2019s just too early to comment. We only announce the deal a month ago. So I think it\u2019s too early to really comment exactly what kind of growth we see year-by-year but give us the time as we get into the first quarter of 2013, we will put some more flesh on that.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Then any quick comments on the accessories opportunity across your brand, it\u2019s obviously bit of big theme in the marketplace?","Manny Chirico","Yeah, I would start by saying both Tommy and Calvin are global designer lifestyle brands. They are not accessory brands by their nature. They both have the ability to have a significant accessory component. Calvin Klein is significantly more developed today than the Tommy business has developed, and we are seeing strong growth in basically Asia, we have seen strong growth in North America with the accessory business we think it\u2019s a significant opportunity in Europe given the design esthetic of Calvin Klein and given the design capability we have in the Calvin Klein design studio which we have relatively been fully utilizing but now we have control of the brand particularly in Europe we think it\u2019s a real opportunity for us to grow that accessory business both in Asia and Europe pretty dramatically. So it will be a key component in North America. ","We are looking at free standing Calvin Klein accessories stores both have the first (inaudible) that we have opened have been real success stories for us. So we think what\u2019s great about the accessory business is one, it\u2019s very profitable and two just by the nature of the product to presentation, where Calvin Klein sits it\u2019s significantly enhancing.","So the opening of stores and regular price moles and street locations that they really can be profitable, at the same time I think just lifts the level of the brand and it really coordinates with all of our marketing efforts. So a scenario of growth, I think you will see us really going after 2013 and beyond.","Operator","We will go now to Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hey, it\u2019s (inaudible) for Evren. I was just hoping if you guys could please sort of elaborate on the Tommy Hilfiger comps in both Europe and North America during Q3, what's specifically driving these games in each of the regions, I know you mentioned AUR increases but is it a mix shift or price increases AURs and then may be traffic and conversion?","Manny Chirico","Okay, so in the third quarter Tommy was up, I think 9%, it was not (inaudible) but it was everything. We saw higher AURs, we saw better conversion and traffic was up low single-digits for the third quarter. I think the key area of benefit that I think we are getting first and foremost is product, the product has been enhanced, its been invested in and the consumers are willing to pay for that product, actual price, full price and first price for us in our retail stores. So we are seeing it across the board. ","In Europe I think there's two things going on, just the strength of the brand continues. We continue to be better retailers globally and continue to just maximize that business. We are significantly under penetrated as a brand in the outlet venue throughout Europe; we are just starting to open some of those stores and working with the brand management. We are not going to overdo it, but we have such a low penetration in that market that as we go into it, given the brand\u2019s strength, we will really perform exceedingly well and that's part of the benefit as well. ","But we are seeing strong sales increases in our regular price stores and in our outlet stores throughout Europe. So it\u2019s a combination of all those things and geographically in Europe I would just say I mentioned it in total, but our retail stores tend to be much more central more than European focused. We don't have that many stores in Italy and almost no stores in Spain. So I think over time as those economies come back, those are markets that we believe have a retail opportunity but right now given the uncertainty there its not an area where we want to invest and not having that exposure I think really shields us from some of the more difficult retail markets throughout Europe. So I think we are benefiting from that as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's helpful and then maybe kind of in conjunction with that how are you approaching the marketing for the holiday season, is it stepped up year-over-year and what sort of differences are you seeing.","Manny Chirico","I think that the strategy is more or less the same. We continue to really invest behind the (inaudible) Hilfiger\u2019s campaign at all levels, and I think that investment has clearly paid off. We are spending a larger and larger percentage of our marketing dollars digitally and going to that venue; trying to focus both for Calvin and Tommy on the under consumer and bringing that consumer into the ranks. ","I think its really helped the whole on-the-channel strategy both North America and Europe, a combination of all bricks and mortars, our wholesale distribution, our own internet that we sell on and then selling through some of our key retailers where we've seen dramatic growth at Macy\u2019s and some of our key retailers here with Calvin and Tommy brand online has really just enhanced the performance of the brands overall. ","So as we've owned the brand, as we've really focused on both Calvin and Tommy, its become much more of a holistic marketing approach and really trying to connect with the consumer in the hot zone when they are making the retail decisions either in store or online.","Unidentified Analyst ","And one more question kind of bringing it back to North America, looking at Black Friday weekend, you mentioned the wholesale was very strong but how about the environment in your own retail stores, can you talk to traffic trends, how are the promos year-over-year or are things more aggressive in this channel.","Manny Chirico","The two week period second half of November was right on plan. I would say the outlet in volume for the three day period of the weekend when traffic was down compared to prior years. I think the noise the big box retail as we are doing from an advertising positioning point of view, the noise that was also going on even at the regular mall where there was much more earlier openings we've kind of owned that. The outlet environment three years ago, kind of owned that timeframe from 9 o'clock on thanksgiving night to 5 o'clock in the morning. We were almost the only game in town and it really just started to till we really benefited from that. ","Competition during that period of time was not as much more intense Wal-Mart opened at 9\u20190 Clock and (inaudible) was opened early, everyone really was - Macy\u2019s opened much earlier. So every retailer was much opened by midnight that we were competing with everyone. So we saw traffic down the three day period, but we also saw retail comps with only two days where it really bounced back just strongly Monday and Tuesday of this week back on trend. ","So I think with the moment in time a lot of noise, lot of advertising going on, people looking for electronics and other things and not necessary an outlet venue. So I think that\u2019s what happened on Black Friday.","","Operator","We will go now to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Manny I was hoping you could just may be elaborate a little bit more on Japan. Do you think about that market and could you pass out may be how much of that negative comp is high just to general consumer (inaudible) in that market overall versus the change of these nature reposition of the Tommy brand. And then with respect to the repositioning how are you communicating those changes to the consumer in that market?","","Manny Chirico","I think to be totally transparent, it\u2019s very hard to quantify that. I think that Japan is clearly not a growth market, but by the same token I don\u2019t think on a relative basis that retail is under dramatically underperforming there. So I think we have to recognize the vast majority of the downturn that we are seeing there is self inflicted from a brand positioning point of view and what we are doing. ","So I think from that point of view we have clearly tried to step off marketing in the Japanese market, we have opened two flagship stores to really make a statement about the brand and try to really don't speak to the brand and lift it up, and we really invested behind the products. So it is a dramatic change that the consumer\u2019s seen over 12 months period, its going take some time for them to accept it and understand it. I think its going to be a slow grind which will continue. ","The good news is that it\u2019s really at a low point that will be able to balance (inaudible), but still getting where we really want it to be this is a three, four year process of repositioning a brand similar to what's been done here in North America over the last six years and we are really seeing the fruits of that the last few years. I think Japan will be a similar situation, but it really needs to be done Tokyo as the fashion capital of Asia, and you can't be misaligned as a brand in Japan and then really want to be big in China, India, and Korea, where we are experiencing double digit growth across the broad. ","So I think its really important from the brand positioning to be appropriately positioned there, and we are making those investments and fortunately that will absorb the hit that we are taking because of the strong performance here in North America and Europe.","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Okay, that's helpful. And just a quick clarification on some of the comments you made earlier on southern Europe and particular still obviously on the performing of the northern European side, are you seeing any wasting of trend there just as we anniversaried a very significant year in southern Europe as very tough trends?","Manny Chirico","Yeah, its down less but its still down. I guess, that's the best way I can describe it. I think it\u2019s bottoming out, its finding its bottom. I think all of those things, but its still there, its still a market that\u2019s very challenged, those two markets.","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","And as you think about the holiday season in Europe, can you maybe just speak to how you are thinking about the overall promotional environment, anything you\u2019ve changed and how your are looking at the brands in Europe for the holiday?","Manny Chirico","I think as what we've done exceedingly well is manage inventories. So, we are not in a situation and given the strong sell throughs both the wholesale and the comps that we posted throughout the year, we are in a very good inventory position. So I'm not sure what the promotional environment would be overall, it seems to be pretty much the level where it was last year and its different market-by-market but in general, we don't have a big inventory issue that we need to move goods or what else. So, sales trends continue as they are. We just continue to see gross margin improvements as we go forward. So, this is not an environment where we are trying to be a hero, we've kind of said that pretty consistently, we've really bought to the order book and not gone after every last drop of sales. We've really tried to call out some of the bottom level of some of our retail accounts that we've already bought from the credit point of view. So, we've really tried to prune it and be meticulous about how we manage the business and in this environment the uncertainty in Europe causes us to be more risk averse as opposed to be where we were say in 2010 where given the strength and the momentum of the business we were willing to make investments behind inventory that really capture market share. This doesn't seem to be the environment that you want to do that.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will go next to Diana Katz with Lazard Capital Markets.","Diana Katz - Lazard Capital Markets","I understand you are not providing guidance today for next year but more on conceptual basis, can you talk about there's anything new within the trajectory of the Tommy business outside of taking in tailored business that we should consider for next year?","Manny Chirico","No not that I can think of, on the Tommy business I think its more of the same, Europe will grow but it will be more conservative. We\u2019ve talked about 4% to 5% kind of top line growth including the tailored business and we've and I guess that's basically that's all I have to say.","Diana Katz - Lazard Capital Markets","And then as Tommy\u2019s business is really benefiting from the growth in [property] trend is there anything you might be changing about this that is for Calvin Klein to capitalize in some of these trends?","Mike Shaffer","No, I think you have to stay true to your brand. 18 months ago when modern and contemporary was more in line we didn't change Tommy to be from red light and blue to black, gray and tan. I think is colors become more important and we try to do color in Calvin appropriate way but again its we will stay true to the brand. In North America and Asia I think Calvin Klein is clearly the leader on the modern and contemporary side in department stores floors and that's a position we need to fill and we can't trend off of that. So in a lot of ways you gain more market share in tougher markets. So in a market like this I think our competitive set is in the modern and contemporary side is really suffering. And we are growing in a traditional property cycle so clearly overall the Calvin Klein business is gaining market share. So that's a positive that we will just take and given our portfolio of brands, a lot of our brands are much more traditional in nature like Tommy, IZOD are really benefiting from the fact that we are in this cycle and we have other brands like Van Heusen and Calvin when modern and contemporaries and dress we find dress up is more in line those brands perform. So I think it\u2019s this balanced approach in staying true to what the brand is.","Diana Katz - Lazard Capital Markets","Okay. And then what\u2019s the plan for the Heritage retail business particularly Bass to kind of turn that around?","","Manny Chirico","","I think its look I would say that\u2019s a long-term strategy. It\u2019s, we have been disappointed with the volatility of the Bass business keep in mind, it\u2019s a $250 million business represents 3% of our sales and may be 1% of our profits. So, we tend to be so transparent we talk about everything. So there is a number of initiatives going on and hopefully we will start to see some improvements, investment and product which the Heritage of our brand what that stands for that management team is working on it very closely.","","Diana Katz - Lazard Capital Markets","Okay. And then finally on the fourth quarter model, it seems gross margins are coming in higher than originally planned for the year, is this purely driven by the Heritage businesses or other areas contributing to out performance? And then similarly SG&A seems to be also becoming in a bit higher, is this primarily its opening larger stores or is there something also with an SG&A?","Manny Chirico","","I think Mike will talk about that.","","Mike Shaffer","Basically, the gross margins are up about 300 basis points and pretty much as we plan them I don\u2019t believe we have had much change. Heritage is driving that business, are driving those margins up that\u2019s the biggest piece, but all our businesses are seeing gains. The cost decreases were a major factor there. On the expense side, the increase in expense is primarily the pension expense and that\u2019s really is and then of course anything to do with the additional revenues and as you pointed out some square footage growth, but closer and our expenses are in line with our plans in line with the first three quarters of the year.","Manny Chirico","Mix of the business, the SG&A is going to grow as a percentage of sales and gross margins will grow also because Calvin and Tommy and Calvin, Tommy retail businesses in particular are growing faster than everything else in the portfolio. So it\u2019s just a natural act, the key issue is to make sure operating margins overall are growing at the same time.","Operator","We will go next to Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank.","Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank","So I was looking for a little bit of color on the sourcing environment as return the corner into next year. I think in the past you have called out kind of as go-forward as we cycle some of the increases from last year, it kind of moderates apparel cost inflation moving forward in 2013, so I know there is a lot of moving parts of that but I was wondering if you can comment on that? And then importantly, whether you think you will be able to continue to offset those with continued AUR increases and whether those will be coming from kind of explicit price increases or more of there some kind of underlying mixed shift in some of your brands that's you know generating that AUR shift? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","","I want to make Ken answer the question on sourcing; I will give just specifics for next year. ","Ken Duane","So obviously, you have seen a change in 4Q as we move through 4Q. We have seen some of those cost increase, cost decreases come through on the sheet. And as you move into spring 2013, it\u2019s a 4% to 6% decrease I think Manny spoke about it, and then in fall 2013 where its generating about a 4% to 6% decrease again for 2013 for fall. It continues on. Then you will see a leveling off as you move to 2014 because you had a full year of it, annualize the full year.","Manny Chirico","You know David once you get out to 2000 and we've got indication now on fall holidays as Ken said, you know down in that 4% to 5%, 6% who knows that where its going to finalize but depending on the mix of the business as well, but its clearly like more of a continuation of what we saw, and we are seeing in spring is what we expect but when you get into 2014, its going to depend on supply and demand, capacity issues at factories. You know specifically I have always said I think which I quoted is I have always said is when that well is off and when the economy bounces back globally and I don't know when that is going to be, there will be coming a point in time again when demand will outstrip capacity and we shall start to see more of a modern, we will start to see a modeling increase in cost of product. I think its natural and significant global pressure going on, on labor rates around the world. There's you know we've gone to so many different countries that ability to just keep shifting production, I think there is opportunities but not as great as its been in the past. So I think we have to start thinking long-term that we are going to start to see cost increases and that will have to be factored into our business models but again that's 2014 or beyond as we look out.","Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank","So I guess, that's helpful so I guess given what you said for 2013, the decreases I guess in terms of the plan for AUR, would you continue to expect to raise that level or maybe that will flatten out as well. I guess it will depend on the brand and geography?","Manny Chirico","Again at this point with an environment of 4% to 5% cost declines, I don't think we would be comfortable raising AURs. In fact, we are taking some of those cost increases and investing in product which may in fact raise the AUR but at the same time may not start to raise the gross margin overall. So I think our gross margins will improve because of mix of business year-over-year but right now at this stage we wouldn\u2019t be planning for AUR overall increases on top of the last 18 months of pretty significant AUR increases.","Operator","And gentlemen at this time I would like to turn the conference back to you for closing remarks.","Manny Chirico","Okay, thank you very much.

I am joined on the call by Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Investor Relations; and Ken Duane who runs all of our North American wholesale businesses.","Overall, given the macro environment we are quite pleased with our third quarter results which exceeded the top end of our earnings guidance by $0.06. The earnings beat was driven by the continued strength of our Tommy Hilfiger business and an improvement in the performance of our Calvin Klein business. I could best describe the macro third quarter business trends in all channels of distribution as very volatile.","The quarter began in August with the strong sales and margin trends. As we moved into September and October, we and the whole industry experienced a significant slowdown in store traffic both in Europe and North America driven by unseasonably warm weather and less promotional activity at our stores in Europe. Towards the end of the third quarter and into November, retail businesses rebounded with an improvement in store traffic driven by colder weather and a heightened level of promotional activity in all markets.","Speaking directly about the Tommy Hilfiger business. On a local currency basis, revenues for the business increased 3% while operating earnings grew by over 9% driven by strong gross margin performance. In North America, we posted 1% comparable store sales increase and our operating income margins expended by 130 basis points. As we moved into the fourth quarter, comp sales trends have basically continued at this level running about flat for the month of November.","In Europe, comp store sales declined 5% in the third quarter driven by the aforementioned slowdown in traffic in September and October due to the unseasonably warm weather and less promotional activity. Despite the slower sales, our European operating margins increased to 100 basis points due to strong overall gross margin performance. As we ended the third quarter, our European business bounced back with an improvement in traffic, driven by colder weather and a higher level of promotions. November comp store sales in Europe are running up low single digits for the fourth quarter.","Our European wholesale business continues to outpace the competition. As an indicator, our spring summer 2015 order book is up over 5% compared to levels in 2014.","Moving to our Calvin Klein business. Revenues for the Calvin Klein business in the quarter on a local currency basis grew 3% driven by a 5% increase in North America, where we saw strong sales both at wholesale and at retail. At retail, our North America stores posted a very strong 5% comp store increase for the quarter, while our international comp store business sales declined 2% due to continued softness in Europe with weakness in Korea offset by strong business in Europe.","Moving into the fourth quarter, Calvin Klein retail trends in November were on plan with North American comps up low single digits and international comps down low single digits.","Let me put a little color on some of our new product deliveries for fall. I am going to start with the Calvin Klein underwear business. From a product point of view, we have delivered new core product along with significantly improved and elevated packaging. The new product features have been significantly enhanced from a quality point of view. We have significantly better fabrics, improved waistbands and enhanced styling. We have also invested in our point-of-sale presentation with new advertising graphics and fixtures throughout North America and Europe.","In addition, we have upgraded and installed new shops in key markets in the U.S. In New York at the Herald Square location and at Lord and Taylor at Fifth Avenue. In Florida at Aventura and in California at Beverly Center in South Coast Plaza. Additionally, we have installed new shops and stores internationally in key markets. In particular, I would call your attention to the Macy's Herald Square store where we have our largest department store shop-in-shop in the world at about 2500 square feet. That shop was installed in the middle of the third quarter of this fiscal year. I think it will be well worth your while to go in and see that presentation and the dramatic representation of the Calvin Klein men's underwear business there and the Calvin Klein intimates business there. We are seeing sales at that location up over 50%.","In the Calvin Klein jeans area, new product has been delivered and we are seeing good reaction from the consumer, particularly where we have installed our new jeans shops. In North America we have installed 180 shops in the third quarter. 115 men's shops and 75 women's shops. Since we have installed these shops, we have experienced a 40% sales increase over last year. Season to date, our AURs are running up between 10% and 15% over the prior year. We are scheduled to open an additional 25 new shops in January and are targeting 150 new jeans shops installations for fiscal 2015.","In Europe, we are in the first inning of our turnaround in jeans. We have installed over 80 new jeans shops throughout Europe. We have significantly improved the quality level of our European jeans line with better fabrics and trims. We have begun to see an improvement in AURs and our spring summer 2015 order book for Calvin Klein is up 10% over 2014 orders.","As we have mentioned before, we believe our Calvin Klein jeans men's product is further ahead relative to our women's product but we believe we are seeing some nice improvements in sales trends for both genders.","Moving on to our Heritage business. Heritage revenues increased 3% in the quarter driven by a 6% increase in wholesale sales offset by a 6% comp store sales decline in our Heritage retail business which continues to perform at weak levels. We have seen strong performance in our Heritage wholesale sportswear business with our IZOD and Van Heusen brands. In particular, our launch at Kohl's with IZOD has been very successful and we are exceeding our initial sales projections. Overall, earnings for our Heritage brand businesses in the quarter was down 15% as our North American moderate brands were most severely impacted by the heightened promotional activity, particularly in our own retail stores. Heritage retail continues to be a major area of underperformance for us.","Finally, I would just like to speak a little bit about our guidance before I turn it over to Mike. We revised our guidance for 2014 to $7.25 to $7.30 per share. The takedown was solely related to an $0.08 impact relating to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies. We believe we are well positioned to successfully navigate through the expected volatile and highly competitive environment in the fourth quarter holiday selling season. As a reminder, in the second half of December and through all January, our sales comparisons, particularly in North America, become much easier relative to last year.","And with that I would like to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of those results.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I am about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.","Revenues for the third quarter were $2.23 billion, a 2% increase over the prior year when excluding the Bass business which we sold to G-III last year. The impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar was felt across all of our non-U.S. businesses. Excluding this FX impact, our revenues were up 3%. On a constant currency basis, our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses were each up 3% and our Heritage revenues were also up 3% excluding Bass.","Our earnings-per-share for the third quarter was $2.56, a $0.06 beat to the top end of our previous guidance and an 11% improvement over the last year. The beat was primarily driven by better performance in Calvin Klein due in part to an earlier than planned shipment of holiday product and a shift of marketing expense into the fourth quarter. Also impacting the quarter was a favorable tax rate as a result of timing but this was offset by the impact of the strengthening dollar and continued underperformance in our North American Heritage business, which fell short on gross margin due to heavy promotional environment.","For the fourth quarter, we are projecting earnings-per-share of $1.71 to $1.76, or an increase of 20% to 23% over the prior year. Earnings-per-share and revenues for the quarter will be negatively impacted by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Revenues for the quarter are projected to be about $2.1 billion or an increase of 3%. On a constant currency basis, projected revenues for the quarter are approximately 6% greater than the prior year. Our earnings-per-share for the full year 2014 is now planned at $7.25 to $7.30. We have both revised our guidance down as a result of the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar and corresponding FX impact which negatively impacted our earnings by approximately $0.08.","Our revenues for the full year 2014 are projected at $8.3 billion or a 3% increase over the prior year excluding Bass. Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein our planned to have revenue increases of 5% and 2% respectively. Our Heritage revenues are planned to be flat to the prior year excluding Bass. A downward revision to revenue guidance reflects the negative impact of FX primarily due to a weaker euro on our Tommy and Calvin Klein businesses, as well as the impact of weaker fourth quarter sales in our Heritage division.","Our full-year operating margins continue to be planned on 60 basis points versus the prior year. The 60 basis point decrease reflects an increase in gross margin that will be more than offset by an increase in SG&A expense due in large part to the increased Calvin Klein investments. We have not reduced our Calvin Klein investment spending from our initial budget and will continue to make all the necessary investments to grow Calvin Klein for the future. For the full year we are projecting our Tommy Hilfiger operating margins to increase 20 to 30 basis points. Our Heritage brands operating margins will decrease 60 to 70 basis points and our Calvin Klein operating margins are planned to decrease 170 to 180 basis points. Finally, we continue to pay debt -- we continue to plan debt pay down at $400 million for the year.","With that, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will first go to Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul","I guess the first question I have, Manny, on the Calvin Klein jeans AUR increases. Was that for both men's and women's?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes. We are seeing a significant improvement beginning in September on all AURs between both genders. And it's really being driven first and foremost by significant increase in our opening price. Denim, the basic denim jean product in both genders where we have moved the opening price point from $49.50 to $69.50, we have been able to put a better product on the floor. Better piece goods on the floor that the consumer could really touch and feel and we seem to be -- and we are getting paid for that as we go forward. And we think that's a much more appropriate price point for the Calvin Klein brand to open up with on the denim floor.","Bob Drbul","Okay. I have a question on currency and gross margin. As you look for the rest of this year but also into next year, can the gross margins be positive next year with the euro being at $1.24? How should we think about it given the transactional nature?","Emanuel Chirico","On the transactional side, I think for the first half of the year, margins specifically, since we hedge out currency we are probably -- we are secure against for that piece of the fiscal year as we go forward. The exposure would be on lower translation rates for the second half of the year as we go forward. From a transaction point of view that could impact gross margin. On a translation basis, top line and then just translating the bottom line, obviously we are exposed to the full year as we don\u2019t hedge translation. So that\u2019s going to be a headwind for 2015 as we go forward.","Bob Drbul","Okay. And then just one last question, Manny. So you guys I think are one of the first to talk post-Black Friday and post last week. Can you just talk about the surprises or the trends both on your wholesale business but also on your retail and sort of how you are sitting with the inventories at this point in time?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I guess I would say, here is how I would describe November. Business bounced back in November coming off of particularly soft October. Unseasonably warm weather both here in North America and in Europe. The third quarter, as we finished off, was particularly weak. As weather got cooler, business did bounce back. Also promotions clearly got pulled forward as the Black Friday frenzy really expanded at a minimum one weak and in some cases with some key retailers really went all the way through the whole month of November. So the selling was strong at the beginning of November through mid-November and then as we got into Black Friday, look, you have heard all the reports. Business softened. We got some excitement on Thanksgiving, the Black Friday and then the weekend was soft, relatively speaking.","So I really think it's important that we look at November in its totality. And November on its totality, the best that I see, my visibility outside of our company and looking at some of our key customers, is they are running on plan. Started stronger, Black Friday week was okay but not great and then that weekend softened. And now it's really about how the process moves as we go forward. Our inventory position coming into the third quarter, back to school was very clean and I think you clearly saw the benefits of that in the third quarter on the gross margin line in all of our business. In particular the Tommy Hilfiger business and the Calvin Klein business, where we really saw expanded gross margins and we didn\u2019t jump into the promotional frenzy that began in October. We just didn\u2019t participate in a full way there. But given the competitive pressures right now, we need to meet the competition as we go forward. So where I see risk, is really on the gross profit line just driven by the promotional level.","Now last year, December and January were very promotional as well. So I think as we have gotten through November, that\u2019s been the toughest comparison both from a margin and a sales point of view and I feel good how we have come through that. But I think now coming ahead of us, particularly beginning December 14 or so, we are up against some windstorms, we are up against some really tough business for a while. So I think those comparisons get easier and I am expecting and anticipating an acceleration of comp sales going into the back half of the fourth quarter.","Operator","And next we will go to David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David Glick","Two questions. One for Manny. Could you size up kind of where you are on the Calvin Klein jeans business in global revenues and where you are in terms of getting past some of the decreases in distribution to the off price channel and the club channel? And just how to think about the revenue and profitability of that business and what kind of improvement you can expect going forward? And then secondly for Mike, the implied SG&A growth in Q4, certainly greater than Q3. You have anniversaried a lot of the Calvin Klein investments. I am just wondering if you can walk us through what's driving the SG&A increase in the fourth quarter.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. Let me just deal with the jeans. Michael will deal with the SG&A question, I will focus on jeans. On the jeans side, I guess I would describe it this way. The cleanup of the distribution in Europe, Asia and North America will be completely behind us in 2014. So the benefits that we will start to see is we won't be up against a lot of that clean up and elimination of that off price sales as we have gone forward. As we have talked about, the jeans business round numbers worldwide is about $1 billion in sales, the wholesale retail category.","The challenge for us is the weakness in the business. And where the margins are significantly underperforming is first and foremost Europe where the business on an operating margin basis is actually losing money. Overall the European Calvin Klein business is at best a breakeven business with underwear being profitable and $250 million of jeans and related apparel being sold into the market at operating margins that are negative. So the opportunity there over time is to take that business, grow it substantially and to get it -- our first goal would be over the next four years to get it to about 10% operating margin.","In North America, it's a profitable business but it's below our benchmark levels for Calvin Klein. I describe it as a mid-single digit operating margin overall. Men's being more profitable than women's. And I think the opportunity clearly there is to, as we increase our presence on the retail floor, as AURs continue to improve and we get the benefits of less vendor markdown support for our retail partners, the opportunity is to bring that to where our men's sports operating margin are which is in excess of 10%. So I think those are the opportunities ahead of us. We are on a level playing field today that we are not dealing with the headwinds that we had in front of us from a distribution point of view and cleanup of off price. And now it's improve the business, it's blocking and tackling, continuing to install new shops as we go forward. And I think the onus is on us to really see that performance start to improve 2015 and beyond.","On the SG&A question, I guess I will turn it over to Mike.","Mike Shaffer","Yes. David, when we look at the fourth quarter, we are thinking about SG&A as a percent of sales being fairly flat to the prior year. The dollar growth there is just normal dollar growth. It's 2% to 3%. And then it's also got a slight impact because we did shift some marketing out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter. So it is pretty flat on a percent of sales basis.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will next go to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","I was hoping you could spend a little bit more time speaking about the Calvin Klein international trends quarter to date. Could you just maybe parse out what you are seeing both in Europe and Asia in that business?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I guess I would say is, the comps right now are running flattish in Europe and in Asia they are running down 2% to 3%. The softness in the Asia business continues, for us, to be the Korean market. If we are disappointed in anything on the Asia business, it's the volatility in China. That truly, from our perspective, is a market dynamic that we are seeing. Particularly in the two major cities, Shanghai and Beijing, where we just see pressure on traffic with that domestic consumer in particular. Our Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan business, major market there, continues very strong as we see that. And I would say from a Calvin Klein performance by product area, the underwear performance just continues to be outstanding for us. We are seeing strong performance, perfectly fit for us. In Calvin Klein intimates business in Asia, depending on country, it's the number one and number two collection country by country. So the strength of that business just continues.","And I think one of the challenges we are dealing with is the malaise that\u2019s going on, particularly in China and in some of the Asian markets that are being impacted by a lack of Chinese tourism and spending in that market. So we have overcome all of that, continue to deliver. Asia for us continues to be, with the exception of Brazil, our highest profit margin business globally for any of our brands. So it continues to be a stellar performer for us. We would just like to see more growth in that market. If you go back two years, obviously that market was growing double-digits for us. We would like to get back to that trend but right now the macro environment doesn\u2019t seem to be supporting that.","Erinn Murphy","That's helpful. And then just in Europe, if you think about that order book for Calvin Klein for next year, can you just remind us kind of the key markets that you will be expanding that line into?","Emanuel Chirico","I think the two biggest markets we just see significant expansion are the U.K. and Germany. And Calvin's always had a big position in Italy. And in the Italian market we are actually pulling back as we clean up distribution there and just the difficulty that that market has experienced. We haven't seen, out of all the markets in Europe, when we look at our Tommy Hilfiger business, the Italian market is the one that just continues to suffer. And unfortunately the business we acquired, our biggest market in Europe was Italian market. So that's been a real challenge for us as well. And then I have to add, the second largest market for Calvin Klein is Russia and that related Middle East area. And although that business has remained nicely profitable, clearly we have seen some drag on the sales there. And a very careful buying for 2015 as we go forward.","So the 10% growth, and if you look at Germany, again we were very small in Germany so on a percentage basis the numbers sound spectacular, but it's on a very low base. And if you look at the growth we see in the U.K., it's very healthy. France and Spain, very healthy growth. But two markets that are holding that down significantly is the impact of Russia and the whole Italian market where Calvin had its biggest position. I hope that helps.","Erinn Murphy","That is very helpful. And just the last question. On the Tommy Hilfiger business, the revenue guidance in the fourth quarter, if I was just to adjust for the currency headwind, it is up a very nice 10% which is a good acceleration in the third quarter. Can you just help us think about some of those key drivers that's driving that re-acceleration as we get into this final quarter of the year? Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. So there is a significant year-over-year square footage expansion in our retail business that continues to drive that in the Tommy Hilfiger business, both in Europe and in North America. And in addition, our wholesale shipping timing we have, if you look at the wholesale business in the third quarter, it was relatively flat. We are seeing significant increase in sales trends and that really just has a -- that's really much more related to delivery of the product as we go forward and the timing of shipments. And really to get a real sense of that business you should put the two quarters together and you would see it's probably worth about 250 basis points of the increase for the quarter. Hope that helps.","","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thank you, guys.","Emanuel Chirico","I guess, and final point Mike just mentioned is, we are planning the Tommy Hilfiger comps both in Europe and North America at about a 3% growth for the quarter overall. And a substantial amount of that is coming out of December and January as we anniversary some very soft business driven by a lot of weather implications last year. So to remind everyone, our post-Christmas business is almost as big as our Christmas business given the nature of our North America business, which is tourist destination locations throughout the United States. That business is very strong post-Christmas and last year that business was really negatively impacted by a significant amount of weather issues. So we think that's some real opportunity for us as we go forward and that's yet to come but that's a part of what we are counting on as we go forward.","Operator","Now we will move to Michael Benetti with UBS.","Michael Benetti","Mike, I just wanted to follow up with you on the comments for the SG&A in the fourth quarter being up, I think dollars 2% to 3% and flattish. I just want to make sure I understand, if we calibrate to where you guys are headed for the operating margin for the year, that that has the gross margin -- the year-over-year gross margin improvement decelerating quite a bit in the fourth quarter. And if I'm right on that, could you maybe help us, speak to some of the components there again?","Mike Shaffer","Yes. Sure. Couple of things. I agree with what you said. So we are pretty much flat on an expense margin. On gross margins are fairly flat as we look at the fourth quarter, and the biggest driver there is mix. We are seeing, in particular that the European business while growing, the FX and the impact there and just the mix between the businesses. Our businesses are performing fine but it is the mix.","Emanuel Chirico","You know, with retail what happens also is with the retail expansion in a square footage that we have really going on. And it's a big impact in the fourth quarter as prior years stores coming on and current years stores coming on. The operating margins in wholesale and retail are very comparable but the mix of SG&A gross margin is significantly different, 1000 basis point different. Higher gross margins in our retail businesses overall. That really changes the mix as we go forward. So you really see that in the Tommy business and to some extent in the Calvin Klein business. So some of what you are seeing is just mix of the business as we go forward into the fourth quarter.","Mike Shaffer","And just to say, that when we [do not lap] [ph] that Calvin Klein investment expense and that's why you are not seeing any more deleveraging on the SG&A. We level off in the fourth quarter.","Michael Benetti","Got it. And then if we just step back and look at just a couple of strategy questions really quickly. As you look at -- Manny, if you look at Heritage retail, you voiced your displeasure with that for a while. Maybe just think ahead of like what the strategy is as you look to 2015 and what you think you could do to fix that or right size the business if that's the direction. And then maybe like, if we look at the licenses that are outside the company for Calvin and Tommy that you've talked about perhaps someday being businesses that you would like to operate. Maybe how we can think about those businesses. Where you think you need your net debt to be to start going on offense and saying it might be time to start bringing some of these in again.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. They are two very different questions. Let me deal with the Heritage retail question first. Heritage retail overall represents about 4%-4.5% of our total volume. Two divisions, IZOD and Van Heusen. Clearly we have been, for the last two years we have been significantly contacting that business. Last year we sold off the Bass business which was almost 45% of the total Heritage business. And I think as we go forward, you will continue to see more contraction in that business. The business model just doesn't work any longer for moderate priced brands in the outlet channel in North America. The outlet channel in North America has become a designer showcase brands with the like of Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Coach, Michael Kors. Those are the big players there. And I don't believe moderate brands can continue to compete in that environment as we go forward.","So where we are, given the leases and how we are moving in a very disciplined fashion, continuing to contact and shrink that base as we go forward. And I think that will be a direction that will be going on for the next 24 to 36 months as we go forward. On our growth initiatives, really with the two big brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, they represent about 75% of our volume and 85% of our profitability. We think we are at a point now where we are starting to think about and strategize what businesses should come in. The integration of the Warnaco business is clearly behind us now. We have some small systems integrations going forward that will be completed by mid-2015. But the majority of that is behind us. And I think, first and foremost internationally, Asia, both China and Southeast Asia markets, the Hong Kong market and Macau, Taiwan. Those are areas that are very interesting to us, that would like to look at potentially being more actively involved in the direct operation of those business when it comes to Tommy Hilfiger. Particularly since we have such strong operating platform in Asia with the Calvin Klein businesses today.","In a similar fashion when we look at Latin America, Brazil and Mexico. I think maybe just a little bit longer out view there. Maybe looking out, maybe 24 to 36 months. Looking at those businesses and also looking at the Tommy businesses and trying to make a decision about what businesses there we should be operating directly given our very successful Calvin Klein businesses in those markets. And then on a category basis, we are always looking at some of the men's categories here in North America like tailored clothing. And the women's opportunity which G-III has just done a spectacular job in growing that business from levels. Continues to put up substantial sales increases with the Calvin product, doing it in a quality way as we go forward. So they are a great strategic partner and we look for more ways to work with them together to grow that business and to look at maybe some creative ways of doing it together.","Operator","Okay. And now we will go to Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how the new shop-in-shop rollout is going and what the plans may be as you look towards 2015 for that.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I guess I will speak to that. I touched on it but I will just say, we will install through the second half of 2014 in total over 200 shops. Both men's and women's, probably 60% men's, 40% women's. Those shops have performed exceedingly well. We are seeing sales increases in those shops in excess of 40% over prior year levels. Where we have the ability to control the space, present the Calvin Klein denim product in a fashion that the brand deserves, in a manner that is consistent with what we do across the store in all other categories, men's sportswear, tailored clothing. Moving to the women's dress side, women's suit side, women's sportswear side, our accessory businesses. We have got major presentations in the store that the consumer can see, shop. Where we are able to put our marketing and graphics in to really attract the consumer to the space and then have the right product for them to find. We did not want to make those investments and fixtures and then disappoint the consumer with inferior product and we felt the product wasn't up to the level of the shops that we were looking to invest until we got to fall 2014.","We have put those in. We have seen a significant increase in the sales and in AURs. So that's where we are. We feel really good about that. I think for the back -- I think we're looking at approximately 150 new shops that we are targeting for 2015 in North America solely, and major doors, both Macy's, Lord and Taylor, Dillard's, our key retail partners. We will be investing significantly in fixture and presentation, and with the new product, we think that product will see strong sell through. So that just continues. We are still not in all the key doors that we need to be. Even in Herald Square where we have a nice presentation, we haven't really installed the new shop as they are going through their whole new modeling of that Herald Square store. 2015, they will be a major Calvin Klein jeans shop going in, both for men's and women's.","So I think that trend will just continue. The product is evolving and I think we will be paid for that as we go forward. Denim is the challenged category as we all know. Particularly on the women's side much more than the men side. So we are dealing with that headwind but even with that we are starting to see some good sell throughs and some improvement in AURs as we go forward.","Christian Buss","That's very helpful. And could I ask, how many shop-in-shops do you currently have for Calvin Klein jeans wear in North America?","Emanuel Chirico","A little bit over 200 shops. I would describe everything else that's out there, we are in about 700 to 800 doors. I would describe that is pulled together fixtures that we are not necessarily the most proud of the way those look. Those are left over from the Warnaco days. We have tried to at least get better fixtures on the floor in those markets and also tried to improve the merchandise presentation with new graphics, fresh graphics. Changing out the graphics on a quarterly basis rather than once a year. So we are doing things in those markets, working with the stores to get the proper presentation in those stores. We don't want to just open shops in stores if it's not the right location and if we are not getting the appropriate support at the store level. So we are making those decisions door by door, working very closely with our key retail partners.","Operator","Now we will go to Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson","Just touching on Tommy. I think a couple of years ago, you had laid out a target of 14.3% for operating margins. And just given that those margins are outperforming the way they have been this year, has the target changed at all?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. So we are operating today, the Tommy Hilfiger business, at about 14%. I think given -- I have to answer this in two ways. Given the current licensing structure, meaning that our Asia business today is hundred percent licensed basically. And our Latin America, South America business is also a hundred percent licensed. We believe there is 50 to 75 basis points of improvement on that structure. Going forward, if we were to take back in the Asia business or the Latin America business, we believe those businesses should be operating at 15% operating margins. But I do have to remind you that at the same time, those 15% operating margins, we have to eliminate the licensing margins that come through at hundred percent gross profit on where we are.","So I think from an incremental profit point of view and a return on investment, taking those businesses back in-house would be a home run but it has the potential to impact slightly the operating margin. So I think conservatively speaking, we think we should we approaching about 15% operating margins for the Tommy Hilfiger business over the next three years.","Joan Payson","Okay. Great, thank you. And also as we wind down the debt repayments for this year, what are the plans for that going forward and paying down the rest of the balance?","Emanuel Chirico","I am going to make Mike handle that and I will jump in.","Mike Shaffer","Look, we are going to continue to use free cash flow to pay down debt. It's our top priority right now for cash. So that is our goal, is to pay down the debt and continue at about the same kind of capacity we are paying down this year.","Emanuel Chirico","Yes. And I think, as you know, Mike, I, Dana, we have been really, along with our board we have been looking at this as we go forward. As you know, as the restructuring with the Warnaco transaction is behind us and as some of that cash flow that we need to put back into that business in the form of capital and restructuring expenses is behind us, our businesses are just inherently cash flow very positive. So last year, in the year which I would describe as very capital intensive from an investment point of view and from a continuation of the restructuring cost associated with Warnaco, we generated $500 million -- we pay down debt of about $400 million. I think that number starts to really significantly grow $500 million-$600 million each year as we go forward.","And the real question comes down to, we want to continue to pay down debt but we also want to look at the strategic acquisitions related to both Calvin and Tommy of bringing back some of our licensed businesses in-house. And secondarily I think, as the debt level gets to a point that we are very comfortable with next year, we will start to look at, should we be buying back some stock and return some of this cash flow to our shareholders in the form of a stock buyback or whatever. So all those things will be on the table once we get through 2014, really see what '15's cash flow looks like, our board along with the senior management team will be looking at how best to use that free cash flow.","Operator","And then we will take a question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","It's actually [Annie] on for Matt. Piggybacking on the Calvin margin question, should we still be thinking about 13% EBIT margins for total company over time and how should we be thinking about the timeframe for that?","Emanuel Chirico","I think, no, I think as we clearly talked about that we think that the Calvin Klein margin opportunity which this year will be about 13.5%, we thing that has at least 150 basis point of opportunity as we go forward over time. So I think that business historically for us prior to the Warnaco acquisition, operated substantially higher than that. But as we pro forma Warnaco, the jeans and underwear business into that business model, getting that to a reasonable return level, we think 15% is a very appropriate [interim] [ph] target for us as we go forward. And we thing that's [excitement] [ph] for us over the next three years.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then for total consolidated company, should we still be thinking about 13%?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, I think -- the way I think you have to look is that, is you have to look at, I think is our goal on Heritage is 10%. Our goal on Tommy and Calvin is, at this point about 15%. So a substantial amount of what our margin will be, will be driven by what each of those components of those businesses represent and how that changes over time given contraction of some of the Heritage businesses as we go forward and some of the growth opportunities both organic and from an acquisition point of view happen with Calvin Klein. So I think giving us a company target is not necessarily the best way to look at it. I think it should be a model that's constantly updated based on where we are with those three businesses because those businesses are just so different.","Operator","Now we will take a question from Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Manny, can you give us your thoughts on the moderate department store channel? It sounds like the Kohl's launch is going nicely, JCPenney is improving. What are you seeing there? Anything that's changing with the customer there? And then any other new brand introductions that you would take a look at that could be coming up? Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. So our JCPenney and Kohl's business in sportswear couldn't be healthier. We are seeing just very strong performance there with those two brands. We are seeing on the intimate side, we don't talk about a lot because it's just not a big part of our business overall. But the Warner's and Olga business, our core intimates business is just having a very strong year in all channels of distribution, particularly with Kohl's and JCPenney. New presentations. We have allowed that business for the first time in years to actually invest back into the brands. It was really a significant harvest strategy that Warnaco had with both the core intimates business and I would say the Speedo business. And we have allowed the businesses to invest back into those businesses, both capital and some level of marketing at point of sales and fixtures investments.","And the consumer has really reacted with both brands to that. So we have seen nice payback there. And with our Warner's business, that's really a mid-channel play for us in a big way. Our biggest customers there are both JCPenney and Kohl's. So that business is very healthy with those two mid tier department stores. And then finally I would just say, the one business at wholesale that's been more challenged across all channels of distribution has been our dress shirt business. As a category, dress shirts are just in a negative sales, low single digits kind of business. Really being driven by fancy dress shirts which just don't carry the same gross margins that basic EDI replenishment businesses. So that business is just going through what I would describe as a normal cycle it go through, it seems every four of five years. As the business evolves, I think we are well positioned there. But that\u2019s been a more challenged business for us.","At this point, our growth with Kohl's and Penney's, very healthy. Our relationship couldn't be better. We are in investing on the floor with shops with those two key retailers for us. I think their business in November have been healthy. I don\u2019t see the entirety of their business but I see our businesses. And our business there has been healthy and I think that is reflective of how we are performing in November, which is basically on plan. So I think we are happy with those relationships and our performance in that channel of distribution. I don\u2019t see us growing with additional brands at this time in that channel of distribution but I do see with Kohl's that the IZOD business will continue to expand in some new categories and really giving us an opportunity to expand the IZOD presentation with Kohl's very successfully for both of us. And they are really on top of it there. So I think you will see even a broader presentation for spring and then fall 2015 in Kohl's across the store.","Operator","Now we will go to John Kernan with Cowen & Company.","John Kernan","Manny, helpful color on the Tommy Hilfiger licenses in regions that you are not operating directly. Can you remind us the relative size of those businesses and what they are doing with the dollars at retail? Just so we can try to understand what the boost to top line will be if you bring some of these businesses back in-house?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think if you took it all in, on the Tommy side it's about $1 billion and on the Calvin side it\u2019s about $1 billion in sales, round numbers. Let's say $750 million to $1 billion for both opportunities. Given the growth that\u2019s going on, particularly in Asia and Latin America, those numbers, depending when we do the transaction, could be higher at that time. What we are seeing in most of those markets since Tommy is at the early stage of development in those markets, a lot of those markets, we are seeing double-digit kind of sales increase in our license business there. And to remind everybody, in some of those key markets, Brazil and China and India, and as well Australia. In those four key markets, we are joint venture partners there, so we don\u2019t get to report our profitability, our sales in those markets. But do own between 40% and 50% of those businesses. So it clearly gives us a real insight into those business and understanding of what's going on there. And obviously it gives us a direct path to acquire the business as we go forward over time.","John Kernan","Okay, that's really helpful. And then just on the Calvin Klein international business. The margin improvement year-over-year there was noticeable given that the FX headwinds you clearly faced in the quarter. Can you remind us where the European Calvin Klein profitability stands? I know when you bought it from Warnaco it was barely profitable after previously being a double-digit operating margin business. So where do you stand in some of those international Calvin Klein regions where the profitability was very depressed when you bought the business from Warnaco?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. So Europe is really the market where the Warnaco, Calvin Klein businesses were depressed. It's about $450 million business, ongoing business, since we are cleaning up distribution as you look at it. And that business today, given the investments that we have put in, above where Warnaco is, where Warnaco is at a marginal profit of 1% to 2%. We are today at a marginal loss of about 1% to 2%. So as we look at the opportunity of 1000 basis point improvement over time in that business as we get it to a scale and we start to be paid for the investments that we are making in the business and as our Tommy Hilfiger management team operates that business. Clearly on a much much larger Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe, they are earning in excess of 15% operating margin.","Our initial goal over the next four to five years is to get Calvin to about 10% operating margin business. And that\u2019s where Warnaco operated the jeans underwear business in Europe if you go back to 2008 and 2009. Operator, since it's after 10 o'clock, we are going to make this our last question. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Then we will take that question from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric Tracy","Thanks for squeezing me in. Manny, just a follow-up on that CK Europe business, jeans in particular. Can you just sort of -- I get it's over a four-year period to get back to that 10% level, but maybe just a cadence, is there anything incremental that needs to be done from a spend perspective or should we relatively step function from here in terms of improvement of that profitability?","Emanuel Chirico","In order to get the 10% operating margins, we would have to -- the business needs to also scale. Given the -- if you look at the European business model, we had the diversity of country, the need to have an expanse, an organizational structure to support a pan-European business. That business in order to get to 10% operating margin needs to be at about $750 million of sales base across the market. So there will continue to be investment spending as we grow the business normally. As we put shops in where we are. But what you should see and this is how anybody is going to budget or project a business. If you are going to go from breakeven to 10%, you are going to do it over 4 to 5 years. What you are going to see in a business plan from any management team is it goes to 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%.","What we are hoping for, given our market expertise and given the strength of the team that we have in Europe that runs the Tommy Hilfiger business, that we are able to leverage our past experiences with acquisitions. The Tommy acquisition, the initial Calvin acquisition. What we would like to do is actually accelerate that timeframe and obviously that\u2019s our goal. But if you are asking me what our financial plan is, it's that steady growth. Trying to grow operating margins 200 basis points a year and then working our way up over a 4 to 5 year period approaching 10%. So that\u2019s our goal. That\u2019s how we planned it financially. That\u2019s what I am willing to commit to. With the understanding is that we are doing everything possible to accelerate that turnaround.","Eric Tracy","And then if I could just switch to Tommy. I just wanted to clarify. Really decent profitability in 3Q in that business. Sales de-celed [ph], the expectation that it re-accels in 4Q. You mentioned that the environment got more promotional. Is that your expectation as well that you guys participate in that and so the actual operating algorithm doesn't really change? Or is there, potentially you accelerate sales and actually hold the profitability as well?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. It's a great question. And the best answer I could give you and the fairest answer I could give you is, I don\u2019t think anybody knows at this moment in time. And so I think we have planned it prudently. I believe we have planned it with the appropriate level of markdowns and promotions. If business were to slow down and we needed to step on the pedal in order to liquidate goods and cleanup, that\u2019s what we do. We don\u2019t stay with problems. That\u2019s our business model. So I don\u2019t want to throw out any guarantees of whatever, but our model and our business practices, that\u2019s what we do. So we will react to whatever the market conditions are. I think we have clearly, prudently planned it in a way that we have given ourselves room to be promotionally competitive with the rest of the market. But if that steps up another match in an environment like this which is the fourth quarter holiday season, it happens very quickly and you need to react, we are going to react.","So we will be transparent. We will let the market know what's going on. We will clearly send signals so that everybody understands it. But I think in our model we have built that all in and the one thing that gives me a level of comfort about all that is the weakness that was experienced last year in December and January, that we really felt because of the market conditions we left money on the table last year. I think we have really built that into our plans that we will be promotional and it will require us to be competitive with the market and we have tried to factor that in as best as possible.","Eric Tracy","Perfect. Appreciate it. Thanks guys, best of luck.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, everyone. First of all, I would like to just wish everybody a happy holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah. And I would also say to everyone, we look forward to speaking to you on our fourth quarter call and have a great and healthy and happy new year. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's call.

Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President in charge of business development and investor relationship. Ken Duane is also on the call. Ken runs all of our Heritage businesses, as well as our North American wholesale businesses.","Looking at the business, we were pleased with the second quarter results. We beat our second quarter revenue and earnings guidance. We saw a strong outperformance against our projections in both Calvin Klein and the Tommy Hilfiger businesses, as well as in all of our Heritage wholesale businesses.","From a macro point of view, I would describe the environment from a consumer point of view as volatile. We saw the quarter -- we saw the second quarter get off to a strong start in May and early June, and then the business and the environment softened, particularly in North America and Europe where we saw attractive trends in June and July that were actually down year-over-year. Business strength began in August, particularly in our North America business. And as we turn into September, we've seen business soften and traffic trends soften in the North American environment. So overall, we're trying to follow the consumer and see where the trends are taking us.","Focusing in on each business and the performance in the quarter. On the Tommy Hilfiger business, it continued to be strong overall during the quarter. We posted 11% revenue increase. Revenues were up about 10% in North America, driven by a 7% retail comp store increase, growth in square footage in North America, in our retail business and strong growth in our wholesale business.","Internationally, revenues were up 11% for the quarter. Revenue growth in Europe was partially offset by continued weakness in our Japan business. Our retail comps in Europe posted a 6% increase in the second quarter.","Operating income for our Tommy Hilfiger business grew 3% to $100 million as 20% earnings growth in North America was partially offset by a 15% earnings decline in our International business.","Continued weak performance in Japan, coupled with gross margin pressure in our European business caused by higher promotional selling and a weaker U.S. dollar merchandise purchases negatively impacting our International results overall. As we look into -- out to the third quarter, third quarter sales strengths in North America are running on plan with our retail store comps running up about 3%.","Looking at the third quarter International sales trends, European comps were running ahead of plan, up mid-single digits. We are planning our wholesale fall and holiday sales up about 8% for the year. Geographically, we see continued strong growth in Central and Northern Europe, with particular strength in Germany, France and Russia, partially offset by weakness in Southern Europe, Spain and Italy in particular.","Looking out to spring 2014, which we begin shipping in January, last fiscal month of our year. We are seeing our spring order projections flat to last year as strong business trends in Northern Europe are being offset by a double-digit declines in Southern Europe, particularly the Italian market.","Moving to our Heritage business. Our wholesale Heritage businesses continued their strong performance. Sales came in ahead of our estimates. We also saw a strong performance in our newly acquired Speedo and court intimate business units. Overall, second quarter operating margins improved in our wholesale Heritage business to over 12%. This margin expansion resulted from a significant improvement in sportswear margins driven by strong sell-throughs at retail and higher average unit retail selling prices. Third quarter sales trends are running on plan and inventory levels are quite clean during the back-to-school season.","Our performance in our Heritage retail businesses for the second quarter was disappointing. Comps were minus 10%, and were particularly weak in our Bass footwear division. Third quarter sales trends at retail have improved to -- and are now posting a low single-digit negative comp quarter to date, so we're seeing some improvement in that business as we move into the back-to-school season.","Moving to our Calvin Klein businesses. We exceeded our sales and earnings estimates in the second quarter. We posted strong sales gains and higher-than-estimated operating income.","By region, we saw the strongest results in South America, Asia and North America. Our South America business was very strong, particularly in Brazil where we continue to see sales growth of about 10%, driven by the performance of the Calvin Klein Jeans business. Our order book for the fall\/holiday season is also running up about 10%, so there is good momentum in this business as we go to -- as we move into the third and fourth quarter.","Asia, overall comps in our Asia business are up slightly for the quarter. We still saw strong sales in China and Southeast Asia, where comp store sales are up about 5%. The only difficult market continues to be Korea where comp sales trends have improved from first quarter and are now running down about minus 5% for the second quarter. Third quarter sales trends in Asia continue to improve and are running at about plus 2% for the quarter-to-date, third quarter.","In North America, our businesses continue to perform strongly across all product categories with the exception of men's and women's jeans. We have seen very strong performance in our wholesale men's sportswear and our men's and women's underwear business. In addition, our North America retail business posted a 6% comp store sales increase and higher operating margins due to better sell-throughs at higher average unit retails. The third quarter trends in these businesses are running on plan. Quarter to date in the third quarter, comps are running on plan at about plus 4% in our retail stores.","The Calvin Klein Jeans business in North America and Europe continues to be the only difficult business in the Calvin Klein portfolio. We have planned these businesses down mid-single digits and are anticipating continued pressure on margins in order to move through goods for the third and fourth quarter of this year.","In the licensing area, ongoing royalty revenues were up about 10% in the quarter due to the strength in our global handbag and accessory businesses, as well as our women's apparel businesses, which are operated by G-III in North America and Club 21 throughout Asia. Our fragrance royalties in the second quarter were flat as we are planning for significant launches in the second half of the year. This year, our key marketing initiatives are all second half weighted. We have a major women's fragrance launch planned for the third quarter. The fragrance is called Downtown, and our celebrity talent is Rooney Mara. You're starting to see some of the marketing associated with this launch as it goes forward, and we would expect that there will be major -- there is a major marketing campaign around the launch, particularly in the fourth quarter.","Just to update you on our integration plans, which are all on track. We continue to validate all those plans, and we're seeing all the processes and system conversions to move, and we're on plan there. Over the last 3 months, we successfully converted a number of systems in North America and Europe. There have been no surprises in this area since the last time we updated you, and we're very comfortable with our integration timetable. From a people perspective, we have our senior management teams in place across the globe and have had some key hirings across the globe as well and are moving forward in a very positive fashion in this area.","Mike will put a little bit more flesh on that. And we're going to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of our results.","Michael A. Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.","Revenues for the first quarter were $1.965 billion, up 47%, with $628 million increase over the prior year. Driving our revenue increase over the prior year was the Warnaco acquisition, which accounted for $507 million; Tommy Hilfiger, which was $77 million; and $43 million in the pre-acquisition Calvin Klein businesses.","Overall, our pre-acquisition Heritage business was flat to the prior year as our ongoing wholesale business performed well for the first quarter but was offset by continued disappointing business in Bass retail and the discontinued Timberland and Izod women's wholesale business.","First, our guidance revenue were up as a result of strong performance in Calvin Klein China, Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein Brazil, coupled with strong performance in our Tommy Hilfiger North America retail businesses.","Our earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.39. Driving the earnings per share beat was our revenues, which was slightly better than planned.","Our revenues for 2013 are projected at $8.25 billion. Calvin Klein revenues are planned at approximately $2.75 billion. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at approximately $3.42 billion, up around 6% to the prior year. Heritage revenues are planned at $2.08 billion. Year-over-year comparisons for the Calvin Klein and Heritage Brands revenues are significantly impacted by the Warnaco acquisition.","I wanted to put some color to 2013 operating margins for the company and our businesses. Operating margin for the year is expected to be approximately 11.8%, a 60-basis-point reduction to 2012. Driving this overall reduction is the switch from running a licensing model to direct operations for the Calvin Klein jeans and underwear businesses, combined with our expenses associated with rebuilding and investing in the acquired Warnaco businesses. The current operating margin guidance of 11.8% reflects a reduction of about 20 basis points to previous guidance as we see continued pressure and volatility, particularly in Southern Europe. For the year, we are projecting our Calvin Klein operating margins to be about 15%. Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned at about 14%, and Heritage Brands operating margins will be in excess of 8%.","We're planning the full year tax rate between 25.5% and 26% and full year interest expense between $195 million and $200 million.","For the quarter, we're projecting revenues at about $2.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.20. When comparing to the prior year, earnings per share for the third quarter impacted negatively by the new seasonality of our business as a result of the Warnaco acquisition, particularly in the acquired Heritage businesses, coupled with the higher tax rate.","The tax rate for the third quarter is planned at 26.5% compared to 22.2% in the prior year. About $0.13 of our earnings per share drop versus the prior year is associated with this tax increase. Also, negatively impacting the current year's third quarter is the shift of advertising expense as compared to the prior year, which is worth approximately $0.10.","Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be about 13%. Our debt paydown for the year continues to be projected at $400 million. Integration efforts are in full swing, and initial conversion has been very successful. We have converted the Warnaco Calvin Klein North America retail and Calvin Klein Jeans operations to the PVH platform. Our Calvin Klein Europe operations have also successfully migrated to the PVH platforms. We are now focused on North America underwear, as well as planning and allocation systems in Asia.","And with that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe I guess as you look at the rest of the year, the sort of full year number that you've maintained, what was the, like, biggest factors that you looked at that kept you comfortable with the $7 number versus increasing it? And the second question that I have is, can you just elaborate a little bit on the European -- the trends, especially on the wholesale side and the order book a little bit and the margins or just the promotional side of what's happening in Europe?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure, Bob. I guess we've been pretty consistent. We've been talking about $7 from the beginning of the fiscal year, and we're holding on to that even though, as you know, we've beaten our first and second quarter initial estimates in the street. I think what's causing us to be more cautious about the 2013 fiscal year is just the consumer environment that we see and the lack of consistency from the consumer from a traffic point of view and spending point of view. It seems to come in fits and starts. When you look at our overall sales trends through the first 6 months of the year, there's still -- particularly in the Calvin and Tommy businesses, they're still pretty impressive, putting in mid-single digit comp store increases in North America and Europe. But it still gives us some pause as we go forward looking at the business and with the kind of plans we've had in place. So we're really looking at the second half. And right now, I guess you'd have to say that we're anticipating that our sales trends will remain positive but will not be at the same levels that we were able to garner in the first quarter and the second quarter this fiscal year. That may hopefully prove to be conservative, but right now, it seems to be the right posture to take based on what we're seeing in the business. When we talked to our retail customers in North America or in Europe, our major department stores, there seems to be a level of cautiousness as they approach the back-to-school season and the holiday selling season. A couple of good weeks of business will change all that, but right now, that's the tone of business, and it's hard to be more aggressive in this kind of environment that we see. On the European order book, I guess I'd start by just reminding everyone that the last 3 years that there's been so much volatility in Europe, we've been fortunate enough to grow that Tommy Hilfiger business at over a 10% sales increase on a, what I would -- on a pretty large business and a very profitable business. And that trend continues through the second quarter. As we go into the fall season, we are seeing a continued momentum in the order book. But as we turn to spring, coming off of what can only be described as a very challenged overall macro European retail environment for the first 6 months of the fiscal year, I think retailers are being cautious as they buy. But if you look at our order book, Northern Europe, our order book is up between 5% and 6%, and we're really seeing the pressure in Southern European markets, principally the Italian market where business is down over 20%, where there has really been a contraction in open to buy dollars and also a cautiousness on our part into selling into a number of these small specialty accounts where we have significant credit collection issues there, and we're just being very cautious as we sell into those accounts and judicial as we plan that business. So we are trying our approach o market appropriately. I've also -- the flip side of that whole comment is when you look at our own retail businesses on the Tommy side where we're running up high mid-single digit increases in that business, that continues to go. So it gives us -- clearly, it validates the strength of the brand. It validates continued gains in market share that we're making. And I think we're dealing with a moment in time with the challenging spring, summer order book in the face of such a challenging 2013 spring order book with retailers being cautious as they buy. So I think we're planning it appropriately and we're doing it. So hopefully, that gives you some color.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Glick from Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Manny, I just wondered if you could kind of update your thoughts on how, if at all, kind of your guidance update today and being a little bit more cautious. I mean, how does that make you think about the sort of intermediate to longer-term sort of financial model that you guys have been talking about, the high single-digit growth in Calvin and Tommy, the overall mid-single-digit growth, and earnings in 15% to 20%? I mean, clearly, you've got a lot of levers on the Calvin Klein side, particularly Warnaco. You've got CK bridge, lower interest expense and taxes potentially over time. But how, if at all, does these recent developments change how you think about the growth prospects for the company?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, I guess when you look at it from a long-term perspective, it doesn't change anything. The opportunities which we've been speaking about for the last 9 months on the Calvin side and the Tommy side, we're just more excited about. We don't think that any of the trends we're seeing in the business really have any impact on what's going on there. More intermediate, meaning -- and I know how the investment community is thinking about -- starting to think about 2014. Clearly, the order book for such an important business in Europe being flat will put some pressure on some of the earnings growth that we see. But as you said, we have plenty of levers. We expect to have a benefit on the interest expense line. We expect to see margin improvement in the Calvin Klein businesses as we go forward. We think there's margin opportunities in the Tommy business. So I guess in the intermediate theory, it will put some pressure on that 15% to 20% growth kind of range and maybe puts us more on the bottom end of that as we go forward as we start to think about it. But it's really too early to start to give any kind of specific guidance about 2014. But from a pure growth trajectory point of view, opportunities for both brands and what we see, nothing that we're experiencing in this short window and dealing with the consumer as they go through these -- the volatility in the economic markets really impact our thinking about what the growth opportunities for the 2 brands are.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And just a quick follow-up. I mean CK bridge is -- represents a major whitespace opportunity for you guys in Europe, and could you update us on where your thinking is now in terms of the launch and rollout of that brand?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think in Europe, the -- let me take a step back. As I think everyone is aware, it's already a very successful business in Asia -- throughout Asia, Club 21, in conjunction with us, runs that business. And that continues to be -- to grow at a double-digit rate, somewhere between 12% and 15%. So we're very happy how they manage the business and growing. In Europe, the plan is to launch men's for Fall 2014 with our major wholesale accounts, also to begin to open some of our own retail stores, Calvin Klein, where we would have the women's accessories and women's apparel as well, and then looking out probably a year or so, launching women's apparel in the 2015 time frame. Probably fall is the thought process right now, but continue to really focus on that. We see it as a big opportunity. We believe we understand the market, have the infrastructure with the Tommy Hilfiger experience on a management team that's in place to really take advantage of that. But it's critical for us, first and foremost, to really try to get along around the jeans business, have that repositioned, get some traction in that business, improve the distribution in that business in Europe and take a business that's actually losing money and start to bring it to a breakeven to a small profit in '14 and then move it forward, combined with the platinum launch to really start to create a significant sportswear apparel offering for the Calvin Klein brand in Europe that just doesn't exist today.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the progress with the key hires that you've been looking to make.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think clearly, in -- throughout Asia, we've made some significant progress. We've hired some key positions in the merchandising, design and the planning side of the business, in the retail side of the business as well. A strong management team in place in country there that existed with the Warnaco Group, and very close to announcing the hiring of the new CEO for Calvin Klein Asia. A similar fashion in Europe. That business has all come under the direction of the Tommy Hilfiger management team on the ground. Systems have been converted. Management has been put in place. The country managers have now been all put in place for the Calvin Klein business, as well as the Tommy businesses, as we go forward. And we should be very close in the next 1.5 months to making an announcement about a new CEO for the Calvin Klein Europe as well. Both of those are down the road and will be in place by the fourth quarter of 2013. So good progress there as we move forward. In North America, the business is really -- we've taken the business forward. We've moved the jeans business under our Calvin Klein sportswear businesses which we've been very successful with here in North America under Alex Cannon. We've also moved the underwear businesses under Cheryl Dapolito who has taken over that business for us and brought it forward. On the supply side, both in jeans and underwear, we've made good progress. And we've got some strong people on the global supply office that was brought in place to really move that business forward as well. So I think we are on track to where we thought we would be from a people perspective and moving forward. Still some work to do there, but I think we'll be well positioned as we go into 2014 from a people perspective.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could we talk a little bit about the systems? Can you give me a little bit of a sense of the time line for the integration of those Warnaco systems onto the PVH platform over the next 12 months? And then when do you expect to be fully complete with that systems integration?","Michael A. Shaffer","Okay. Let me start with the last piece first. As we look to the full integration, it won't be till 2015. But the bulk of the systems integrations in North America will be completed in 2013 and in the first half of 2014. Asia and Latin America will then follow. Europe, as I've said before, is already moved on to the PVH platform, so that is the time line as it stands today.","Emanuel Chirico","And that is the same time line where we started the fiscal year. So everything is on track.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I wanted to focus a little bit on trends in Asia, maybe first with Calvin Klein in both China and Korea. It seems that you guys have still been very strong in China despite kind of some of the -- denim appears struggling, a lot of excess inventory there. Can you just speak a little bit more to that landscape? And then in Korea, still a little bit volatile. Maybe just help us appreciate kind of the comparisons you're up against in the back half of the year? And then for Japan as it relates to Tommy Hilfiger, could you just help us understand kind of, as you've repositioned the brand there, what you've seen year to date? It sounds like it's still a little bit soft and promotional? How should we think about some of the levers you have in the back half of this year?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. Starting with the Calvin Klein businesses. Our China business has been strong all year. We -- soon as we took over the business and got involved and even before we took over the business, we made the decision about cleaning out inventories quickly. So there was a significant inventory glut. There was about 6 months too much inventory on hand. We moved in -- that inventory. We destroyed some of that inventory. We moved some of that inventory to other markets, but we took decisive action to try to get that behind us, and I think probably moved quicker than most of the other markets in China -- other competitors in China to get fresh goods in place, particularly by the start of the second quarter. So our business there has been good, continues to be good. And I think we're not suffering as much from some of those inventory situations because we moved so quickly when we got involved. And when you think about Korea, Korea has been a tough market, both macro and micro for us, so their own situation and issues. I think most of our inventory flow issues are behind us, particularly as we get into the third quarter. You're absolutely right. We start to cycle some double-digit negative comps from the prior year, so I think the comparisons do become easier. And we've seen business improve from trends that were running first half of the year, double-digit negative comps, to low single-digit comps in the third quarter so far to date. So seeing some improvement there as we go forward. So I think in Asia, I think we have the business planned appropriately. We have room in the business if we stay on the kind of trends that we're seeing to outperform our plans financially as we go forward, the driver being for the Calvin Klein business really the China business as we go forward and the stability that we're starting to see in Korea quicker than we might have anticipated. The Tommy Hilfiger Japan business has been a challenge for us. Since the acquisition, it's the only piece of the Tommy Hilfiger business that really hasn't come together well for us. We made the decision after about owning it for a year to reposition the brand in Asia and really take it up to mirror the way it's positioned throughout the European and Asian markets overall. And when we -- obviously, when we've done that, we moved very quickly. The consumer is still catching up with that. It is the right thing from a brand positioning point of view, but it is putting pressure on the top line and the bottom line. We believe we are under the numbers now from a point of view -- we're not happy where the numbers are, but we're clearly in the single-digit operating margin range for a business that's about a 225 -- $250 million business for us overall. So we think there's opportunities as we go into '14 to start to see some improvement in that business. It's a business that should operate when it's hitting at the right cylinders in the 10% to 11% operating margins. So there's clearly opportunity there. I don't believe it's going to come to a short term. I think it's more of a long-term, '14 to '15 kind of issue for us to get that business back on track as we go forward. So...","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. I guess just a quick clarification on the Tommy Hilfiger International margins then. A little bit lighter in the second quarter. I mean, is that kind of the kind of promotional driven nature of what happened in some of the key regions there for Tommy? And then just with inventory being in good shape, should we expect the margin profile of the International business for Tommy to improve in the second half? Or just maybe help us think about the puts and takes there.","Emanuel Chirico","I think as you start to look at that business, the expectation is those operating margins will level off, and it should be flat to up slightly for the second half of the year. I think we were aggressive about marketing inventory down, both financial -- from a financial perspective in the business and from an in-store point of view. So I think a lot of that is behind us as we go forward. Some of the U.S. dollar purchasing issues alleviate as we get into the third and particularly into the fourth quarter, so some of those comparisons year-over-year where the weakness of the dollar from a hedging point of view on inventory purchases which has been impacting us for the first half and into the third quarter this year will be behind us. So I think you'll see those margins in the third quarter flatten out, and then we should start to see improvement in the fourth quarter.","And that's really just with the kind of sales trends that we're seeing in the business today. It doesn't call for any major herculean changes in the business. So I think we feel very confident about that margin expansion in the second half of the year, and hopefully, can see some sales upside as that European environment starts to stabilize.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Omar Saad with the ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It sounds like on the Calvin Klein Europe piece, you've got a lot of the management pieces in place, systems pieces in place. Such a big kind of profit dollar opportunity Calvin Klein Europe from where it stands currently as you took the business over. Is it time now to start thinking about the cadence of when some of the big chunks of those profit improvements are going to flow through? Is it -- or is the macro kind of headwind going to overweigh that?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, I think there's a -- I think it's -- look, it's a very fair question. We have a Calvin Klein business that does $500 million between jeans and underwear in Europe. It's a business that, all-in, if you put it all together, is operating at low single-digit kind of operating margins, 3%. Clearly, that's a business that should be at least, let's just use 10% as a goal. I know everyone is going to tell me, \"Well, Tommy is at 14%,\" but I think 10%, at this moment in time for the next 3 years would be a great goal for us to improve to 3% to 10%. And I think it's clearly there, that opportunity ahead. How quickly it comes, I mean, we have to remember, we're not dealing with white space here. We are changing a lot of the distribution. We're cleaning up the distribution. There is some profitable business in the secondary channel that we are making the decisions to get out of as we start -- as we're seeing growth, particularly in the spring book for Calvin Klein, if you look at it from a regular priced business, the business is up 10% to 15% in jeans, at the same time that we are bringing the off-price business down. So overall, it's up slightly. We're planning for spring 2014, but on a much healthier distribution platform, a better sale. Also, to remind everyone, just by the nature of the jeans business in Europe for Calvin, the way it's been established, 75% to 80% of that business is done in Southern Europe. So those markets, although we're seeing growth in those markets for the Calvin brand, it's still in an environment that's very much challenged. And if that starts to stabilize and improve, I think you can start to see an acceleration there. We're making significant breakthroughs in Northern Europe on a very small base. But from a percentage point, we're seeing very, very big percentage increase kind of growth, with the opportunity to really grow that business further. So there is real opportunities there and I think we'll see improvement in operating margins in 2014. I'm not, at this moment, ready to start putting a stake in the ground what it would be. But I think you clearly have to think about this improvement from 3% operating margins to getting to 10% operating margins as a 3- to 4-year path to get there. It's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take time to reposition the brand, to get the profitability to where we think it needs to be and to move the business forward as we go in making these right investments, to really take advantage of what we think is at least $1 billion opportunity as we go forward. And today, we're at $450 million, $500 million, so a big opportunity over the next 4 years with the brand and a big margin expansion. The cadence of which, I don't think we're ready to be very specific about, but we're trying to point out the opportunity. It will improve -- the magnitude of that improvement, I think as we get into the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year and ready to give guidance, we'll be more specific about.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then a quick question on Tommy Europe, Manny. Is it fair to say you're seeing kind of a dichotomy in the business that Tommy wholesale -- and I'm not talking about Northern versus Southern. I'm talking about the wholesale, kind of, through the department store channels in Europe versus the Tommy kind of owned stores which seem to be comping pretty well. Am I interpreting that right?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, I guess, it's -- look, I know the focus is on spring 2014, I understand that. I think you have to think about the business model in Europe, which is more like the North American model used to be 25 years ago. We had pretty healthy spring order book, up 3% to 4%, followed by a strong order book for fall, planning up 9% to 10% as it came through. So in that, as a backdrop for that, the retail comps we're seeing in the business kind of mirror that -- what's going on. The issue really is, from a macro point of view, the retail environment in Europe was very much challenged in spring 2013, and every retailer is buying the spring '14 order plan very cautiously. And everyone is planning, they're hoping to buy dollars down. And what we're seeing in Northern Europe, where our business might have been up 10% to 11% for fall, we're seeing that up 5% to 6%, so it's still pretty healthy growth. Unfortunately, we're really being impacted in Southern Europe, where we're seeing double-digit declines, closer to 15% overall, with the Italian market down over 20%, where we have seen open to buy dollars cut and also, we've eliminated a number of specialty store accounts where we're really concerned about being paid as we go forward, given the economic environment there. So I think that we're really dealing with a moment in time on that spring order book and we have to get through it. So I think as you look at it and get into it, I don't think it's really a disconnect. It's just understanding how the business models work and where we are going. So what it tells us is the brand continues to be very strong. We continue to garner market share in the wholesale channel but also in our own retail channel, given the strength of the performance we see. We're recognizing this as an issue we have to deal with this spring, summer order book that we have to deal with, but we really feel at the moment in time and a transition as we reestablish ourselves. And I would expect that our fall order book will be up in the mid-single digit range as we go forward. But that's to be seen as we go forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Kernan from Cowen & Company.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to jump back across the pond to Tommy Hilfiger North America. I think your square footage growth has been pretty impressive this year. How many more outlet doors can you open in North America? And what's the full price square footage growth opportunity over the next few years?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, let me take the second part first. Clearly, we operate in North America, I guess, only in about -- from specialty store, regular-priced business, probably 20 stores overall. There's clearly a huge opportunity if that materializes as a successful business strategy, and that's what we're testing. I think the specialty store opportunity -- the specialty store test that we're doing is really twofold. One is, we think regular retailers are very appropriate for the brand, positioning of the brand. Having a chain of overall, 30 to 35 stores throughout North America, from where we are today at about 20, would be great. It positions the brand. It communicates to the consumer, it would be part of our marketing -- marketing of the brand to the consumer and really allows us to showcase the brand in appropriate retails formats. The separate question then is, \"Well, doing that, can you actually make money and does it make sense?\" And that's what we're testing, and I guess our results have been mixed. We have some good stores that are making a nice profitability for us in that channel, and we have other stores that are breakeven or a small loss for us as we go forward. Understand that we're in the very early stages of development, and you would expect that to happen. So from the -- the specialty store opportunity is huge. And I guess if you said, \"What could be the magnitude?\" Theoretically, you can have 100 stores to 125 stores throughout North America, if you could do it profitably. And we wouldn't get too far ahead of ourselves until we could prove that to ourselves. So next year, I think we're talking about opening 2 stores. So clearly, this is a slow test, understanding and communicating with our consumer, and also getting the benefits from a brand positioning point of view for a relatively small dollar investment to balance off our positioning in North America, be it our Macy's full-price strategy, some of our outlet strategy as well. Where we had tremendous square footage growth, and I don't think it's going to be as high in the future, has been in the outlet environment, not only new stores but also, the ability to expand square footage in major AA markets like Harriman, New York; Orlando, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada. Some of those still exist and I think we'll see it, but when we think about square footage growth, I think we're talking about 3% to 4% square footage growth for Tommy going forward. Coupled with the conservatively 2% to 3% comp store growth, I think that would translate into business growth of 5% to 6%, 7%. And we are always looking for opportunities to be opportunistic about growing that square footage since it's probably our most profitable business in North America.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great, that's really helpful. And then, I guess, 1 final question. The timing of the realization of the $100 million in cost synergies with Warnaco, has that changed at all in terms of your thinking, and when that will flow through?","Michael A. Shaffer","No, we're still on track. We're talking about $25 million for this year and we're still on track for $100 million as we move forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Manny, with regards to your comment about pulling back some sales from Southern Europe -- I understand Italy is weak, is this the first time that you guys are pulling back product or has this been ongoing?","Emanuel Chirico","Well -- I guess this is -- look, we're always very -- we're always looking to get credit in the situation. I think it's been ongoing, but our sales declines in Italy have been more in the 8% to 10% range, as opposed to what we are seeing for spring 2014, about 20% decline. So that is 1 market when we talk about Europe in general, saying we're seeing some stability and we are not seeing any stability in the Italian market at all. And that continues to be a very difficult market overall.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And is there any opportunity, then, because of the strategy and as you look into spring 2014, to reduce some of the SG&A spend or is that -- what is the strategy around SG&A dollar spend?","Michael A. Shaffer","Well, that's a great -- it's a great question. Given the size, when we looked at the Calvin and Tommy business in Italy combined, and it was 1 market where Tommy had a major position, actually, larger overall than the Tommy business, we really felt we needed 2 organizations as we go forward. We're in the midst of relooking at that overall, trying to understand where there might be some more synergies as we bring both -- as we rationalize the size of both businesses as we go forward. So that's in-process dialogue and we're looking at it as we go forward. So clearly, it's one of the areas that as we are looking at the trends in the business, that we're looking hard at to see if there's some SG&A expense leverage that can be gained there.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, my last question is a bigger strategic question, just around Calvin Klein underwear. As you take a look at the positioning of that brand, particularly in the U.S., there's been some consolidation, with Hanes taking over Maidenform, I wondered if -- how that maybe changes the strategic outlook for Calvin Klein underwear?","Emanuel Chirico","I think it really has a minimal effect on the Calvin business. I mean, Hanes is the major player in the market, particularly post this transaction. And I think it's -- but we're really into the designer underwear business. Our price points are significantly higher. Their distribution is dramatically wider, selling from -- selling a number of their brands through Walmart, all the way out and some through Bloomingdale's, where Calvin is really a department store business. In North America, specialty store business, a price position I think 3x the price position of Hanes on the men's side. And on the women's side as well, we're really in a different market -- we really feel like we're in a completely different market from that respect, so I don't think it really impacts Calvin in a way. It will have some impact on our Warner's business for sure. But I think, in some ways, it creates opportunities. As a player becomes bigger and bigger, retailers are always looking for opportunities. I think given our portfolio, when you think about us, I know everyone thinks of the Calvin Klein underwear business, but we have, on the men's side, we have a Michael Kors business, we have an Izod business, we have a Van Heusen business and a Tommy Hilfiger men's underwear business that is significant, that gives us a good position in the market overall. So I think we are well positioned in the overall women's intimates business and the men's business to really continue to grow those businesses.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Manny, I wanted to get your -- maybe thoughts on the volatility in the market in North America. You talked about what you've seen recently. Any thoughts on -- some have attributed the weakness to wallet share shifts given the strength in big ticket items like cars? What do you think about that? Do you think there's any weather impact? If you could just share thoughts there, that would be great.","Emanuel Chirico","Those, all, are very logical ideas, concepts whatever. And I guess, I'll leave that to you guys. That's your job to figure out why. I have to deal with what we are facing. I do think that probably a number of those things are all true. Everything I read, I watch the same economical reports that you do. Seeing oil's up, I see home purchases and related goods. And when I look at retail performance, the 1 area that continues to be a standout is anything to do with either home building or home furnishings. So I'm sure there is something to do with that, and if that's all true, then, I think as we move through back-to-school and really turn into the Holiday season, I believe the consumer really -- apparel becomes front-of-mind focus, so it gives us a lot of optimism about the fourth quarter as we go forward. That, coupled with having to anniversary last year with Sandy, which really impacted November and early December selling, which is the 2 very significant months for us. So I think the fourth quarter has tremendous amount of sales upside if all that holds together.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Have you seen the department stores change any planning, any cancellations, things like that for the Holiday season, given the back-to-school trends?","Emanuel Chirico","We have not seen any cancellations in our business. We have -- I guess I have seen, in general, the promotional environment intensify. I don't know if I would describe it as a department store issue as much as a specialty store issue. And as -- I guess, as you would imagine, as inventories built up in July, I -- what I've heard in the market, although we haven't really experienced it in all businesses, some shipments have been delayed for some periods of time bringing goods in as they work through June and July inventory. But I think relatively speaking, I think the market is -- the inventory position doesn't trouble me at all in the market. The promotional environment does concern me. It seems like specialty has gotten very promotional. When I walk the mall and I see it, that does put pressure into the channel. And we'll see how that plays itself out as we go forward. I think it's become -- and particularly in that area, I think the tee market has become very promotional, which does put some pressure on our jeans business. Not so much in the more adult apparel, some of the -- our Izod, our Calvin and Tommy sportswear business, haven't really seen it there, but see more pressure in the jeans area.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And lastly, if I can ask about Tommy Hilfiger in South America. Can you give us a little bit color of where that business is, if some of the strength Calvin Klein has in Brazil, if there's been any work done yet working off of some of that strength? And what's assumed for Tommy in South America in that 3-year 8% to 10% growth goal you have for the overall brand?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. Look, South America for Tommy is about a $250 million business. It is a business that is totally licensed. We have a joint venture relationship with Inbrands, where we own about 40% of the business with Inbrands in Brazil for that market, which we think is a huge growth opportunity for Tommy. The Brazilian market is only about $25 million for Tommy compared to Calvin, which is well over $200 million. So clearly, we think it's a big opportunity. Brazil is a very tricky market from a supply point of view, bringing goods in; from a real estate point of view, developing it. There is no true department store in Brazil. It is a specialty store in a regular and a retail strategy. Our strategy with Tommy has been to partner there, and our strategy for Calvin -- the strategy for Calvin had been exactly the same, except they've got a much earlier start. They started as a distribution, then a joint venture, where Warnaco owned a percentage of the business. They took a larger percentage of the business 4 or 5 years ago, and then bought the entirety of the business about 18 months ago. So I think we see ourselves on the same kind of path with the Tommy Hilfiger business in Brazil as we go forward. But again, I don't envision any kind of a transaction for 3 to 4 years, where we might run that business in-house. Of course, with the relationship we have with Inbrands, what they bring to the table and the growth that, really, can come from the business. The rest of the South American market, it's about $200 million business. When you take it all in, South America and Latin, it's been growing at a double-digit rate overall. This year, some of the markets in South America had been more challenged: Venezuela, in particular; and Argentina as well, where Tommy has a major presence there. So this year, it's been a little softer there. But I think as we look out, we expect that market to grow in the 10-plus percent range overall. So a developing market for Tommy, with huge opportunity as we go forward, but I would describe it as more of a long-term opportunity.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Eric Beder with Brean Capital.","Eric M. Beder - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the Heritage businesses, what is happening with that? And how is your business doing at JCPenney, and how do you see that changing?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure, yes, there's really 2 stories. We got about -- We have a $600 million retail business, and a $2 billion -- $1.5 billion to $2 billion wholesale business which is performing very -- the wholesale business performing very well. Through these first 6 months of the year, operating margins above 12%, running ahead of plan. Strength in our dress shirts, in furnishings business, strong performance in our sportswear businesses. Speedo has been delightful to partner with us as well, as well as the Warner's Core Intimates business overall. We think the business overall, when you put the seasonality in, third quarter is just seasonally a weak quarter for some of the businesses. We're going to be in excess of 11% to 12% -- 11.5% operating margin overall for Heritage wholesale. So we're very happy with that business. The weak side of the business has been our Heritage retail -- has been our Heritage retail business, particularly the Bass footwear division, which is about 50% of that business. As I said, comps were minus 10%. We've seen an improvement in the overall comp store trend where we're down about low single-digits through the quarter-to-date for Heritage, and are looking for that trend to more or less continue into the third and fourth quarter as we go forward. So that is the area where we need to improve. Operating margins in this business are low single-digit. We're not happy with them. We recognize something needs to be done. We are looking at initiatives in that area as well, so it's an area that needs to really be focused on as we go forward.","Eric M. Beder - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","And in terms of JCPenney?","Emanuel Chirico","Oh sorry, I apologize. JCPenney business. Yes, we're happy with the business. It's on plan. The sportswear business in particular running way ahead, as you would expect, as Izod was a second-half launch last year. Our dress business is more or less on slightly off of plan, season-to-date, year-to-date, but we're starting to see some good results there as inventory starts to build back into the pipeline. I think that business will just continue to improve as we move through the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And as they fill that pipeline, particularly for the Holiday season as we set up. So we are optimistic about how that works. We are seeing a big improvement in our neckwear business, which we were able to react to the inventory demand much quicker, given the much shorter lead times in neckwear. That business is actually comping positive in that business. So overall, we are happy with all business at Penney's. I know they're looking for a significant turnaround in the third quarter. I think as the inventory levels get into position, as their product positioning gets -- and re-ticketing is fully in place and their messaging to consumer comes across, I think they're starting to see some improvement in the business. I'll let them speak about their own business but I could just say, from our point of view, we think they're making a lot of the right moves to drive that customer back to the store to really drive the inventories forward, which will really allow them to promote and deliver a value message back to the consumer. And I think it's the start of getting their business to start comping positive in the second half of the year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Howard Tubin with RBC Capital Markets.","Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just a quick question on -- just an update on your marketing plans in North America for the upcoming fall season, maybe for both brands, Tommy and Calvin Klein?","Emanuel Chirico","I think our plans are pretty much on -- consistent with what they've been in the last few years. We're not looking for a dramatic increase in spend overall for the year. But if you look at our marketing spend, it's been more intensified in the third quarter this year. First half, down slightly; fourth quarter down slightly, when you put -- when you take out the Warnaco noise of that fourth quarter. But third quarter, up pretty significantly. Again, I think it's just -- it coincides with some of the major launches we have going on and some of the launches we had going on last year, where fragrance was more first half-weighted last year. It's more second half-weighted this year. And last year, we had a major underwear spend in the fourth quarter around the Super Bowl, which we're not anticipating to repeat this year. So we've put that -- all that in. On the Calvin side, I think there hasn't been a dramatic change in the overall spend, but some of the quarters have really moved. On the Tommy side, it's kind of business as usual, a continuation of the focus on the brand and uplifting the brand both from a presentation point of view and a marketing spend there, and also from a print media spend as we go forward. You won't see television this year. I think the real focus will be on outdoor, in print and social media, both here and in Europe and in Asia, in particular, with the increased spend in China in particular as the Tommy brand continues to grow there very strongly.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","David Weiner. So 2 quick questions, if I could. One on -- in terms of your comp expectations for the quarter, can you talk a little bit about how much of that, either what you're seeing or what you expect for the quarter either being, you would attribute to AUR increases versus traffic, and if you can maybe differentiate a little bit between CK and Tommy, and North America and Europe? That would be helpful. And then, as a second question following on, on an earlier one from someone who asked about maybe consumers taking a breather here on apparel in favor of some other segments. I think one of the callouts from specialty, some specialty guys and even some department stores is that, there has been kind of a lack or a void of kind of more compelling fashion products for consumers: you had skinny, you had color, you had dresses over the last 2, 2.5 years. Do you have any thoughts on whether you're seeing that at all or any comments there would be helpful?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. On the first part, I guess, through the first 6 months of the year, from an AUR point of view, in North America, the Calvin -- in Calvin Klein, the AURs were up across the board, pretty healthily overall. The Tommy Hilfiger AURs were up slightly, not as much as the Calvin AURs. When you look at the mix of the business coming from there, it was a combination of AUR in North America and increased traffic overall as we went -- or conversion as we went on -- because traffic was actually down slightly and we have an increase in AUR in conversion in Calvin and Tommy North America. In Europe, AURs are down. I think it's -- and it's the pressure in the market. Some of the mix in the business with -- as you can imagine, in this kind of environment, our outlet stores were really posting very strong comp store increases, where our full priced business is up 1%, the outlet business is up even higher. So that has really shown that AURs, overall, will be -- are down slightly in Europe as well, and that also, is part of the gross margin discussion we had a little bit before this. As far as trends that are going on -- look, I think there were some -- it's like anything else, there was -- there's always some positive trend going on. Tommy was really able to take advantage of some of the real color stories that went on in the bottoms business and whatever. I think offsetting that is the denim business -- has solidified from where it was significantly weaker both in the macro environment in North America. Denim is not comping double-digit negatives anymore. In fact, it's probably flat now to slightly up, so that's not as much as a drain, and that's usually a margin builder for you as you go forward. Although there is fashion in the business, it's also a much more predictable business especially when you're on sales trends. So I think from that point of view, especially on the women's side, I don't think that there's anything exciting going on, directionally, from an apparel point of view. Where dresses were huge a couple -- 2 seasons ago and that helped drive the business and other categories. I think there's nothing that's dramatically different that's really changing anything there. So I don't think that there is excitement in the overall apparel area, and that's one of the problems that we're dealing with right now.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I know you got to go, so just a quick question, a follow-up on Dave's question. Can you take that AUR conversation in the IMU versus promo outlook into what your backlogs for the back half of this year and spring of next year? And I know AURs have generally been strong for the last couple of years; how does that look going forward in North America and Europe?","Emanuel Chirico","I think -- look, I think as you go into every season, I think that's always the challenge, is what the sell-throughs are going to be, what kind of AUR expansion, can you sell more goods at first and second markdowns than third markdowns? What I will say is there is no -- any significant ticket price increases going on. The cost environment is such that we're not seeing any real cost pressures coming from a sourcing point of view as we look into spring 2014. So there -- the pressure that existed, say, 2 years ago has continued from some point of view to move retail in order to drive AURs. That's behind us. So that's not there. But what you're always looking to do is to drive your AUR up by selling more -- the mix of business that you sell, manage your inventory flow-throughs, and as you go through. So that's always a big question. So as we look out, we are not anticipating a dramatic AUR expansion. In Calvin and Tommy, we're looking for 2% to 3% AUR expansion. And in our Heritage business, it's more like 1% to 2%. So the growth is going to be really unit-driven, as opposed to AUR-driven as we go forward. That seems to be the way most retailers are planning their business as they go forward.","Okay, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations and Ken Duane, our CEO of Heritage Brands and North American wholesale.","Looking our results for the quarter, although we came in-line -- we came in in-line with our earnings guidance for the first quarter, we were disappointed that we needed to lower our EPS guidance by $0.10 for the year. To be specific, the guidance take down is a reflection of the near terms sales and margin pressure in our North American businesses.","I strongly believe that our long term growth strategies for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses remain intact and that the planned strategic investments we are making in our Calvin Klein business will accelerate sales and earnings in the second half of 2014.","Let me get into each of our businesses by geographic region. In North America, our business in the first quarter was clearly negatively impacted by the unseasonably cold weather. As the weather improved in April, we saw an improvement in sales and store traffic trends.","Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses were on plan for the first quarter. In our retail business, the Tommy comps were up 2%, while Calvin Klein comps were flat to last year. Our wholesale businesses performed well and achieved plan, and delivered 2% to 4% sales increase for the quarter.","Our Heritage businesses struggled in the first quarter in North America. With retail comps down are disappointing 11% and our wholesale EDI replenishment businesses negatively impacted by weak store traffic trends at our key accounts.","We have seen our North America sales trends improve the second quarter across all of our businesses. Our retail comps at Calvin and Tommy are running up 2% to 3%, well, our Heritage comps have improved to minus low single digits. We are planning the second quarter to be promotional given the macro regional environment, and have lowered our second quarter margin expectations to reflect this.","Moving to Europe, our Tommy Hilfiger European business continued its strong performance with overall revenues up about 8%, driven by strong retail comps of plus 6%, as well as retail square footage growth.","Strong sales trends have continued into the second quarter with comps sales up mid-single digits. At wholesale our business came in on plan for the first quarter. We continue to plan our full holiday sale up about 5% based on our order books for the season.","Our early selling of the pre-spring season is indicating a continuation of these strong sales trends and could positively impact our fourth quarter sales plan. The Calvin Klein European business continues to be under pressure, particularly our jeans business. We are planning this business down low double digits for the first half of the year, as we eliminate off price sales and reposition the business for the new full jeans product launch in the second half of the year.","Moving to Asia, our Calvin Klein business continues its strong performance in the first quarter, posting a high single digit sales increase despite the lack of a Chinese New Year in the first quarter. This performance was driven by strong sales performance in our China and South East Asia businesses.","Sales trends in the second quarter in China and South East Asia have continued their strong performance. However our business in Korea has weakened driven by the ferry accident, which has significantly impacted the total consumer spending in Korea. We have seen this business improve over the last 10 days and are continuing to closely monitor the situation in Korea.","In Latin America, our business in Mexico and Brazil continue to post high single digit revenue increases in local currencies. We are planning this business to grow high single digits in local currency for the year. However for the second quarter, we are planning the business flat due to the World Cup Soccer tournament that is taking place in Brazil during the month of June.","We expect consumer spending to negatively impacted in that month, because of the tournament due to store closures that are in the matches that will occur in Brazil. Let me update you on some of the integration that\u2019s going on in the business. We continue to execute our plans and are on track with all our processes and system conversions.","Let me give you an update on some of the strategic investments we are making to build a solid foundation for our Calvin Klein Jeans and Underwear business into the future. These strategic investments fall into six board categories. On the people side we have filled all key positions across the Calvin Klein Jeans and Underwear global businesses. On the systems and infrastructure side, we have completed all system conversions in North America and Europe and over the last three months have successfully converted a number of systems in Asia. There have been no surprises in this area since the last time we updated you and we are very comfortable with our integration timetable.","Moving to the off price area, we are in the midst to significantly reducing our off price sales and warehouse club sales in North America and in Europe, to bring that overall jeans and underwear sales distribution in-line with a healthy mix of our other Calvin Klein businesses. We expect this process to continue through the end of this fiscal year.","We are also in the midst to upgrading quality and design of the Calvin Klein Jeans product. We should begin to see the benefits of these initiatives in the second half of this year with product hitting the stores in August and September. We are also elevating the presentation and point of sale marketing of the Calvin Klein Jeans and Underwear presentations at retail. This will be an ongoing process. Let me give you a few examples of our new shops of Calvin Klein.","In North America in the Jeans and Underwear area, we\u2019re touching over 200 doors throughout North America. We are specifically hitting Herald Square and Union Square in the Macy stores, the key Lord & Taylor flagship stores here in New York. And in Canada in Toronto at the Bay and some of the significance stores. Just to remind everyone, in jeans area in a number of the top doors and our key partners in North America, the Calvin Klein Jeans presentation was eliminated from the sales mix both in men's and women's jeans. That is in the process of being rectified as we go forward. You just start to see those new doors coming on board in the third and fourth quarter this year into the first and second quarter of 2015. We\u2019re spending in total in capital in new shop expenditures in Jeans and Underwear an access of $12 million. So clearly investment spending there in North America.","Moving to Europe, we\u2019re seeing across Europe new jeans presentations with some of the key retailer accounts, just a few examples, Harrods in London, a new men jeans shop will be opening there in the third quarter of this year. In Paris, at Galeries Lafayette in Printemps will be opening new jeans men\u2019s and women shops. Peek & Cloppenburg will be opening their flagship stores in Cologne and Vienna. And there will be various other key doors that we will be opening. We're clearly making significant investments there. And we continue to make investments in new shops and stores throughout Asia, in China with new stores opening and new concepts opening in Shanghai, as well as in Korea and in Hong Kong.","Finally, we\u2019re making investments as well in our e-commerce business at both Tommy and Calvin Klein in order to support the significant growth we are experiencing in these businesses for both brands. We continue to make these planned strategic investment in Calvin Klein in order to unlock the full potential of this business over the long term. As we have said, 2014 continues to represent a year of two stories. The first half is pressured by our strategic investments, while 2014 will be the first season we order product by our newly established design sourcing teams which will be presented in enhanced retail environments.","Despite the first half pressures, we feel we are well positioned with solid underline business fundamentals and have not changed our outlook for the second half of the year, where we expect second half earnings per share to grow 20% over the prior year. We believe that the strength of our global growth brands Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger and the strategic investments we are making today will allow us to drive ongoing earnings per share growth of 50% plus in 2015 and beyond. ","And with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Mike Shaffer to quantify some of the results for the first quarter and our guidance.","Mike Shaffer ","Thanks, Manny. The comments I\u2019m about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Revenues for the first quarter were $1.96 billion, a 4% increase over the prior year when excluding the Bass business, which was sold to G-III in Q4 of last year. Driving our revenue increase over the prior year was a 6% and 4% increase in our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses respectively. Our Heritage business revenues were down 2% excluding Bass for the quarter. ","Our earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.47, at the midpoint of our previous guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. While we were at the midpoint of our range, we were disappointed with the performance of our North America businesses which were negatively impacted by the environment and fell short on gross margin for the quarter. The earnings shortfall was predominantly in our moderate Heritage North America businesses. For the second quarter we are projecting earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.45, or an increase of 1% to 4% over the prior year, and revenues of about $2 billion, or an increase of 4% over the prior, year excluding Bass.","Or second quarter guidance reflects the continuation of a highly promotional environment in North America in most channels of distribution which will negatively impact our gross margin as our customers and competitors move through higher than planned inventories. Our second quarter EPS guidance reflects a take down from our initial plans. Additionally or second quarter comparison to the prior year is negatively impacted from the Calvin Klein investment spend and $10 million in additional marketing spend, always planned in the second quarter and for the full-year.","Or earnings per share for 2014 are now planned at $7.30 to $7.40, a $0.10 decline to our previous guidance. Our change in guidance is the result of the takedown in our first half EPS reflecting the difficult North America environment. Overall, our 2014 earnings continue to be negatively impacted by the incremental spending in the acquired Calvin jeans and underwear businesses. We have not reduced these investment plans from our initial budgets and will continue to make all the necessary investments to continue to grow these businesses for the future.","Our second half EPS estimates remain unchanged and reflect growth of approximately 20% over the prior year. This growth will be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter due in part to anniversarying swing on investments in the acquired Calvin Klein businesses. Our revenues for 2014 remain projected at about $8.5 billion or 5% increase over the prior year excluding Bass. Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein are planning to have revenue increases of 7% and 4% respectively. Our Heritage business revenues are planning to increase 4% excluding Bass. ","Our full-year operating margins will be down about 60 basis points versus the prior year, a 10 basis point decrease from our previous guidance resulting primarily from the first half North America gross margin pressure. Versus the prior year the 60 basis point decrease reflects an increase in gross margin that will be more than offset by an increase in SG&A expense, due in large part to the increased Calvin Klein investments. For the year, we are projecting our Heritage and Tommy Hilfiger businesses to have operating margins flat to the prior year. Calvin Klein operating margins will be about 14%. Finally debt pay down continues to be projected at about 400 million for the year. ","And with that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Bob Drbul from Nomura.","","Bob Drbul - Nomura","The first question that I have is around the back half outlook, and you are sort of reaffirmation on your beliefs of the growth, given some of the challenges of the business thus far, what gives you the confidence in the ability to sort of reaffirm what you think is going to happen in the second half and specifically the fourth quarter?","","Manny Chirico","I think, Bob, a couple of things. We are making these significant investments on the Calvin Klein side of the business. We have seen good order flow from our retail partners. We\u2019ve opened up in North America new doors, some of the top doors as I was mentioning in the jeans business and significantly adding square footage in North America. We\u2019re adding about -- on the men\u2019s side -- we have an increased plan for the second half of the year in square footage of over 50%. And most of that is in top doors. And on the women\u2019s side we\u2019re looking for an increase of about 35% from a square footage point of view. So that really positions us, I think well as we go forward getting repositioned back in these stores. I think it is an endorsement on the product itself that the retailers are getting behind it now. Clearly the consumers got to vote and we have to see those sell through. So that\u2019s in North America.","Europe, we have also seen our order book up double digits as we\u2019ve gone into back half of the year. That\u2019s being offset by the elimination of the off-price and warehouse club sales that we're going on, but clearly we\u2019re seeing doors opening there that we\u2019ve been before in new markets. The challenge there will be again the same thing, is positioning the goods, getting them in place. I think that\u2019s all in front of us, and then seeing how the goods sell through and transact as we go forward, that\u2019s the open issue as we go forward, how we perform at retail in Europe specifically in our own stores and as the department store level. So we feel positive about that.","We have the orders in hand to do the business we feel and then obviously in jeans and underwear, there's a big reward of the EDI business that goes on. We need the sales flow through to follow that, but based on planning and where we are and working closely with our retail partners, we feel that\u2019s all in place as we go forward. I\u2019d also say -- last thing I\u2019d say is as we work our way through this second quarter, the comparisons are much tougher for us first half of the year versus second half of the year and I think you see that throughout all retail as we go forward. So clearly I think there is opportunity in the second half of to outperform both our Calvin and Tommy businesses as well as our Heritage businesses. So getting paid back to the investors we are making today, getting paid back for the additional marketing and presentation we\u2019re putting in and getting paid for the new product; that gives me confidence as we forward and now we have to earn that as those goods hit and sell through.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","And then the second question I have is just the promotional environment currently, first quarter, second quarter, how much of it is wholesale promotional concerns versus your own retail business in terms of the promotional cadence?","Manny Chirico","I think it\u2019s two things, Bob. I think if you take -- if you view the business comparably and I think that\u2019s really have to do, comparably to where it was last year; last year\u2019s first quarter, from a weather point of view, from a business point of view was very, very strong. And as everyone came in including us, came out of the first quarter into the second quarter, everyone was chasing inventory. We\u2019d have to outperform sales across the board. There was less clearance pressure, less promotional pressure. What we\u2019re seeing now is across the mall, particularly in the middle of the mall with specialty retail we are seeing in each as sales were being missed on a macro level in January February March, despite a strong April that didn\u2019t make up for some of the sales misses that took place in the beginning part of that -- first three months of the calendar year and I think in general, inventories are heavier than they need to be and there is more promotion going on. So we are seeing a higher promotional volume at the outlet stores here in North America and the regular price stores internationally and we\u2019re also seeing at the department store level prices -- AURs that are lower than this time last year, anywhere from 3% to 5%.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll hear from Michael Benetti from UBS.","Michael Benetti - UBS","So just to get one thing out as far as our modeling goes and thinking about the cadence in the quarter since you guys are so helpful with how you\u2019re planning it, I think there's a lot of pressure on to hit the guidance for the year. In the fourth quarter you\u2019ve mentioned that well over 20% but I think there is some noise in there related to the way you guided taxes and interest and the interest expense benefits. So just to avoid a boogieman, can you help us think about the growth rate that\u2019s implied in the back half for the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, given those two there variables?","Manny Chirico","Sure. So I guess just to say, the growth rate for the third quarter, we\u2019ve talked about on EPS was about -- is mid-single digits which -- and then of course for the second half of the year 20% total. So that is the plan. To get there taxes and interest do play a part. Our tax rate benefit for the year is greatest in the fourth quarter and then secondarily in the third quarter. So those are two quarters with the biggest benefit in taxes and interest because the deal was done to refinance in the first quarter, pretty flat second, third, and fourth quarter.","Michael Benetti - UBS","And then Manny, could you talk to us a little bit about -- as you look at -- you\u2019ve taken down your assumptions for second quarter based on promotionality in that -- how are you thinking about promotionality in North American in the second half as you set the guidance maybe relative to what you\u2019re thinking for the second quarter that you just hear about?","Manny Chirico","We\u2019re looking for a more -- a less promotional environment that we've seen in the second quarter, that we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year of this year. I think a couple of reasons, I think is -- on a comparative basis, last year\u2019s third and fourth quarter were more promotional than last year\u2019s first and second quarter, in general, as you look at what transpired particularly in the fourth quarter. So I feel there is more opportunity in the third and fourth quarter from a margin point of view to outperform we were last year than there was in the first half of the year. And then secondarily, looking at the plans that are out there, I think everyone is really focused on executing to get inventory levels down in the second quarter and position themselves back to school. So all of our key retail accounts are moving through goods with a strong incentive beginning of month August to be in a position that inventories are clean and moving forward have an appropriate level of clearance but not to be overly, overly weighted in that area. So, I think the plans are all in place. We know we are moving aggressively to do that in our second quarter and I think the industry in general is doing it.","Michael Benetti - UBS","","Okay. And then just if I could follow-up, one last modeling question as you look at second half guidance. Can you help us think about what type of comp sales and replenishment trends are you implying there, since it\u2019s such a big variable? Thank you.","Manny Chirico","","Well I guess in the second half of the year, we are looking for comps in general to run -- in North America we're looking for comps in our own retail somewhere in the 2% to 3% range. We're looking for Europe comps in our Calvin business to be up somewhere around low to mid-single digits. And we are looking for the Tommy business in Europe to be up about mid-single digits. That\u2019s pretty consistent. All of that is pretty consistent with where the trends are today, with the exception of the Calvin Klein Europe business, which has been playing down now low double-digits. But I think that we are really looking for the third quarter to be an inflection point, new product, new presentation up against soft results from last year that we should start to see a better comp performance in our Calvin Klein Europe business with all the initiatives that are in place.","Operator","","And we will take our next question from Christian Buss from Credit Suisse. Christian are you there? Okay, we will go to...","Christian Buss - Credit Suisse","","Yes, sorry about that. I was wondering if you can provide some color on the cadence of new product introductions in the Jeans wear and Underwear business. And also where we should expect to see the store environments change first?","Manny Chirico","Well I think the store environments will be changing throughout third and fourth quarter. You will see it in Europe, particularly Northern and Central Europe, you will see in third quarter and throughout the UK, Paris and Germany, big markets to give you a sense and I mentioned some of those key retailers. Here in North America, it\u2019s an ongoing process, third and fourth quarter but I think that you should start to see -- at September 1st, you should really be in a position if you went to Herald Square, if you went to Union Square, if you went to some of the big doors, you should see some significant improvement in the jeans presentation in those departments, as well as in the underwear presentation in those stores as well. So I will be ongoing but I think it clearly will be visible to you as you visit those doors going forward.","And from a product point of view, some of the new product launches, underwear there will be some key launches both on the women side, on the broad side of the business with key marketing campaigns, third quarter supported by some significant marketing, and on the men\u2019s side as well. So we've got some real initiatives going forward that we haven\u2019t totally made public yet from a marketing point of view. So there will be more about that but be assured there will be significant marketing supporting the launch here in North America, Europe and in Asia.","Operator","","And next we will hear from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","","Manny, I was hoping you could just follow-up a little bit more on the Calvin Klein Europe side of the business. As you talk about trends kind of being down double-digits in the first half and then starting to improve as we get into the second half, first question where should we start to see that off price product levels start to be closer to where you need them to be? And then as we think about just kind of longer-term, I think on the last call you talked about the brand, it\u2019s kind of reaccelerating back to that high single-digits range beyond this year. Is that still how we should be think about Calvin?","Manny Chirico","","Let me start with the first point. I think from the elimination of the off-pricing in Europe, I think that it should become almost invisible by the end of third quarter that you will see in market. And I think you might see some product of CK MAX but besides that it should be much cleaner, significantly cleaner than it\u2019s been. And more importantly, I think you will start to see more of a presence particularly in Northern and Central Europe of regular priced Calvin business in some of the key department stores that I laid out before. On the second part of your question.","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","","Just on the overall Calvin Klein brand, I think you have talked about it being closer to high-single digit grower over time. Should we still think about that for beyond this year?","Manny Chirico","","Yes, I think these key product investments that we're making -- I think what will be critical for us is that we really feel that there is significant growth in the Jeans business here in North America and in Europe as we get to a more healthy base as we go forward. I think that will continue to drive growth. We won't have the burden of cleaning up as we did this year, cleaning up the off-price sales that we had carry over. So as that gets cleaned up, we wouldn\u2019t have that in the base and that\u2019s worth 200 to 300 basis points by itself.","So I think clearly not having that headwind in front of us, we\u2019ll start to see -- will get us much closer to high single digit kind of a growth rate and if we can get some momentum in the European business to along with the momentum we see in Asia and Latin America, I think that\u2019s when that we could really start to get closer to that double digit kind of growth again.","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then just the last question from me, just sticking on kind of the European theme, could you just speak to how you are viewing the European consumer currently as we kind of get out of the spring and into the falls season? And then just any other context on regional performance within Europe would be really helpful?","Manny Chirico","Sure I think the story continues. The one market that we have not seen any significant improvement in is the Italian market. It continues to be a challenging market. It continues to be a market, as you know -- it is a market that is dominated by specialty stores as opposed to launch department stores. So there is clearly pressure in the -- a credit point of view to continue to sell into that channel, worrying about getting paid. So that puts some pressure on as well. And then the issues that are going all over the consumer in general. We are seeing Spain -- for the Tommy Hilfiger business this is the first season we\u2019re actually seeing some growth off of a base where we\u2019ve gone through now 3.5 years of contraction in that market. So we think that market is leveling off.","And then our Tommy business, as you can just see from the results up 8% for the quarter in Europe, that\u2019s really being driven by Central Northern Europe, the UK business as well, continuing to grow that business both from a retail point of view, square footage growth but also wholesale bookings and I mentioned the bookings that seem to be trending again as we go into Spring \u201915 in a more positive way and consistent to what we\u2019re seeing in fall. I'd say only other the only other risk out there and we included in Europe is the Russian market. With what's gone on in the Ukraine, we don\u2019t have a big business in the Ukraine and Crimea area but we have a big business in Moscow and that whole territory, Eastern Europe there. And that business for the last month and a half has been under more pressure. We\u2019ve seen it level off as the crisis -- and the heightened nature of the crisis has also leveled off. But it\u2019s an area that we've watching very closely and we have a big business there with both Tommy and Calvin Klein and that business is very profitable for us. So we\u2019re watching it very closely.","Operator","And our next question comes from Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","You guys talked a lot about the new product, the new presentation for Calvin Klein going into this fall. Can you maybe elaborate on it little bit, what\u2019s new, what\u2019s new about the product, what\u2019s new about the presentation. I know you're going to do some more marketing spend. Is it different styling? Is it different quality? What\u2019s the presentation going to look like versus what it used to look like? Maybe just help articulate some of the things that we could expect to see in the stores this fall?","Manny Chirico","Okay. Omar, on jeans side it\u2019s in Europe and in North America. It\u2019s a complete region. It is completely different sourcing base. It is designed -- instead of being designed by central design group in North America we\u2019ve gone through a regional approach for Europe, Asia and North America. We think that\u2019s more appropriate and with the centralized control the key items and as we go forward we believe that\u2019s significant. There's been an upgrade in peace goods, there has been an upgrade in make. We believe that the design aesthetic is more in tune with the Calvin Klein consumer. It\u2019s a more modern shape, it\u2019s a more modern styling.","So, on the Jeans side it\u2019s a complete makeover; new packaging, hangtags, branding on product that we think is enhancing for the presentation and will warrant higher price position that the brand warrants and we talked is how challenged particularly in North America the Jeans business has been from an average unit retail point of view. We\u2019re just looking to get back it\u2019s where the brand historically has transacted and I think we have done that from a design point of view and now the consumer has got a vote to see how that\u2019s being presented.","So from that point of view on the Jeans side it\u2019s been a total remake. On the underwear side of the business it\u2019s been -- it's always been a successful business. The big improvement that we\u2019ve done is retail [ph] packaging has significant cheapened and the presentation was significantly cheap and that\u2019s where we\u2019re making the investments on the Calvin Klein Underwear business, really going after the business in a big way. You could see that from Macy's Herald Square, new shop, men's shop, 2,400 square feet. On the Calvin Klein women\u2019s intimates business, the big focus for us a bra business. We\u2019ve always been a major player in the bottoms, panties business. And we believe there has been a lack of investment in the actual technical designs of product that is not needed; as universal as it should be to fit all women. So we\u2019re re-launching Perfectly Fit for the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. That will be a big initiative for us as we go forward. That\u2019s been a successful product category and I think with the packaging, with the point of sale presentation that we have there, I think it\u2019s very significant.","Just to reiterate, we will be spending in the third and fourth quarter of this year in excess of $12 million in North America on shop presentations for jeans, underwear, our men's sportswear business. We will also be spending about $5 million to $6 million in Europe in capital expenditure in presentation in our own stores as well as in our partners' stores in key accounts. So that\u2019s -- its night and day from what it was and we believe that\u2019s going to really drive the business back and get the Calvin Klein brand repositioned in designer jeans back to where Heritage has been as a brand that started designer jeans around world. So I think we\u2019re highly confident of our initiatives and where we\u2019re here in North America and as we\u2019ve discussed, Europe is just more of a challenge because of the brand positioning there and what needs to happen and how far we need to move the brand. But we\u2019re making all the right moves and all the right investments from a long-term goal to the Calvin Klein business there.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","And Manny marketing spend, incremental marketing spend to get the word out to let consumers know that -- come back to Calvin Klein, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s new, it\u2019s kind of back to where it should be. Is there that kind of spend lined up to support those?","Manny Chirico","Yes. So we spend every year -- it\u2019s never been an issue about not spending marketing money because thankfully especially on the jeans side that was a contractual requirement that Warnaco had to spend in jeans. So that spend is continuing. We believe now it\u2019s more focused, more brand right and it\u2019s also coupled with retail presentation. So it\u2019s great to marketing the brand, but if you don\u2019t have, if you\u2019re not presented well and if you\u2019re not presented in an appropriate environment of retail, the marketing by itself is not going to drive it. So we think to a great extent the investments we\u2019re making are point of sales and capital and marketing at point of sale are as important as our marketing campaigns.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","One last question, that\u2019s really helpful Manny. On the digital side, on the e-commerce side -- it\u2019s not as big a percentage of your business as maybe some of the peers out there, where there is a traffic issue going on in retail generally because the rise of e-commerce. Can you just give us an update? You've got a lot of balls in the air especially around Calvin Klein but an update on how you are strategically thinking about really entering the digital side of the business in a much more material and significant and focused way?","Manny Chirico","","Sure, I think there are two stories. I think the Tommy Hilfiger business which is about $85 million business today and profitable has been a business that\u2019s been growing 20% to whatever is high double-digits. That\u2019s been a business that with the control of the brand, we have been able to make the investments and pull the goods together and make a real statement about the brand and the product and transact well there. And the focus has been Europe and North America.","On the Calvin Klein brand, being a -- us running a licensing model, it was very difficult for us to really pull together an economic model that worked. We had a significant brand statement on the internet and we had a $20 million business that transacted and lost a couple of million dollars. But now that we have control all over jeans and underwear and a much bigger control over sportswear, we\u2019re able to -- going forward we\u2019re able to make a much more solidified cohesive message going forward. And we\u2019re making investments. We\u2019ll be launching calvinklein.com to sell and transact the commerce side in Europe. We\u2019ll be launching throughout Asia in the second half of 2014 into 2015 and we\u2019ll be also launching in Brazil a site for spring 2015.","So a significant amount of investment going on with -- the technical capabilities are there. We\u2019re investing in the brand site at itself as we go forward. That\u2019s all built into our numbers. And we think it\u2019s an opportunity for us as we go forward to grow all direct to consumer business with Calvin Klein. We have a very big third party ecommerce business with our partners where we are significantly penetrated at Macy\u2019s and our partners throughout Europe and Asia. We have a significant business with some of the pure play retailers as well. So we know there is demand for the product and now that we have control of it, I think we\u2019ll be able to, given our retail presence in all of those markets, we'll be able to really take advantage of the e-commerce opportunities there as well for us as we go forward.","Operator","And our next question will come from John Kernan from Cowen & Company.","John Kernan - Cowen & Company","","Just can you quantify the investments made specifically around Calvin Klein jeans and underwear on the SG&A side of things that you expect to roll off next year. And then Mike with CapEx right around $300 million, how sustainable is that? Do you need to push CapEx higher given some of the expansion of e-commerce and a greater push internationally?","Manny Chirico","Mike will touch CapEx first. ","Mike Shaffer","Yes, $300 million this year, I do think we'll see a decline in that as we move forward. I think somewhere close to the $270 million to $275 million would be the number as we go forward. Part of this year does include some one-time investment spend, particularly for infrastructure.","Manny Chirico","Okay, just from an investment point of view, we have talked about $55 million to $60 million in strategic investment spending in those areas that I laid out, combination of spending and elimination off-price sales at profitable margins and overall profitability to be somewhere in that $55 million to $60 million range. Being spread over the second half of last year into the -- through the first two or three quarters of this year; those expenses don\u2019t go away but they need to invest at that level above our normal growth rates. That\u2019s what falls off. So we\u2019re up against $30 million or so this year of spend associated with the investment spending that\u2019s going on with Calvin Klein. Principally in the first two quarters of this year, a little bit in last quarter but principally in the first two quarters of this year. And we were up against that with the second half of last year to the tune of about $20 million to $25 million in the third and more significantly in the fourth quarter of last year.","John Kernan - Cowen & Company","Okay that\u2019s super helpful. Just one final question. Can you talk about some of the opportunities you have in emerging markets to bring back some of your joint ventures and licenses internationally?","Manny Chirico","Sure, I think as, I guess the opportunity to bring back licenses in categories long-term is the -- our Tommy Hilfiger business in Asia is principally a licensed model. It's about a $550 million business today. Some of that business in China, where are a joint-venture partner, where we own about 45%. There is opportunity over the next two to three years if we can make economics work that we would, potentially could bring that back in-house.","In the similar way, the Korea business and the rest of south-east, Central Asia there's two license agreements that have varying terms between three and five years to go on those license agreements -- that clearly as the Calvin Klein businesses in those markets are fully integrated and established, give us the opportunity to potentially bring those businesses in-house and operate them directly ourselves.","Moving to Latin America, there\u2019s a developing business for Tommy in Brazil today that\u2019s going very fast, but it\u2019s basically $35 million - $40 million in this year. That business, we believe the potential to be between $100 million to $150 million over the next three to four years, three to five years; and I think that\u2019s an opportunity given the strength of our Calvin Klein business in Brazil and as we look at that business developing overtime, again we have the option to bring that business in-house, four years from now, if it makes sense and we can make economics work.","And similar story, in Mexico as well, we have a very healthy Tommy Hilfiger business. It\u2019s a $150 million in those markets. We have a Calvin business that we operate directly ourselves. Finding the right business model there, which might be a combination of both, could really work well for us as we go forward. So we\u2019re looking at that as well.","When you look at product categories then on the Calvin side in North America, the tailored clothing area is an area that we think is a natural fit for us, given our strength in the dress furnishings business with neckwear and dress shirts, and then secondarily the whole women opportunity that G-III does just a fantastic job in operating and has grown the business so well, and now I'm really talking long-term. Clearly that\u2019s a license that\u2019s 9 to 10 years today, but as that business comes forward, we are trying to work out a business model that maybe is more -- the we\u2019re more directly involved and something we'll be looking to do. So those are broad strokes, some of the big opportunities that aren\u2019t necessarily factored into our growth strategies.","Operator","Next we will hear from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","As you think about the CK transformation and what\u2019s happening with the gross margin pressure in North America, looking out towards the fourth quarter and into 2015; can you parse together as you think of the gross margin pressure and the changes that you see will happen, does inventory come down, does product improve, and how do you see that with the CK business in Europe? Is it more promotional there, do you see pricing improving?","Manny Chirico","Okay, so I guess, when you said fourth-quarter \u201915, you meant 2014.","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Exactly.","Manny Chirico","So, look I think just a couple of things. I think we are -- in North America, the Calvin Klein business with the exception of jeans, is very healthy. Our margins there are under the least amount of pressure overall than we\u2019re seeing. And I think as we move forward, the new product initiatives, what -- we were up again significant liquidation sales last year. I think there is a real margin opportunity for us in the fourth quarter of 2014 as we go forward in North America.","I think in general I think last year\u2019s fourth quarter, once we got past Thanksgiving last year, it got significantly promotional. The tighter calendar, we talked about less days last year. I don\u2019t want to go back and rehash all that. The very challenging January that really occurred I think -- I don\u2019t anticipate that repeating itself and that\u2019s not built into our numbers, that that type of pressure would repeat itself. So I think relatively speaking from a comparative point of view first half, second half; the second half comparisons are much easier as we start to cycle those going forward, particularly in North America.","In Europe again, the Tommy business we\u2019ve not seen any significant margin pressure there at all. That business is very healthy, continues to perform very well and I would expect that only to continue into the second half of the year. Talking specifically about Calvin Klein, we\u2019re looking for some significant margin improvement in the third and fourth quarter, principally because we were in liquidation mode all of last year. So sales were under pressure last year throughout. We were liquidating goods. We weren\u2019t happy with the product quality. We do have the right presentation. So I think there on a specific basis for us, we clearly think that there is margin opportunity as we go forward.","I think that they will be naturally some level of promotion in the market but I think for us it\u2019s about first getting some regular price selling that we didn\u2019t almost have at all when it came to the jean side of the business. So there's a big margin opportunity for us in the third and fourth quarters that we need to capitalize on.","Operator","Our next question is from Joan Payson from Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays","In terms of the Calvin Klein distribution rationalizations and I think you started touching on this in terms of Europe. But with regard to the off price versus full price mix in North America, what do you think that could be at the end of this year? And then in terms of the European business, which has always been more heavily focused on the southern regions, what do you think the northern versus southern side could be pro forma?","Manny Chirico","Just a -- could you repeat that? You broke up on this side. Could you just repeat the last part of the question about northern - southern? I didn\u2019t hear it.","Joan Payson - Barclays","Just in terms of pro forma for the distribution closures, what do you think the northern versus southern mix could be in Europe?","Manny Chirico","Okay, sure. Let me start with North America. I think in North American there's always a healthy mix of off price to regular price selling. You need to clean goods. The T.J. Maxx channel is a natural channel to do that. You could do it in an appropriate way and limit the distribution. It could both be profitable selling and then it could be -- it\u2019s not brand denigrating in any way. And we feel by the end of this fiscal year we\u2019ll have that balance from a dollars\u2019 point of view in the off price channel where we wanted to be both in jeans and underwear. And as we\u2019re growing the regular price business in North America, that percentage should come in line over the next year or two as we go forward.","But I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the Calvin business, relatively speaking is so clean -- it's distribution in other product categories, sportswear, if you move into the women\u2019s side of the house, our accessory -- that distribution is so clean, when you look on the balance, we're not overly distributed from a brand point of view in the off price channel with this. There's just too much jeans and underwear in that channel that needed to be cleaned up. So I think what once we get through this fiscal year, we feel perfectly positioned as we go forward.","Moving to Europe, I think what you have to keep in mind is the jeans business was principally focused on Southern European distribution, at least on a regular price point of view. It was very difficult to find prior to 2014 quality jeans distribution in Germany, Central Europe, France, the UK. That\u2019s where the major cleanup is going and where it is. We\u2019ve always had good jeans penetration in Spain and we had a big business in Italy but it was -- the Italian business was much too much in the off price channel and significantly discounted and that is the channel that is going to be the biggest challenge for us. That market will be the biggest challenge because one it\u2019s obvious market and two it\u2019s the market that\u2019s feeling the most pressure economically and that continues and that consumer is under the more pressure.","So we\u2019re very focused on that. We're focused much more in the Italian market on opening price point jeans there. We will be more promotional in our own stores in the Italian market just because we had to be, given our size and where we are. So again, we\u2019re trying to manage that upgrading, but it will be less promotional than it has been, it will be cleaner than it has been but we\u2019re not going to be able to just to turn the spigot it off completely in the Italian market.","Joan Payson - Barclays","Okay, great, and then just in terms of your gross margin expectations for the year, if you could provide some additional color just in terms of I guess what the contribution could be from the retail and international expansion, compared to the negative impact from promotional activity?","Manny Chirico","Okay just two things I want to clear. Again, we\u2019ll talk about gross margins. We are going to see gross margin, gross margin improvement going forward and that\u2019s excellent. But I guess I just want to reiterate a couple of things. The off-price sales, because they were done under the Calvin Klein label, which is of the quality that is, selling internet channel distribution with planned sales was a very profitable transaction for Warnaco. It wasn\u2019t brand enhancing but it was very profitable. So making 30% margins which were lower than what the overall brand does, but with almost no incremental expenses was a very [indiscernible]. On a gross margin basis, eliminating these sales will be enhancing to our gross margin, but will not be enhancing from a profitability point of view since there were so few expenses that along with that sales transaction. So Mike will give you some of the guidance specifically for gross margin.","Mike Shaffer","Joan, we\u2019ve talked about the gross margin expansion, about 70 bps of improvement for the year. We\u2019ve talked about a couple of things. One, as I mentioned before, we are doing less promotion which helping our margin. The mix of businesses is a big factor, selling VAS is a factor, growth on the international markets where we operate with higher gross is a factor. So all that comes together and for the year we\u2019re still not finding about 70 bps improvement.","Operator","And our next question will come from Eric Beder from Brean Capital.","Eric Beder - Brean Capital","Could you tell us a little bit about J.C. Penny and what you\u2019re seeing at the J.C. Penny stores? And in terms of -- let\u2019s do J. C. Penny first.","Manny Chirico","Okay, I guess on the Penny side, it feels pretty good. Again, sales trends have been positive. You see, I'll let them speak for their own comps, but our business there has been very solid, both the dress furnishings business and our Van Heusen and IZOD sportswear businesses have been very strong as has our Warner bra business as well. So we\u2019re very happy with how J.C. Penny is performing in the mid-channel for us. And we haven\u2019t -- those trends have continued into the second quarter for us. So we\u2019re feeling good about that","Eric Beder - Brean Capital","And how are you feeling about the Kohl's expansion with IZOD and how does that look for you?","Manny Chirico","We\u2019re very excited about that. That\u2019s going to be a big launch for us. We really start to shift that very late second quarter, but mostly third and fourth quarter. It is a major growth initiative for us. There will be a significant marketing spend that will go along with that that Kohl's is making a significant contribution for. We also have a significant shop presentation spend there. So the brand will be presented in an excellent way going forward. You should start to really see that, I would think in probably September 1st to September 15th, you\u2019ll really start to see the IZOD presence in men's', in kids, in Calvin clothing and dress furnishings in that store. So I think we\u2019re very much excited about that. They are excited about getting some of the national brands that they are launching in the second half of the year and IZOD is clearly on the men's' side the big launch for that.","Operator, we\u2019re going to take two more questions and then call it. It\u2019s about 10 o\u2019clock right now.","Operator","Okay, great. We will take our next question from Howard Tubin from RBC Capital Markets.","Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets","Assuming 3-Q works out the way you expect it to, how should we think about kind of total inventory growth going into 3Q and ending the year?","Mike Shaffer","Look, I think as we get through the third quarter, we\u2019ll see our inventories get more towards flat and then we\u2019ll see normal growth as we get into the fourth. As we end the year we\u2019ll start to see more normal growth reflected with sales. At the end of the second quarter, our inventories are up about 3.5% to 4%. Our sales are planned up 1%. As Manny said earlier, inventories are a point or so high. I guess I would say that the inventory composition is heavily basic weighted, the piece that\u2019s a bit of a -- the overage piece is heavily in basics and we really don\u2019t see much exposure. And it\u2019s going to take some time to work that down throughout the year, but it\u2019s really not a financial exposure for us at this point.","Manny Chirico","Also we\u2019re -- we are building our inventories to begin the shipping of IZOD, which was shipped early third quarter. So that\u2019s hitting our warehouses in June and July. That\u2019s set up as we go forward. So I think that build up and that fixture fill that goes on is also reflected in there. So the quality of our inventory will down -- will be pretty strong by the end of the third quarter and then by year-end I think you\u2019ll see it back to normal levels.","Operator","And our last question will come from David Weiner from Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank","","Dave Weiner from Deutsche Bank. So I just had two questions to end things here. The first, Manny, you were talking about AUR increases in the jeans, in the CK Jeans business earlier in the call. Can you just remind us in North America and Europe where those are and where you'd like them to go? And then my second question would be and I don\u2019t know if I missed this earlier but can you give some kind of quantification of the early interest you are seeing in Europe and North America on your redesigned CK jeans product? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Sure, okay. So on AURs, I don\u2019t think I mentioned on this call before but we've talked it, is the jeans in North America going for seasonal basis all in t-shirts, jeans going out at $25. The right number for the positioning of the Calvin Klein brand with markdowns and clear should be closer to $40. Our men\u2019s sportswear is $45 to $47.","To put it in perspective, jeans by its nature with the big t-shirt business is going to be lower than sportswear and that includes all the markdowns and clearance that\u2019s appropriate for the business. So for us it\u2019s moving at $25 to that $40 mark and our financial plan calls for that to happen over a three year period. Starting in the fall season we should see a 10% to 12% improvement in AURs. We're hoping that closer to $30 as we go forward and then moving that up over the next two years, going to $35 and then $40.","So I think we're doing it in the smart way and we'd like it to happen quicker but I think you also have to recognize that the consumer has been trained at this and you can\u2019t go overnight and take out the needle, particularly here in North America with some of the promotions that have gone on. Hopefully we could outperform that. But it clearly gives you a sense of how underperforming the jeans business was from a margin point of view.","Since the bottoms are ticketed 59%, 69%, 79% or 80% of the bottoms businesses are at that point and 20% or little bit higher than that. So it just gives you a sense of the kind of pressure that the jeans business has been on. I think a lot of that just has to do with product and presentation.","In Europe, directionally it\u2019s a very similar story. The price positioning in Calvin Klein Jeans should be closer to EUR80 in Europe and we have been going out closer to EUR45 in Europe when you factor in t-shirts and everything that goes with it. So it\u2019s a similar opportunity. We think in some of the markets that the brand hasn\u2019t had significant distribution in Northern Europe, Germany, France, the UK and so basically Central Europe, that there's an opportunity to move the out the door retails quicker and that will be more challenging to do in Southern Europe in the Italian market and the Spanish market. So, those two markets will be more of a challenge for us to move it. So we factored all that into our business plans we've gone forward to really work that through.","But again over a three year period, we want to move those out the door retails to where we believe it\u2019s appropriately targeted. We have a Tommy Hilfiger denim product is executing now at the door is a good benchmark for us as we go forward. So, it\u2019s clearly where the brand should be positioned and how we should go forward. As far as some of the doors, I really spoke about that in detail and where we're seeing some of these increases but I think the biggest endorsement here in North America is the new doors and our key retail partners opening up new shops in top 100 doors in the U.S. over the next few years. And they believe in the brand. The brand performs in every other product category, men\u2019s sportswear, women\u2019s sportswear, accessories, tailored clothing, dress shirts, across the board and clearly believe that jeans should be a significant opportunity for the brand, since it's its heritage. So, that\u2019s probably the biggest endorsement we have from a distribution point of view and what we've been able to secure for ourselves in the third and fourth quarter of this year.","Okay. Listen, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us on the call and we look forward to updating you again in September on our second quarter results. Everyone have a good day and speak to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s call.

With me this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, as well as Ken Duane, who runs our wholesale businesses throughout the United States.","We are very pleased with our first-quarter results which exceeded our expectations despite the challenging global environment and the difficult retail market in the US. Overall we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 3% on a constant currency basis while earnings per share grew 33% on a constant currency basis.","The momentum in the quarter was primarily led by the strength of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger international businesses. Our European and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets while Hong Kong and Brazil are under pressure.","From a macro perspective, the US market continues to be the most difficult and volatile market we operate in. Despite that, our US wholesale businesses are running ahead of plan and the prior year actual results. However, our US retail businesses are seeing weaker traffic and higher promotional trends.","Overall international tourist traffic and spending continues to weigh on our US retail business and we are experiencing a deceleration in sales trends in the US especially after the early Easter.","Our digital commerce businesses saw revenue growth in excess of 20% for the quarter and this channel continues to be our fastest-growing distribution channel.","Given our overall strong first-quarter financial performance and the momentum we see in our international businesses, we are pleased that we were able to raise our full-year earnings guidance and significantly increase the bottom end of our earnings forecast.","Let me move into each of our individual brands, moving to Tommy Hilfiger. Overall revenue increased 4% on a constant currency basis and EBIT was up 20% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our Tommy international business which was up 11%.","We saw solid performance in all major European markets demonstrated by our 8% increase in comp store sales for our retail business with particular strength in the UK, Germany and Central European markets. Comp trends in the second quarter have continued to be strong, running up high single digits.","Moving to wholesale, the Hilfiger brand continues to resonate with the European consumer and we are seeing growth in our fall 2016 order book which is now up 6% versus our previous indication of plus 4%.","Growth in the order book was generated across all product categories and strong growth is coming out of markets like the UK, Germany, Scandinavia, Spain and even Italy which we have not seen in many seasons.","Our Tommy Hilfiger China acquisition which closed in mid-April had a minimal impact on the first quarter. This business continues to demonstrate strong results and is tracking to our plan which will be slightly accretive to our earnings this year.","As we have said before, we will be deploying more marketing spend into this business particularly in the second half of the year which we believe will help set the foundation with sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond.","Moving to North America, our US retail business continues to be under pressure driven by the weakness in traffic and consumer spending. Comp store sales declined 10% in the first quarter and we have not seen any improvement in second-quarter sales trends and we are not forecasting for this trend to improve for the balance of the year.","Moving to wholesale, I am pleased to say that our Tommy men's wholesale business has performed very well in the first quarter highlighting the design improvements and product quality enhancements we have made to the men's line.","We are posting positive retail sales results, strong sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. We are seeing this performance continue into the second quarter of the year for wholesale and are excited about the development there.","I want to comment also on some recent news around the Hilfiger brand. From a brand perspective, we continue to be focused on driving brand relevancy and consumer engagement. We are leveraging our Rafael Nadal relationship which began with Rafa as our brand ambassador for Tommy underwear and is now expanding to our tailored clothing business.","In conjunction with the French Open, we just hosted a great event in Paris with Rafa for TH flex suits, which are performing very well at retail.","In September, we will launch our Gigi Hadid capsule collection with to wide reaching e-commerce players, Amazon and REVOLVE. In addition, we will be offering the product in our Tommy Hilfiger stores and other key wholesale accounts around the world.","This underscores the focus we are placing on our women's business for fall 2016 and beyond. We believe that we have a significant future global growth opportunity in women's and we are beginning to see positive momentum in this business.","We will also introduce a Tommy jeans capsule collection in the US which will hit Urban Outfitters stores in August. This exciting partnership will allow us to further tap into a younger consumer base which is critical for the brand. This jeans capsule collection has already been a huge success for us throughout Europe and we look forward to leveraging this opportunity in the North America market.","Last week we also announced that we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture in Mexico with Grupo Axo, a long-term licensing of the Tommy Hilfiger brand in Mexico. This is an important strategic development for the business as it allows us to maintain a direct ownership interest in our Calvin Klein and Heritage businesses in Mexico while gaining control over our Tommy Hilfiger business in that region as well.","Grupo Axo's Hilfiger business is a larger business in terms of sales and profits than our Mexico business. However, given the strength of our brand position in the market, we were able to negotiate a favorable 50-50% ownership split. The closing of this transaction is expected to occur early in the third quarter of 2016.","As a reminder, we are still on track for the handover of our women's wholesale business to G-III for holiday 2016. Our key department store customers' initial reaction to the G-III collection have been very positive and we continue to be very optimistic about the future prospects for this business.","Moving to Calvin Klein, the first quarter was another solid quarter for Calvin Klein as we generated top line growth of 13% on a constant currency basis. EBIT was up about 20% on a constant currency basis as well.","Let me start with the international businesses for Calvin which is really driven by the significant momentum in our European business. Europe continued to experience double-digit retail comps and very healthy wholesale selling. Our fall 2016 order book has accelerated to high teen\u2019s growth versus our previous indication of mid-teens growth.","The strength of the business is coming from all major markets and across all of our product categories beyond just jeans and underwear including menswear and accessories. We are seeing our brand presence across the markets continue to improve by the season. Growth is coming from new doors and incremental square footage being dedicated to the brand. In the second quarter, comp store sales in Europe continued to post strong double-digit sales increases.","Our CK Asia businesses continues to perform with China outperforming the other markets. We are seeing strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and our newer CK performance business.","As we look at the region, Hong Kong and Macau remains under pressure due to lack of mainland Chinese tourists and Korea continues to be pressured by the macro environment in the department store sector. However, our Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia businesses are growing significantly.","Second quarter comp sales in Asia have improved and are now running about mid-single digits. In North America, our revenues are up about 14% on a constant currency basis driven by growth of over 20% in North America wholesale due to the strong performance across all categories particularly to men's underwear and to women's intimate businesses.","During the quarter, we saw continued strong momentum in our underwear business as our women's business continues to see tremendous growth both in bras and panties with our market share growing to the number five position in bras and the number two position in panties in the department store sector.","In men's, we continue to hold the number one market share position and we saw our market share in the first quarter grow to over 30% which is a record performance for the men's business.","Our jeans and men's sportswear business saw an improvement from the fall season with better AURs and strong sell-throughs especially on the men's jeans side of the business. Women's continues to see outsized improvement through our specialty store accounts like Urban Outfitters.","Moving to retail, the business in the US remains challenging with international tourist traffic and spending under the same pressure as we are seeing in our Hilfiger US business. Retail comp trends continued to decelerate into May and we are not planning for this sales trend to improve for the balance of the year.","Let me take a moment and discuss some of the recent news around the Calvin Klein brand. In April we announced a new global creative strategy for the Company which will unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision across all categories of the business.","As the company continues to build itself into a $10 billion global retail sales business, this undertaking will further solidify the brand's positioning worldwide and pave the way for future long-term global growth. We look forward to providing an update on this strategy over the next few months.","As it relates to the brand's relevancy and the power of the brand globally, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics continue to improve in all markets. Consumer engagement across the brands showed an over 35% increase in social media followings globally with a 60% increase in global engagements.","We are connecting art with Converse through our partnerships with Zalando, Urban Outfitters and key social media platforms and of course the brand continues to draw controversy with tremendous industry buzz be it us sponsoring Justin Bieber's worldwide tour, our #mycalvins campaign, or many of our digital partnerships.","Moving on to our Heritage businesses, the Heritage business revenues declined 12% driven by the ongoing rationalization of the business including the exit of the Izod retail business and a discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishing business.","Partially offsetting this decline was a 12% comp store sales increase in our Van Heusen retail business. Earnings were close to flat versus the prior year as the gross margin rate improvement offset the planned revenue declines in the quarter.","Overall, we have seen the department store channel continue to be under pressure from a traffic perspective but we believe that our Heritage brands are in most cases outperforming their respective categories.","During the quarter, we continue to see positive response in sell-throughs from our Van Heusen Flex Collar product and we celebrated the launch of Speedo Fit. Speedo fit is a platform designed to inspire and equip athletes at all levels to explore the power of training in the water. We held major events both in the New York City and Los Angeles with our Team Speedo athletes to launch the campaigns.","We are looking forward to the Olympics for Speedo and have some exciting events planned around the games and around our business.","Just to conclude my remarks, overall we were quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter and believe that our world-class brands, proven business model and best-in-class management teams are well-positioned to navigate through this uncertain and volatile environment while continuing to deliver strong financial results.","With that I will turn it over to Mike Shaffer, our CFO, to quantify some of my comments.","Michael Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I am about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.","First quarter revenues were in line with guidance with a 3% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding the negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter and both exceeded our guidance. Calvin Klein revenues were up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by strong growth in Europe and North America wholesale particularly our underwear business.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis for the quarter driven by strong performance in Europe as our Tommy Hilfiger international comp store sales were up 8%.","Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger US retail businesses remain under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist destinations. Heritage revenues were down 12% primarily due to the exit of the Izod retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business.","EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.05. The beat was driven by a strong Calvin Klein and Tommy performance for $0.03 as well as FX and the timing of taxes for another $0.02 combined.","Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016, we are increasing our earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis for the year while continuing to take a prudent approach to planning our business as foreign currency and global consumer spending remain unpredictable and volatile and the US retail market is increasingly more promotional.","For the full-year 2016, we are anticipating based on current exchange rates that we will be impacted negatively by about $1.55 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.55 impact was approximately 90% driven by transaction and 10% driven by translation.","For the full-year 2016, we are projecting earnings per share at $6.45 to $6.55. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.55, we have earnings per share growth of 13% to 15% over the prior year. We have increased our guidance $0.15 from the bottom of our previous range and $0.05 on the top end of our previous range which reflects a prudent view of our business for the second half of the year.","Included in our full-year guidance is increased marketing spending versus the prior year which is mostly second half weighted. Overall we are projecting revenue to grow approximately 2% both on a constant currency and GAAP basis.","This guidance reflects a revenue reduction of approximately $55 million in the second half of the year related to our proposed joint venture in Mexico which is expected to close in the early third quarter and will primarily impact our Calvin Klein business.","Overall we expect the Mexico transaction to be earnings neutral for 2016. Overall operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and expected to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis.","Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margin to increase about 50 basis points excluding a negative impact of 150 basis points of FX.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 50 basis points excluding a negative impact of FX of 225 basis points. Our Heritage businesses plan to have a revenue decrease of 8% due mostly to the exiting of our Izod retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business.","Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 30 basis points. The impact of foreign currency on our Heritage business is relatively immaterial.","Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $117 million and $120 million compared to the prior year amount of $113 million and reflects a decrease from our previous guidance as a result of our recent amendment to our credit facilities.","As a reminder when compared to the prior year an interest rate swap converting variable to fixed interest began in February and is the reason for the increase. Our tax rate for the year is planned to be about 20% which is in line with previous guidance and the prior year.","Second quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.25 to $1.30 and includes $0.45 of estimated negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we are expecting earnings per share to increase 24% to 28% for the second quarter. Revenue in the second quarter is projected to increase 5% on a constant currency basis.","Calvin Klein revenues are planned at a 13% constant currency increase and Tommy Hilfiger is planned at a 7% constant currency increase. Heritage brand revenues are projected to decrease 12%. Interest expense is projected to be $26 million and $28 million for the second quarter and taxes 24% to 25%.","And with that we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Emanuel Chirico","Good morning.","Bob Drbul","Manny, I have two questions. The first one is when you look at the sales trends domestically with either your own retail business or within the wholesale business in department stores, can you just talk about how your sales plan for the fall specifically or in the second half of the year has changed given some of the weakness that you are seeing domestically?","The second part of it is within the US, can you just talk a little bit about where you see current inventory levels and where the pressure is and how you feel positioned both in your retail business but also at the wholesale level?","Emanuel Chirico","Bob, when we look at sales trends, I guess there's a couple of stories going on. You can't just generalize because we are seeing really substantial strength in our Calvin Klein brand and I think that is really going counter trend to what is going on in the market.","So at wholesale, be it our underwear business, our sportswear businesses, the women's business, the G-III's operating, despite the challenges that we have all read about over the last couple of weeks in the US department store channel, that Calvin brand continues to grow across department stores and continues to grow in some of the key specialty store accounts as well as online.","Our retail businesses, the Tommy business I would also say particularly on the men's side of the equation continues to perform very well and we are planning the second quarter conservatively but continue to grow from a top line point of view from us.","When you look at the department store environment, I think one thing you have to take into consideration is that the overall comp trends have been challenging but I think if you look at the categories that have been stronger, men's clearly have been stronger than women's overall.","Apparel has been under pressure but really where I think they are seeing a much more significant pressure on the business is center core, the accessory business is under major pressure. We play in that but to a limited extent compared to the depth of our apparel business.","So I think you've got to factor that in when you think about our department store business because as I said, Calvin continued to grow 20% in the quarter at wholesale so clearly there is positive results going on there.","Moving to our own retail business, look, the biggest factor we are dealing with is a lack of traffic particularly in the international tourist markets. We are continuing to see a downturn in international tourists coming out of South America as well as the Chinese consumer really taking a step back in the first quarter.","So I think that has to do with currencies, what is going on with travel into the US. And to be honest, I think it is some of the strength that we are seeing though than our European business and in our Asia business as well with tourists saying home in market meaning Europeans staying within Europe, the Asian consumer traveling either to Europe or into the Asian market as well.","So that is how I would characterize it. Inventories, I am concerned. I think our inventories are really under good control. We have made a decision to invest in core inventory for the second quarter and beyond because we really see a sales opportunity particularly in the underwear category and we wanted to be in a position to fill those sales trends both in men's and women's and to remind you last year the sales trends were so positive we were surprised by them, we were chasing inventory all year last year in that category.","So we really ourselves well-positioned to really fill at the 100% rate given the current sales trend. So we are making that commitment on our inventories but given these sales performance, inventories are building as we go into Father's Day and it is going to be a promotional second quarter.","We are hopeful that the pain has been factored in at retail and we are hopeful that as we come out of second quarter, inventories going into fall will be well-positioned and I think most retailers are really planning for a turnaround in second half sales performance given the difficult environment that they had to deal with last second half, last year's second half.","So a long winded answer. I really do believe inventories will be under pressure and promotions will be more significant in the second quarter in the US.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you very much, Manny.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick","Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the outlet business, Manny. Can you talk about the difference in trends in your local markets versus tourist? And how much tourist business do think really is going to be left after 2016 as we think about what sort of a normalized trend might look like in that business? Then I have a follow-up on Calvin Klein.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think what we are seeing in our domestic store base is low single-digit comp store increases overall. I think that business is healthy but what you have to take into consideration is international tourist particularly in the Tommy business had represented somewhere in the 40% rate range of business for us and I think that business over a two-year period when we complete this year will be cut in half and I think that is what we are weathering as we go forward.","David Glick","And then a follow up on CK, obviously really strong double-digit trends, your annual sales guidance in constant currency implies a deceleration. I know you have the Mexico joint venture which impacts your second half growth.","You have some tougher comparisons but just trying to understand why the guidance appears to be at a lower growth rate in the back half on Calvin Klein? Thanks.","Emanuel Chirico","I guess, David, in the US we are taking - you pick the word, we are taking a prudent posture where we are anticipating that the sales trends that we have seen in the first quarter are going to continue into May are going to continue for the balance of the year in Calvin Klein. We are not looking for a sequential improvement as we get to the second half of the year.","I think most other apparel companies in this market and most other retailers based on what I have read are looking for a sequential improvement as we start the third and fourth quarter. We are not but we've positioned ourselves with core product to be able to capture that sales growth if it were to come.","So I think we are sitting in a good position in that given the momentum in our international businesses we have been able to plan our US businesses conservatively and I think that is partially what you are seeing is pulling down some of the sales growth that we see in the Calvin business.","That coupled with the other two factors, I mean we are coming off of double-digit growth in the third and fourth quarter of last year, we are growing on top of that but we are not anticipating it is going to be double-digit growth going into the third and fourth quarter.","You mentioned Mexico which is worth over $50 million to us for the quarter but from a profit point of view, won't have any impact on us for the year.","So I think there is opportunity. Let me just sum it up by saying I think there is opportunity to outperform those sales projections if the environment just improves slightly.","David Glick","One last question if I could on Tommy Hilfiger's women's, obviously there are a lot of new categories that you could benefit from a licensing perspective which can transition the profitability of the Hilfiger business to an extent more similar to Calvin given a higher licensing income.","What kind of opportunity do you see in licensing income of the new Tommy Hilfiger women's licenses that you just signed with G-III?","Emanuel Chirico","Over time I could see licensing revenues increasing ever $30 million. If you just think about a 7% royalty and if you think about above what we have got planned in our business over the next three years, what that could be worth given G-III is expertise just in the North America market. And using as a barometer the Calvin Klein business, that doesn't bring that business up to where the Calvin Klein business would be.","So I think there is a real opportunity to outperform what we are currently projecting given the positive reaction to the collections, given G-III's expertise and given the enthusiasm which retailers seem to be getting on board with the product at Tommy.","I also think if you think about the women's opportunity for us the opportunity is even bigger internationally. And I think the investments we are making starting in the second half of this year from a marketing focus around the Tommy women's business I think really positions us to take advantage of some of that momentum we see in the business. So you would expect women's to be bigger than men's.","Obviously for us it is not. Men's represents over 60% of the Tommy Hilfiger volume worldwide so there is a real opportunity to continue to grow men's but really outperform in women's and that is not in any of our forward-looking projections.","David Glick","Great. Thanks, Emanuel. Good luck.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping, Manny, you could talk a little bit more about the comment you made about driving the global retail size of the Calvin Klein business of $10 billion over time.","I think it stands somewhere in that $8 billion range today. Could you just talk about what the biggest incremental category or regional drivers are to really bridge that gap as you think about the future?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think the growth I think is easier to understand if we talk about regional. Clearly the growth will be driven more significantly out of the international markets. Europe can grow dramatically over the next few years. If you think about the European business, this year it will probably approach around $600 million for us, the Tommy Hilfiger business is well over $1.7 billion just to put that into perspective.","We haven't even launched any kind of women's sportswear or related classification businesses with Calvin outside of North America. We've got a big jeans business but very limited sportswear offerings on the women's side of the business and our men's sportswear businesses internationally are significantly under developed as well as tailored clothing which is big businesses here.","So we see dramatic growth for the Calvin Klein brand continuing coming out of Asia and coming out of Europe as those markets really can provide us upside growth as we move forward.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about your e-commerce, your digital strategy, just remind us where does e-commerce stand today as a percent of your total?","And then if you could just elaborate on some of the initiatives you highlighted earlier about your partnership with REVOLVE, some of the other platforms you are working with going forward and then just if you could add on what you are doing with Amazon right now in the conversation, that would be great? Thanks.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. So our e-commerce business in total when you consider our sales to dot-coms as well as our own internally managed business is over $800 million in retail sales. Our strategy has been in North America to utilize our sites as flagship sites, as really to present the best of the brand, to present the brand in a way that we are showing in Calvin, we are showing collection product, we are showing bridge product. And then we also show a white label product. But we don't promote dramatically, we try to keep the site pure.","Our average unit retail selling on that site is significantly higher than what you would see average at retail in department stores in the United States. And we really are trying to do the business in North America through our wholesale partners and a number of the pure plays here in the United particularly Amazon which is growing dramatically.","When you move internationally, it is really a two-tiered approach for us. We are focused on our own e-commerce sites, Tommy Hilfiger is very large in Europe it is by itself our site is over $100 million there and it is nicely profitable as well. And we are also selling to our wholesale.com accounts as well as the number of the pure plays like Amazon and Zalando.","In Asia where with the Warnaco acquisition, we probably started a little bit later, we are really seeing strong momentum in that business as we move forward. Our key sites that we operate ourselves are doing well but even more dramatically, Alibaba through Tmall and our JV partnerships are really driving outsized growth for the business there.","So it is a channel that we are really focused on, it is a channel that we are making significant investments in and it is a channel that is our fastest-growing channel and distribution for both brands.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks for the context and congrats on the quarter.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. I know it is a very tough environment. I know you have been asked about the guidance for the second half. I want to ask about the Calvin Klein guidance for 2H a little bit differently. In the North America wholesale business in particular has been such a nice driver and you are seeing good 20% growth rate there now.","There is obviously some really strong selling going on but I think some of the industry data we see shows good sell-through as well. So it looks like the growth rates in the US wholesale that you are baking in for second half are much lower, you start to lap much bigger growth rates a year ago so obviously that should decelerate and I think that is in your guidance.","But maybe you could help us talk about what kind of growth rates in North America wholesale you think we will be talking about when we have this call with you 90 days from now, just so we can think about where you are headed?","Emanuel Chirico","Michael, a couple of things. Let me just take a step back. I know everybody feels that there is opportunity in the second half and we would agree. But look, if this was a different environment, if we were sitting back and sales in the department store channel were flat, slightly positive, a more normal attractive environment, you can be sure that we would be much more aggressive in forecasting results and projecting numbers.","It is the first quarter. Most companies are missing, taking down guidance in going forward. We are really, really just going to try and continue to go along hopefully continue to outperform, raise our guidance as the year goes and see how it moves forward.","This doesn't seem like the environment to try and be a hero in. So let's see how the year progresses. The second quarter is projected pretty aggressively. We are looking for double-digit sales growth in Calvin Klein.","We will have better insight as we get into the third quarter, hoping the buy dollars being planned more specifically at the retail department stores and even though projections might be strong for the Calvin Klein brand, we are being cautious about how much of that is going to materialize as we move into August and September of this year.","I guess my total message is let's see how it moves forward and we will be sure to be as transparent as possible.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Let me ask you about maybe some of the components that are driving the 20% growth rate that you are seeing today. Could you help us think about how much of that is coming from AUR or just philosophy to help us think forward in our model as to what rolls off and what seems more sustainable as we do get into the back half of year?","Emanuel Chirico","I think AUR increase is up out 25% of it and I think the balance is really unit growth. We are seeing AUR improvement in those numbers particularly in the jeans business. The underwear business is very strong on the women's side. Men's has always been a high AUR so clearly we are not seeing 25% increases in men's AUR because we were the highest AUR in the category to begin with. But it is very healthy and holding together.","So this is much more driven by units than just AUR and I think you probably see the AUR improvement even more specifically on the gross margin line and I think there you see the performance in the quarter and I think you will see it even more so as we get into the second half of the year.","Michael Binetti","Okay, thanks. Very helpful.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone. As you think about, and congratulations, as you think about the underwear business, how big could of the underwear business be, Manny? And then overall as you think about revenue by channel for each of the brands, what is the opportunity whether it is the new specialty channel you are engaging in, department stores, outlets and what is the margin implications for that? Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico","So the first part of the question, the underwear business, how big can it be? The growth opportunity is women's. Women's overall for us is about 40% of our underwear business. The women's market is five times the size of the men's market so clearly there is a huge opportunity for us in women's here in North America.","In men's, the opportunity here in North America continues to be the channel diversification that is somewhat going on. Calvin Klein is a department store brand from Nordstrom's to Macy's. Those are our key large accounts, Bloomingdale's.","As you think about it with the growth of pure plays, it is opening us up to a newer consumer and we are capturing that market share be it in on Amazon or urbanoutfitters.com. So really the channel play there in the United States is important for us as we move forward as well.","Internationally it is just all white space. We have huge opportunity in Europe to continue to grow that business as the brand continues to expand there both in men's and women's. And in Asia which is a direct retail play for us, we continue to see strong comp store sales performance there and I think both men's and women's can continue to grow.","So I think the underwear business could continue to grow in the mid to high single digits for an extended period of time.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. The second part of the question, I'm sorry. Dana, could you repeat it?","Dana Telsey","Of course. As you think of the changes that you are making with entering the specialty channel and obviously online that you mentioned for the overall business, what is the opportunity, how do the channel change as a percentage of the penetration in your business and what is the margin implication?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, I think the second part of the question is easier to understand because we are agnostic about where the consumer buys products. By that I mean we have a very profitable retail direct to consumer channel, our wholesale business is highly profitable within 100 basis points of each other.","And as e-commerce scales both our own and the pure plays and our wholesale.com business, our profitability in that channel is similar to our profitability in the wholesale channel.","So from a profitability point of view, we are going to manage the distribution from a brand point of view but it really doesn't change or dramatically impact our profitability at all.","On the distribution channel, what we do find is the specialty store channel and the dot-com channel opens us up to a younger consumer, not only for underwear but for all of our businesses. That is exciting for us and we are connecting with that consumer from a marketing perspective, a marketing campaign to engage.","Our digital spend in Calvin and Tommy today is over 65% of our marketing spend is really occurring on a digital basis and we are really trying to move and connect with that consumer emotionally and they shop differently.","At the same time, we are not looking to alienate our core department store customer in North America or around the world and we believe are able to balance that through our channels of distribution. So we think we are in a strong position to manage the brick and mortar evolution that is going on at the same time take advantage of the growth that is occurring in the e-commerce channel.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Kernan with Cowen and Company.","Krista Zuber","Good morning. This is Krista Zuber on behalf of John Kernan. Most of my questions have been answered but as we model out CK and Tommy over the next several years, where do you think their respective margin profiles can recover to? Thanks.","Emanuel Chirico","That is an excellent question and an interesting question. Clearly the currency situation levels are off. There is an opportunity to really get back the margin that we have given up in the business and I think between both businesses internationally we have lost about 300 basis points of operating margin driven by the strengthening US dollar.","I think if currencies just stayed where they are and more or less level here, I believe we can capture back half of that over the next three years. I think if currencies were to start to swing the other way marginally and start to improve, that is how you capture back the other half of it as we move forward.","So it is something that we really need to watch. We've got very - Dana and Michael have very sophisticated hedging strategies to really get us through the next 12 months from a transaction point of view but as you go long-term and since inventory throughout the world in Europe, throughout Asia is bought in US dollars, you can hedge and you can go out probably 15 months.","But once those hedges fall off, if currencies remain weak against the US dollar, you are going to have to deal with that at that point in time and that is what is happening to us in 2016.","So hopefully we are optimistic that we will see some strengthening of some of the currencies against the US dollar, particularly the euro given the strengthening of that economy as we move forward. But who knows what it is going to be in the short term. I hope I answered your question from a profitability point of view.","Krista Zuber","Yes, thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eric Tracy with Brean Capital.","Eric Tracy","Good morning and I will add my congrats. As we think about the domestic retail business, certainly understood the international tourism is putting pressure. But correct me if I am wrong, we should start to lap some of those compares starting in 3Q.","And then just a little bit bigger picture, where is that business in terms of profitability? Just not total DTC, but just the stores and maybe a breakdown between CK and Tommy.","Emanuel Chirico","Well, our international stores even with the hit we are taking in top line are by far our most profitable stores. The volumes that you do, just think about the volumes that we do in Orlando and Miami and Harlem [ph] in New York which are by far, and Las Vegas which are probably the three or four largest centers in the country.","The sales per square foot despite experiencing a comp store decline that is probably over 20% in those stores continues to be our highest performing comp stores. So it is not a profitability issue from the point of view of overall profitability but just given the decline in sales volume and the margin pressure that that caused over the last 12 months, it is taken out of the performance of that business.","And we report our North American and our European international businesses and you can see North America the margin pressure that we have been under and the top line impacts that it had. But even with that, we continue to report double-digit operating margins in those businesses. And I think once that starts to level out, and as you said, the comparisons do start to get easier as you get into September and October.","So we are all hopeful that on a stacked two year comp basis that we can start to see a better trend in our retail comp performance in the second half but we are not counting on it to significantly improve.","Eric Tracy","Okay. Then switching gears a little bit to the Gigi Hadid the collaboration with Tommy again I believe you said sort of kicks in August. Maybe just talk about sort of distribution and marketing campaign around that.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. It is an exciting campaign. Gigi is so hot and she is such a great ambassador for the brand. We are investing significant dollars in that campaign and as Michael said in our comments, we are planning marketing expenditure increases throughout the second half and that focus really will be on Calvin and Tommy and Gigi is a key part of that marketing investment.","I think the opportunity is not so much just the GG collection. I think that creates buzz with the consumer, I think you will see it all over and you will see the key retailers and you will also see it really advertised significantly globally but I think it really provides a platform and a foundation to really move the Tommy women's business as we go forward.","Eric Tracy","And then lastly if I can just squeeze in one more, as you think about - you said you are channel agnostic and clearly wholesale distribution domestically is challenged secularly here. Talk about the level of investment you feel like you need to continue to make or what is incremental to support the digital migration be it your own sites and or a third-party player like an Amazon?","Emanuel Chirico","I think we for the last three years we have been making significant investments in our e-commerce platform. That is not going to slow down but I think that is all factored into where we are. Capital spending for us is between $250 million to $300 million in a given year. I can assure you that systems are a big piece of that, platforms are a big piece.","If we made a decision that the commerce business is growing so strongly that we need a separate warehouse for e-commerce, that would be a major capital investment but you could be sure that there would be a significant expense benefit associated with making that investment based on the efficiencies that would come out of a standalone warehouse facility here in North America or Europe or Asia.","So I think we are very comfortable with the investments we have made which we continue to make and I think the business will continue to evolve and our business and our investments will evolve along where we see those growth initiatives.","Eric Tracy","Perfect. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, if I could we are going to take one more question so we can all get back to work for the second quarter. Operator?","Operator","Thank you, yes. And we'll take our final question from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Manny, I was just wondering, with the success that you have seen at Calvin Klein at wholesale and all of the opportunities that you mentioned during the Q&A and on the call about opportunities for incremental distribution, do you think your conversations and relationships with the department stores have changed at all and how do you manage this going forward?","Emanuel Chirico","I think they have strengthened. I think one of the things, we listen to our customers and one of the things that we talked about three, four years ago is they wanted us from an e-commerce point of view, from a dot-com point of view. They wanted us to help drive traffic to their sites. So we made the decision in North America not to compete directly with them on line.","And by that I mean is I think competitors whoever they are, have much bigger direct e-commerce sites than we have. We have made the strategic decision to partner with our department store customers to really expand their e-commerce businesses to make investments on their platforms that our brands are well-positioned not only in their brick and mortar stores but also in their e-commerce sites. And obviously we are seeing outsized growth with that channel of distribution be it Macys.com or LordandTaylor.com.","So we are really making investments along with them to drive that business so I don't feel a constant growing there. I think the Amazon situation, it is an opportunity. We try to have different merchandising strategies for both players, it is not the same performance. Obviously the fashion quotient at Macy's is much stronger, much deeper.","Amazon really knows how to sell core product. They are trying to get into the fashion world but they haven't proved that yet and we will see how that all plays out. But clearly for us comparative wise, it hasn't been a major discussion point. Calvin and Tommy depending on the retailer in North America, we are two of the top four brands in every major retailer in North America where it is appropriate for us to sell our goods.","So the relationships really have never been better and the channel conflict that we manage every day has been going on for the last 20 years whether there was concerns about our own retail stores, whatever and that is - being a global brand that is what we do, that is what we get paid for so I have not seen that intensify significantly.","Kate McShane","Thank you so much.","Emanuel Chirico","Thanks, Kate. Thank you so much, everyone. I wish everyone a happy, safe Memorial Day weekend to kick off the summer and hopefully some better selling at retail here in the United States. And we look forward to speaking to you in August about the second quarter performance. Have a good day, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

","We believe that these results are spectacular and demonstrate the incredible make-up of our organization that encompasses our powerful brands, our talented teams and our wide range of global growth opportunities. I would like to highlight a few key themes from our performance.","First, our international businesses continued to be a highlight and they currently represent over 50% of our revenues and 65% of our EBIT. Europe in particular continues to be an exceptional market for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein despite the soft macro environment across the region as our products, price positioning and brand experiences are resonating with the consumer.","Our order books are outstanding speaking to the power of our brands. We believe that we continue to gain market share for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein and that Europe represents the largest near-term regional growth opportunity for Calvin Klein. ","Asia experienced healthy performance for our brands despite the softer macro retail trends in China in the second half of 2018. We continue to grow our businesses and expand the breadth of categories that we offer for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, while investing to create exciting brand activations and tell brand experiences for the Chinese consumer. ","While we continue to monitor the consumer climate there in China, we see meaningful opportunity to expand our businesses in the region over time. ","Moving to North America, our retail performance improved over the third quarter with an acceleration in our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein comparable store sales and healthy performance in both of those brands especially for Tommy. ","Another key point to highlight is the continued outperformance across our Digital businesses. Digital continues to be critical and we introduced collaborations globally with a number of pure play digital commerce retailers. For the year, our reported Digital revenues increased by more than 20% and broke the $1 billion mark representing over 10% of our total revenues.","We are also excited about our two recent acquisition announcements. The first one to acquire Gazal shares that we did not already own. Australia is a great market with a healthy business and volume mix and a solid management team. We look forward to accelerating the growth we see in this market over the next few years across all of our brands. ","We are also pleased to finally takeover our Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore and Middle Asia license of the Tommy Hilfiger brand and run it directly leveraging our strong Asia platform. Both transactions should close in the second quarter of 2019. We believe we continue to grow our global footprint by leveraging our strong regional platforms and leadership teams. ","Moving to Calvin Klein, before I talk about the brand highlights, I am pleased to report that Calvin Klein\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter exceeded our revised expectations. Speaking about the brand, Calvin Klein\u2019s brand health remains very strong despite some of the business challenges we faced in 2018. ","Over the past few months, I hope you\u2019ve noticed the repositioning of our Digital First approach in engaging the consumer. I am pleased to report that Calvin Klein was one of the Top-10, most talked about brands in February according to Tribe Dynamics. We believe that our marketing campaigns, products and global activations are sparking cultural conversations about us and we have seen a noticeable increase in Calvin Klein\u2019s relevancy and considerations to purchase from consumers over the past few months. ","Our exciting new campaigns for spring 2019 launched in February and I hope you have had a chance to see it across social media. The campaigns featured Kendall Jenner, Shawn Mendes, A$AP Rocky and Noah Centineo in Calvin Klein jeans and Calvin Klein underwear. We believe the campaigns goes back to Calvin Klein\u2019s roots highlighting our iconic products with a more seductive and provocative aesthetic. ","The impressions and engagements experienced with this campaign has been amazing and it has generated ten times the buzz of the Kardashian-Jenner campaigns from last year. We have more excitement planned as Calvin Klein will be activating at the Coachella music festival this April as the exclusive apparel sponsor. An immersive Calvin Klein brand on-site activation will take place on the festival ground bringing to life the brand\u2019s spring 2019 campaign.","On our last call, I mentioned some of the areas that we were addressing on the Calvin Klein side of the business to improve its overall performance. We are pleased the way these are progressing as we took quick and decisive action. We continue to see a margin opportunity of 200 basis points over the next two years with about half of that coming in 2019. ","First, we have made the decision to exit our top-tier business of Calvin Klein, the 205 West 39th Street collection including the closing of our flagship store on Madison Avenue. We believe this was the right decision for the long-term health of the brand as the existing high-end business was not resonating with our core consumer. ","Second, we continue to enhance our Calvin Klein Jeans product assortment. We believe that the balance of core versus fashion product was improved in the first quarter and that you will start to see more fashion right products in the second half of the year. ","Third, we reorganized our Calvin Klein marketing organization bringing together all facets of consumer marketing experience from consumer engagement to data capabilities to the shopping experience. ","I believe that our 2019 campaign really speaks to the brand\u2019s new marketing direction and that the influences we are using around the world to complement our campaign will drive brand\u2019s heat with iconic sexy campaigns with a Digital First mentality. ","We believe that this enhanced marketing approach will help us build personalized relationships and tailor the overall consumer experience through the specialized themes. ","Lastly, we are discussing with G-III, our women\u2019s wear partner in North America about the potential for them to takeover our Calvin Klein Women\u2019s Jeans business in North America. This is being planned hopefully for the second half of the year and it demonstrates our high degree of confidence in G-III\u2019s ability to drive the women\u2019s jeans business in the North American region. ","Moving to the business overview, revenues for the fourth quarter were flat on a constant currency basis. Earnings increased 7% with operating margins up 80 basis points year-over-year, all ahead of our revised expectations. For the year, Calvin Klein posted growth of 8% and despite the challenges we had, we posted earnings growth of about 2%. ","We observed strength in our higher margin, international businesses for both the quarter and the year with strong growth in Europe. Notably, the Calvin Klein European business achieved its target of $1 billion in revenues well ahead of our plan as we continue to see a very positive response across the business despite softness in jeans. ","Our new product lines including, Performance, and men\u2019s and women\u2019s apparel also performed quite well. As a reminder, our spring 2019 order book is up 20% and we are pleased that our fall 2019 order book is up about 15%. We continue to believe that Europe remains the brand\u2019s single largest growth opportunity in the near-term with the potential for it to double over time. ","Calvin Klein\u2019s growth also continued across Asia. China was healthy during the fourth quarter and we were pleased with our performance during the Chinese New Year period including the consumers\u2019 response to our Chinese New Year capsule collection. ","That said, the overall consumer backdrop in China remains weaker than it was during the first half of 2018. So we are closely monitoring the consumer overall environment as well as we see Korea continues to remain a softer market as it has been all year. ","Lastly, our Calvin Klein North America business had a relatively healthy holiday season. Our retail comps were down 1%, a slight improvement versus third quarter. We have made key changes to our North America\u2019s structure and streamlined operations. We are increasingly focused on driving improved productivity in our stores, and we believe this will drive our business forward. ","We also continue to work through our denim inventories in-store and feel that we are in better position than we were entering the third quarter. We saw overall healthy trends in wholesale all year, but as planned we experienced some weaker trends in the fourth quarter in our North America Jeans business as we cleared two products that was too fashion forward for our core consumer. ","In summary, we have taken swift action to reposition the direction of the Calvin Klein business seeking to offer a more commercial product and exciting brand experience for our consumers. This will allow us to capture the top and bottom-line growth opportunities we see for this incredible brand. ","Moving to Tommy Hilfiger, the Hilfiger brand\u2019s health and relevance only strengthened in 2018 with brand awareness now exceeding 80% globally. Tommy experienced a phenomenal fourth quarter and full year demonstrating the broad based momentum we see across all product lines, regions and channels of distribution. This was fueled by a strong product offering and a consistent brand execution around the world which we believe is driving our results. ","Driven by our commitment to excite and engage our consumers, we are embarked on an exclusive high profile partnership to reach new younger audiences while also satisfying our core consumers, of course all of our marketing efforts. We continue to balance global and regional brand ambassadors to cater an increasingly global consumer base. ","We delivered engaging marketing campaigns featuring Lewis Hamilton on the men\u2019s side and those geared towards the female consumers including Hailey Baldwin and Winnie Harlow for our full 2018 icons campaign. ","We recently announced that American actress, Zendaya as our female brand ambassador beginning in spring 2019. Her authenticity and belief for the power of the inclusivity and diversities have always been at the heart of the Tommy Hilfiger brand and we believe it will help us reach a broader consumer base in 2019.","Leveraging our belief in local ambassadors and unique product experience for key markets, we also introduced a Chinese New Year Capsule collection for men\u2019s and women\u2019s starring Shawn Yue and Maggie Jiang as the faces of the campaign. The capsule collections were usually successful with a 117 million total impressions and website traffic exceeding 1.5 million visitors. ","Along with our celebrity partnerships, 2018 saw us offer exciting new brand activations from KITH with [Indiscernible] and most recently our expanded collection with iconic ski brand Rossignol in fall 2018. These partnerships underscore Hilfiger\u2019s vision to continuously elevate and expand the brand in key markets and further drive global growth bringing the next generation of fans to the brand. ","Moving on to the business from a business perspective, Tommy sales increased 5% on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter and 12% for the year with earnings up about 25% for both the fourth quarter and the year. We continue to be extremely pleased with our results as we are gaining market shares with our existing consumer base, while connecting with and converting to a broader, younger audience.","We continue to be extremely pleased with the response from consumers and are benefiting from market share gains in all regions around the world. Performance in the Tommy Hilfiger International business was robust as international revenues increased 7% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter and 15% for the year. Retail comps were up 16% for the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. ","Our Tommy Europe outperformance continued. We continue to see strong business across all markets with sell-throughs at retail with lower year-over-year promotions benefiting our overall gross margin. Our order books are truly outstanding as we continue to gain market share. As a reminder, our spring summer 2019 order book is up over 10% and I am quite happy to report that we are seeing four winter orders up close to 15% which is truly incredible given the size of the business in Europe. ","Moving to Tommy Asia, which accounts to close to 10% of our overall Tommy Hilfiger revenues. Results in China continue to be strong as we invested in our retail and digital businesses including taking back certain Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities during the year. We advanced our marketing efforts including the use of new regional ambassadors and brand activations. ","We introduced interactive brand events including our fall 2018 TommyNow Fashion Show in Shanghai. In collaboration with this, we held a Super Brand Day on TMall that offered a seamless consumer experience including order delivers within 24 hours in key cities. ","Additionally, our Japan business was another highlight. We experienced healthy revenue growth and our operating levels continued to exceed our expectations driven by investments in products, marketing and the overall consumer experience in Japan. ","Now, for North America, the business continues to outperform. Retail comps for the quarter improved and were plus 5% year-over-year with an improvement of full price selling benefiting gross margins. Our wholesale business had another quarter with strong sell-throughs across all categories. In the first quarter of 2019, we made a strategic decision to grow Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s sportswear outside of Macy\u2019s.","You will start to see our product in new Tier-1 distribution including Bloomingdales and Nordstrom. You will see a presence in Bealls and our department store and other department stores during the second half of 2019. We are excited about the additional wholesale distribution for the brand and the ability it will give us to reach new audience. ","With regard to licensing, we saw strong results across the board including the Tommy Hilfiger women\u2019s business that is being operated by G-III that continues to perform at over our expectations. In line with our strategic objective to further reach and engage with a digital savvy North American consumer, we are focusing on next-generation retail expansion on pop-up shops and brand collaborations. ","As such, we are closing our New York City 5th Avenue, Tommy Hilfiger Store and the Tommy Hilfiger Store on Collins Avenue in Miami, Florida to focus our marketing efforts on targeting a younger, more digitally savvy consumer in North America. ","Finally, in our Heritage businesses, revenues for the quarter declined 5% with flat comp store sales and our earnings was up $8 million reflected the weaker than expected performance across the business. For the year, revenues rose 1% with comp stores also up about 1% and earnings declined about 13% over the prior year. ","We were pleased with our Heritage business for the first nine months of the year. However the fourth quarter saw the business under pressure, especially in our Dress Furnishings business was our softest business continuing to be neckwear. ","As we look ahead, we see opportunities for the Heritage business as we gain market share, develop new products that contain certain innovative technologies and leverage our supply chain to produce further efficiencies. ","We will also continue to evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio in order to generate enhanced returns and better cash flows. ","Looking out to 2019, overall, I believe our results in 2018 demonstrate our strong execution and our continued commitment to investing in and driving our business against our strategic priorities. From a regional perspective, in North America, we have seen a softer overall retail environment since January with some business experiencing better business in May and March as weather started to turn. ","As such, we remain cautious on the North America landscape for 2019. Our own North America stores are experiencing comps down, high-single-digits at Calvin Klein and Heritage and down low-single-digits at Tommy Hilfiger. ","Our international businesses continue to see great momentum quarter-to-date with Tommy Hilfiger International comps up high-single-digits and Calvin Klein International comps running down mid-single-digits as the timing of Chinese New Year negatively impacted Calvin\u2019s international business more than Tommy. ","In particular, factoring out Chinese New Year for Calvin Klein, Calvin Klein International comps would have been trending closer to down low-single-digits for the quarter. Our initial earnings per share guidance range implies a year-over-year EPS growth of about 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. ","Our outlook prudently reflects the macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility around the world and the uncertain global retail landscape that we see both here in North America and in China. And with that, I will turn it over to Mike to quantify our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and the 2019 outlook. ","Mike Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I will briefly touch on 2018 and then move on to 2019. ","Our reported revenues for the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by the 53rd week in 2017 to $125 million. In the fourth quarter, we lost $80 million of revenues due to the one last week in 2018 versus 2017 and $45 million of revenue shifted out of the fourth quarter of 2018. ","Our fourth quarter comp sales are more appropriately compared with the 13-week period ended February 4, 2018. The fourth quarter comp sales I am reporting are on that shifted basis. ","Our reported revenues were down 1% and up 2% on a constant currency basis and revenues were better than our previous guidance. In spite of one less week in 2018, Tommy Hilfiger revenues were very strong, up 2% as reported and up 5% on a constant currency basis and above our previous guidance. Tommy Hilfiger International revenues increased 3% as reported and were up 7% on a constant currency basis. ","The Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increase was driven by strong performance in all regions and channels with comp store sales up 16%. Tommy Hilfiger North America revenues increased 2%, North America comp sales were up 5%. ","Our Calvin Klein revenues were down 2% as reported and were flat on a constant currency basis and were above our previous guidance. Calvin Klein International revenues increased 2% as reported and were up 6% on a constant currency basis. Our international comp store sales were up 6%. Calvin Klein North America revenues decreased 7%. North America comp store sales were down 1%. ","Our Calvin Klein operating margins increased 80 basis points for the quarter and reflected the positive benefits from the recently announced initiatives. Heritage revenues were down 5% for the prior year and below our previous guidance. By Heritage retail business, comp store sales were relatively flat for the prior year. ","Our non-GAAP earnings per share of a $1.84 was16% higher than the previous year and $0.09 better than the top-end of our previous guidance. The EPS dip versus previous guidance was driven by strong business or approximately $0.06 favorable FX of $0.02 and favorable interest of $0.01. ","We ended the full year 2018 with record revenue of $9.7 billion, an increase of 8% versus the prior year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.60 which was 21% higher than the prior year. ","Moving on to 2019, for the full year 2019, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be $10.30 to $10.40, 7% to 8% growth over the prior year. Included in our earnings per share is a negative impact of foreign currency of $0.22. Earnings per share excluding the negative impact of foreign currency is projected to grow approximately 10% to 11%. ","Overall, we are projecting revenues to grow approximately 4% as reported and 5% on a constant currency basis. Included in our revenue guidance for the year is the addition of approximately $150 million of revenue related to the pending Australia and Greater China acquisitions. This is partially offset by a decrease of approximately $100 million of revenues related to our intent to license the Calvin Klein Women\u2019s Jeans business in the second half of 2019 and the closure of our Calvin Klein Collection business. ","Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 20 to 30 basis points for the company. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 6% as reported and 8% on a constant currency basis. Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned to decrease 10 to 20 basis points including the negative impact from the pending Australia and Greater China acquisitions as these businesses shift from a licensing model to a directly operated model. ","We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 2% as reported and 3% on a constant currency basis driven by strong international growth. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 80 to 90 basis points. Our Heritage business is planned to have revenue growth of about 3% and operating margins are planned to increase 10 to 20 basis points. ","Interest expense for the year is planned to be about $128 million compared to the prior year amount of $116 million. The increase is primarily the result of higher interest rates coupled with higher borrowings as a result of the transactions of Australia and Greater China. ","In 2019, we are planning to pay down at least $150 million of our debt. Stock repurchases in 2019 are planned to be about $200 million. Our tax rate for the year is estimated to be at about 14.5% to 15.5%, which at the midpoint is approximately 150 basis points versus 2018 with most of the increase coming in the first quarter. The increase for 2018 is a result of changes in U.S. tax code.","First quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $2.40 to $2.45 and includes approximately $0.14 of estimated negative impact for foreign currency translation. The largest negative FX impact for 2019 is reflected in the first quarter. Revenue in the first quarter is projected to increase 2% as reported and 6% on a constant currency basis. ","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at 4% increase reported and 10% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein revenues are planned at a 1% increase as reported and 5% on a constant currency basis. Heritage revenues are projected to increase 1%. ","Interest for the first quarter is projected to be about $31 million and taxes to be 21% to 22% in the first quarter. ","And with that operator, we will open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question today from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. ","Bob Drbul ","Hi, Manny, Mike, Dana. Good morning. I guess, Manny, could you talk a little bit about the update on where you are with replacing rafts and sort of how you are approaching that from the caliber perspective, you\u2019ve seem to be making a lot of progress on the performance there, be my first question. ","Manny Chirico","Sure, I think our focus is really been on first and foremost, getting the commercial businesses fully aligned. So a lot of our effort has gone into restructuring or marketing organization to align with the regional requirements. We have restructured our merchandizing organization and focused on that from a product area. ","So we've made significant investments on the merchandizing side of the business and we continue now to think about how are we going to bring in the design focus together and align as we move forward. We have a process in place I think does that well and we are looking for a creative head from a product point of view as we move forward in the design area. ","So, at this point, that piece of it is still a work in process. But I feel very comfortable that we have the right regional commercial teams in place, designing products, totally appropriate for those \u2013 the markets that they play in and I think that\u2019s going to help drive our business particularly in the second half of the year. ","Bob Drbul ","And then I like to just ask on China, can you just elaborate what you are seeing there? Has it slowed down at all for you? Any just updated thoughts on that market would be really helpful to us. Thanks. ","Manny Chirico","Sure, I think, when you look at it on a macro basis, we get a lot of information from our landlords there and we share information with a number of our competitors there on retail sales trends. I really think we are outperforming what\u2019s going on in the market, but fundamentally, beginning I would say around, July of 2018, we started to really see that business slow down as lot of the store pressure on the consumer in China overall was overall. ","And I think clearly, the trade tensions between U.S. and China are impacting that and then the ripple effect that had on stock market valuations and consumer sentiment has made the business more challenging. On the positive side, we haven\u2019t seen any slowdown on our Digital business. From an ecommerce point of view, we continue to see very healthy growth in China there, that\u2019s probably our most penetrated market over \u2013 globally. ","And I think that\u2019s a positive sign how the brands are resonating both Calvin and Tommy is resonating with the consumers there. But fundamentally, business is softer than you saw in the first half of 2018 and that trend has just continued into the first quarter of 2019. So, I think we have to plan right to be fairly conservative in our estimate. ","We are looking for that trend to continue into the \u2013 throughout the first half of 2019 and then as we start to lap comparisons, we should get back to seeing a more positive trend we hope. Finally, again, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but looking at what\u2019s going on with some of the trade negotiations, I am more optimistic today than I was 90 days ago. ","So, based on discussions and a sense of what I have going on with those trade negotiations, I feel that that could be a positive catalyst as we move through the second half of the year. ","Bob Drbul ","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck. Have a good day.","Manny Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today comes from Erin Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Erin Murphy ","Great. Thanks, Good morning. Manny, just my first question is for you. With some of your comments regarding the North American environment I am curious if you see kind of a soft part of the year is more that noise, given the weather, government shutdown earlier in the quarter or do you see kind of a start to a broader slowdown in the U.S. consumer? ","And then, just given how spring trends have been here in the North American market, what are you hearing from retailers in terms of how they are planning their fall receipts?","Manny Chirico","Okay. Look, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret. I have talked to a number of our key customers and see our business and our competitors is, the first quarter is slightly softer than the fourth quarter. Overall traffic seems to be down in most of the centers and I think there is a couple of things going on and you touched on them is, I think, the consumer sentiments being impacted by a lot of the noise around trade, even Brexit as people hear more and more about this. ","There seems to be more uncertainty in the market and that always impacts the consumer in discretionary categories like apparel. I think you touched on the weather. I think that clearly was an impact in February which was a soft month. ","And then, the later Easter, I think is really playing a bit of havoc with the retail calendar and if you think about it, particularly in our business, the outlet environment which is driven in the first quarter significantly by vacation and school, holidays and when spring break is with the calendar is just not aligned. ","Easter this year is three weeks later that clearly has an impact and I think, we\u2019ve got to wait and see how that whole situation resolves itself. But I think it\u2019s fair to say, compared to first quarter of last year which was very strong is we are seeing a consumer backdrop that\u2019s weaker than that right now and we\u2019ll have to see how it all plays out. ","I think we have a \u2013 we PVH, we have a plan fairly conservatively. We are expecting April to be much stronger and I think that just naturally will happen given the Easter holiday and then it\u2019s a real question of what\u2019s the second half of the year looks like. But just to remind that we want to particularly broad even though our business was strong, we clearly saw a bit of a slowdown in the second half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2018. So, I think the comparisons for us get a little easier as we enter the second half. ","Erin Murphy ","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, just my second question is really on the Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe. I mean, it\u2019s a pretty incredible order book number for fall. It's already a strong spring, that number, I am just curious what\u2019s driving that. If there is a specific region or a category or kind of account that\u2019s driving that? Thank you very much. ","Manny Chirico","Look, again, that\u2019s kind of a 15% growth, we are really seeing \u2013 we are seeing across the board and I think we are seeing some \u2013 there is some new product launches particularly Tommy performance and that\u2019s off to a unbelievably strong start. So that whole at leisure trend that's been so strong here in North America is starting to take off in Europe. ","And I think given Tommy\u2019s position, they are in a really advantageous position to take advantage of that as we move forward and it seems to be a really strong response both from retailers and consumers there. So, that\u2019s been a nice part of our growth as we move forward. But to be honest, we see strength in men\u2019s sportswear, women\u2019s sportswear. ","The tailored business as we move forward our footwear and accessories business as well and even denim as a category continues to be really well for us with Tommy Jeans. So, it\u2019s across the board. I remind everybody all the time it\u2019s a very big business. The largest sportswear business for any global lifestyle brand in Europe and I think, the double-digit growth is not what we really factor in and planning for the business. So, it\u2019s really just the sense of the business. ","We are gaining market share against all of the major competitors both the local European brand the global players that are positioned in Europe. And we see it consistently account-by-account and we see it in our retail comps as well. So, the team has just done a phenomenal job. ","Erin Murphy ","Great. Thank you guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Matthew Boss from JP Morgan has our next question. Please go ahead. ","Matthew Boss","Thanks and congrats again on a nice quarter. ","Manny Chirico","Thank you.","Mike Shaffer","Thank you.","Matthew Boss","I guess, first on the margin front, can you just touch on what your guidance embeds for gross margin both for the year and the first quarter and how to think about the drivers by brand?","Mike Shaffer","Okay. I guess, when you think about the company for the year, we are looking at 20 to 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. We are looking at about 70 to 80 basis point improvement in gross margin and that\u2019s the components. We do have a shift towards a significant increase in the international business, which is also fueling that gross margin increase. ","The Calvin Klein business and the turnaround that we are projecting there at 80 to 90 basis point improvement is a piece of the puzzle on the year. On the first quarter and the way the margin improvement will lay out, we will see some operating margin improvement in the first quarter, but we won\u2019t see gross margin improvement in the first quarter. ","You will predominantly see the gross margin improvement in quarters two through four and nearly in the first quarter we are seeing a real heavy penetration on the wholesale selling in the business which is a lower gross margin component to the business. Also, we have a Chinese New Year headwind, as Chinese New Year has less weeks than you see in last year and that business is a very high gross margin business. So it\u2019s putting a little pressure on the first quarter margins, gross margins. ","Matthew Boss","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, just the bottom-line earnings growth, stripping out the headwinds from foreign exchange interest impacts, basically calls for double-digit growth this year. I guess, can you speak to the confidence in that plan and any change for double-digits as the multi-year earnings growth algorithm that we think beyond this year?","Manny Chirico","I think when you think about that, you touched on some of the headwinds, below the line headwinds that we are facing. But based on the momentum in the business, the wholesale order books that we see we are fairly confident and I think we have a track record of trying to be prudent how we project the year. I mean, we try to underpromise and overdeliver. ","All that said, I think we are in really good position here and the one thing that I think everyone was just concerned about is the macro environment is particularly in Asia and North America where we are seeing some softness right now. We think some of that is just the retail calendar and we touched on that with the Easter shift. ","But that\u2019s the only concern we would have and it\u2019s more of a macro global concern versus PVH-specific. So, everything I see tells me that in the \u2013 with our key customers where we see a lot \u2013 we have a great visibility, we are outperforming the competitive set. So, with that said, it gives us real confidence to deliver the numbers we are talking about. ","Matthew Boss","Great to hear. Best of luck. ","Manny Chirico","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today comes from Bernard Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Bernard Boruchow","Hey. Good morning everyone. Let me add my congrats. I guess a quick one, Manny or Mike, I am really interested in the Tommy wholesale opportunity in North America now that the Macy\u2019s arrangement is an offer. I guess, what I\u2019d love to understand is how should we think about the phase-in of the whole sell-in opportunity in the back half of 2019? ","And then, does that ramp into next year? And then, I guess, at a higher level, do you guys have some sort of sense of what the underlying demand is for the brand across North America, outside of Macy\u2019s? And does that help you kind of frame a larger revenue opportunity for Tommy North America today versus years past?","Manny Chirico","Okay. So, I guess, for \u2013 I\u2019ll take it in pieces, let me talk about 2019 first. The decision we made about moving away from the Macy's exclusive, that decision was made in mid-fourth quarter. So, just to put that into perspective, the ability then to go out and capture open to buy dollars in 2019 was somewhat limited there. ","So from that perspective, we are opening some doors. We are starting to ship fall holiday 2019. So, I think it\u2019s \u2013 relatively speaking, very minimal impact on 2019 and in fact, probably with the investments in order to position the brand, it\u2019s in fact a little bit of a headwind for the Tommy business to 2019 on a bottom-line basis. ","Moving into 2020 and beyond, obviously, when we went out to speak to the market about the appetite for the brand, there was a significant demand for the brand outside of Macy\u2019s. We wanted \u2013 the plan is to keep it in Tier-1 department stores, meaning Macy's up from a competitive set point of view. So we touched on discussions with Nordstrom and Bloomingdale and also obviously Bealls looking to expand particularly in women\u2019s with Dillard's. ","And I think those create opportunity as we go forward. And then finally, I have to say is, clearly, Amazon is excited about the exclusivity being taken off and the availability in North America to sell Tommy Hilfiger products. So, we think it could be meaningful, but again, I think it\u2019s more of a 2021 kind of issue as we move forward. ","We did it as much as a brand positioning \u2013 from a brand positioning perspective as we did it from a financial driver, because I think we will really be able to position the brand in great shop and shops and some of the major department stores to present the brands in the best way and it\u2019s also part of that \u2013 part of the decision to close the 5th Avenue Store. ","We think we were confusing the consumer here in North America with our international product line in 5th Avenue and we think there is better ways to use those marketing dollars to connect with the North America consumer directly to really target that to a younger consumer and the opening of the distribution channel outside of Macy\u2019s was a key initiative in the decision process to close that 5th Avenue Store as well. So, we are excited about and I think it really positions the brand well as we move forward. ","Bernard Boruchow","That\u2019s really helpful. ","Manny Chirico","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question now comes from Tiffany Kanaga from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Tiffany Kanaga","Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Would you dig into the cadence of your Calvin Klein guidance which assumes a softer back half despite easier compares and your initiatives hopefully gaining traction and how that\u2019s being impacted by your plans around the women\u2019s CK team\u2019s business in North America? ","Manny Chirico","Well, I guess, Tiffany, I am a little confused. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a softer backdrop in the third and the fourth quarters. And again I feel like, we got the first quarter planned more conservatively, first half planned more conservatively and I think, the only issue is, that we really had a such a \u2013 we had a better fourth quarter this year that we expected. So, it\u2019s \u2013 so that\u2019s a challenge. The FX is really a first quarter headwind for the company overall, and I think that\u2019s explained in the guidance. ","So, I think we actually see opportunity in the fourth quarter. I guess, from a top-line basis, we are not seeing the third and fourth quarter growth. A big piece of that is the elimination of the collection business and moving of the Calvin Klein G\u2019s business to G-III that does have a negative impact on the fourth quarter \u2013 third and fourth quarter sales. But I think it\u2019s a healthy move for us as we move forward and improve profitability as we move into 2020. ","Tiffany Kanaga","Okay, thanks. I was just hoping today again to how your constant currency assumption for the first quarter was for 5% growth, but only 3% for the quarter. So, thank you. That was helpful. ","Manny Chirico","Okay. It\u2019s a \u2013 but I think that the 3% is really being impacted directly by the jeans elimination of sales in the third and fourth quarter of the year. So I think that has the biggest pressure on this I guess why 5% is down to 3% and I think, maybe just to take a step back on Calvin Klein. ","Overall, the way we\u2019ve tried to really manage the business in 2019 is, I think, with all the change that we have going on, the way we\u2019ve tried to project the business is, overall on a top-line basis, trying to be fairly conservative about the top-line turnaround, because we think there is such a margin opportunity in the second half of the year and even in the first half of the year for that matter, both from a gross margin point of view and an expense restructuring that\u2019s going through. ","So, we are taking a really prudent approach on the top-line going with the assumption that this year is a transition year as we bring new creative directions to the product and moving forward, but it really try to secure both the gross margin benefit that will come as we shouldn\u2019t have nearly the promotional selling in the second half of the year that we had in 2018, particularly around jeans. ","And in our own retail businesses here in North America, as well as, the expense leverage that we should be able to attain throughout the year given the restructuring initiatives that went in and around the collection business in particular. So, it gives us a great deal of confidence that we are planning it right. So, operator, we have \u2013 it\u2019s after 10. We are going to just take one more question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will now come from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Heather Balsky","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could elaborate on the kind of digital investments you are making for 2019. Where \u2013 I guess, where this dollar is being focused?","Manny Chirico","Okay. I guess heavy investments are being made in systems as you would - success with really thinking \u2013 fundamentally, the distribution channels from a sales point of view really changing and the way to service our consumer is changing and investments are being made there systemically warehousing and distribution. ","Our IT systems and support, our marketing, which has moved significantly to a digital marketing focus has completely changed and moved forward. From the way we can talk business, 3D design is really moving forward. We are making advances there. That will not only make us more efficient and cost-effective. ","But it gives us time to really be making decisions on products later and later in the supply chain and I think it will create more nimbleness and also allow us hopefully to improve our overall gross margins. Consumer data continues to be key for us and how we connect directly with our consumer how we gather the information systemically corporate-wide in both globally and region-by-region and then connect back with that consumer, really making investments there as well, and then the whole planning process on how we manage inventories and the product cycle. ","So, look, I think as we will look back over this last year-and-a-half and going forward the next two years, I think our industry is one that is just gone through a fundamental change in the way business is conducted. ","And I really, truly believe, if you are not making the investments now, you are falling behind your competitive sets and you will pay a price as you move into 2019 and 2020 and scale becomes more and more important, efficiency becomes more and more important and then the way you can communicate with your consumer is critical. ","If you are not making those moves today, I think you are going to be behind the 8 ball as you move forward. And with that, I am going to close the conference. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to speaking with you in June about our first quarter results. Have a great day. Take care. ","Operator","Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect."],"18388":["PVH Corp.

Good morning everyone. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relationship.","Our strong first quarter performance exceeded our expectations and demonstrated our ability to continue to deliver against our strategic and financial plans despite the ongoing challenging macro-environment. We grew first quarter non-GAAP EPS earnings 17% on a constant currency basis. Our performance during the quarter was driven by the momentum across our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses with our international businesses continuing to demonstrate outsized performance.","Our European and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets. And our North America business performed in line with out plans. Strength has been across all distribution channels, wholesale, retail and our digital channels with our digital e-commerce business continuing to be our fastest growing distribution channel with revenue growth in excess of 20%.","Moving to our brands, let me begin with Tommy Hilfiger. We continue to experience positive momentum around Tommy Hilfiger and its health and relevancy continues to be exceptionally strong with the global community. We are pleased to have signed Gigi Hadid as our women's brand ambassador for another two seasons. As I had said before, we continue to be extremely pleased with the response from customers for both our women's business but the broader impact the partnership has had on the overall brand. The Gigi partnership has created a halo effect across all women's categories and generated double-digit sales growth in our women's business across all regions. From a business perspective, overall revenues for Tommy increased 9% on a constant currency basis and earnings were up 25% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our international businesses, which increased 19% on a constant currency basis for the quarter.","Tommy Europe, which has been our outstanding performer and continues to be a stand out, all major European markets are performing demonstrated by a double digit comp store sales increase in the quarter which was above our expectations driven by full price selling. As strong as our retail business has been, our wholesale performance continues to see tremendous strength with strong sell-through season to-date. As I mentioned last quarter, our Fall 2017 European order book has been frozen at a 10% increase versus the prior year. We are seeing strong growth across all our divisions, particularly in men's and women's jeans and women's sportswear.","Moving to Asia. Tommy Asia, led by China, continues to perform well as we leverage the business with our PVH China platform and drive product, marketing and business productivity initiatives to support the long-term growth for the brand going forward in the market. Additionally, our Japan business continues to see steady progress in its turnaround efforts as we continue to improve upon 2016 productivity improvements. ","In North America, Tommy saw another strong quarter of men's performance at wholesale. We are pleased with our outperformance relative to our competitors during the quarter. The transition to women's wholesale business now run by G-III is also performing well at retail and we are optimistic about the growth prospects for our women's business.","Shifting to retail. During the quarter, we saw some stabilization in international tourist traffic in our outlet store and we saw comparable sales growth improve to a decline of 4% during the quarter. During the quarter, we did see some improvement in our Florida business, however the border stores for both our Canadian and Mexican border stores continue to be under pressure.","Moving to Calvin Klein and focusing on the brand. Calvin continues to capture compelling brand and cultural relevancy through its focus on digital consumer engagement, elevated brand imagery and strong digital advertising campaigns which have created impactful interactions with consumers. Over the past few months, we have seen a strong reception in engagement with our men's underwear campaign featuring the Moonlight cast. And most recently with our women's Intimate campaign featuring a wide range of actresses and models, including Lauren Hutton, Kirsten Dunst, Maya Hawke and others highlighting our latest tailored bra product as part of our effort to continue to elevate and drive our tailored bra business. As we look to fall 2017, we see some exciting new launches across our product categories, including fragrance. Unfortunately I can't provide any sneak peeks quite yet but we look forward to an exciting fall from a marketing and consumer engagement point of view and will share that on our August call.","From a business perspective, Calvin revenues increased 6% on a constant currency basis for the first quarter, reflecting strong global trends. Our revenues were driven by strong topline growth out of Europe and China with North America performing in line with plans. EBITDA on a constant currency basis was up slightly for the quarter despite a $7 million planned increase in marketing expense and creative leadership changes that we have previously discussed with you. As a reminder, we should be lapping these expenses as we approach the fourth quarter of this year.","Moving to Europe. Results continue to demonstrate outstanding performance, both topline and bottomline and I couldn't be more pleased with the direction of the European business with comparable sales up double digits and strong sell-throughs across our wholesale channel of distribution. As we discussed on last quarter's call, our fall 2017 order book is up north of 25% for Calvin Klein and the strength of the business continues to be seen across distribution channels for all major markets and across all product categories with significant acceleration in both jeans and the underwear category.","Calvin Klein Asia continues to perform well with China outperforming our other markets across all product categories. While China continues to outperform, the negative geopolitical news out of North Korea have had a negative impact on our business there.","Finally, moving to North America for Calvin. We continue to see healthy growth across our wholesale channels, in line with our plan despite significantly reduced department store open to buy plans versus last year on a macro basis. Our Calvin Klein North America retail business experienced a negative 5% comp, in line with our plans.","Our Heritage brands. The Heritage business revenues declined 3% for the quarter, principally resulting from a planned shift in timing of shipments from the first quarter to the second quarter as compared to the prior year. Comparable store sales were flat in our Heritage retail business and on plan. EBIT decreased slightly in the quarter due to the planned shift in shipments which offset the gross margin improvements we saw across the business. We feel our Heritage business is very well-positioned as we move into the second half of the year.","That's a good segue into our view of the balance of the year. While we continue to take a prudent approach to planning our 2017 business in light of the uncertain global retail landscape, we were pleased to have raised our guidance for the year. Our international businesses continued to see nice momentum quarter to-date with Tommy and Calvin international comps running up mid single digits with strong performance continuing to come out of China and Europe. The environment in North America continues to be challenging with traffic trends and the department store landscape on the pressure which we believe will continue throughout 2017. Comps for Calvin Klein North America and Tommy Hilfiger North America are trending down low single-digits quarter to-date with the Memorial holiday coming this weekend. Overall, we feel we are very well positioned for the balance of the year and believe given our underlying brand momentum and the strength we see in our international businesses that we can continue to outperform our financial plan.","And with that, I will turn it over to Mike to quantify the first quarter and the year.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks Manny. The comments I am about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Our reported revenues for the first quarter were up 4% from the prior year and exceeded our guidance. On as constant currency basis, first quarter revenues increased 5%.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues were ahead of guidance and up 9% on a constant currency basis excluding a negative impact of 3% related to foreign currency. The Tommy Hilfiger revenue increase was driven by strong international performance, including a 14% comp store increase in international comps as well as a full quarter of revenue from our Tommy Hilfiger China business which we acquired in the first quarter of 2016. The international increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue worth approximately $20 million due to the transfer of the North America women's wholesale business to G-III in the fourth quarter of last year.","Our Calvin Klein revenues were ahead of guidance and up 6% to the prior year on a constant currency basis, excluding the negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency. Negatively impacting revenues versus the prior year was the deconsolidation of our Mexico business which was worth approximately $15 million. Calvin Klein international revenues increased 13% on a constant currency basis, excluding the negative impact of 2% related to foreign currency with strong performance in Europe and China.","Heritage revenues for the first quarter were down 3% as guided. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.05 better than the top end of our previous guidance. The EPS beat was driven by a $0.06 business beat partially offset by $0.01 unfavorable FX. For the full year, we are currently anticipating that we will be negatively impacted by $0.35 per share due to foreign exchange. We have raised our guidance to reflect the stronger Euro and Pound, partially offset by a weaker Canadian Dollar and a weaker Brazilian Real. For the full year, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be $7.40 to $7.50 which is $0.10 higher than our previous guidance and reflects a $0.05 increase due to favorable FX and a 5% increase due to stronger business. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $0.35, we have constant currency earnings per share growth of 14% to 15% over the prior year. Overall we are projecting constant currency revenue to grow approximately 5% excluding the negative impact of 2% related to foreign currency. 2017 revenues would be negatively impacted by approximately $70 million related to our Mexico deconsolidation and approximately $80 million related to the transfer of the Tommy Hilfiger North America wholesale women's business.","2017 revenues will be positively impacted by a net amount of approximately $30 million related to the 2017 being a 53 week year, offset in part by the negative impact of the timing of the Chinese New Year. Overall operating margins are expected to increase approximately 30 to 40 basis points on a constant currency basis and to increase approximately 10 to 20 basis points on an as-reported basis.","We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 7% on a constant currency basis excluding the negative impact of foreign currency of 1% and including the negative impact of the Mexico deconsolidation. We are planning Calvin Klein operating margins to be relatively flat on a constant currency basis and to decrease 30 to 40 basis points on an as-reported basis. Our Calvin Klein earnings will be negatively impacted in 2017 mostly in the first half of the year by the continuation of the investments made in the latter part of 2016 related to brand investments in advertising and creative leadership changes.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 4% on a constant currency basis excluding the negative impact of 2% related to foreign currency and including the negative impact of the transfer of the North America wholesale business. Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned to increase about 100 basis points on a constant currency basis and to increase about 80 basis points on an as-reported basis.","Our Heritage business is planned to have relatively flat revenues versus the prior year. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 20 basis points. The impact of foreign currency on our Heritage business is relatively immaterial.","Our corporate segment expenses are planned to increase about 15%. The increase reflects low single-digit growth of our overheads as well as startup losses associated with new businesses. Interest expense for the year is planned to be at about $120 million compared to the prior year amount of $115 million. The increase is primarily the result \u20ac350 million bonds issued in June 2016. In 2017, we are planning to pay down about $250 million of our debt. Stock repurchases in 2017 are planned to be between $200 million and $250 million. And our tax rate for the year is planned at about 17.5% to 18%.","Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at the $1.60 to $1.63 and includes $0.07 of estimated negative impact from foreign currency. Excluding this negative impact, we are expecting earnings per share to increase 14% to 16% for the second quarter. Included in the second quarter is a planned $20 million increase in marketing expenses over the prior year, primarily in Calvin Klein. Revenue in the second quarter is planned to increase 7% on a constant currency basis excluding 2% for foreign currency. Negatively impacting revenue in the second quarter 2017 is the Mexico deconsolidation and the transfer of the Tommy Hilfiger North America wholesale women's business.","Calvin Klein revenues are planned at a 8% constant currency increase, excluding 2% related to foreign currency. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 4% constant currency increase, excluding a negative impact of 3% related to foreign currency. Heritage brand revenues are projected to increase 10% due to the timing of shipments, which move from quarter one into quarter two when comparing to 2016. And finally, interest expense is projected to be about $30 million and taxes 20% for the second quarter.","And with that, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go first to Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Bob Drbul","Good morning.","Manny Chirico","Good morning Bob.","Bob Drbul","Manny, when you look at the outlook internationally and you look at the strong order book for Tommy and Calvin especially in Europe, how confident are you in the order book, especially with some of the macro events that have occurred in Europe? And then the second question, can you detail a little bit around the digital growth being the strongest area? What's driving that and the opportunities that you see there?","Manny Chirico","Sure. I am very confident, very, very confident about the order book for the balance of the year. The trends have been, the order, as you know in Europe, orders really do stick and our sell-throughs, more importantly in department stores have been outstanding and that's been really at full price selling. So if anything, we are seeing retail is pulling goods earlier than the initial shipments that we have had and we have seen our direct business, EDI replenishment kind of business also accelerate. So I think the European wholesale business, we are very confident to see that moving forward.","And then I guess our retail trends in Europe in our own stores, both for Calvin and Tommy, are riding up double-digits. So we are very confident that the brand momentum continues. We haven't seen any significant impact based on some of the terrorist geopolitical activities that have gone on in Europe, if that's what you are referring to and most of news from a political point of view has been positive as well. So there hasn't been as much uncertainty and disruption in Europe. So Europe continues to look like a real bright spot for us as we go forward.","On the digital side, our job as brand managers is to make sure that our brands are well-positioned and in the appropriate channels of distribution. And right now, we are seeing stronger growth in the digital channels because that's where the consumer seems to be voting to shop, particularly for and what I would say is what we are really seeing is not so much shopping for fashion product, but really shopping more for the commodity or replenishment kind of product, highly profitable business online. And that's through our own e-commerce website and with some of our key partners, be that macys.com or some of our European retailers and then a number of the pure play retailers online as well. So our brand continues to be very much in demand in that channel of distribution.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you very much Manny.","Manny Chirico","Okay.","Operator","We will go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good morning and congratulations. I had a question, Manny, for you. As we talk about the North American wholesale landscape and clearly the environment of challenging foreclosure and level of inventory and the promotional activity in the channel overall, if you could just help us think about, over the next 12 to 24 months, how does your business mix in North America look from a wholesale perspective as you think about U.S. department stores, off price, specialty and then digital and some of the trends you were just referencing?","Manny Chirico","Okay. I think, well a couple of points. It's a volatile environment. But I think what we are seeing is, obviously digital growing and digital meaning both our brick-and-mortar partners as well as the pure plays, we are seeing significant growth there for our brand. I guess I would make take the point that if you think about a lot of the department store closures that is going on and Macy's is talking about closing about 100 doors and some of the other department store players. Our two big brands, Calvin and Tommy, really don't play in those closed stores in a significant way. We tend to be in the top 60% percent of doors, 70% of doors for most of our key department store account. So the store closures, per se, haven't had a dramatic impact on our Calvin and Tommy business.","On the specialty side, specialty continues to grow for us overall. Relatively speaking, it's a much smaller component of the business but a fast-growing component of the business with some key influencing retailers that, I think, really have a positive impact on your brand, especially with the younger consumer. The other area I would say is on the off-price channel, clearly off-price is growing. We try to really manage and balance our distribution into those channels. But as I look out 24 months, I think there is a good likelihood that digital will be a higher percentage of our business than it is today. Off-price and specialty will also be somewhat of a higher percentage than what they are today. And given what's going on in the department store channel, it will continue to shrink to some level, specially with some tenuous players that are out there right now that we continue to watch closely.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just with the Calvin Klein brand in Europe, you have talked historically about seeing that brand to about $1 billion over time. Could you just talk about some of the new category traction that you are seeing right now that's helping you get confidence towards that longer term target? And then, is there any structural reason like Calvin wouldn't be as big as Tommy in Europe over time, just given that you still have a lot of white space as to new category development?","Manny Chirico","Sure. I think the areas that we are seeing new categories, if you would want to call it, is accessories for us, which was a very tiny category when we took over the business, is much larger today and will continue to expand. On menswear business, men's sportswear, excluding jeans, so the refined sportswear and tailored component of the businesses also continues to grow at a very high percentage. But relative to Tommy is about 10%, 15% the size of the Tommy men's sportswear and tailored business. So clearly, there is a huge opportunity in men's sportswear to grow.","The other big area, I think, of growth would be the women's area where we have no refined sportswear in Calvin today. It's really just, from apparel point of view, it's really just the jeans opportunity. And the other area where we are raring is the performance area, that whole at-leisure area, which is very big for us in North America, growing very fast for us in Asia. We will be introducing that next year as well.","So when I look at Calvin as a brand and compare it to Tommy, everywhere else in the world, the Calvin business tends to be somewhat bigger than Calvin, anywhere from 150% to 300% in some parts of Asia. So clearly I don't see any reason why Calvin cannot be as big as Tommy over time. The key for us would be, I think the big key for us to get to that $2 billion market we would like to reach, the $1 billion mark is within reach for us with jeans, underwear, accessories, men's sportswear. To get to the $2 billion mark, we really have to take advantage of the women's opportunity that could be significant for us there. And I don't think we wouldn't launch that until 2018. And the other big opportunity obviously is in the performance area which I think could also be a very big area for us. So we are very enthusiastic about the growth in Europe and see it as a real opportunity for us over the next five years.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thank you guys and all the best.","Manny Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hi guys. Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter. I don't want to go too much into it, but on Heritage, that down about 3% in the first quarter up to 10% in the second quarter shift, that lands on about plus 3% in the first half. The guidance for the year is flat. So you are planning to back half down 3%? I am trying to understand a little bit more what's going on in that business? Where did that growth come from? You did raise the year a little bit. Would you mind talking about where the upside is coming from? And then maybe your assumption on what rolls off in the second half out there in the first half?","Manny Chirico","Sure. We have seen, I guess, three areas. We are seeing really strong business in our sportswear areas with first the IZOD business, particularly in the mid-tier and the Van Heusen business also in the mid-tier, mid-tier being the Kohl's, Penny's and the like. And that business has been very strong and we think we will see good performance throughout the balance of the year. In addition, our core intimates business led by Warner's continues to really be a very strong player for us. We have seen strong growth both in the mid-tier and in the mass market growth with Walmart and Target. So those are the two big areas that we growth and I think we could see better performance than potentially we are projecting if the trends continue through the second quarter into the second half of the year in Heritage. So we are feeling good about that business and we are managing the inventories tightly. As you know that's really a North America driven business. So we are really watching our inventories there given the volatility in the channels. But we seem to be outperforming the competitive set.","Michael Binetti","Okay. That's very helpful. And then backing up for second, just looking more broadly at your guidance for the company. It also implies that revenues only about 2% growth in the back half, off of over 4% in the first half. So as we start to look through some of the detail and North America sounds more stable, the international order books, I think, for the fall are much stronger than even the spring, you have got FX at your back now for the first time in a few years and then some of the headwinds from Tommy, G-III and Mexico start to go away in 4Q. So I guess the question is, what am I missing that the comparable would be lower in the second half versus first half? Just help us understand at a higher level the slower revenues in the second half?","Manny Chirico","Sure. Look, I think the biggest thing is, we are not planning for the retail comps in Europe and Asia to continue at such a high rate for the balance of the year. We have the inventory and we have the supply chain to continue to feed those businesses. But we are not planning Europe, both for Calvin and Tommy, which is growing, which grow in the first quarter at double digits to continue anywhere near that, probably planning at low single digits for the second half of the year. And we are not planning our China business, which is growing mid to high single digits, we are not planning those businesses to grow at that rate. We are planning those to grow at low single digits as well. So I guess I would leave it at that and one of the reasons we feel really confident about our guidance and how we are positioned for the year is I think with our retail businesses we are taking a prudent approach about how to plan those businesses. And I think there is opportunity to outperform in the second half of the year.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Great to know. Thanks for all the help and congrats again.","Operator","We will go next to Irwin Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Irwin Boruchow","Hi. Good morning and let me add my congrats as well.","Manny Chirico","Good morning.","Irwin Boruchow","So Manny, you have talked over the past several months on the potential border tax implications. I am just kind of curious, as you think about potential M&A for your business, would you need to see a resolution on that topic before you feel comfortable to pull the trigger on a potential deal? Or have you gotten more comfortable on the topic that you aren't as concerned as maybe you were a few months ago? Just curious how you think about those two dynamics together as it pertains to PVH?","Manny Chirico","Well. I guess I feel more confident today that the likelihood of the border tax, particularly the way it was initially drafted is not going to recur. And I don't have a crystal ball. I have been in Washington. My entire career, before this year, before this last 12 months, I think I have been in Washington three times. In the last 12 months, I have been in Washington multiple times. And I don't know if it's six, seven times meeting with different members of Congress and meeting with the administration when possible to really try to take a leadership position on this topic because I just think it's so bad, not only for our industry but I think it's just so bad for the economy in general. Since the consumer represents two-thirds of the economy, I think the last thing we want to do is put an import tax and start picking winners and losers as a country as we go forward. So I really tried to be front and center about it.","To answer your specific question, I think it does give me pause when I think about a large multibillion-dollar acquisition. To have so much uncertainty out there about the border tax, but also capital structure. Is interest deductible? And if it is, how do you -- I think we have been good at managing acquisitions and I think the financial team has been excellent at managing the balance sheet when we have made financial transactions like Tommy and Warnaco, the big deals and have done in a way that is highly efficient but also protects the company as we go forward.","It's hard to do that when you are not sure what the rules of the road are as you go forward. So a long-winded answer to, I think it does give me a little bit of pause to do a big deal and to pull the trigger on a big deal. But we continue to take back licenses, make investments internationally, do what's necessary to move forward the Calvin and Tommy businesses in particular and take care of opportunistic acquisitions in the hundreds of millions dollar value, I think we will continue to look at that strongly. That again, if a great opportunity comes along that is more expensive than that, it will force us to be maybe a little bit more conservative in capital structure. I don't think it will stop us from doing a deal. So I just feel that right now the way the wind is blowing in Washington, the likelihood of something like a border adjustment tax to be in a tax proposal, if they can even get anything done in Washington, is probably a long shot right now.","Irwin Boruchow","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","We will go next to Kate McShane with Citi.","Manny Chirico","Hi Kate. I think we lost Kate, operator. Could we go to the next one?","Operator","We will go next to John Kernan with Cowen.","John Kernan","Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Manny, can we talk about the 14% comp for Tommy Hilfiger? And I think it's the best you have put up since 2012. What's the drivers of that? Is it ticket driven? Is it traffic driven? And what do you think the outlook for that in the back half of year looks like?","Manny Chirico","Okay. It was ticket driven. It was conversion driven. It was not necessarily traffic driven. Traffic was positive but it was positive about 1%, maybe 1.5%. So it was clearly is much more driven, I guess the consumer as they came into the stores, they were more motivated to buy coming in and when they saw the merchandise, they were more motivated to spend and spend at a higher ticket price. A big part of that, I think, had to do with the fact that we didn't need to really promote significantly at all. So that was all very positive. So hopefully that gives you some color, John, as we go forward. So I think to put it in perspective, we saw very similar results in Europe with Calvin. Now Calvin's overall comp wasn't as high as Tommy's internationally and a lot of that has to do with the mix of the business. The Tommy business is probably 75% Europe, 25% Asia where the Calvin business is probably be reverse of that, 75% Asia and 25% Europe. And our European businesses for both were up double-digits and our Asia business was up for both mid single-digits despite having the Chinese New Year have a calendar shift in the first quarter. So very strong for both brands across the board and I think it gives us real confidence as we go into the second half.","John Kernan","Okay. And then just one follow-up. Calvin Klein was up over 13% in the first half of 2016. You are obviously lapping that now. I am just wondering what the outlook for Calvin in North America is as we go into the back half the year, you are now lapping a difficult comparison?","Manny Chirico","Well, okay, so our planned comp for Calvin and for Tommy for the second half of the year is, the second quarter is probably down low single digit and for the second half is probably down a similar amount, flat to down slightly. So that's how we have the business planned and we are hopeful that given that, you are absolutely right, the comparisons are easier we go into June and beyond that the trend will actually improve the first quarter trend. But we are trying to plan it conservatively.","John Kernan","Okay. Thanks. That's all.","Manny Chirico","Thanks John.","Operator","We will go next to Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole","Great. Thank you. Manny, you talked about some opportunities to expand the Calvin Klein brand into new categories. As you think about Europe and Asia, can you just talk about, if there are geographies where you are still in market development mode with Tommy and Calvin? And maybe what those countries might be? And what kind of opportunities they represent?","Manny Chirico","Sure. I think as we have talked pretty much about the Calvin opportunity, we are giving, what I would say, a three-year goal to get to $1 billion. Long-term, we think it is a $2 billion market for us. Today, it's a little bit over $600 million. So for us, when you think about a region that, by far, is the most underdeveloped region for Calvin Klein and clearly give us a huge opportunity with that brand. Both brands have big opportunities in Asia. Tommy's is bigger because it's about 50% the size of the Calvin business throughout Asia.","And the opportunity, particularly in Central Southeast Asia, we call it the CSAP area, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, the surrounding areas, that's a license business today, which we would like to operate at some point in time directly ourselves. It's run by a long-term partner that's done a really good job with it positioning the brand. I think if we were operating we would be more aggressive on growth and we can take it to another level. So there is a huge, big opportunity there. And then obviously, for China for both brands just continues to be a big opportunity for us and I think we will continue to see mid to high single digit growth out of China for the next five years.","The other area where we don't have an unlock for it today, but we really want to get to it, is Brazil for Tommy Hilfiger, Brazil as a market for Calvin is very successful, highly profitable. We have an outstanding management team and operating structure in Brazil. The Tommy business is operated in a joint venture with a partner that we don't believe can take the business to the level we needed to take it to. And we would like to work out of that arrangement over time for us and we think that's an opportunity. So we think that there is somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million to $50 million sales opportunity just in Brazil and then of course that opens up the rest of South America.","So that's where we see the big growth opportunities geographically for the brand. We think North America will continue to be a solid performer. It will be a market share gain. And the opportunity for Tommy in North America is on the women's side which G-III is operating. They are about 25% the size of Calvin business in women's in North America. So there is a real opportunity somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million to $750 million of sales on a wholesale basis that could be added to the business over the next five years and collecting royalties there would be very profitable for us and obviously profitable for G-III and we think they are the right partner to execute that.","Jay Sole","Great. That's super helpful. Maybe if I can ask one more about e-commerce. So you touched on some of your investments and CapEx this year that are deployed toward e-commerce. Can you talk about some of the achievements in the quarter and some of the milestones looking forward that you hope to achieve? And what you plan to [indiscernible]?","Manny Chirico","Yes. I think both for CK and for Tommy, I think there continues to be growth opportunities there for us. We have experienced significant growth and I think that should continue. I think couple of things. I think we really want to grow with our retail partners, the macys.com, nordson.com, Kohl's, JCPenney. We want to grow with Heritage brands and we want to grow with our Calvin brand. And we are working closer and more closely with them. You could see it in the results. A big part of our growth, despite what's going on in the market with those two brands, has really been on the retailer's dotcom sites making investments in presentation, driving consumers to their sites to transact product. It is a very profitable model for us and for them. But it's really profitable for us on a wholesale basis to service that business and work with them to back up the inventory. And as they get more of the efficiencies of running that online business with their brick-and-mortars, the markdown savings that we are both not totally taking advantage of, I think that businesses just becomes more profitable as well move forward.","The other play that we have globally is with some of the pure plays in Asia with Ali Baba, Tmall and JD.com. They are growing obviously over 20% each. They are becoming meaningful volume at a highly profitable level, given the business model that's there which is much more a wholesale model for us the way we look at it. In the United States with Amazon, our core commodity business has really continued to excel there and will continue to excel. The consumer likes shopping there. Brands are well-positioned in those channels and we are seeing double-digit growth with them as well. So those are the key milestones, the relationships, the learnings that we are getting. The infrastructure that we are building is only making us more comfortable with that business as we go forward. And we are really focused. We really have now, over the last 12 months, focused dedicated teams focusing on that channel of distribution, direct to the consumers ourselves and through our partners on a wholesale basis. And we think that's the right model going forward and the most profitable.","Jay Sole","Great. Thanks very much. That's really helpful.","Operator","We will go next to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane","Thank you. Can you hear me?","Manny Chirico","Yes. Kate, how are you? I am glad you are still with us.","Kate McShane","I am. I am sorry about that. I think there was some technical issue. But I just wanted to ask a question on inventories in the channel, at the outlets and the department store and any detail you could provide around full price selling during the quarter and your expectations for the rest of the year?","Manny Chirico","Okay. So on the inventory levels, I think you saw, our inventories overall are down 2% despite the sales growth we are planning. So I think clearly we are in a very clean position. We are in a bit of a chase mode right now globally and here also in North America. Inventory levels globally are in excellent position in just about every market. I am not going to micro manage into each one. But overall, when you look at international inventories, fantastic shape. When it comes to the United States, I think it's a little bit more mixed. But on balance, I think you are seeing is with the contraction of open to buy dollars that has well significantly exceeded the negative comp store trends that I think on balance inventories are in good shape in the channel. A lot depends in the next couple months, how we see the Father's Day and how we see that will progress, but there is not bi callouts right now about any inventories in the channel. Outlet, in general, our inventories are in fine shape. I would say that's become a highly promotional channel today and I think because there has been such contraction in the open to buy dollars, there is a lot more availability of merchandise in the outlet channel which has put pressure on margins overall. But if you look at it, we have kind of managed it really well. But there has been some pressure on margins, just to match the competitive environment and the promotions we see in the channel. So I hope that gives you some color.","Kate McShane","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted to ask on Tommy men's. I was curious if you could clue us in on any initiatives you might have from a marketing or product development piece for the fall? I know a lot of the focus and commentary has been on the great success that you just had on the women's side. But I just wanted to dig in a bit more on how you are thinking about evolving the marketing or other aspects of the brand for later on?","Manny Chirico","So if you think about the Tommy brand and the strength of the brand, the strength historically has been our men's sportswear business. And we have made, as you said, we have made a concerted effort to invest the last 12 months and continuing in the next two seasons behind the women's campaign and focused on the Gigi Hadid's campaign which has had a tremendous impact on our women's business but also on the brand overall. I think it's really moved us younger and we have not seen any negative impact from that campaign on the men's business. In fact, we believe it's actually been enhancing to our men's business overall because we have gone younger. I think what you are going to see going forward and I can't speak about it is campaign as we get into second half of this year for holiday and beyond where there will be a focused campaign with a celebrity endorser on the men's side of the business as well to balance some of the marketing that we have had gone on. I think the focus would probably be on tailored and underwear similar to the Rafael Nadal campaign, because I think that's a good way really to influence men's shopping. The team is working on it and we just can't talk about the talent that might be involved.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","One more.","Manny Chirico","Sure.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","On the cotton side, a couple of brands have called out better sourcing environment despite some recent moves in cotton just based on how their negotiations with factories are going. I was curios if you could just talk about how you are thinking about average unit cost ahead?","Manny Chirico","I think for the next six months, relatively flat to slightly down. A little longer perspective, if global demand continues to be as strong as it is, I think we might see some slight increase in cost as we go into spring 2018. I think all very manageable given what we see right now ahead of us. So I don't see a lot of noises around sourcing cost in general as we move forward for the next 12 months.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great. Thank you.","Manny Chirico","With that, operator, we will take one more question and then wrap it up so we can get back to try to move the business forward.","Operator","We will go next to Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley.","Jeff Van Sinderen","Good morning. I wondered if you can just kind of speak to us on your latest thinking around your domestic store fleet? What you think the right number of stores is? Maybe remind us how much the store fleet comes up for renewal each of the next two years? What are you seeing in terms of landlord willingness to make concession? Is there any shift there? Would it make sense selling toward a higher concentration of certain types of locations or stores or footprint or prices in the future? Thanks.","Mike Shaffer","So I guess when we think about our outlet business, which is predominantly where we operate in North America and I think that's what you are referencing, we do run businesses that has predominantly shorter leases on our lesser revenue driven stores. The highest buying stores, the most profitable stores tend to be very profitable and even though they have had some declines over the last 12 to 24 months, still remain very profitable. Those stores tend to have longer leases. The shorter leases are in the lesser profitable stores but they still make money. At this point, we have and continue to close any stores that don't perform well and there is very little growth in terms of outlet business in the U.S. in terms of new store growth. There is really not a lot on the comp.","In terms of occupancy, we continue to drive our rents down. That's the benefit of having these short-term leases. If the market deteriorates and if there is an opportunity, we do take it and we do go in and get rent reductions. We are also one of the larger tenants with those clientele.","Manny Chirico","I guess I would just add two points. I think as we look at store size going forward for stores that do open, we are looking for smaller stores that are more technologically advanced, more features in store where we can ship the customers at home and give them a broader range of product that doesn't necessarily have to be on the floor.","Secondly, in the full price area, we do have a number of stores. We are seeing some potential for better deals as we move forward and the economics seem to be working through as we start to have some discussions with landlords. Like anything else, the A and A-plus centers are still highly occupied, still in significant demand and with Calvin and Tommy, we are usually looking, if we are going to open, as we do open regular price, full price stores, we do look for the best real estate to present the brands in. So that's always going to continue to be a challenge.","And I guess I would just make the last point is, over the last three to four years we have been very proactive on our retail portfolio. Four years ago, we made the decision to sell our Bass business. We don't believe moderate priced brands have a long future in the outlet store environment, no matter how good the brands are. It's just a challenging environment to compete against international designer brands for the most part in those centers. And we also closed our IZOD retail portfolio. So between that, that's almost 300 stores that we closed very efficiently and did it in a timely manner, given what's going on in the retail world and I think we are much better off because of it. So we have tried to be ahead of the curve on some of these things as we looked at it.","Manny Chirico","With that, I am going to close. I am sorry. With that, I am going to close the conference call. Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to updating you in August about our second quarter results. Have a great holiday weekend and a good day. Take care.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"18360":["PVH Corp.

I'd like to introduce also on the call Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer; Dana Perlman, our Head of the Investor Relationships and our Treasurer; as well as Ken Duane, who run all of our Wholesales businesses throughout North America.","Overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the second quarter, which exceeded the top end of our earnings guidance by $0.07. In the second quarter, on a constant currency basis revenues increased 2% and EPS grew 11%. In the first half of 2015 there were significant sales shifts into the first quarter and out of the second quarter that makes comparisons to the prior year somewhat confusing.","So from a brand and business perspective, I plan to review the first half results in order to give you a better sense of the underlying sales trends, rest assured that, Mike Schaffer, in his comments will quantify and break down all of our second quarter financial results.","Overall, for the first six months of 2015 on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 3% and EPS grew 16%. This outperformance was driven by strong underlying results in our International Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. At the same time, we did see softness in our U.S. Calvin and Tommy retail businesses where a strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted international tourist traffic and spending in some of our largest stores located in tourist destination locations like Orland, Las Vegas, Miami and the New York Metropolitan area. At the same time, our retail stores located in U.S. permanent population locations continue to post low to mid single-digit same-store sales increases, which we were very encouraged by.","Moving into each of the brands; Calvin Klein, looking at the first half. On a constant currency basis, our CK revenues increased 4% over the prior year's first half driven by strong performance of our international businesses. From a retail comp sales perspective, international comps increased 6%, while North American comps increased 2% in the quarter and the half despite being negatively impacted by the international tourist traffic and spending.","The Calvin Klein brand continues to gain traction and is increasingly becoming more visible both digitally and at point-of-sale. Our fall marketing campaigns are out now with in-store signage and media and marketing launching as we speak. We have major initiatives before holiday. For jeans, our Meet Me campaign is about sexting and hooking up where we are digitally connecting with our customer which is right up the Calvin Klein DNA.","For women's underwear, our campaign, The Original Sexy features Kendall Jenner. Both campaigns are creating a lot of buzz around the market and we are connecting with our consumers to drive our commercial business. Globally, the underwear business continues to gain share in each market. Interestingly, our women's underwear sales trends for the first half are outpacing our men's sales trends worldwide. Men's, with our key spring launches of Intense Power and Air FX have been very well received with great sell-throughs. And for fall, we just launched our magnetic wait-band product with positively early indicators from sales. In North America, we have seen our 2015 men's market share grow by over 200 basis points with growth across all of our major retail partners.","Moving to women's, our Modern Cotton logo product continues to be the big story for women's, especially those under the age of 30. Along with our tailored bra offering by region, in which we have significantly grown over the last 12 months with our push-up styles leading the business in Asia, our Perfectly Fit style leading the business in Europe, and our new invisibles bra in North America driving sales gains. In North America, we have seen our 2015 women's market share grow by over 100 basis points with growth across all of our major retail partners.","Moving to jeans. We continue to make very good progress around the jeans turnaround in North America and in Europe. Women's jeans are still performing better than men's, but our women's business is significantly gaining traction. Over the last 12 months, we have installed in North America over 180 men's shops and over 100 women's shops, which are performing well above last year's levels. In men's, we're looking at sales increases in those shops in excess of 30%; and in women's, the sales are in excess of 25% in those shops.","We have also expanded our distribution to include Urban Outfitters globally and Topshop in Europe. These two retailers target a younger consumer than our traditional department store consumer. We've delivered some initial capsules first 625 (07:21) and have seen significant sell-throughs with great performance at Urban, and we have seen significant re-orders and expansion of doors as we move into the holiday season. We're very excited about this business as it opens up our brand up to a much younger consumer.","In Europe, we have seen a significant improvement in same-store sales as well as where we have installed new shops or have re-fitted our existing base, particularly in London and Rome our sales performance is running well ahead of our comps which are in the double-digit area. Our Calvin Klein Asia jeans business continues to be very healthy with solid performance throughout the first half, which is best documented by our comp store performance in that region.","We have also seen very strong performance in many of the other Calvin Klein product categories. For the first half of 2015, our Calvin Klein royalty revenue has increased by over 11%. This strong performance is driven by our women's apparel, our women's footwear, and our accessory businesses in those areas.","These categories are posting mid-teens sales increases in all the major retailers throughout North America. This business is predominantly run by Jimlar and (08:52) and they are seeing great sell-throughs at this time on those product categories.","Moving to Tommy Hilfiger. The business there for the first half of 2015, revenues on a constant currency basis increased 3% over the prior year. The increase was driven by solid performance in our international businesses, which grew 4% in the first half of 2015, including a 6% comp store increase throughout Europe.","At wholesale, our Tommy European business continues to outperform the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 full year European order books, excluding Russia, are running up 5% for the year. The strongest markets continue to be Germany, the UK, France, and the Middle East. In North America revenues increased 1% resulting from retail square footage growth partially offset by a 2% decrease in retail comp store sales. Our Tommy business continues to perform well despite the pressure on the retail business in the U.S. market, primarily driven by the lack of international tourists in our tourist destination locations.","As we have previously mentioned, this fall we have Rafael Nadal as our brand ambassador. And, boy, did he make a big splash in Bryant Park on Tuesday for the kick-off our fall underwear and fragrance campaign. We believe that Rafael's association will be a positive for our overall men's business, but certainly will lift our underwear business globally. Our fall order books reflects this uptick in our underwear business, and Rafael will continue as our brand ambassador for spring 2015 where the focus will be on tailored clothing, and our initial order results in that category continue to be very strong.","Moving to our Heritage business. First half revenues for the Heritage businesses were relatively flat while operating income increased about 3%. This increase was driven by our Heritage Sportswear businesses which continue to perform well both at wholesale and retail. We've also seen strong performance in our Warner's core intimate business particularly in the mid-tier channel distribution where we have seen our year-to-date market share grow by over 100 basis points. Our dress shirt business continue to perform \u2013 underperform in the first half of the year. However, we believe that business will significantly improve in the second half of the year.","New fall product deliveries, especially our Van Heusen Flex Collar has seen stronger sell-throughs in August and give us confidence in our second half sales increases for dress shirts. Let me take a moment and talk about our early third quarter back-to-school sales trends. Our International Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger business continues to post strong sales.","By region, we are seeing very strong performance for Europe and China for both brands. In Korea and Brazil, where we have a large Calvin Klein business, sales trends continue to be challenging as we are being negatively impacted by the macroeconomic environment for each of those countries.","Overall, international same-store sales are up mid-single digits at Tommy Hilfiger and are up low-single digits at our Calvin Klein business.","Moving to our wholesale business in Europe, our order book for spring 2016, excluding our Russia business is projected to be up 4% to 5% at Tommy and is up about 15% at Calvin Klein as our marketing initiatives are starting to pay dividends along with our new product deliveries.","In North America, we are dealing with a later back-to-school selling season, due to a weak later Labor Day Holiday, which is making it more difficult to read the business. Our retail same-store sales are running negative low-single digit at Calvin Klein and negative mid-single digit at Tommy Hilfiger. Those two businesses are running on plan given the later back-to-school season and are continue to be impacted by international tourist traffic and spending.","Before I turn it over to Mike, I just want to focus on some of the key initiatives we outlined at the beginning of the year. As we move over the next three years, our objectives will be capturing the long-term revenue and profit opportunities for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands.","There are really four key initiatives that we hope to accomplish over the next three years that you should be monitoring as we go forward. The first is to continue to invest in product, presentation and the marketing of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. Second, we continue to invest in our global operating platforms to support our growth strategies, including key investments in our digital commerce systems and platforms. Third, significantly improving operating results of the Calvin Klein European business over the next three years. Although we have seen strong performance there, we believe we have a long way to go to reach the comparable levels of profitability that exist at our Tommy Hilfiger business for the \u2013 in the European market, and this is a big opportunity for us as we move forward. And fourth is to continue to invest in the expansion of the presence of both brands in Asia and Latin America, including more direct control over the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licensing businesses, where we can maximize our core competency to increase sales and improve the overall profitability of both brands.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the second quarter results.","Michael A. Shaffer - EVP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in the press release. On a constant-currency basis, revenues for the second quarter were up 2% versus prior year and ahead of our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 3% constant currency increase over the prior year.","Our Calvin Klein International business was up 7% in constant currency, driven by strong wholesale shipments and international retail comps at 3%. Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold and we are seeing improved performance, particularly in gross margin and in our international businesses.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 5% in constant currency, also ahead of our guidance with strong revenues in our international business, which had revenues up 6% in constant currency, and Europe comps up 9%. Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein U.S. retail stores located in international tourist destinations continue to be under pressure from a lack of traffic and spending, but these declines were more than offset by performance in other areas of these brands.","Our Heritage business revenues were down 6%, also ahead of guidance and heavily influenced by the earlier-than-planned wholesale shipments, which benefited quarter one as well as the launch of IZOD at Kohl's in last year's second quarter.","Earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.37, a $0.31 negative impact related to foreign currency and expected weakness in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 11% over the prior year. Our Q2 EPS was $0.07 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.07 beat was comprised of $0.10 related to business outperformance, which was predominantly at Calvin Klein, and an interest expense benefit of $0.02, partially offset by $0.05 of headwinds related to taxes and FX.","For the full-year 2015, we raised our guidance and are now projecting earnings per share at $6.90 to $7, which includes an additional $0.05 hit for foreign currency versus our previous guidance. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in our Russia business of $1.30, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 12% to 14% over the prior year.","We also raised our revenue guidance. We are now projecting revenues to grow approximately 4% on a constant-currency basis. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase about 10 basis points to 20 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to foreign currency.","Driving the growth, when excluding foreign currency, is continued improvement in the Calvin Klein business, which is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant-currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 80 basis points to 90 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 40 basis points of FX.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 4% on a constant-currency basis with operating margins planned down 60 basis points to 70 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 80 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger International operating margins are planned up with North America operating margins planned down after excluding FX. This is due to pressure on U.S. stores located in international tourist locations.","Our Heritage businesses plan to have a revenue decrease of 3%, due mostly to our exiting of the IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 70 basis points to 80 basis points. The impact of foreign currency in our Heritage business is relatively immaterial.","Interest expense for the year is planned to be about $120 million when compared to the prior year amount of $139 million due to our average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in last year's first quarter. We currently expect to generate approximately $450 million of free cash flow in 2015. This will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for opportunistic stock repurchases and our license buybacks.","Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 21.5%. Our revenue for the third quarter is planned at 3% on a constant currency basis. By business, we're estimating that third quarter revenues on a constant currency basis to increase 7% for Calvin, 4% for Tommy Hilfiger, and to decrease 5% for Heritage brands.","Heritage brands' revenues are being negatively impacted by the closing of our IZOD Retail Division. Third quarter earnings per share is planned at $2.45 to $2.50 and includes approximately $0.40 of estimated negative impact from foreign currency and a decline in our Russia business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS is projected to increase 11% to 13% over the prior year. Interest expense for the quarter is planned at $30 million and taxes about 18% in the third quarter.","And with that, we'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Bob Drbul from Nomura.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bob.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, Manny. Maybe a couple of questions for you. The first one, I guess, China is top of mind; I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more in terms of what you are seeing in China? And I guess with some of the macro trends present, does that speed up or change the potential for the license buyback opportunities that's there?","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I guess, let me start with part one of that question, which was the business in China. Our business in China both for Calvin, that we operate directly, our comps have been running between mid single digit to high single digit for the first six months of the year, and that trend is more or less continued into \u2013 through August so far.","The challenge is \u2013 trying to operate that business is, trying to get beyond a lot of the noise that's going on from the stock market point of view and where we see the business moving and going. So you can't help, but look at that business and be a little bit more conservative about how we project that business out both through the balance of this year and then moving into 2016 and beyond. So it just gives us pause.","We've seen how the luxury market has been hit from the sales point of view. We haven't experienced anything like that. I think our brands are \u2013 both Calvin and Tommy are very well positioned in that market as premium brands, affordable luxury. So I think that works to our advantage and we are \u2013 we have strong brands that are really executing from that point of view.","On point two, on Tommy, potentially we're acquiring the 55% of the Tommy Hilfiger license business that we don't own throughout China which is very healthy and very profitable. I don't think \u2013 I try not to make those macro issues really impact that decision. Strategically, it makes all the sense in the world for us to own that business. I think from a valuation point of view, although that market has taken hits \u2013 if you look at PEs or valuations (23:28), they're still relatively high. So we will be diligent as we look at that. But, clearly, one of our goals would be to own that business sooner rather than later. It just makes too much sense from a brand point of view; and I think financially, it should be a nice transaction for us.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Manny. And I guess the second question that I have is on some of the commentary you made around the back-to-school period, maybe just discuss a little bit more around the trends that you're seeing. I guess is it your retail stores and is it your wholesale partners, and sort of how much of a pickup you expect to see with the later Labor Day, and sort of how that's incorporated in the third quarter estimates that you've provided this morning?","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think just to talk about how we plan the business. From the beginning of the year, we've always planned August negative, low single-digit, negative kind of comps because of the shifts that we see. And we're planning September more aggressively and higher positive, mid to high single-digit. When you put both months together, I think you get a much more natural feel for the business running \u2013 continuing to run up low single digit positive comps in our own businesses and at retail, generally speaking.","I think \u2013 geographically, I think it's much more of a Northeast, Southeast phenomenon with the whole back-to-school being somewhat later. I think as you move across the country, some of those schools come back earlier. And since most of our retailers and ourselves have a concentration of business in those regions, it's having a significant impact on trying to read business. I think when we get to September 15 or whatever, we'll have a real clear understanding of how this back-to-school period is trending. But I think, generally speaking, everyone has planned it to be somewhat later as we've gone forward.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much, Manny.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from David Glick of Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Manny, congrats on the progress. My first question was on Calvin Klein. Obviously, you're seeing some acceleration in your business. Looking at your guidance, it does imply a ramp-up in the fourth quarter. I just wonder if you could touch on what is driving that increase? You talked about a strong order book, but what gives you the confidence that you can see that kind of acceleration? And what does that mean for the business going forward? Can we see an acceleration in the Calvin Klein growth rates to levels that you guys have talked about as your goals going forward? Thanks.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think there's two things really going on. I think \u2013 three things. I think the underlying business just continues to perform very strongly. So we're really seeing the kind of sales performance that we've seen at retail with \u2013 in jeans and underwear. As you could imagine, when you're getting the kind of sales increases we've gotten, we've been chasing business all year. We really get into a position where we could fulfill at, what we would feel like an acceptable rate of consumer demand, particularly in underwear which is replenishment business, really starts as we get into the holiday season, probably late September, early October. So I think you're seeing a bit of that. So the real healthy trends in the underlying business.","We also had some pretty significant square footage growth in Calvin, and Tommy to a degree, due to the transfer in North America of our IZOD stores to the Calvin Klein Underwear and Accessory stores. So square footage growth there that'll really come in in the holiday selling season which is very strong. And then last thing is, internationally, even with all the strength, we are going to benefit in the fourth quarter like everyone else from early Chinese New Year, which really impacts a lot of the Asia markets. It's about two weeks to three weeks earlier this year and you'll get \u2013 you get two things happening; you'll get earlier actual retail sales in the stores that we are operating, but also because of the early Chinese New Year, wholesale shipments are falling into January out of February. So there's a little bit of timing shift that we have to just deal with every year with Chinese Year. But underlying business just continues to be very strong.","Looking into 2016, we're not getting into all the guidance discussion about it, but obviously there's momentum in the Calvin Klein business. And we think that momentum will help us offset, partially offset some of the headwinds we're seeing with continued pressure on FX, particularly on a transaction basis going forward from inventory purchases in some of our foreign markets, Europe, Brazil, Mexico, and Canada. So we've talked about those issues; so that's in front of us in 2016.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. That's a good segue into my next question in terms of your ability to offset that. You've talked about managing SG&A, taking some price increases and potential AUC reductions. I'm wondering if the devaluation we're seeing in the Chinese currency is enhancing your ability to increase the percentage of transactional FX that you may be facing next year?","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the Chinese currency impact has been relatively small. It's about a 3% reduction. So, I mean, that is what \u2013 at this point, what that might portend as the world \u2013 as you extrapolate that and if there's more pressure on the Chinese currency, clearly that might make an opportunity for fall 2016 and beyond. But right now, at this point, with the pressure you're seeing on labor rates offset by some currency benefit, it's very marginal, just on that particular front.","You hit the three \u2013 the three buckets we really are trying to focus on. As you can imagine, the challenge, the biggest challenge we're looking at is, how aggressive to raise prices particularly in a world, as you look out there that is facing extraordinary deflationary pressure in just general terms across a \u2013 the ways most economists speak, the biggest concern is deflation, not inflation.","So the challenge we're facing, although our cost increase, let's say, in Europe or Canada are increasing anywhere from 12% to 18%, because a big piece of that being currency offset by some products savings, how much can you raise prices in one season? And that continues to be an ongoing discussion with our retail partners. And we'll give more color to that as we get into the end of the third quarter going into the fourth quarter. But we talked about that, that there'll be pressure in the neighborhood just on a pure mathematical basis, in excess of $1 a share in 2016. And we're hoping to be able to offset \u2013 partially offset some of that. So that's where we are right now, David.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Last quick question on dress shirts, not your largest business obviously, but it did have a pretty sizeable negative impact on your fourth quarter last year. You talked about the Flex Collar, I'm just wondering how big an innovation that is and how broadly you can extend that production innovation across your wide array of brands and programs? And is this the kind of thing that could be like athletic fit was for you or fitted, or how are you viewing this new product?","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's a great callout, and our dress shirt business is a $500 million business, and it's \u2013 really, we went after the production innovation. You saw it at MAGIC (31:56) but if you go into stores now you'll see it principally with the Van Heusen. There's a million units on the floor which is significant of this new product and this new technology that we have a patent on to use.","So we are seeing really a strong response to it. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, it's three weeks of selling. It's \u2013 as you would expect, it's at the three key retailers, Kohl's, Penney's (32:25) and Macy's in a substantial way and it's a getting a reaction. And we're getting \u2013 it is a little bit more expensive product and we're able to get a higher retail price on it.","So we're tracking the business. We have the pipeline and the sourcing network in order to go really after the business in 2016 if it really starts to roll out, and we'll focus on some of our other owned brands where we may employ that technology where it makes sense. So it is a real innovation for the dress shirt business. And I think we're going to try to take advantage of it as the market leaders.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Joan Payson from Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Joan.","Michael A. Shaffer - EVP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Hi, Joan.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Manny, could you talk a little bit \u2013 I think you've mentioned China; but more broadly for 2016, are there any other potential headwinds that you would foresee and how do those compare to this year?","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I guess, Joan, the biggest headwind we face, cut through it all, is currencies. And then I guess fundamentally currencies are usually \u2013 I mean, there's a lot \u2013 I don't want to play economist, but those are usually indicative of what's going on in the underlying economies. So on a \u2013 the biggest market for us is Europe. It has gone through some macro issues, but we're actually seeing positive sales trends in Europe. We believe that economy is coming back and that consumer is re-engaging. The challenge we are facing in Europe for 2016 will be cost increases that are double-digit cost increases, and how much of that is reasonable in one or two seasons to pass on to the consumer. That's the biggest challenge we're facing in Europe.","As you get into some of the other markets that you talked about, some of the emerging markets, Brazil, Brazil for us has been a \u2013 for Calvin Klein, in particular, and Tommy is just really getting started with a joint venture there, we've seen over the last five years dramatic growth in that market; but, clearly, as we are planning 2016, we are planning that business flat to down slightly, and that is just different than what we've had to do over the last five years. And it's totally a reflection of what's going on in that macro environment, how that consumer is being impacted by everything politically and economically that's going on in that business. So I think, in some regards, given that we were \u2013 we, as an international brand, are really a pioneer in Brazil developing a business, we are probably more impacted by that business as we go forward.","The China market continues to be a growth market for us. We continue to expand there. We continue to add square footage. We continue to expand our brand offering throughout China, both Calvin and Tommy as those businesses develop. The challenge there is, it's more of a what's going to happen question and how much growth is there. Clearly, this is not the heydays of three years ago where, from 2007 to 2010, the business grew 15% topline. We are planning the business to grow more mid-single-digits. I think that's reasonable. We are currently outperforming that, but there's just a lot of noise in the environment.","So I guess the biggest thing we're dealing with is uncertainty and what that does to \u2013 potentially does to the consumer, how that forces us to plan our business, and reacting to the macro-environment. But I think, as a brand, as a company, we are as well-positioned as anyone to really weather those headwinds. So our portfolio of brands gives us diversification. Our geographic diversification is second to none, which I think is a long-term success. Although in this market, the more North America you are, the better you are. But I think on a long-term basis, being the global powerhouse brand is the place to be. So we are just dealing with a lot of those macro issues. That's the biggest headwind we're dealing with.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then you also mentioned the digital initiatives as being a big program over the next three years. Could you just provide an update on how big those online businesses are at this point and what rate they're growing at?","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I guess, what I would \u2013 I'm not going to really quantify in total, but I would describe all of our online direct businesses as small. Add it all up, $150 million in sales just taking everything into consideration. It's growing dramatically, but again off of a small base. And we really target that as a growth area.","In the Calvin Klein area, in particular, if you think about pre-Warnaco acquisition, we were a licensor. And getting the model right internationally in e-commerce platform, direct e-commerce platform was very difficult as a licensee with so many different partners doing business, and Warnaco being the biggest partner at the time.","Post-acquisition, that focus has completely changed. We now control probably \u2013 in apparel, we probably control 65% of the categories today, and with our relation with G-III, are able to really aggressively go after the women's area as well.","So that's been the area where the biggest investments have been made. We now have active, highly functioning, performing e-commerce direct-to-consumer platforms in China, throughout most of Asia, Europe, launching in Brazil, launching in Mexico, North America obviously both brands, Tommy and Calvin are really \u2013 are there. And now we're making those connections with the consumer that needs to be made, not only from a commercial point of view.","But today, I would say between Calvin and Tommy, 60% of our marketing budget are directed at digital marketing, and connecting with the consumer there, converting them to our in-store platforms, our wholesale customers' in-store \u2013 online platforms or our own brick-and-mortar stores as well. So it's really a 360 campaign. It's requiring capital investment. There's no doubt about that. But those \u2013 that's just the price of growth and where we are and it's factored into all of our plans as we go forward.","So it's a big opportunity and it's \u2013 both an opportunity for us to sell direct to the consumer, but also sell through our key wholesale accounts, our e-commerce platform where we're really seeing growth. And if you look at our dot com business with some of our partners, those businesses are up depending on the player anywhere from 30% to 50%. So clearly, our penetration continues to grow online.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you and congrats on the progress during the quarter. Manny, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the denim business? I mean the category broadly has seemed to have a little bit of a resurgence and it seems that there's also been better pricing integrity in the category of late. So maybe can you share a bit more about the Calvin Klein traction you're seeing, in particular the inflection in women's? And then, what are you seeing broadly right now in terms of AURs and just how you're planning the promotional side of that business?","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So I think is \u2013 let's talk about North America first. I think we're clearly seeing both growth in men's and women's, we're seeing much better sell-throughs, more regular priced sell-throughs, or prices that are first kind of markdown. Denim is a category that will be promoted no matter what your brand is. But I think what we're really seeing is, it's been a cycle for the last \u2013 going into this year, last three or four years where particularly in the women's side, men's has been more stable, but women's in particular, it's been really a sharp decline in overall market share in denim. And what that's really done is, as you move through seasons where inventory historically had been building up, it's required more promotions, more clearance, and a real takedown in AURs overall for the season. For the last nine months in our jeans business, our AURs are up about 20% in men's and women's in North America.","I think that's a sign of health in the overall denim market, but also a lot of the initiatives that we have in place that have moved the product up, improved the product. I'm optimistic about the category as it moves forward, because it's an important category for every retailer, and it's historically been one of their most profitable category; so there's a real focus on continuing to focus on that area.","And on the women's side, in particular, there's been a lot of product innovation around stretched jeans, really trying to take advantage of that whole at-leisure as it relates to a denim component of that. So we're really starting to see the knit jeans really starting to become a bigger component of the business as well.","So for Calvin, we've always had a very healthy top denim business, which seems counterintuitive. It's really about re-establishing our bottoms business where we are significantly under-developed against the competitive set. Where most of our competitors set like a Levi's and some of the other brands denim bottoms would represent well in excess of 50% of their overall sale, and for Calvin, it's been hovering around 30%, moving into 40%. So there's a huge bottoms opportunity that I think our fits now are much more well-defined, the consumer is starting to re-find us, and I think it's \u2013 it's like anything else with denim, it's really a fit issue as well. As that consumer starts to wear the product, starts to have a positive response to products, they become a more loyal consumer. And I think we are price positioned right in the sweet spot of the market. We are not sitting at some $200 denim prestige that represents 5% of the market. We are a designer denim jean that is going out the door $59 to $89 in North America. That's a real sweet spot for all department stores and we're really starting to see it.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess just following up on some of the unique partnerships you guys have announced recently both with Opening Ceremony for Calvin, but then also some of the distribution like Urban Outfitters you mentioned and Topshop. Can you just elaborate on maybe some of the other opportunities that from a retail perspective that these ones are kind of showcasing whether there's new accounts to be getting into or kind of deeper business within these existing kind of newer distribution opportunities?","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I think that \u2013 the channel you just spoke about, that specialty denim \u2013 specialty store denim business which really targets the teenage consumer through maybe 30-year-old consumer \u2013 to do business there is very healthy and could be very profitable. But even more important is, what it means about the brand and your positioning with the consumer. And I think obviously all the \u2013 every major department store, both in Europe and in North America, when you sit down with them, what they continue to talk about is trying to continue to try to attract a younger consumer.","I don't think it's any surprise to anyone that department stores tend to skew somewhat older. And I think if your brand can be more relevant \u2013 the Calvin brand continues to be more relevant to younger consumer given our strong position in some of the specialty retailers, I think \u2013 and our strong underwear component which is usually introduction to a consumer, that is, by far, our youngest consumer. If you have that connection between underwear and jeans, I think your brand now becomes more relevant to younger consumer.","So the opportunity with some of the retailers you talked about, Urban Outfitters, with Topshop, particularly The Buckle as we move forward, some other players Opening Ceremony, you mentioned, it's as much \u2013 it's as important as it is commercially. It's also very important from a brand positioning point of view how we connect with the younger consumer, how we connect digitally, how we sell online for that consumer.","So we're seeing really great growth there. And it just makes our brand relevant to that consumer and I think it makes us a cool brand that will be \u2013 will see stronger sell-through. So it's just, I think, another indication of \u2013 if we're in that channel of distribution, the product has to be right. You don't get accepted into that channel of distribution unless your product is positioned appropriately.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thank you. That's helpful. I'll let someone else jump in. Best of luck.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Manny, could you just help us understand the big inflection in the Tommy same-store sales in the quarter, particularly the inflection to 9% in Europe as a particular standout? Maybe a little help on whether you think, hey, that was simply good execution from the team in the quarter or if there were some changes that you made that we should think about as more of a medium-term tailwind?","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's hard to say. Let me start with that. So we had a really good second quarter selling season. You could make a case of \u2013 well, as we moved into August, your comps have decelerated from plus 9% to mid single-digits. But I think some of that is the fact that it was such a successful first half of the year full-priced selling, we had significantly less merchandise to promote and sell off during the traditionally sales seasons throughout Europe. So we just weren't as aggressive in July and August from a promotional calendar, because we didn't need to be, and I think we managed our gross profit.","So as we're turning into August and that's starting to wind down, we're seeing business continue to improve. So I think there's two things going on. I really think our line is fantastic. I think the consumer is connecting with it. I think the product is right. But I also think that there's also something just going on in the overall environment. In Europe, I think there's two basic things. I think the environment is improving. And I think because of the currency situation that's going on, I think a lot more Europeans are staying home. And by staying home, I mean, I think they're vacationing this summer within Continental Europe and UK where their euros are buying more, where if they come to the United States, forgetting everything else, their hotel and food, just from a currency point of view, is up 20% to 25%.","So I think we're benefiting from that. We're also, I think, benefiting from the fact that our Chinese consumer or Asia consumer instead of being in the United States is more so in Europe. And as you \u2013 I was in Paris and I was in Amsterdam this last month, you could see the tourism boom that's going on there and helping their economy.","So long-winded way to say, I think, the underlying product and the brand strength continues to be second to none particularly in Europe for the Tommy Hilfiger brand. And then, I think the environment continues to improve and that consumer is back out, opening up their wallets and spending money, and we are getting a larger share of that.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then on the Calvin business particularly in North America wholesale, that's been hovering \u2013 I mean, you helped us isolate a few datapoints that have caused some noise in there, like shifts, but it's been hovering plus or minus flat range for a while. And with all the growth and inflecting demand from retailers even talking to us about it's not exactly intuitive why the reported results are still hovering around the flat range. I'm trying to think backwards through the moving parts that are in the baseline there and what's causing that number to remain flattish?","And more specifically, are there some things that you would point out to us that start to roll off over the next few quarters from that baseline that remove some headwinds that are going to make the growth rate of that North America business sound a lot more like what we \u2013 what it sounds to me like you're trying to tell us the underlying run rate of the business is as you started relaunching product?","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Look, Michael, I think there's a lot of noise in numbers because of currency and everything else, that's the point one. I think point two is, we have consistently been talking about cleaning up distribution, closing doors, but also \u2013 even in some of our best accounts as much as \u2013 we've opened square footage and we have expanded in top doors and we just didn't think a brand belonged in some \u2013 a lot of the bottom doors. So there's been that ongoing issue.","And I've also talked about the fact that we've been chasing business constantly. So you don't necessary see it all on the topline, although there has been topline growth. What you've really seen is, I think is in the operating margins in the business despite the currency impact which is taking that away, but the operating margins of the business just continued to improve. So I think the inflection point I touched on is really fourth quarter. I think you'll start \u2013 that you start to see that more, and, hopefully, as we go into 2016, we see our order books really starting to improve significantly in North America.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So it's at least somewhat related to removing distribution and the year-over-year headwind that that causes. That will connect that to I think David's question earlier where it says this is how we get to the business (51:37).","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mike and Dana just handed me a notice. We report North America and when you add \u2013 Canada's currency is down 20%. So that's a 20% increase before \u2013 and Mexico is down 18%. When you factor that in, when we put all in it, it's just part of the drag that's on the business as we go forward from currency.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And if I could just ask one last quick follow-up. I think you mentioned last night on television that maybe a six months to nine months' timeframe as far as looking at licenses, help us think about it? At this point \u2013 I don't know if anybody has reminded that you said that, but at this point...","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, now they are.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","You can't go on TV and expect us to forget, Manny. So at this point \u2013 can you help us think about what influences timeframe on that? Is it \u2013 look, typically, in the past these licenses have been set so that everybody is happy with the terms when it gets executed and it's a negotiation, or is it more set by when licenses roll off at this point? Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a good question. I guess, when you're on that show with Jim Cramer, it does get a little crazy at times. So \u2013 but again, not to put too definite a timeframe on things.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Sure.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Nothing has really changed. Buying back licenses, it's a delicate situation. You've had a partner usually for a number of years that's built a business and clearly has (53:07) created value for the brand and for themselves. So there needs to be a reasonable negotiation that goes on, so that you secure a business and don't have a \u2013 you don't want to have a situation where you break a license or just terminate the license at the end and just take back the business. I think there's too many examples of that where you wind up leaving money on the table and hurt the underlying business. That's not our goal. Our goal is to negotiate a fair reasonable transaction with our partners, and to do it in a way that doesn't economically hurt them. But more importantly, from our perspective really gives us a business that's ongoing with momentum in it as we go forward. And that's the push and the pull that goes on there.","So clearly, the biggest driver of that is licensing term. If somebody has got two years to three years to go on a license and you've clearly given them an indication that the plan is to bring it back in. That's a very reasonable negotiation to go on.","If somebody has eight-years to 10 years or 20 years depending on the situation, it's a much more challenging discussion similar to the kind of discussions we had with Warnaco when we wanted to buy their business back besides the complication of being a public company, it was a very long-term license, so there's much more value there that had to be determined.","So this is really about sitting down with partners with more or less, for the most part, short-term licenses balances left, probably only exception to that is China, where really are trying to come up with a reasonable way and a smooth transition. So I believe over the next (54:57) 2015 and 2016 we'd be very disappointed if you haven't seen some progress in that area \u2013 beginning process of bringing some of those businesses in. And when that starts I think it become obvious what the next potential licensee take back would be. And those would be very strategic and accretive transactions as we move forward.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks. Outstanding quarter guys. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from John Kernan from Cowen & Co.","John D. Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to ask a question. Calvin Klein operating margin internationally has been fantastic in the first half of this year in the face of a lot of currency pressure. Calvin Klein North America margins has been under significant pressure. Just trying to understand what's driving the Calvin Klein International operating margin at this point? Is it European margin recovery and where you stand right now for profitability in Europe? I think when you bought the business from Warnaco it was not making any money. So just a little color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Michael A. Shaffer - EVP, Chief Operating & Financial Officer","Look, in the Calvin Klein business, we operate in both Asia and in Europe on the international margins. The Asia business continues to perform. The margins there are very healthy. And on the European business, we've talked over a three-year period getting someplace closer to 10% operating margins. We're on that trajectory. But those margins today are still \u2013 they're positive but relatively small at this point. So we've seen expansion in both, but the European margins are still relatively small and we're still at the beginnings of the turnaround.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mike said it perfectly. The relative improvement has been taking a loss in Calvin Klein Europe over the last two years to a profit, but still below what anyone would think as acceptable. And we really haven't been \u2013 so the currency impacts that we've gotten hit with, have hit the topline and the bottom lines are proportionately the same. So operating margin haven't really contracted significantly or at all there yet. That starts really in the second half of the year where the product course component of FX as our hedges start to roll off, particularly in the fourth quarter and then into 2016. That's where operating margins would be more impacted as we go forward from that point of view. So I think that kind of lays it out.","John D. Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then if I could just thematically ask one more question. We noticed a lot of the global lifestyle brands increasing distribution on Amazon. So just wondering what your strategy is with Amazon? I know they're making a big push into fashion. It seems like almost all your \u2013 there is some Tommy and Calvin product on Amazon at this point. Just wondering what your strategy is there.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our Amazon business has grown geometrically. Our Calvin Klein Underwear business in particular is by far the largest selling underwear on the Amazon site, as you would expect giving them that product category. So they're a great partner. We really manage that very closely from \u2013 making sure it's brand enhancing. We just don't want goods on the site. We want the brand experience on the site. And they've been very good at getting us that. So, we've really attacked it regionally both here in North America and in Europe and we would expect that customer to be a significant growth area for us for both Calvin and Tommy over the next three years, and trying to manage that distribution, so it doesn't become in any way brand negative.","John D. Kernan - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. That's great. Congrats on all the momentum. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a terrific quarter. As the underwear business certainly seems to be very strong in gaining market share in both men's and women's, is it expanded distribution, is it the celebrity advertising programs you have, is it margins improving also, how do you see the go-forward for that underwear business? Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dana, I would say in North America besides the \u2013 some of the \u2013 in underwear, besides some of the specialty stores that we've added, it's basically same customer base. But the \u2013 if you walk into the store, the exposure has just grown. So there's been a continuing expansion of the square footage and that's directly aligned with new product innovations, new product has been delivered.","On the women's side of the business, we always had a very strong bottoms, panty business. The focus has really been to grow the bra business, which from a price point is four times the unit cost of panties. So the growth has really been \u2013 to really try and grow that square footage.","So if you go into Macy's Herald Square, you'll see a women's shop that's 2,500 square feet, you'll see a men's shop that's 2,500 square feet, we are clearly their largest brand there, and I think with the best positioning on the floor; on men's yes; and on women's trying to move from the number two or three positions to the number one position in that store from a sales volume point of view.","So, that's really been the opportunity. We're so dominant in men's. I think men's will continue to grow nicely. But to be honest, the bigger market opportunity for us is women's, market is much bigger, and our market share, although significant, is not nearly as dominant as it is in men's. So that opportunity is really in front of us to grow.","In Europe, it's been a growth in customer, better retail presentation, better customer presentation, true cleaning up of the brand into department stores and key specialty stores. Offsetting that has been getting out of the off-price channels and getting out of some terrible distribution that the brand was in.","So that's been a balancing act. But what you've really seen in the last six, nine months, the growth that you've seen in the business has really been driven both by square footage growth, which we think can continue, and also growing the customer base, which we also think can continue throughout Europe.","In Asia, we \u2013 it's basically a retail business, whether you \u2013 whether that's our own stores or department store concession business. And there we continue to open doors. It continues to be the player in the market. We continue to raise AURs throughout Asia, lifting the product up \u2013 our Black Label product has gone from 3% of the business in Asia to today 10%, with a goal to get to 20%. And that product is price positioned a good 30% to 40% higher than our base business.","So those are the initiatives that have really driven the presence of underwear and the market share gains by region.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Operator, we're going to make this our last question. It's well after 10:00 o'clock.","Operator","Certainly. Omar Saad with Evercore.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Thanks. Great job on the progress, guys. Manny, quick question on the outlet channel. There's been a lot of controversy around this channel. I know it's affected by currency and tourism. I don't know if you can parse that out and see what's going on underlying with local consumers, but your thoughts on that channel would be helpful. I know it's still an important distribution for you guys.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think there's \u2013 okay, if you look at the number of centers in the outlet environment, the number of centers significantly skews towards permanent population locations. Good solid stores that this year continue to comp, overall, single-digit comp store increase, probably 2% to 4% kind of growth in that market, healthy along with the American consumer, I think being healthy. So the channel continues to be just \u2013 from our perspective very, very healthy.","What is going on is there are 15 key centers around the country in these tourist destination locations that are extraordinarily large. Think of Harriman, New York in this location; think of Orlando, down in Florida, where the normal size of the store is five times to 10 times as large as an average store in a permanent population location. Those are the stores in the channel that are being impacted the most dramatically.","And I think the brands that are being impacted the most dramatically are the global brands, ourselves, Calvin and Tommy, we talked about, I guess Ralph Lauren has talked about this, Coach has talked about it to a degree. So some of it \u2013 if you're a global player that really attracts a global consumer, in those centers like Orlando or Harriman, your customer base in those centers for those brands, 50% of the credit card sales are international tourists from South America, Europe and Asia. If tourism is down in the United States which we know just in general term, it is, those are the centers that are being impacted, and those 15 or so centers are the ones, because of the size of their business, are being dragged down accordingly because of that.","As we look out, we believe as we get into the fourth quarter of 2015, and clearly into the first quarter of 2015, we start to anniversary that business and it should become less and less of an issue for us. But clearly, third quarter is going to continue to be an issue. Last year, our comps for both Calvin and Tommy were high single digit positive comps in North America. So we're up against some of our most challenging comps in the third quarter driven by that international tourism.","So that's the best I can do for you. There is really nothing at all wrong with that channel distribution. It's like saying there is a problem with Herald Square Macy's because the tourism is down in Macy's. It's still the largest department store in the world and probably the most profitable department store in the world, but it is being impacted by just tourism trends.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","That's really helpful. Thanks. One last question. In this kind of younger millennial consumer efforts that you're making and you're seeing progress you're seeing in the Calvin Klein business, help us understand the relation with Topshop, Urban Outfitters, other channels that really target that young consumer. Have you guys always been there in that channel? And is that business is now accelerating as you push into the more of the digital marketing and some of those younger campaigns? Are those retailers coming to you and asking you to develop more products for them? Just help us...","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We, as a brand, Calvin Klein, I would say 10 years ago when the brand was the number one designer jeans brand in North America, where it had a great position in the market where a product was being executed, we were in those kinds of stores. The last five years at Warnaco, that business was zero and went away. You need to be cool. You need to be connected. And the Calvin Klein products wasn't cool, it wasn't cutting edge, there was other brands that were much hotter, and we were living off \u2013 that business was living off the heritage of the brand and overdependent on off-price channel distribution.","I think what's indicative most importantly about the fact that we are in Urban Outfitters, we are in Topshop, is the brand, the product is connecting with that younger consumer. Combination of our marketing and how we've really gone after that market, combination of the products and what it is and that it's executing and we're seeing really strong sell throughs.","So product hitting, if you walk in \u2013 just go into an Urban Outfitters, you're going to see a presentation at Calvin that you've never seen before. It's going to be front and center. I would tell you it's still relatively a very small business, but it's creating a lot of buzz, and it's helping our department store business.","And then finally, I think it's also very important, look, our primary channel of distribution is department stores. They want to continue to attract the younger consumer. So it's important to really \u2013 we are one of those brands, particularly Calvin that skews younger than the department store customer. I think it's a combination of our underwear business and our jeans business that does that for our department store accounts. At the same time, we don't want to alienate our department on more mature department store accounts. So we really have differentiated product that services the needs of both of those consumers from a fit point of view and from an esthetic point of view. So I think that \u2013 hopefully that makes it clear what that channel is, why that channel is important.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the information.","Emanuel Chirico - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, that ends our call. I'd like to thank everybody for joining. We look forward to speaking to you in December for our third quarter press release.

Please go ahead.","Manny Chirico","Thank you. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer; Allen Sirkin, our President; and Ken Duane, who is in charge of all of our Wholesale Apparel business.","Just some general comments before I get into the businesses. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results. We beat the top end of our fourth quarter earnings guidance by $0.08 and we gave that guidance in mid-January of this year. And the momentum we see in all of our businesses we were also able to increase our 2012 earnings guidance by $0.20 to $6.10 to $6.20 from $5.90 to $6 that we gave about two months ago.","Moving to each of our businesses. Our Calvin business continued its strong momentum. Total revenues in the fourth quarter for the combined Calvin Klein businesses were up 12%, and operating profits increased about 6%. The Calvin Klein wholesale and retail business that we operate directly posted a 13% sales increase in the quarter, but strong performance was driven by our Calvin Klein retail businesses which posted an 18% comp store increase in the quarter.","For 2012 we are planning our Calvin Klein wholesale and retail businesses to grow about 7 to 9% which will be driven by mid single-digit comp store increases and a growth in square footage at both our wholesale and retail businesses. ","Moving to our licensing segment. Royalties in the quarter were up about 16%, the business posted strong double-digit growth in all geographic regions with the exception of Europe. Specifically, North America was up about 10%, Asia was up about 21%, Latin and South America were up about 30% and Europe was up low single-digits with fragrance posting strong performance while our apparel businesses were down for the quarter.","For 2012, as we look at the Calvin Klein business, we are planning the growth more conservatively than in prior years. Overall, we are planning royalty revenue growth on a constant currency basis to grow about 4 to 5%. Foreign exchange will have about 200 basis point headwind against this business. ","In North America, royalty revenue the plans call for mid single-digit growth with [performance] in department stores, being partially offset by a planned reduction in sales to the off price channels, resulting in planned overall North American royalty growth in the low single-digit range for 2012.","In Europe, the macro environment is causing us to conservatively plan this business for 2012. In addition, our take back from Warnaco of the European CK Bridge business will result in about $3 million reduction in royalties for 2012. As such our overall European royalties are being planned down about 5% in 2012. ","Geographically, our Asian and South American royalty revenues are being planned to continue their explosive growth of about 20 to 25%. This growth has being driven by retail square footage growth coupled with strong comp store sales increases which will drive growth in these regions. ","I\u2019m going to just touch on some of our bigger Calvin Klein businesses and just a little color on the total 2011 businesses. In underwear the Calvin Klein business was ahead in 2011 about 11% with all regions U.S., Europe, Asia and South America posting strong sales gain. The growth was driven by the continued strong performance in international markets where we grew retail square footage and had extremely strong performance from CK ONE.","CK ONE results were strong in all markets. In men\u2019s CK ONE continues to exceed our plan and help us to grow to a number one position within U.S. department stores. CK ONE currently represents over 10% of our annual underwear business. ","In 2012, a major initiative for us is the launch of Bold. Bookings in men\u2019s are very strong for Bold and are exceeding our initial bookings to CK ONE. ","Moving to jeans. Our global jeans and related businesses were up about 6% for the year; relatively soft businesses in the U.S. and Europe were offset by strong performance throughout Asia and South America. For 2012, we expect our jeans category to grow in the mid single-digit range overall, driven by new product initiatives particularly our power stretch program which will see significant sales increases in the spring season. ","Fragrance had a very strong performance growth in 2011; we posted just about 10% increase in revenues for the year. Business was very good across the Board with our [Euphoria] and CK ONE fragrances continuing to post very strong performance for us both domestically and internationally. ","In the U.S., our women\u2019s business continues their strong performance both women\u2019s apparel and footwear businesses were up in excess of 15% for the year. On the apparel side this growth has being fueled by strong selling of women\u2019s sportswear and outerwear. In footwear, revenues are running ahead about 20%. Our two licensees there G-III and Ghim Li continue to do an outstanding job for us. In addition, our new handbag and accessory business had a very strong 2011, its initial performance under G-III. G-III saw excellent sell through both at Lord and Taylor and Macy\u2019s. In its first full year, sales exceeded $50 million at wholesale. ","Moving to our CK Bridge business in Asia with Club 21, this business continues to grow dramatically posting a 25% increase for the year. The growth has been driven by China, Korea, and the Hong Kong markets. We experienced significant door expansion and double-digit comp store increases. ","Moving to the Tommy Hilfiger business. Overall, the Tommy Hilfiger business had a very strong quarter, and a significantly exceeded both our sales and profit expectations. Revenues for the fourth quarter were up 16% and operating earnings increased 25% over the prior year. The brand performance both in North America and in Europe were particularly strong.","Just to give put some color on each of those business, in Europe for the full holiday 2011 season; we saw sales growth in excess of 15% over the prior year. On a product category basis, we posted double-digit sales increases in men\u2019s sportswear, women\u2019s sportswear, denim and in footwear. All countries with the exception of Ireland posted strong sales growth in 2011. ","Moving to our Tommy Hilfiger international retail business. In the fourth quarter, comp store sales were up 16% with the exception of Italy and Japan all of our major markets posted double-digit comp store sales increases. And margins were up significantly in our retail businesses internationally. ","Moving to North America retail, we had a very strong quarter of comp stores plus 15% in the fourth quarter. We saw strength in all regions of the country with particularly strong performance in the geographic areas that cater to international tourist. The Tommy retail results in the fourth quarter were very consistent with the strong sales performance we saw in our own Calvin Klein retail businesses in the North America.","Our U.S. wholesales business which is particularly focused at Macy\u2019s saw a very strong performance in the quarter both in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sportswear. Sales ran ahead of last year, and sell through at retail were well above the plan. Our average unit retail out the door in the quarter ran up between 7 and 8% over the prior year. ","As we look out for 2012, we are planning the Tommy Hilfiger business to grow 5 to 7% on a constant currency basis, with foreign exchange conversion being planned to result in about a 500 basis point negative impact to our overall sales growth. Given the uncertain economic environment in Europe, our international growth is being planned much more conservatively than in the past, and much more conservatively than current business trends within decade. We are planning the international Tommy business revenues to grow between 7 to 8% on a local currency basis, while the U.S. has been planned to grow between 4 to 5%.","Moving to our Heritage businesses. Revenues in the quarter were down about 1% driven by 17% decline in wholesale sportswear, which was partially offset by a 9% increase in dress furnishings. Our Heritage retail businesses had a very healthy quarter posting a 6% increase in comp store sales. ","Operating earnings in the quarter were down significantly driven by the poor performance in our wholesale sportswear business. We have been aggressive in clearing goods, providing margin support for our retail partners and taking markdowns on the floor to move through holiday seasonal goods. These steps were taken to position us well for 2012 to really begin our turnaround there. We expect that our business will continue to underperform in the first quarter and we should see a significant turnaround beginning in the second quarter of 2012.","I thought I\u2019ll give you a sense of how business is performing through the first two months of the first quarter of 2012. In North America we have really seen our business accelerate in the first quarter, particularly with our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. At U.S. retail, our comps for the Tommy Hilfiger business is attracting in the mid-teens range about 16% up against the sales plan that\u2019s up about 4 to 5%. For Calvin Klein, our business are running on a comp store basis up about 10% with a plan that\u2019s planned between 4 and 5% as well.","Comps for our Heritage business are running up about 3% against the 1 to 2% comp store plan for the first quarter. In our U.S. wholesale businesses, both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger continue to perform ahead of sales plan and we continue to seek increases in our out the door retails. It's early in the spring season, we haven\u2019t gotten to Easter yet, but the feeling on those two businesses that we have a lot of momentum in those businesses and we continue to see growth as we go forward.","In dress furnishings business is good, we continue to have excellent success passing on higher retail prices, with our average unit retails up between 6 and 7% for the first two months of the quarter. ","Heritage sportswear continues to be challenged, however, we are moving through goods we are moving through seasonal goods there, and we are starting to see some improvement in early selling of spring. So, we are optimistic how that business is doing.","Moving to Europe, wholesale which represents about 70% of our business continues it strong momentum. Our spring summer order book is up about 13% ahead of last year\u2019s booking, and for the full holiday 2012 season we are planning that order book up about 4 to 5% and given the environment in Europe and given what we are hearing about how retails are coming back, they are open to buy and open to buy it down in the mid single-digit range. We think our performance is clearly ahead of all of the competition we see out there. And retail our comps are running up about 5%, against about a 3% comp store sales plan. ","Finally, just before I turn it over to Mike, I\u2019d just like to make a comment about our guidance. We believe we have been prudent with our estimates and it's early in the year. We feel we\u2019ve put together sales and operating margins projections that we can, not only me but a business trends continue we can exceed as we go forward. We believe that the momentum we see in our Calvin and Tommy businesses will continue to drive our growth and should allow us to outperform our current projections. ","And with that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of those results. ","Mike Shaffer","Thanks Manny. The comments I\u2019m going to make is based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. We are very happy with the fourth quarter results and particularly the momentum we have as we move into 2012. ","For the fourth quarter we delivered revenue and earnings per share above our guidance and significantly greater than in the prior year. Our revenues for the quarter increased 135 million or 10% over the prior year and were 4 million greater than our previous revenue guidance ","Revenue growth over the prior year was driven by increases of 16% and 12% at Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, respectively. Total operating income for the quarter was relatively flat to the prior year as earnings increases in Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses were offset by a decline in our Heritage business. Wed delivered earnings per share of 1.18 for the fourth quarter, which was $0.08 greater than our guidance of $1.10. Our earnings per share breaks down as a $0.04 EBITDA and a $0.04 beat in taxes. ","Moving to our guidance for 2012. Revenues are planned to up 4 to 6% excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of our discontinued businesses. Including the impact of foreign exchange discontinued businesses; we were expecting revenues to be flat to up 2%. ","Total Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to up 5 to 7% on a constant currency basis with Tommy Hilfiger North America increasing 4 to 5% and Tommy Hilfiger international increasing 7 to 8% on a constant currency basis. Including the negative impact of the foreign exchange, we are expecting that Tommy Hilfiger revenues to be flat to up 2%.","Calvin Klein revenues are planned to increase 5 to 7% while our on-going Heritage businesses are planning revenue up 2 to 3%. Our total Heritage revenues are planned to decline 3 to 4% including the negative impact of about 6% relating to the exit of the Timberland and IZOD women\u2019s wholesale businesses. ","Gross margins for the year are planned up about 100 basis points with expenses for the year planned up about 50 basis points do in large parts to an increase in pension expense. Impacting our gross margin and expense in 2012 is our mix of business as a result of faster growth and our higher gross margin and higher expense Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses.","Operating margins for 2012 are planned to increase approximately 50 basis points over 2011. Our tax rate for the year is planned to 23.5 to 24% and reflects the continued benefit of additional foreign earnings which are taxed at a lower rate than domestic earnings. ","Interest expense for the year is planned between 115 to $117 million posting a reduction to the prior as a result of debt repayments. ","Our earnings per share for 2012 are planned at 6.10 to 6.20 an increase of about 13 to 15%. For the first quarter of 2012, we are planning our revenues to increase 3 to 4% to the prior year excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Including the foreign exchange impact, we are planning our revenues to increase 1 to 2%. ","Earnings per share for the first quarter is planned at 1.23 to 1.25, first quarter earnings will be the quarter most impacted by product cost increases as first quarter selling will include fall and spring cost increases. First quarter gross margins will be flat to slightly down to the prior year, with the expenses increasing approximately 125 basis points.","As I mentioned previously, our mix of business is a factor in driving our gross margin and expense percentages. Operating margins in the first quarter will also be down about 125 to 150 basis points. Our tax rate for the first quarter is planned to 24 to 24.5%, and on the balance sheet we continue to project debt repayments for 2012 at $300 million. ","And with that we will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Adrianne Shapira from Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs","It was great to hear that the international business the Tommy is about planed, but perhaps maybe you can give us a little bit more color as to the sequential softening you saw, I mean clearly we know the environment there, but the slowdown is sort of the mid-singles from the mid-teens, if you can shed some light on that, that would be great?","Manny Chirico","Well, I guess there is a couple of things on the retail side of the business if you talk around from the comps. As we came out of such a strong selling season in the fourth quarter we clearly had significantly less carryover inventory in the first quarter which had some, you can\u2019t sell goods twice, guess is my point. So, we saw the real benefit of selling through goods sold dramatically in the fourth quarter than our comparative basis that was significantly less spring goods in the store than they were from the year before. So, I think I had some [four] goods in the store. So, I think that had some impact on the first couple of months in selling. No one can, it also continue with that 15 to 16% comp store increase. So, we are pretty satisfied with the 5 to 6% comp store increase that we are experiencing right now. It's running ahead of plan. It's running at very strong gross margins as you can imagine one benefit you get when you are much leaner on inventories seasonal inventory is coming out in the first quarter is higher gross margins as you go forward. So, I think those things will all benefit our profits in the first and second quarter.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs","And then just, as we step back and think about last year you handedly beat your initial guidance and it seems like it was driven much more by top line and SG&A control. As you said, the guidance for 2012 looks prudent and hopefully room for continued improvement given momentum continues. But where you sit today, maybe you help us think through where you think there is potential upside coming from maybe a shift from last year, more expensed control leads to perhaps this year, more opportunity on the margin. And how you see that opportunity pacing as we progress through the year?","Manny Chirico","Well, I guess, I\u2019d characterize it in two ways. I see the upside based on the sales trends right now and our plan. We are planning comps in North America when you put it all together probably in the 3 to 4% range. And right now for the first two months of the year, our comps are running up 10, 11%. So, clearly that bodes well for retail performance in North America, it bodes well for gross margins given how clean our inventories were coming out of the year, and see that kind of sell through. I think the expectation would be that our margins given the product course, the increases that we experienced for spring 2012 would be under more pressure and I think that actually could be that we could actually be flat in gross margin in the first quarter if the trends continue. So, I think that\u2019s where significant amount of upside I think will continue to come. Clearly the Calvin and Tommy businesses in retail are driving that. ","On the Heritage side of the business, I also think that we are just in operating margin recovery. And I think that really could bode well for the second half of the year, particularly in a way we plan the business, we are not looking to do anything really heroic in the business compared to historical benchmarks. So, I think there is an opportunity there. And clearly our Tommy international business, this is about conservatively as we have planned the business coming out of the box. I think that\u2019s very prudent given the volume it, but we really just have to see how sell throughs continue there and the current trends whether continue we really feel we can outperform those numbers as well So, I think in some ways, I think potentially there was we didn\u2019t have some of the headwind that we had last year that we had this year. The biggest one being foreign currency, but absent that, I think we plan that all into our businesses and I feel as good this year coming out of the gate for 2012 about our projections and what they may actually turn out to be as I did at this time last year. So, I think there is no guarantees given the trend of the business we feel particularly bullish about it.","Operator","Moving onto our next question from Robert Drbul from Barclays Capital. ","Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital","Manny the question that I have is on the European side, can you talk a little bit about the geographic trends like country-by-country, what\u2019s happening with the spring order book to the fall order book and any of the changes that you could call out from that perspective?","Manny Chirico","Sure, I think there is a couple of things I think geographically it's exactly as you would expect, about 30, 35% of our business is in Southern Europe and that business is under more pressure. And for us, some of those markets particularly had been growing out of sales rate a year ago which was in excess of 20%. Italy now for fall is being planned mid single-digits. So, although we are still growing in a very, very tough market there that business has clearly has seen a shift in the momentum that we were experiencing and that\u2019s clearly the environment that what\u2019s going on with that consumer. ","I think Spain is a business that for us is being running up 4 to 5% growth and fall we are planning that business down slightly about 2 to 3%. Those are the two bigger markets just to give you sense of what\u2019s going on in Southern Europe. In addition, we had a very, very strong fall holiday 2011 season where for our business our size to be growing 15 to 17%, and we fulfill those orders, had good sell throughs at retail, but the retail performance overall in Europe at department stores and in specialty stores, our key customers, most European retailers were reporting negative comps in the third and fourth quarter. ","So, I think there is a reaction that\u2019s going on there, where they are open to buy dollars are being planned instead of being planned up as they were in 2011 for 2 to 4% growth. They are actually being planned for 3 to 6% negative open to buy dollars. So, in that kind of an environment with the overall open to buy is down anywhere from 3 to 6%. Your thought business has been planned on 4 to 5%. We are clearly outperforming the market and continuing to gain market share there, but it's just in a much tougher market, and you don\u2019t want to take a much sales inventory risks given that kind of sales environment. So, we are trying to plan that business a little bit more conservatively and I think it gives the opportunity to maximize gross margins as we forward in our international business if the sales trends continue.","Robert Drbul - Barclays Capital","And speaking about gross margins, Mike, can you put a little bit more detail around the drivers for gross margin in the first quarter and your assumptions around first quarter and full-year 2012 in terms of mix of the wholesale versus retail?","Mike Shaffer","I guess, Bob, you cannot broke up, but in terms of the color we are thinking about our margins for the year up about 100 basis points. And there is really what\u2019s going on is we have got a real favorable mix change in our business. We are seeing higher margin, higher gross margin, higher expense, higher operating margin Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses growing faster than the Heritage business. So, in effect, we are going to see improvement in operating margins and improvement in gross margins.","Manny Chirico","And the only other thing I\u2019d say is in the U.S., the retail business is so strong, posting double-digit comp store increases that mix change also has the same dynamics and it's favorable both from an operating margin point of view and from gross margin point of view.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Glick from Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Manny, we are looking at 2012 a little more muted revenue growth outlook obviously lot of factors impacting that are a bit more transitory, but as you look out beyond some of those issues this year. I mean has your outlook changed in terms of the revenue growth potential for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. And if you could highlight some of the emerging opportunities that might accelerate that growth and what impact that may have on your operating margin moving forward and if the Heritage business recovery could obviously play a part in that as well?","Manny Chirico","The opportunity really for both Calvin and Tommy, what we always talk about we plan the business. Those businesses will grow 8 to 10%. And given what\u2019s going on long-term in those businesses, I search engines no reason why we will not exceed those numbers. On the Calvin Klein side, we continue to see strong growth with our royalty partners, there will be in the next two years you will see some shift as particularly given the CK Bridge business in Europe coming in-house. We believe that business long-term next 5 to 7 years is a $500 million business for us as we go forward. We think that has extraordinary growth given the platform that exist in Europe with our Tommy management team there given their expertise, given their establishment country-by-country, their knowledge of the retail base there, and the strength of the Calvin brand with the European consumer that we believe is significantly untapped. We clearly believe that that\u2019s an opportunity for us to grow into that we can get too quickly. ","In addition in Europe in 2013 we take in-house, the tailored business, it's a solid business for us today, that\u2019s somewhere in this \u20ac60 million range that we think over the next 4 to 5 years could grow to \u20ac200 million. That\u2019s a strong opportunity for us given our selling base and converting from a licensing model to a direct sales model there at very good operating margins that we can leverage the infrastructure. ","So, I think those are just two pretty significant examples of where we think it's really dramatically grow the top line. With Calvin Klein royalties I think will continue to be driven by explosive growth in Asia and South America, given those high operating margins. I think the noise gets out of those numbers surrounding the CK take back, the reduction of what price that we have this year that will be behind us when we get through 2012. Hopefully, currency we said, becoming a headwind might become a tailwind going forward. So, I think clearly we don\u2019t feel any less optimistic about the growth trajectory both for the Calvin and Tommy and in fact we think there is opportunity that will accelerate that growth 2013, \u201914, \u201915 and beyond.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","And Asia obviously a part of that as well?","Manny Chirico","Asia for us in Calvin is a licensing model. In Tommy we run some businesses directly, but the two big markets there India and China, I think will enjoy significant royalty growth there and as those businesses really start to come on, we own a 50% interest in India and about a 45% in China. And although we will be re-quoting those sales directly, we will be picking up some substantial income benefit as we go out to 14 and 15, a name we should also see an opportunity to potentially bring those businesses in-house as we have the opportunity to buy those businesses some forth in the future, that\u2019s going to be an interesting discussion for us, but clearly those are two growth markets for the brand that we think has tremendous upside. ","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Last question, there is a lot of dislocation going on in the department store industry and this is more related to your Heritage business. You have increased distribution in ARROW, you have the IZOD shop opportunity at Penney\u2019s. Can you give us a sense of how you are navigating the change there and whether this will be a positive neutral or negative for the company?","Manny Chirico","I think we are well positioned as any company given our stable of brands. Our IZOD brand clearly has been identified by JCPenney as a significant growth driver for the business and Van Heusen is well positioned at JCPenney\u2019s to also have significant growth there. Our Kohl\u2019s business with Van Heusen and ARROW is well positioned there and our Macy\u2019s business given our portfolio of brand. I\u2019m just going to have Ken to talk about to give you some color on some of those dynamics.","Ken Duane","David, in our Heritage business right now in Macy\u2019s we have IZOD continues to perform, Van Heusen continues to perform, and as you come through with the JCPenney, our JCPenney IZOD initiatives begins really September 1, and it will get on board for August but September 1 we are going to pickup 400,000 square feet in opportunity there in IZOD and Van Heusen will be, although we will continue to have position, we will have shops in position for 2013 as we come around the corner. Kohl\u2019s has brought in Van Heusen is performing very well and ARROW has been a good brand for them. So, we see opportunity as we have expanded our brand our distribution within the national change both JCPenney and Kohl\u2019s with both Van Heusen and ARROW. So, we see market share gains.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Eric Beder from Brean Murray, Carret & Co.","Eric Beder - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.","How should we think about the FX impact as we go through the year, and also how should we all see about costing and inventories and how are you planning those to go as we through 2012?","Mike Shaffer","So, when you think about the FX impact, when we think about for the first year we talked about the impact being about 20 to 25 million. And at the same time we think about that being spread fairly for the first and second quarters, I\u2019d think about somewhere about 5 to $6 million. The third quarter will be the quarter impacted the most and fourth quarter impacted the least. Overall, when we think about a penny move in FX we think about somewhere around 2 to $2.5 million of impact to our bottom line. ","Manny Chirico","Mike will talk about the EPS. I think the revenues that we categorize about $150 million will follow that as well. And then from a cost point of view, from a product cost point of view clearly the first quarter has being most impacted, I think the second quarter will have some impact, but we really given our second quarter aimed at July, we will have started to have some significant selling of full product at wholesale shipping a product in, and some given our outlet business, significant selling of fall product in the June-July period. So, it will be somewhat muted in the second quarter. So, clearly that cost issues will most dramatically impact the first quarter.","Eric Beder - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.","And in terms of pricing, are you planning to call back any of the pricing here or you plan to try and utilize this lower cost to maybe get some additional margin gains? How you look upon that in the consumer\u2019s ability to take that?","Manny Chirico","Well I guess I\u2019d characterize it this way. In Calvin and Tommy we don\u2019t see any change in the pricing. We raised prices in spring 2011, we raised them again in fall 2011 and we raised them slightly for spring 2012. And we are planning to raise them in fall 2012, but we are planning to maintain the higher retail prices that we established over the last three season. And I think that\u2019s pretty consistent with Tommy and Calvin and pretty consistent both domestically and internationally. ","In our Heritage businesses, dress shirts clearly benefited and AURs last year were up about 9% and in spring they were up about 8%. So, we don\u2019t see any give back there, we will watch the market carefully. So, we are hoping to get some of the margin that we lost last year in those businesses back overtime and we are planning second half gross margins up year-over-year. And I think we feel pretty confident given the tone of business and the consumer\u2019s acceptance of those increases. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","I got couple of questions. My first one is on the Europe macro outlook, the change in trend it sounds like you are expecting or starting to see new businesses. How much of that do you think in your wholesale business where your retail customers are kind of reacting to what happened in the fourth quarter, which was a little bit tough on a weather standpoint. It was height that appears around the Greece debacle and the wholesale customers are just looking out to next fall and saying, it was little bit of a tough holiday season, let\u2019s plan conservatively. And is that marry up with kind of what you are seeing in your own store, I know it's not a huge retail business for you in Europe, but does that, do they jive with each other and you are kind of seeing the same trend or is the department store react in the environment.","Manny Chirico","I think department stores are reacting to the environment, I think they are clearly trying to manage their gross margin and inventory, given the what I\u2019d characterize in Europe particularly at a department store level, you saw the comps, I think it was a relatively tough fall holiday season, blame it on weather, blame it on the macro environment. And I think when retail is doing on environment if they manage their inventories and we have got a sense that open to buy dollars are actually being cut on balance as I said before, 3 to 6%. So, I think that really what was happened. For us I can\u2019t give you except strong performance. I can\u2019t give you the great reason why we significantly outperform the market except the strength of the brand, the marketing that\u2019s gone behind it, and our inventory position was very strong in order to really drive sale. ","We saw for the third and fourth quarter sales up, if you look at a combined probably 9 to 11%. So, given that kind of sales performance, given the macro environment we are not accountable putting on another planning for another double-digit sales increase in Europe. So, we are planning to visit somewhat more conservatively, we are seeing about mid single-digit comp store increases right now. I think that\u2019s very good performance considering that our inventory position is good, but we didn\u2019t have as much fall carryover of the product in those stores. And I think in February, March you continue to sell a lot of seasonal goods there from the carryover season. So, you can\u2019t sell the goods twice I said that before. So, I think we are feeling good about how that\u2019s all shaping up but I think as a reality just listening to what\u2019s going on in the European market I think it's better for us to be more conservative in our inventory and our sales plans as we go forward.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","One follow-up on the topic of Europe, as you think about this Bridge business you bringing back in-house and team you already have over there, Tommy platform with Fred and everybody. How do you frame that out, I know the Tommy business is actually really quite big, you talked about a $500 million potential for the CK Bridge business. How do you put it in context where Tommy is today, how Tommy got to where it is today in Europe. Is it analogous situation or are their differences, structural differences in terms of either categories or the price points or applicable markets for that CK Bridge sportswear business.","Manny Chirico","The Tommy business is over 15 year period grew to \u20ac1 billion business and that business includes denim which is probably a \u20ac300 million business. So, when you think about the opportunity for Calvin, we don\u2019t see any reason overtime as it develops a wholesale, retail strategy overtime why the Calvin business cannot be as big as the Tommy business. I think there are different brand dynamics, Calvin tends to be a more tailored business which is actually a very positive thing given the price points in tailoring, Tommy more of a casual business, sportswear business. From a design aesthetic they completely difference, so I don\u2019t think there is a lot, there would be much cannibalization between the two brands. So, for us we think it's a perfect marriage as the two brand set along side of each other. But $500 million is a pretty big number that come out of the box and talk about. ","And I think we clearly need to if we execute given the talent on the ground in Europe it gives a huge leg up. The brand is well known in Europe, I think we will have a significant marketing launch the fall of 2013 when we re-launch the brand. And I believe those things will build momentum and excitement about the brand. And I think we will see some dramatic growth there at this point $500 million. I think as far as we are willing to go and we will play it out, but I think as you said to me, what could it be 10 to 12 years, I think overtime there is no reason to believe why Calvin wouldn\u2019t be as big as Tommy. I think the only reason we are not, is we have an executed as well as the Tommy team has done throughout Europe.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","And to iterate in your mind Tommy is by no means mature in Europe?","Manny Chirico","I think that\u2019s right, just given the kind of growth we are seeing significantly underdeveloped in some key markets, like France, like the UK, Italy, Russia and the Middle East. Those are clearly market that today are on round number \u20ac50 million markets that we think overtime could approach the size of our German business, our business in Germany which is well over \u20ac350 million. So , I think each of those markets have that kind of potential, so we don\u2019t see any reason why that in the next three to four years why that business has slowed down. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Ohmes from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Couple of questions, first just a follow-up on the North American comps for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. You gave the AUR on Heritage, what\u2019s the AUR look like for them. And what\u2019s the AUR plan look like for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein for comps for first half versus back half.","Manny Chirico","I\u2019d say we are looking for somewhere for this year versus last year AURs to grow about 5%. That\u2019s the plan, right now we are pacing pretty much ahead of that both at wholesale and at retail. And I think that will play itself out, I think we are really enjoying the benefit of being having significant clean inventories in all channels and distribution. We are benefiting from outperformance on the selling line which has allowed us to not be as promotional as our plans had called for. So therefore, AURs are going out the door higher. So, I\u2019d say at least 30% of the comp increase that we are looking at above plan at our retail stores is just being driven by AUR improvement. So, I think that bodes well for gross margins as we go out.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And so the really strong comps that you guys are seeing quarter to-date for in North America ex-Heritage. Is the AUR higher for Tommy and Calvin in North America comps than Heritage right now?","Manny Chirico","Yes, significantly.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. So, it's double-digit right now.","Manny Chirico","Yes.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s great. Second question was just on the marketing plans for 2012 versus 2011. I was just curious if had anything to call out either by brand or by region sort of what you see yourself doing this year versus last year. Thanks.","Manny Chirico","The plan is to stand in local currencies all in about the same that we have spend this year with a hope just like last year, if we outperform, we will continue to increase that to some degree. But we have really gotten those marketing plans up significantly over the last three years both in Calvin and Tommy. So, we really feel good about the spend, we look for opportunities to rally drive it. There are some product initiatives I really can\u2019t talk about their some fragrance initiatives that will happen second half of the year, new master men's brand and there will be a lot of that, the Calvin Klein underwear campaign around Bold will continue to be very strong. So, I think you will continue to see the kind of marketing that you have seen this year, we are planning to continue to meet the Hilfiger campaigns, it's just been phenomenal for us, that campaign continues to have legs, it works very well on television and digitally and it works great at point of sale. So, we are really able to get leverage across the Board there with the Tommy campaign and we are really happy to continue to play out.","From a PR point of view, Tommy with his American Idol appearances, has really given a shot in the arm to the brand, just becoming much more, is becoming more seen really been very positive for us from that point of view, he is a great ambassador for the brand and we plan to continue those initiatives throughout 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi.","Kate McShane - Citi","Just a follow-up on the last question with regards to SG&A dollars spend for 2012. Like how should we be thinking about the cadence for that throughout the year. ","Manny Chirico","Could you just repeat it, you broke up I\u2019m sorry.","Kate McShane - Citi","With regards to SG&A spend for 2012, can you give us a little bit more color on the cadence throughout the year of how we should remodeling our increase in dollar growth.","Mike Shaffer","Sure. For the first quarter, I guess for the year, we are talking about expenses being up about 40 to 60 basis points. And I think if you think about that for the first quarter with expenses be with operating margins being down 125 to 150, gross margins being down flat to slightly down. There is a bigger impact on expense in the first quarter versus the balance of the year. I guess that\u2019s what I think about it.","Kate McShane - Citi","And one unrelated question back to sportswear. I think you said during your prepared comments, that you do expect a turnaround in sportswear in Q2. And I wondered if you could identify what exactly is driving that, is that more margin recovery or is it more top line recovery. And have you had to rollback your prices in the sportswear category just based on that.","Manny Chirico","Again we were talking Heritage, IZOD, Van Heusen, and ARROW. I\u2019d characterize it's all margin opportunity and the whole Heritage story, historically our operating margins are being between 10 and 10.5% last year they were below 7.5%, but I think 7.2%. So, clearly I think there is a story over a period of time where margins will recover. If you look at our AURs in sportswear, out the door retails, when you factor in clearance in what happened in the fourth quarter, we saw no retail selling price increases last year at all even given this cost increases when you think about there was so much private label on the floor there was so much. The main floor was really crowded, too much inventory when we got to November everyone really started to get very promotional on the main floor, required us to do that liquidated goods. We moved as fast as possible to do that. ","The benefit that we really see is that they should with better control of inventory at retail in the channel, there really should be an AUR improvement, not by higher ticket prices or driving higher prices, but just by having less clearance and requiring less promotion. So, key will be watching inventory levels at retail, particularly on the main floor that really just should naturally come back to us without having to do anything heroic from a retail price point of view if inventories are controlled. And right now I feel is we are going to bring inventories on the floor and much better controlled than it were this time last year. And open to buy dollars are being planned much tighter, particularly in the mid-tier department stores where all brand play. ","Operator","And we will take our question from Howard Tubin from RBC Capital Markets.","Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets","You have done a good job with inventory and managing inventories. How are you planning inventories really coming out of the spring season going into the fall season versus last year?","Mike Shaffer","We are seeing a decline as Manny said, we're anticipating a decline in fall costing. So from a perspective of moving into fall we will be selling slightly more units in the fall of 2012. But the cost will be down. So I think you will see more of a relationship to sell as we move into the second quarter and third quarter and fourth quarter. We will see more of a inventories coming in line with sales growth. ","Operator","And we will take our question from David Weiner from Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank","Two quick questions, one on China just to follow-up on some of your comments. I think you mentioned in your interview last night that overtime over the next several years there will be a $1 billion brand in China for Tommy. Can you talk about or can you just tell where are those revenues right now. And then second, when I think about the Meet The Hilfiger campaign, I think that\u2019s being running for right coming up on two years and to your point I think it's been a pretty successful campaign. What are you trying to do with the Tommy brand both at retail and at wholesale overtime in terms o positioning the brand. Are you trying to take at higher end or are you trying to take it someplace it's right now. What are the growth opportunities with Tommy in the U.S.? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Let me talk about China first, when that red light goes on the in the camera sometimes you get little ahead of yourself. So, $1 billion comes out pretty easily.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank","It's a round number. ","Manny Chirico","It's a round number, it seems to get Jim Cramer excited, so you take advantage of that. But all okay, I don\u2019t know how to, China was such a hard thing to quantify. We are growing at both the Calvin and Tommy. We are growing 20% plus, 30% plus, Tommy are off to relatively small base. Retail sales in China are little bit over $100 million for Tommy. Clearly we don\u2019t see any reason why that 20, 30% kind of the growth is going to slow down over the next three years. How fast that ramps up, how quickly we go after, how aggressive, but clearly if you start to extrapolate and get five years out, you get to some enormous numbers. So clearly I think if that Tommy continues to grow that consumer continues to develop the Tommy brand is well known in China, getting better known throughout China as it develops it's platform in Asia, Japan, it's platform in Hong Kong where the Chinese accounts, those China consumer are constantly travelling. I think clearly we look at that as a huge growth opportunity for the brand. ","Calvin somewhat like few years ahead of Tommy there. Warnaco has done a tremendous job in jeans and underwear, Club 21 has been outstanding in growing the CK business throughout China and Asia we have large platform in Asia with the Calvin business and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why it has gotten a jump start on Tommy. But I don\u2019t feel compared to some of the other large U.S. brands, we are not behind anybody there at all. I\u2019m saying some ways we are ahead of most. So, I think that\u2019s a significant opportunity and we will continue to be a big growth opportunity as we go forward.","Looking at the campaign, for us in North America it's all about continuing to elevate the Tommy Hilfiger brand. The Tommy internationally is a premium brand. In Europe the average unit retails if we take all product categories between 75 and \u20ac85 out the door. It's comparable to that in Brazil, it's slightly higher, it's comparable to that 75 to \u20ac80 out the door throughout Asia. In the United States that brand, we all know the history and what it's gone through, the last three years we have seen the AURs continue to increase in the high single-digit range and we believe that that\u2019s starting to really even gain momentum and accelerate as we go forward. ","So, it's all for us particularly our wholesale business at Macy\u2019s, particularly our specialty retail store business throughout the North America. It's all about its continuing to use those platform to elevate the brand, communicate with the consumer, get the message across to the consumer and continuing to raise those AURs. And that\u2019s a big part of the strategic plan for our Tommy Hilfiger brand. We talk about it all the time. It's one of the reasons why we are not planning as dramatic growth in the U.S. for the brand, because we are continuing to push the SURs higher and higher, but we have been surprised the last two years, the consumer acceptance of great product, they are more than willing to pay for it and that\u2019s actually enhanced our growth for the last two years by driving up the AURs, putting more into product and positing the brand as an alternative to Ralph Lauren. And what we\u2019d like to see it similar to where we priced around the world 10 to 15% below Ralph Lauren AUR 30 to 40% where it was 3 to 4 years ago.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We did have a question from Evren Kopelman [Wells Fargo Securities]. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities","Quickly I want to ask about the Heritage business and kind of understand what were the drivers of the revenue decline versus what you were initially planning for. And is it really more of a function of the mid-tier channel or the mix of outerwear and sweaters? Could you help us understand that a little bit more. Thanks.","Manny Chirico","I guess the sales came in in Heritage again let\u2019s talk about, if you look at the fourth quarter we came in right where we thought we would be. We just really continued margin pressure. The selling shortfalls that we had in Heritage were in our sportswear businesses only, wholesale sportswear business is only the (inaudible) business last year was very tough. The IZOD women's business was very tough and IZOD men\u2019s business was very tough. There was some product issues, sweaters you talked about, and outerwear to a degree but I think it was more of an issue really on the main floor, moderate price national brand is under a lot of pressure. And I think that whole main floor sportswear area, private label, really saw pressure. I think if you look at sales performances at retail, it was our customer base. I think the mid-tier players were in the more pressure. And I think the Macy\u2019s business which was very strong had great performance in their accessories, cosmetics, and their collection businesses. And the one area that was tougher for them tended to be main floor sportswear overall on a relative basis. So I think it was just was a weak area overall and the real mix for us in the Heritage business and principally the sportswear businesses was gross margin dollars and not so much from sales. But I think by really getting control of the inventories getting back over the next 24 or so months, I think we could work our way back close to that 10% operating margin in that business than where we are today.","Thanks Evren. With that we would like to close the conference call. I thank everybody for their attention and for joining us for that, and we look forward to speaking to you at our May conference call, the first quarter results.

Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer, Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations and Ken Duane, CEO of our PVH Heritage business and our North America Wholesale Businesses.","I'm quite pleased with our results for the third quarter, which exceeded our expectations. We continue to over deliver against our strategic and financial plans. Overall, we saw third quarter revenues grow 5% and EPS increase 16%. We saw a tremendous strength across all of our businesses with our international businesses demonstrating outsized performance. Europe, China and Japan continue to be our healthiest markets in the third quarter. We saw improvements in our North America business, which performed in line with our plan, despite multiple natural disasters, particularly in Puerto Rico that impacted our retail businesses.","Business trends in North America continue to significantly improve as we move through the fourth quarter. Across channels, we continue to see outsized growth from the digital channel, consistent with our trends all year.","From a strategy perspective, we continue to invest in driving our brand relevance and our consumer reach through our increased marketing investment. And given our strong results, we have decided to invest an additional $20 million in brand marketing in the fourth quarter. Despite this $0.20 per share incremental expense, we are significantly increasing our earnings guidance for the year.","Moving to our third quarter results let me begin with Tommy Hilfiger. The Tommy Hilfiger brand continues to experience significant demand and we are seeing broad based strength across all businesses. The Tommy brand relevancy and momentum continues, leveraging our key influences from Gigi Hadid, our women's brand ambassador to the Chainsmokers, our brand ambassadors for all Tommy Hilfiger men's categories, and showing you our local brand ambassador for China.","We believe that investing in the Tommy Hilfiger brand via these brand ambassadors will continue to drive performance in our global growth categories. And additionally, by offering limited jean capsules and unique collaborations, we are continuing to propel the brand forward, allowing us to engage with a new and younger consumer.","From a business perspective, Tommy revenues increased 10% and earnings were up 35% for the quarter. We continue to be extremely pleased with the response from consumers and are benefiting from the market share gains in all regional markets. International revenues increased 16% with retail comp sales up 7% for the third quarter. This outstanding performance was driven by our Tommy European business, which continues to outperform and we continue to see positive momentum across the business and we see strong sell through at retail.","As I\u2019ve previously mentioned, our Spring\/Summer 2018 order-book is up over 10% and we are quite pleased with the broad based strength across all of our product divisions and across all of our markets within Europe. In addition, we continue to see strong momentum in early full selling and we anticipate the strong selling to continue in Europe throughout fiscal 2018.","Moving to Tommy Asia, lead by the China's Tommy business, it continues to perform very well as we\u2019ve continued to build on the continued momentum in China, benefiting from integration and investments that we\u2019ve made in the Tommy Hilfiger China business. Our Tommy Hilfiger Japan business also continues to over-deliver against its repositioning and turnaround plan.","Moving to North America, I am happy with the inflection we've seen in the business. We started to see it turn in our retail business in second quarter, and we saw even stronger momentum during the third quarter as revenue increases driven largely by the improvement in our retail business, which posted 6% comp store increase and solid gross margin improvement.","We have also seen continued strength across our wholesale businesses, both men's and women's. Our Macy\u2019s business, in particular, has been outstanding with strong sell-throughs at higher overall margin.","Moving to our Calvin Klein business and speaking about the brand. We are pleased with the momentum around the Calvin Klein brand, and have just announced several significant marketing initiatives. We recently launched our Calvin Klein jeans and other underwear campaign, which introduces an evolution in the #MyCalvins to both action to our family #MyCalvins. This feature several personalities, including Solange Knowles and some talent, which will be announced at a later date as we head into spring 2018.","I cannot wait to share with you the incredible talent and amazing reach we have planned when we announced our latest talent in mid-January for our spring 2018 campaign. Specifically, these jeans and underwear marketing initiatives are geared to enhance direct-to-consumer focus to drive our business. We really feel that with the amazing talent we have planned that I can\u2019t speak about now and that we will introduce as these initiatives will fuel tremendous growth in 2018.","We also recently announced our Calvin Klein X Amazon fashion holiday retail experience; available for customers at pop up shops in New York City and in Los Angeles, as well as through our online brand store at amazon.com#mycalvin. While these are just two recent examples of our consumer engagement marketing investments, we believe that these, together with our other upcoming and ongoing brand marketing initiatives, will continue to drive the brand momentum, fashion relevancy and allow us to capture growth opportunities for the business.","Moving on to the business. Revenues increased 6% for the third quarter, reflecting strong global trends with 20% increase coming from our international business. And overall earnings were slightly down in the quarter due to a planned $15 million increase in brand marketing investments. Absent these brand investments, earnings would have been up 8% in the third quarter.","We continue to see strong top line growth out of Europe and China with North America performing in line with plan. International retail comp store sales increased 9% in the quarter. Calvin Klein Europe continues to deliver terrific performance, both top line and bottom line with strong sell-throughs across all channels. As we discussed previously, Calvin continues to see market share gains across the European region, and the momentum continues into the spring 2018 with our order book projected to be up over 25%.","The broad based strength across the business highlights the evolution of the brand and the business into a true lifestyle business in Europe, in line with our strategic plan for the region. We see the strong selling trends continuing into fall, and would expect the strong sales trends to continue throughout 2018.","In Asia, Calvin Klein continues to perform well with China outperforming our other markets across all product categories. We continue to see softness in Korea, which has been pressured by the negative geopolitical news out of North Korea. But overall, Asia business continues to post strong sales and earnings growth. Calvin Klein North America saw healthy growth across all of our wholesale businesses in line with our plans. Our CK North America business saw an improvement in comp store sales trend versus the first half of the year with comps down only 1% for the third quarter.","Finally, moving to our Heritage businesses. Revenues for the quarter were down 7%, in line with our plans, due to some sales moving from the third quarter into the second quarter as compared to the prior year. And therefore, earnings were down as a result of that planned sales shift. As a reminder, year-to-date for the nine month period, our Heritage Brands\u2019 revenues are flat and earnings are up 9% over the prior year. Retail comps were up 2% in our Heritage Retail business in the third quarter.","Given the challenging overall North America market dynamics, we are quite pleased with the financial performance of our Heritage Brands division.","Looking to our full year guidance, we have raised our full year earnings outlook and believe that our brands will continue to drive our fourth quarter performance. In addition, as a result of the momentum in the business, we have increased our fourth quarter marketing spend by an incremental $20 million to capitalize on the opportunities we are seeing across our businesses.","Despite this incremental brand investment, we are planning fourth quarter earnings per share to grow 15% to 17% over the prior year. We feel highly confident making this incremental investment in our brand, given the momentum we see in our business. In the fourth quarter, early holiday sales and margin results are running well ahead of our financial plan. Our international businesses continue to see nice momentum with Calvin Klein international comps up high single-digits and Tommy Hilfiger international comps up mid single-digits.","The big improvement we have seen has been in our U.S. business. We have seen a strong start to the North American holiday season with improvements in both traffic and sales trends. Comps for Calvin Klein North America are trending up mid single-digits and Tommy Hilfiger North American comps are trending up high single-digits quarter-to-date.","We also continue to see strong performance in our wholesale businesses in North America and Europe in the fourth quarter. We are well positioned for the fourth quarter and the balance of the year, and believe given our underlying brand momentum and the strength across our businesses that we can continue to over-deliver against our financial plan.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to quantify our third quarter results.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Our revenues for the third quarter were up 5% for the prior year, including a positive impact of 2% for foreign currency and exceeded our guidance of up 4%.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues were ahead of guidance and up 10% over the prior year, including a positive impact of 3% for foreign currency. The Tommy Hilfiger revenue increase was driven by strong international performance of plus 16% for the prior year, including a positive impact of 5% for foreign currency with international comps up 7%.","Revenue growth was also positive in North America where we saw 2% increase over the prior year, including strong retail comps of 6%. Negatively impacting the Tommy Hilfiger North America revenues was a decrease of approximately $20 million due to the transfer of the North America women's wholesale business to as you see in the fourth quarter of last year.","Our Calvin Klein revenues were ahead of guidance and up 6% to the prior year, including a positive impact of 2% for foreign currency. Negatively impacting our Calvin Klein revenues versus the prior year was a deconsolidation of our Mexico business, which was worth approximately $20 million. Calvin Klein international revenues increased 20%, including the positive impact of 4% for foreign currency with strong performance in Europe and international comps up 9%.","Heritage revenues for the third quarter were down 7%, driven by a shift in the timing of shipments from the third quarter to the second quarter. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.02 represents a growth of 16% over the prior year and included the planned increase of approximately $15 million of marketing compared to the prior year related primarily to Calvin Klein. The $3.02 was $0.10 better than the top end of our previous guidance and the beat was driven by $0.03 business fee favorable FX of $0.03 and tax expense, which was favorable for $0.04.","For the full year, we are currently anticipating that we will be negatively impacted by $0.17 per share due to foreign exchange, an improvement of $0.03 when compared to our previous guidance. For the full year, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be $7.78 to $7.80 or 14% to 15% over the prior year, which is $0.10 higher at the top end of the range in our previous guidance and this reflects a tax beat of $0.04, a $0.03 increase due to favorable FX, a $0.23 increase due to stronger business, partially offset by an increase in Calvin Klein marketing of approximately $0.20.","Overall, we are projecting revenue to grow approximately 7%. 2017 revenues will be negatively impacted by approximately $70 million related to our Mexico deconsolidation and approximately $80 million related to the transfer of the Tommy Hilfiger North America wholesale women's business. 2017 revenues will also be positively impacted by an amount of approximately $50 million related to the 2017 being a 53-week year, offset in part by the negative impact of the timing of Chinese New Year.","Overall, operating margins are expected to increase about 10 basis points on an as-reported basis and to increase approximately 30 basis points on a constant currency basis. We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 9% with operating margins down about 130 to 140 basis points on an as reported basis, and to decrease about 90 to 100 basis points on a constant currency basis.","Our Calvin Klein earnings are negatively impacted in 2017 by about $50 million increase related to advertising and the creative leadership changes. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 8% with operating margins planned to increase about 130 to 140 basis points on an as-reported basis and they increase about 160 to 170 basis points on a constant currency basis. Our Heritage business is planned to have relatively flat revenues versus the prior year with operating margins planned to increase about 30 to 40 basis points.","Our corporate segment expenses are planned to increase over 15%. The increase reflects low single-digit growth in our overheads as well as startup losses associated with new businesses.","Interest expense for the year is planned to be about $120 million compared to the prior year amount of $115 million. The increase is primarily the result 300 million euro bonds issued last year. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 16.5% to 17%.","Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at a $1.42 to $1.44 or 15% to 17% over the prior year, and includes $0.02 of estimated impact for foreign currency. Revenue in the quarter is projected to increase 11%, including a positive impact of 3% for foreign currency. Revenue will be positively impacted by the 53rd week and negatively impacted by the Mexico deconsolidation, the transfer of the Tommy Hilfiger North America wholesale women's business and the timing of Chinese New Year.","Calvin Klein revenues are planned at 16% increase, including a positive impact of 4% currency. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are at 12% increase, including a positive impact of 5% for currency and Heritage brand revenues are projected to decrease 1%. Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes to be between 17% and 20% in the fourth quarter.","And with that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Bob Drbul","Manny, I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more around North America, especially in November the last six weeks in department stores. What do you think is going on in the market in this channel for your business generally?","Manny Chirico","I think, in general. I guess there is two big-ish items that are going on that I think helping business overall. Traffic has improved and we see business just in general improved. And the other big benefits that I think everyone will see is inventories under real tight control. So I think it feels like again we\u2019ve got a month ahead of us of this holiday selling, but it feels like we\u2019re going into December with a lot of momentum, tighter inventories. I think it will be promotional, but probably not as promotional as last year there\u2019ll be less goods to clear on January, if these trends continues. So we are very positive in all that we\u2019re seeing throughout North America across all of our businesses and across the various different channels of distribution with our key customers.","Bob Drbul","And I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit, I mean, on your inventories at the end of the quarter just the content of those inventories, your comfort level with what\u2019s in there and the expectation on moving those inventories forward?","Manny Chirico","I\u2019m going to turn it over to Mike. I would just say qualitatively that inventory is very strong and we\u2019re really trying to capture as much as growth opportunities above plan that we see ahead of us. And I think that inventory is going to be a valuable asset for us. And I think Mike can give some details.","Mike Shaffer","Bob, look our inventories up about 70%, our fourth quarter sales turned up about 11%. The content of that inventory we are very clean on fashion across the globe. A big piece of the investment that we made was in international inventories. And it is really core and basic. So there is really no risk in terms of liquidation -- it\u2019s been obsolete. So it could fuel us a good increase in fourth quarter.","Manny Chirico","And I think as Mike said it well. I think we have a bigger core replenishment business today than we had 12 months ago in our two big brands. And I think the opportunity to capture the momentum in those brands is in front of us with very little markdown in this given the composition of that inventory. So we really see it working to our advantage.","Operator","And we\u2019ll hear next from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","I guess, I\u2019d love to, Manny, hear you talk a little bit more about the Amazon fashion holiday collaboration that you guys just announced a few weeks ago. How has that been trending thus far? Any insights from what you\u2019re learning from consumers. And then has that changed anything with your relationship with your legacy department stores?","Manny Chirico","Well, I think on balance I think the experience for us has been terrific. We think it\u2019s great for the brand. We\u2019ve seen strong sales performance coming out of two pop up shops. And more importantly, we've seen strong sales performance in the Calvin business and our Amazon business with them as well online. The interesting fact that we\u2019ve seen is that we think it's really created a lot of momentum around the brand and more excitement around the brand. And we've seen our Calvin Klein underwear business, and that's what this is really focused on. We've seen our Calvin Klein underwear business in all channels of business really accelerate through the month of November, and in particular that the Black Friday week through Cyber Monday, of course department store channel and distribution, we've had one of our strongest weeks on record with Calvin Klein underwear business.","So I think it's really lifted all boats and I think it\u2019s created a level of excitement around the brand. And we haven't seen a lot of any kind of pushback from our accounts and we have a strong relationship with all of our key customers and we try to drive everybody's business.","Erinn Murphy","And then I guess my second question for you guys is just on the Tommy Hilfiger business. I think it's the first time in a long time that North America is actually outperforming international. Obviously, they're building up very different basis. But just maybe bigger picture, how sustainable do you see the North American Tommy traction? And how are you thinking about anniversarying the success you've had this year with Gigi? Thank you.","Manny Chirico","I think, there's two specific questions in there, the North America business just continues to perform. We think we have, if you look at that business over the last three years with Tommy North America business, we really felt the pressure coming from currencies and the lack of international tourism. As that starts to turn and we're clearly seeing that start to turn, I think, our Tommy retail business will be one of the biggest beneficiaries, given the strong international presence that that brand has.","So I think there's opportunity that's continued to comp on top of these comps, given the fact that we\u2019ve really had two and half years of challenging business going into the second quarter of 2017. So we really haven't seen an inflection point on that business until we got to that point in time. So really can't -- don't see any negative downsides. I really can't talk about the new talent, but I can tell you that that's happening at Tommy, but I can tell you that we'll be a significant spring 2018 marketing campaign with new talent. And I think the focus will be a little different in that Gigi with such a driver for the brand but it was really, she was the women's ambassador.","I think our focus will shift a bit. We'll continue to focus on women's, but we'll really focus on our strength, which is our men's business as well. And I think you'll see some exciting things come January, February of 2018 around the Tommy Hilfiger marketing campaign, which will be a continuation of what you've seen for the last 18 months. And I think it's helped to really fuel the top line growth that we've seen in that business.","Operator","And our next question will come from Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane","My question\u2019s centered around the relationship with Amazon, as well. We've heard from some vendors that they're starting to have conversations with Amazon about markdown money. And I wondered if you had any commentary with regards to that? And then in regards to the pop up shops, I wondered if the incremental $20 million that you're spending in the fourth quarter is being allocated for that initiative.","Manny Chirico","Couple of things, I think having discussions with retail is about markdown money is not very unusual. And I think as Amazons becomes a bigger and bigger player, there will be discussions about performance and markdown money as needed. It continues to be a very profitable channel for us. And I think that I don\u2019t see any reason why that wouldn\u2019t continue. The interesting thing about that business it tends to much more of a core driven business. And given our strength in that area of the business, particularly our Calvin Klein underwear business our dress shirt business, I continue to think that our profitability will continue to be pretty high as we look at that business, so we haven't seen anything that drastically change.","We're taking some I think I would say, we're supporting them probably more so from a inventory point of view backing up inventory, particularly in core programs, so we can maximize the business as opposed to really seeing any pressure on margins in anyway. So we are not seeing that at all. Your second question on the marketing, yes, part of the investments that we are making on the Calvin Klein brand, the $20 million, a portion of that relates to the promotion PR related to the Amazon pop up shops and the Amazon relationship, which I think is healthy all of our Calvin Klein business, not just Amazon.","Operator","And our next question will come from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan.","Matthew Boss","So as we think about improved inventories in the channel, I guess, what\u2019s the best way to think about near-term gross margin opportunity? And then more so, as we think beyond this year, what's the best way to rank the continued drivers of gross margin beyond?","Manny Chirico","I think, for us with the outsized growth of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses, in general and with the outsized growth that we\u2019re seeing internationally, both in Europe and Asia, the biggest opportunity for gross margin expansion is the continued growth of those businesses, which will continue to drive gross margin expansion as we go forward.","Matthew Boss","And just on the expense front, I guess, what\u2019s the best way to think about the right mix of marketing dollars to sales? I guess on that line, how that\u2019s to think about SG&A dollar growth versus sales as we move forward there as well?","Manny Chirico","Look I think, in general, is we try to invest and continue to invest as a percentage of sales on the business. However, in fairness, I can't say that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always done. When we see momentum in the business and our performance in the business we have, like we\u2019re doing in the fourth of this year, we\u2019ve made a determination to take a portion of that earnings growth and invested back into the brands above the historic level of profitability.","So I think if we continue to outperform, we\u2019ll continue to spend more in the marketing area. We\u2019ll make sure to deliver more on the bottom line as we\u2019re doing that but at the same time in order to fuel the momentum of the brand, not to be a pig and has it for everything out to the bottom line, I think the spending that we're doing in the fourth quarter of this year is extra $20 million I think is really going to set us up for Spring\/Summer 2018 to go in into that fiscal '18 with a lot of momentum. And gives us the confidence that we can hit our financial goals as we move forward and continue to grow with this double-digit earnings growth where I hope when I look at most of our competitors set, I don\u2019t see them growing at those same levels. So I think the marketing investments are clearly paying off.","Operator","And our next question will come from John Kernan with Cowen & Company.","John Kernan","Just how do we think about international growth for Tommy and Calvin into next year? The run rate of wholesale order books and the comps for Tommy Calvin are pretty robust. I\u2019m just wondering on how you\u2019re thinking about the sustainability of low double-digit top line growth access ex for Tommy and Calvin into next year in international?","Manny Chirico","I guess, I would say we\u2019ve got a metrics that basically talks about overall delivery mid-single that is 4% to 6% kind of top line growth that\u2019s our formula. And I think clearly we\u2019ve said that in our international businesses will be in the high single-digit range and our domestic business will continue trend in low single-digit range. And blended will drive that 5% to 6% kind of top line growth. That\u2019s the metrics that we have when we look out. The reality of the situation is and what\u2019s been happening the last two years and what appears to be happening for next year as we start to feel it is our international growth has been more significant in that.","And the surprise has not been Calvin Klein we have anticipated that double-digit growth with Calvin given the momentum in the brand, the underdevelopment of the European business and being able to put 25% top line growth in the wholesale side of that business. We think that will continue into 2018 based on our order books and early selling four. The surprise, to be honest, has been the Tommy business that\u2019s a very big, what I would describe as a mature highly profitable business with great market penetration and to be able to be growing that 10% in the first half of the year is somewhat surprising to us, pleasantly surprising to us.","And I guess to be honest what we\u2019re seeing initially and we\u2019re not ready to quantify anything but we\u2019re seeing initially in our early selling is those trends in the high single-digit growth in the Europe wholesale business feel like they should continue based on the momentum in the brand and early selling of fall. So we\u2019re optimistic as we look out into 2018.","John Kernan","Just one follow-up, I guess, somewhat of a follow up to the prior question. As you exit transactional pressures from FX that you faced the prior two years. How do we think about operating margin expansion, not just for next year but beyond that and your confidence in the portfolio\u2019s ability to grow double-digit -- EPS double-digits over multiyear period?","Manny Chirico","So I think I always have to consider when it comes to find currency, the margin benefit that will come overtime, assuming that the euro and it continues to strengthen and foreign currency continues to strengthen and the U.S. dollar stays at this level or we can further, if that trends were to continue, you would expect to get margin improvement coming from currency. But given our hedging strategy and that we go out 12 months to 18 months that portion of the foreign currency benefit will probably push out second half of 2018 but more significantly into '19 from a margin benefit.","The benefit we'll get next year is on the translation side of the business, which is really arithmetic, just converting our earnings at the average currency rates for next year, which clearly will be higher than this year. So the big benefit is we've gone through two years of FX, two and half years of FX pressure on our earnings, and we start to see that turn in the fourth quarter this year into next year it should become a tailwind for us. So that's how I would think about it John.","Operator","We'll hear next from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Manny, maybe I just want to go back to Tommy's international growth in Asia. You talked about, I think, you took China in-house about a year ago with revenues around $140 million with two cities, I think Shanghai, Beijing. Can you talk about the pace of expansion there in terms of new cities that you're looking at and what sales you're expecting, maybe this year and going forward in the region?","Manny Chirico","Sure. I think, so just to clarify, I would say we were much more exposed than just in two cities but we were directly operating two cities, meaning a direct to consumer model in Beijing and Shanghai. Over the last 12 months, we've taken in two additional cities where we're operating directly those businesses. So that will drive some top line growth and some overall operating income improvement that you see coming forward. So we look at China as a market for Tommy to be able to grow high single-digits low double-digits for the next two or three years.","And put it in perspective versus Calvin Klein, the Calvin Klein business in China is probably 3 times the size of the Tommy business. And I think over time there's no reason that Tommy shouldn't approach the same size as the Calvin business. So I think that opportunity in Asia will continue for Tommy as we go forward.","Ike Boruchow","And just a follow up, maybe your current appetite around taking other Asian geographies in-house for Tommy and some Southeast Asia and Korea, I believe. Just how you're thinking about that in the near term to medium term?","Manny Chirico","I think, that's an opportunity for us. I think probably we would prioritize it. We\u2019d probably focus more on Southeast Asia first, meaning Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan. It\u2019s more aligned with the China business and the opportunities there; Korea, we've got a great partner in Korea with Hyundai Department Stores as our operator and licensing partner in Korea for Tommy Hilfiger. And I think we would be looking to really continue to grow that business with them as we move forward. So I think clearly, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, will be the markets we'd be looking to expand into, probably over the next 12 months.","Operator","And our next question will come from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Wes] in for Omar. Can I just follow up on how you're thinking about the online relationships outside of the U.S. Zalando team, how those relationships are developing and how you're contrasted with your relationship with Amazon and how you see that moving forward? Thank you.","Manny Chirico","Look, I think, the focus on this call has been Amazon because of the marketing initiatives that\u2019s going on in Kelvin, but the growth has been pretty explosive in Europe and Asia with partners you described. And we're seeing; we had a great Cyber Monday; we had a great singles day; we continue to see very strong growth coming out of the China. Again, it\u2019s a little bit different business model in China when we talk about Tmall, it's really a direct consumer model where you pay a commission versus Amazon for us, which is really a wholesale model. But both business models were really well for us. They are very profitable for us.","And in Europe, our biggest online partner continues to be Zalando, and they do an excellent job presenting the brand to do an excellent job really selling fashion and not just core; their strong partners, strategic for both Kelvin and Tommy as we grow the business and we\u2019ll be looking to continue to grow that business throughout Europe. So we see nice growth in all regions. As I said, our biggest growth channel continues to be digital and we define that as our own digital businesses, our department store, customer businesses, macys.com and the like, and then obviously the three side resume, the pure play, the Amazon, Tmall and Zalando, those businesses we\u2019ll put that all together but our fastest growing channel of distribution.","Operator","And we\u2019ll hear next from Chethan Mallela with Barclays.","Chethan Mallela","I want to ask about the Calvin Klein women's opportunity in Europe, which I think you\u2019ve previously discussed as an initiative you\u2019ll be pushing in 2018. Could you just provide an update on your efforts there and how you're thinking about that opportunity from a category and country prospective. And then I think it's been cited as one of the main unlocks in getting that business to your $2 billion longer term target for Europe. So are you seeing anything that makes you feel better or worse about that ultimate potential?","Manny Chirico","So we are launching that women's initiative in fall 2018. The market response and the receptivity to the brand in those categories has been very strong and very high. We want to make sure we go into the market the right way and not and hit it at the right at the appropriate price point. Right now, that the focus is on our wholesale model as we start to roll that out, but we will be adding retail stores probably more so in 2019 and 2018 to represent the fullness for lifestyle presentation for the brand as we go forward.","So look, it is early but it makes me feel -- I guess, the best signal we have is the performance of the Calvin Klein brand overall in Jeans and underwear, particularly in the women's category in Jeans and underwear that we\u2019re seeing such strength and that\u2019s been a big part of, I would say to you, we\u2019ve always had strength in our men's underwear and our men's jeans business. But as we look out, internationally, the biggest growth that we've seen with Calvin Klein brand has been in our women's intimates business and our women's jeans business. So really see the growth there.","So I think clearly the brand has got a right to be in that sportswear category similar to the strength that we see in North America. And I think given the strength of our European organization, we're very optimistic about able to keep that growing and that women's sportswear ready to wear, including accessories and related categories, will be one of the big drivers that we look at 2019 and beyond.","Chethan Mallela","And then just as a quick follow up. I think in North America wholesale, one of the reasons you cited for your outperformance is just the square footage expansion that you\u2019re seeing there. Can you just remind us of the key categories where you are gaining space? And then just in terms of the runway where we stand from an inning perspective with the distribution gains?","Manny Chirico","So again look we\u2019re seeing door expansion, we\u2019re seeing square footage growth with indoors and we\u2019re seeing growth with some key partners that we\u2019re really not in the business in a big way. So I think that it's coming from all different pieces. And I just feel that that\u2019s going to continue as we move forward.","Operator","And our next question will come from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.","Heather Balsky","I guess, first off, can you just remind us about your priorities in terms of excess cash. And I think a couple of calls ago you talked about outside M&A being on hold just given the border tax risk. And now that\u2019s off the table, does that change your view? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Look, I think I\u2019ll make Mike and Dana speak about some of the uses of the cash in the short-term. But just on the acquisition front, we would love to do an acquisition. We would love to do something that fits in and besides just what we\u2019ve been doing, which I think has been strategically a strong for us is adding our license businesses and taking more direct control of the Calvin and Tommy businesses, globally. But clearly we\u2019ll be looking to take on if we could find the right balance to find the third brand that we could put on our operating platforms, Europe, North America, Asia and then Brazil. We think that\u2019s a competitive advantage for us.","And we really know how to attack those markets and do it in a very synergistic way. So M&A, it happens when it happens when the opportunities present themselves. But I clearly with our balance sheet some of the uncertainties has been lifted from the overall environment and we\u2019re feeling more bullish about our own businesses. So clearly, we\u2019re in a place where we\u2019d love to do an acquisition if we could add it. And I guess in the short-term, some of the uses -- the primary uses cash, I turn it over to Dana.","Dana Perlman","Continues to be our focus around debt pay down and share repurchases that we\u2019ve executed to-date this year.","Heather Balsky","And just actually as a follow up on M&A and just adding a potential brand. Are there things that you\u2019re looking for in a potential target and are there things that you like to avoid. Would you want to do a more stable company or turnaround? Just how do you think about?","Manny Chirico","Well, clearly, we would not be looking to do a turnaround of the brand to hit finest great brand that\u2019s got operating issues that will be fantastic. So we will be looking for an established brand that has credibility regionally and has a potential to have growth and opportunities globally. And I think be it on the fashion side or maybe moving a little bit more into some of other areas. But I think that\u2019s where the focus would be on the business is to find the third brand that we don\u2019t think would be overly cannibalistic to either Calvin or Tommy that we can really fit into the portfolio.","Operator","And our next question will come from Eric Tracy with Buckingham Research.","Eric Tracy","Manny, I just wanted to follow up on the North America situation. Obviously, you guys are taking share. I appreciate that some year-over-year comparison in terms of FX tourism. But is the strength that you're seeing from the improvement in the market somewhat of decline and the stabilization of disruption you've been seeing in brick and mortar retail more broadly or is it really just specific to how you guys are executing?","Manny Chirico","No, look I think we're executing at a very high level and I think we\u2019ve been in there we\u2019ll take advantage of it. I'm not ready to say that everything is great in North America retail overall. I think we're going to continue to see downsizing of businesses and store closings. But I think that our retail partners have done a terrific job of managing into the fourth quarter, really good control over their inventories. And I think it will be a profitable quarter for us -- fourth quarter for us and in general as we move forward.","But it doesn't mean that the ills that are impacting retail in North America in the over-story of North America is over. I think those issues still linger and we're going to have to deal and manage through that. And I think we're going to have to deal and manage through some probably bankruptcy situations with some of our smaller accounts as we move forward. But I think that's just the nature of the North America retail business. And I think given the time, we're going to take one more question and then end the call.","Operator","And our final question will come from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Mann","I just had two I know that you guys are not ready obviously to give full year guidance for 2018. But you have alluded to some of the drivers that would affect the business. And Manny I was just hoping maybe you could give us some more holistic view of some of the puts and takes as you think about 2018 relative to your typical double digit earnings algorithm view?","Manny Chirico","I think we continue to be, looking at that algorithm, we don't see any reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to grow next year in that mid single-digit range for sales and that we can keep that double digit earnings growth as we move forward. Any more than that, it\u2019s just premature for us to really get into any more details. But the thing I would do, the one thing I would add is, obviously, the momentum in the business the strength of the business gives us a great feel of confidence, particularly for the fourth quarter and then obviously as we go into spring next year. So I think we've got wind that all back.","Lindsay Mann","And just to clarify on something that was in your prepared remarks where you talked about the spring campaign for Calvin and how you felt like these initiatives, in particular, were focused on driving the direct business. Maybe you can just elaborate on what that means?","Manny Chirico","Well, I think it's really -- I mean, these are our energy campaign that really I think drive sales and business, and it's brand building but it's less about brand halo. And on the marketing and the collection initiatives that we have in place continue but this incremental $20 million that we're spending is right at the heart of the business and right at driving what we think will not only be great for the brand but really will drive top line growth, not just in the long-term but in the short-term as well.","So we think these campaigns will be seen in our retail stores and with products behind it to drive sales with our key retail partners around the world, this campaign will be aligned with them. And as we think our key partners are taking position in the goods with the anticipation of the campaign is going to drive top line growth. So a little different in some of the first half initiatives that we have around, had around the Kelvin businesses, which is really focused on halo positioning and really driving our collection business and the fashion relevancy of the Calvin brand. This is really driving traffic and sales and we think it's going to pay big dividends for us in 2018.","And with that, I'm going to call an end to the call. I would like to wish everybody a happy holiday season; Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and a healthy and happy New Year. And we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter call in March. Have a great day and speak to your soon. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentleman, this does conclude today's call. Thank you all for your participation.

Please go ahead.","Manny Chirico","Good morning. Thank you, Ellen. Joining me on the call are Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Duane, CEO, PVH Heritage brands. ","I am pleased to report that PVH experienced a strong second quarter which exceeded our expectations, solidifying a terrific first half of 2018 as we continue to see broad based strength across our businesses. Our EPS increased 29% to $2.18 for the quarter which was $0.08 above the top end of our guidance. Revenues grew 13% which was also above our plans and reflected momentum across all of our businesses globally. Broad-based strength was seen across all distribution channels, wholesale, retail and digital. And digital remained our fastest growing channel with revenues growing over 20%, of course, our third-party and owned and operated businesses.","Again our digital sales for the companies represent about 10% of our total revenues. Our first half performance continues to highlight our focus on executing against the strategic priorities, which we've had discussed before. First, we are driving consumer engagement through innovative designs and personalized brand and shopping experiences that capture the heart of the consumer. We continue to invest in the brand experiences across all channels of distribution from stores to wholesale presentation and digital experiences.","From more frequent newness in our stores through capsule collections and more frequent products [drops][ph] to new omni-channel capabilities in store, which continue to focus on creating authentic brand experiences. We believe that our increased use of regional brand ambassadors, balanced with our global energy campaigns is allowing us to reach new consumers and build our share of voice globally, resulting in clear global market share gains for Tommy and Calvin.","Second, we are expanding the worldwide reach of our brands through organic growth and acquisitions. We continue to be pleased with the growth trajectory of our European and Asian businesses. And we see opportunities to take control of some of our license geographies and product categories over the next two years. Third, we are investing and evolving how we operate by leveraging technology and data to be dynamic, nimble and forward-thinking. We are making significant investments and enhancements to our data analytics, and our data capabilities, which we believe will drive future growth.","Importantly, we continue to make the right investments in our infrastructure to support the long -term growth of the business beyond just the systemic perspective, including investments in our supply chain which is delivering critical speed to market capabilities, enabling us to more effectively react to changing business trends. Increasingly as the mix of our business shifts to digital, our investments in digital sites continue to deliver against consumer expectations.","Finally, as we look to our projections for the year, we raised our earnings guidance by $0.10 per share at the high end of our range. Our new earnings per share guidance range implies a year-over-year earnings growth of about 16% and we continue to conservatively forecast our second half sales and earnings estimates. We strongly believe that if our current business trends continue that we have opportunities to significantly exceed our sales and earnings guidance for the second half of the year. Michael will quantify this in his comments.","Now moving to our brand results. I'll begin with Tommy Hilfiger. Tommy Hilfiger had an outstanding quarter exceeding our expectations and posting outperformances across all regions. We believe that we are putting the consumer first giving them strong product assortment at great value propositions including engaging brand experiences, and marketing campaigns to really build our lifestyle connection. I'm pleased to give you an update on some of our exciting fall initiatives. Hopefully most of you have seen Lewis Hamilton, Formula 1 world champion, our Tommy Hilfiger global men's ambassador. He has been wearing Tommy Hilfiger sportswear on and off the racetrack. He is resonating with the Tommy consumer across the globe particularly in Europe and Asia.","We will be launching our fall 2018 campaign over the next few days and which will include Lewis as well as our new women ambassadors Winnie Harlow and Hailey Baldwin. In addition, Maggie Young, the prominent Chinese actress was recently announced as our Greater China regional ambassador to help support our strategy to drive growth in the China women's business. ","Lastly, we will host our Tommy now Fashion Show in Shanghai on September 4th and the Tommy X Lewis product capsule will be available during that live show. In addition to the show taking place in Shanghai, we are also partnering with Tmall for a super brand day on September 4th which will bring the full impact of the brands see now buy now platform to China together with some special offers for consumers and exciting activations on tmall.com.","From a business perspective Tommy's revenues increased 15% and earnings rose 34% in the quarter driven by strong revenues, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Internationally, revenues increased 20% in second quarter with continued strengths in Europe and Asia. International comp rose 11% which exceeded our expectations reflecting the health of the brand and the quality of our execution. Our performance in Europe has been outstanding against even tougher comparisons which we attribute to strong product assortment and our effective efforts to connect with a new, younger consumer.","As we convert this consumer, we believe we are getting share versus our peers. We are pleased to see strength across all channels, retail, wholesale and digital. And as a reminder, our fall holiday 2000 (sic) [2018] order book is up over 10%, and we expect our spring\/summer 2019 order book to be up about 10% as well. Tommy Asia continues to perform as well. Both our China and Japanese businesses continue to deliver strong growth across all channels with exceptional performance in our e-commerce businesses.","In particular, we continue to be very pleased with the growth trajectory of our Tommy China business. As we continue to grow the brand, invest in the business and directly operate more Tier one and Tier two cities. I'm pleased to note that we are becoming more visible in the market together with our local activations we are seeing brand awareness and the desire to purchase continue to improve. ","Moving to North America. Our overall revenues were up 9% with broad-based strength across all channels. Retail continues to drive strong growth in the quarter with comps up 5%. We saw strength across all categories which we attribute to our assortments and the impact of our consumer engagement activities. Our wholesale performance had another strong standout quarter with strong sell throughs across all major product categories. On the licensing side, we continued to be extremely pleased with the performance of our women's business on the G III, which continues to experience strong growth.","Now I'd like to move to Calvin Klein. With our new Chief Marketing Officer in place and the brand really focusing during the quarter, we are increasingly focused on how we can leverage our already successful #my calvins. In particular, we have focused on evolving our consumer engagement programs from leveraging not only our global brand ambassadors, but local and regional influences to drive local market activations in an effort to further connect with the younger and wider audience. For fall 2018 we have announced a few exciting campaigns and initiatives so far.","I'm sure many of you have seen this Kardashian-Jenner 2.04 campaign that recently launched. We are getting great traction from a customer engagement and sales perspective. With our new monogram launch and our modern cotton programs experience strong second quarter performance to date. We announced our Calvin Klein women's fragrance featuring Lupita Nyong'o and Saoirse Ronan as part of this campaign. We are using #IAMWOMEN to allow our consumers around the world to pay homage to the females in their life that inspire them.","Our strategic partner, Coty, is putting a significant amount of marketing dollars against this campaign, and should be very visible as we move into the back-to-school selling period. As we head into our global CK jeans relaunch this fall, we just launched today our multimedia campaign for fall 2018, reflecting the next chapter of the #mycalvins movements, which embraces a digital first socially powered mindset. The campaign will have extended digital content featured across all social platforms throughout the season. ","Initial read on product in stores have been very positive with a great response to the new fits, upgraded washes and fabric treatments. Lastly, we have some great activation plans for the second half of the year. Many of which will launch over the next month or two and unfortunately I cannot spill the beans today. So be on the lookout for some more exciting collaborations and activations from Calvin Klein.","From a business perspective at Calvin, revenues increased 18% for the second quarter reflecting strong global trends and total earnings were up almost 10% during the quarter. Our earnings improvement was driven by our outperformance of our sales plan; however, operating margins declined 80 basis points and missed our margin plans. Beginning with Calvin Klein internationals, revenues rose 16% reflecting healthy top-line growth in both Asia and Europe. We are pleased to see broad based strength across Asia with healthy growth in China, Korea, Central and South Asia despite some macro volatility during the quarter.","In particular, digital commerce experienced exceptional growth as we continue to embrace the channels that are most relevant to our consumer. Calvin Klein Europe continued to experience momentum and we remain excited about the brand's opportunity to expand product line, and capitalize on the white space opportunities for the brand. Building upon the momentum from our 2018 order books up over 25%. Our spring summer 2019 order book is up 20% reflecting continued growth in all key categories.","Additionally, as a reminder, we will launch Women's Wear and Calvin Klein performance beginning with the fall 2018 season and we look forward to building out those categories over the next few years. Calvin Klein North America saw revenues up 19% in the quarter, as we experienced improved trends through the quarter particularly at wholesale where we saw strength in underwear, sportswear and our men's denim business. Average unit retails rose across most categories.","Additionally, digital was the healthiest channel across our department store customers, our own site and our pure-play partners. In our retail business, we posted a 2% comp store increase driven by healthy domestic consumer. Looking ahead, we are excited about the upcoming brand initiatives including our denim launch for fall 2018 season. ","Moving to Heritage. Finally, in our Heritage business, revenues for the quarter were above our plan for the quarter, but declined about 3%. In general, we saw a nice performance across our wholesale business with continued shared gains and our retail business posted a 3% comp store sales increase. During the quarter, we officially launched our Heritage digital ecommerce site this summer including vanheusen.com, izod.com and stylebureau.com and we have been pleased with the initial performance of these sites.","Additionally, beginning for 2018, we will launch Izod in Europe to customers in Spain, Germany the Netherlands and Scandinavia, offering our classic American Izod signature lifestyle products including t-shirts, polo's, sweaters, heavyweight knits, pants, denim and outerwear. We believe this is an opportunity for us particularly as we look into 2019 and beyond. From a marketing perspective, we recently launched our new campaign for a Van Heusen brand which includes a partnership with the UFC. The partnership establishes Van Heusen as the UFC's first-ever official men's dress furnishing provider, bring its innovative and flexible men's wear choices to the UFC's worldwide fan base. ","To kick off the campaign and partnership, UFC Bantamweight Champion T J Dillashaw; and UFC Welterweight Contender Stephen Thompson, are starring in a new commercial highlighting the innovative Van Heusen Flex Collection of men's shirts and pants which incorporates stretch features in a corporate business life-looking look without sacrificing the range of motion or comfort that is found in casual clothing. We think this is an exciting partnership and continue to keep you posted about it.","With that I think as you can see from our updated 2018 guidance, we've experienced a terrific first half executing against our strategic priorities in the face of the changing dynamics in the industry. Looking at the second half of the year, third quarter to -date trends are signaling a strong start to the quarter with comps running up similar trends as we experienced in the second quarter. We believe that the incredible brand power behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger continues to position us well in the marketplace against our competition, and will drive continued momentum into the future.","And with that I'd like to turn it over to Mike to quantify our second quarter earnings and 2018 outlook.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non GAAP results and reconciled in our press release. Due to the 53rd week in 2017 comp store sales for 2018 are more appropriately compared on a one-week shifted basis. Comp store sales I mentioned for the second quarter are compared with the 13 weeks ended August 6, 2017 instead of the 13 weeks in the July 30th, 2017, which was the end of the prior year second quarter.","Our reported revenues for the second quarter were up 13% which exceeded our guidance. It was inclusive of a 2% benefit from FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were very strong up 15% inclusive of a 2% benefit from FX. Tommy Hilfiger International revenues increased 20% inclusive of a 4% benefit from FX. The Tommy Hilfiger revenue increase was driven by the strong performance in all regions and channels. Tommy Hilfiger North America revenues were up 9%, fueled by strong wholesale performance and solid retail growth.","Our Tommy Hilfiger International comps were up 11% and North America comps were up 5%. Calvin Klein revenues were up 18% inclusive of a 2% FX benefit. Calvin Klein International revenues increased 16% inclusive of 3% benefit and FX driven by outstanding Europe and Asia performance. Our international comp store sales were up 5%. For North America, our revenues increased 9% for Calvin Klein; strong wholesale performance in all categories drove the increase.","Heritage revenues were down 3% to the prior year. Our Heritage retail business comp store sales were up 3%. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.18 was 29% higher than the previous year, and $0.08 better than the top end of our previous guidance. The EPS beat versus previous guidance was driven by strong business for $0.05. Interest and taxes were also favorable by $0.03. We ended the second quarter with inventories up 16% versus the prior year due to a shift from the timing of inventory receipts as a result of the 53rd week in 2017 and our projected sales increase for the third quarter.","We also continue to make investments in basics and core products to capitalize on opportunities for the balance of the year. For the full year 2018, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be $9.20 to $9.25, 16% growth over the prior year, which is a $0.10 increase at the top end and a $0.15 increase at the low end compared to our previous guidance despite a reduced foreign currency benefit for a full year. Now included in our earnings per share guidance is the reduced positive impact of foreign currency translation of $0.07. This is $0.05 benefit reduction compared to our previous guidance of $0.12 and consists of the positive impact of $0.23 in the first half of 2018, partially offset by an estimated negative impact of $0.16 in the second half of 2018.","Our new guidance at the high end when compared to our prior guidance at the high end now reflects a $0.10 improvement in business, $0.05 in improvement associated with interest and taxes, and this is partially offset by $0.05 of unfavorable currency. Overall, we're projecting revenues to grow by about 7% including the positive impact of 1% related to foreign currency. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 30 basis points for the company. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 9% inclusive of a positive impact of 1% for currency.","Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned to increase about 80 basis points. We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 8% with no impact from foreign currency. We're also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to be down about 50 basis points, which is a reduction of 30 basis points to our previous guidance. This reduction is a result of our Calvin Klein businesses underperforming their gross margin plans. We've reflected lower gross margins for Calvin Klein for the balance of the year. ","Our Heritage businesses planned to have revenue growth of about 1% and operating margins will be higher by 10 basis points to last year. Interest for the year is planned at $117 million compared to the prior year at $122 million. In 2018, we are planning to pay down at least $250 million of our debt. Stock repurchases in 2018 are planned to be between $200 million and $250 million. Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 13.5% to 14.5%. ","IRS regulations are expected to be issued later in 2018 related to the recent Tax Reform Act. Our current estimates could be subject to change if the regulations differ from our current interpretations. Negatively impacting our second half earnings per share projections is a $0.16 unfavorable impact versus the prior year due to FX. In addition, revenues are negatively impacted by about a $150 million in the second half of 2018, compared to 2017 from the 53rd week and resulting calendar shifts. The $150 million reflects about $80 million of revenue that does not repeat from 2017 into 2018 due to the loss of one week of business from 2018 compared to 2017.","In addition, the $70 million of revenue that moves into the first half of the year from the second half of the year as the calendar shifts a high-volume retail selling and wholesale shipping week out of the second half and into the first half. In addition, we continue to plan that the second half of 2018 will include an increase of approximately $15 million in marketing compared to the second half of 2017 primarily related to Calvin Klein. Marketing as a percentage of full-year revenue in 2018 continues to remain consistent with 2017.","Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $3.10 to $3.13 includes approximately $0.09 of negative impact for foreign currency. Revenue in the third quarter is projected to increase 7% including the negative impact of 2% foreign currency. ","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at 10% increase including the negative impact of 2% related to currency. Calvin Klein revenues are planned at 5% increase including the negative impact of 2% related to currency, and our Heritage brands revenues are projected to increase 8% in the quarter. Interest expense is projected to be about $30 million and taxes will be 4% to 5% in the third quarter.","And with that operator, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good morning. I was wondering if we can spend a little more time on the Calvin Klein businesses. In the quarter, can you talk about the margin performance in the quarter, elaborate on that a little bit and I'd be curious just the preparations on the denim relaunch. How that's gone and I think you said it's off to a good start but I was wondering if you could maybe update us on pricing around the denim piece as well.","Manny Chirico","Sure. Thanks Bob. Look, we are somewhat disappointed with the Calvin Klein margins for quarter. And I think what we've done is we've taken that result and projected out for the balance of the year. I think first and foremost, we've been more aggressive in clearing the old jeans product off the floor, which I think is a good thing and will set us up well for the second half of the year and as we move forward. So we've really been even more aggressive than we originally planned about moving that off the floor. And that resulted in some allowances in markdown, additional markdowns than we had originally planned.","In addition, I think as you know, we're launching a number of new Calvin Klein businesses internationally. Women's performance, expanding the men's sportswear significantly. And we are -- as we look at those estimates and as what's going on, we've decided from a guidance point of view to be more conservative on the margin expectations on launch as we look forward. I think we're really well set up, inventories are clear, but I think when you're launching new products; I think we have to be a little bit more cautious about how we plan some of those new businesses as we start to roll those out.","I think if you think about the Calvin Klein business overall, it's --we're not performing at the margin levels that we believe we should be at. If you compare it just to the Tommy business and historically Calvin has been at least at that or better. We're 200 basis points behind the Tommy operating margins. And we see that as a major opportunity for us, the second half of this year and as we look into 2019 to really have the opportunity to put that back into our business plans. And capture that 200 basis points expansion as these products start to get traction as we learn more about the new businesses that we're in. ","As the denim cleanup is completely behind us, it all feels very positive as we look out. And we're taking some short term pain today.","Bob Drbul","Got it and okay thanks Manny. And I guess just Manny a bigger picture question for you which is VF recently announced that they were going to spin-off their businesses. I was wondering if this is something that you would consider I was wondering if you could give us your perspective on any sort of possibility around that. Thanks very much.","Manny Chirico","Bob, we usually don't get into that whole commenting. But we look at I guess, let me take it different. I am not going to speak about VF obviously, but we look our heritage businesses as really giving us a base where we can -- from an efficiency point of view, sourcing point of view and infrastructure point of view, solid cash flows. And I think unless somebody can demonstrate to us the delevering that would occur within the organization from breaking that business model apart, and that we're going to get significant multiple expansions. That's to me is the thing and -- it's been hard-pressed to be proven to me.","As Calvin and Tommy naturally just continue to grow at the last two years at double-digit rates, the heritage business which three or four years ago is 20% of our business, today is 10% or so. And clearly is going to -- even with their good performance would just as the math, will just become a smaller piece of our business, but contributed stable cash flows, and give us the efficiency as I touched on. So I don't see us going down that road. We're always open to looking at opportunities to enhance shareholder value. We're not sure that's right for us anyway.","Operator","We will take our next question from Erin Murphy from Piper Jaffray. ","Erin Murphy","Great, thanks, good morning. Manny I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the digital strengths that you saw in the quarter. You talked about it being up over 20%. How much of that is coming from pure-play versus your own.com? And then if you could elaborate a bit more about your relationship with Tmall? It sounds like you have some exciting events planned in the fall. How broad is your product distributed on that platform today? And what do you expect in the back half from just the overall China market as you kind of further catalyze that region?","Manny Chirico","Sure. I guess, let me take a step back, digitally we're seeing significant growth. We're seeing on our owned and operated sites that we have ourselves around the world. We're also seeing with our business partner macys.com business continues to grow significantly. And our penetration there continues to grow as a percentage of our total business with Macy's and as well as some of our other department store accounts. It's just become a critical component to our growth as we move forward.","Internationally, as we think about the business we look at Zalando as a key partner for us. And we've seen tremendous growth and an expansion of our presentation on those sites. And done in a way that is very brand enhancing both for Calvin and Tommy as we move forward. So the growth there continues to be significant and the growth in Europe with our own -- our owned and operated site also continues to be significant. From a point of view when you think about our Asia business, the Tmall business and the [jd.com] [ph] business are two key partners for us.","We continue each season to expand our offering on those sites. They're our primary channel of distribution from an e-commerce perspective; e-commerce is gaining a greater penetration of our business within Asia at large and China in particular as the consumer really shops there and taking advantage of it. So it's been a significant growth vehicle for us. And then finally back in North America, our Amazon business and our relationship particularly with Calvin Klein, our Heritage brands and Tommy Hilfiger just continues to expand. ","We are very cautious about how we continue to roll out that product category expansion because we want to make sure the business continues to be highly profitable, but it's a great --it's a strong brand experience that's offered on that site. And we keep the assortment pretty tight clearly in North America. The e-commerce business is driven much more out of core basic products. And that's where we really tend to focus all of our e-commerce business in North America in that area. Fashion really we do that in our brick-and-mortar stores and through our wholesale accounts. And that's been driving the growth there.","So as I said I think our growth is up in this channel in excess of 20%. And our penetration from 12 months ago has gone from 8% its total sales to just over a project initiated just be over 10%. So we're very happy with what we're seeing and we like the way our brands are presented on the site.","Erin Murphy","Got it, thank you. And then just a clarification on the guidance for Calvin. Could you just speak to the Calvin top-line expectations in the third quarter? I think you talked about them being up 7% constant currency which is a deceleration from the 16% in Q2. How much of that is just conservatism versus some of the timing of shipments just curious on some of the drivers behind that deceleration on the top-line.","Manny Chirico","I think it's important when we look at this that. So we really look at least --you get hung up on quarterly analysis. I think the best way to look at it is on second half. And if you flush out the currency issues on both sides with currency being a positive impact in the first half of the year; currency being somewhat negative impact on the second half of the year. Move the calendar shifts that Mike talked about. I think what you'll see is we are planning -- for the business in totality overall we were up about 9% in overall for all of our businesses.","And we're planning the second half up about 6% overall. And Calvin Klein is more or less following that trend off of that, down about 200 to 300 basis points on an apples-to-apples basis. I think it's what --I think two things. I think it's what's going on a Klein and I think we're a victim of our own conservatism as we're building the plans for the second half of the year. We're just-- we're going to be up against up -- we are up against stronger comparisons. And we're just not building in that same kind of growth. The trends right now would indicate that we are being too conservative on that estimate. But we're only three or four weeks into the plan, into the quarter but obviously that gives us a lot of optimism against our plan.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Matthew Boss from JP Morgan. ","Matthew Boss","Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter, guys. On the margin front, so underlying the 30 basis point EBIT margin expansion guide, and I think you reiterated. I guess any change to your gross margin expectation for the year maybe how best to think about performance in the back half. And then just multi-year, any change to the larger picture gross margin opportunity as you see it multi-year?","Mike Shaffer ","So, Matt, when you think about gross margins, we did take down the Calvin expectation which also as I said I took down their operating margins, but that was driven purely by the gross margin reduction for the second quarter and a projected decline for the third and fourth quarter. Our gross margin projection was --we had guided for the year to be up about 90 basis points as a result of that take down. We are now guiding to be up about 80 basis points. And then as we look out, I would --I guess I'd say the inherent model, the strength of our businesses we feel good about.","And we don't see any changes in the model at this point in time. And we think as we go forward, we're still going to grow as we talked about.","Manny Chirico","I think you'll see that our international margins and as that business grows taking currency out of all of those noise, as that business will grow faster than our domestic that mix will also improve margins as we go forward. And I think as I said is focused particularly on the Calvin business because all we're seeing is in the Tommy Hilfiger and our Heritage businesses is continued gross margin improvement, is the Calvin Klein business really gives us the opportunity I think over the next 18 months to have a significant improvement in gross margin.","Obviously, that would flow through from an operating margin point of view as well to deliver upside against where we are today. So it's clearly a 200 basis point opportunity, and I think we're well positioned to capture that as we start to get into fourth quarter and beyond.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse.","Matthew Boss","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking all our questions here. I guess I just want to follow up on the earlier question. Manny you commented that you think the trends in business today could mean an opportunity to beat the second half guidance. I think it was the first time we've heard you use the word significantly. So I think you were --we always look to you for a transparent look here, I think you meant to say that on purpose. But you did guide your revenues very strong through third quarter, so I just have to ask up here with pretty solid levels in the guidance already. Where if we look back at the end of the year do you think we'll have seen the most opportunity for upside as you look out?","Manny Chirico","I think the opportunity for upside consider --would be top-line, continuing to grow to succeed the top-line growth. And I think from an operating margin point of view I think we could see improvement there as well. And I think that could --it could be significant, it could be significant as we move into next year. So that's really where we see the opportunities. I think we positioned the guidance given the strong performance that we've gone on the outperformance that we've had for the first six months of the year, even dealing with an over $0.35 hit from a currency point of view. It's --we've been able to continuously raise our earnings guidance.","And that's also given us the ability to be more conservative as we look at the third and fourth quarter. And the fourth quarter in particular as you think about it is, we lose the 53rd week. We're up against a 20% revenue increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 and having to comp that I think we're well positioned to do it. We're planning on an apples-to-apples basis to continue to grow, but clearly not anywhere near the levels that we've experienced the first six months of this year. So from our perspective, we think we've taken out just about every risk we can think of in the back half of the year. And really built our guidance where we can outperform as we go forward.","Matthew Boss","Okay. Maybe you can help us a little bit with -- on the near term I guess jump over to Manny and Mike. But on the third quarter EBIT, I think you're baking in about a 120 to 140 basis points of compression. How much to think about from grosses versus SG&A? and I guess backing up a little bit, I know, we've talked recently about a company adding a lot of SG&A in the past few years, and a lot of it came from some obviously important investments like unifying the creative side of Calvin. And some --putting some of the Tommy international businesses on your IT platform.","So but 2Q was the first instance we've seen that we could be headed potentially for better SG&A leverage path forward. Can you speak to the outlook on SG&A there as you see it?","Manny Chirico","A lot of the SG&A leverage is going to depend on mix as we go forward between the International and our North America businesses. So we're going to have to be clear with you as we roll that out because if as internationally grows we should see gross margin expansion. And actually from a solid SG&A deleveraging because that business comes with a higher SG&A component associated with it. I think is as we look at it we really -- I just repeat myself the Calvin opportunity is really where we see the operating margin expansion opportunity as we move forward.","Mike Shaffer","And look, I guess, I would add couple points. One, there is an additional $50 million in marketing baked into the third quarter. It's year-over-year, our percent remains consistent, but we did have a timing spent, a difference in timing of how we're spending that's in the third quarter. And look, there is a little bit of shift because of the shifts and the fourth and the third quarter, I think you are going to lose a week of revenues in the fourth quarter. So de-leverage on expense is going to be tougher while you pull out one week and you shift that high-volume November week out of the quarter, and put in a low February week. So more opportunity I think in the third than the fourth quarter.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Kernan from Cowen and Company. ","John Kernan","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Manny, I think this question is for you. The top-line performance has been obviously impressive but inventory for the last four quarters has now grown far in excess of sales. I just wondering how you're thinking about inventory as we go into the back half of the year? There's clearly been some Calvin margin pressure but how should we think about inventory and the ability get some of this off your balance sheet as we go into next year?","Manny Chirico","John, I think first, the calendar is just completely off. We're off a week and I know it doesn't sound like much but it's significant especially near to a quarter where you're building for back to school to get -- you get shipments in the first week of August. It's not apples-to-apples and I can't change that. But I can assure you and then when you think about, the only thing I would take exceptions with is, for the last -for the last four quarters, our top-line sales have grown in for those two brands in the mid-teens overall. And, yes, our inventory is going into the quarter we're up mid-teens, but I don't know how to have sales if I don't have inventory. ","So I recognize the point, I think we've always historically been really tight inventory managers. And as you think about the business being able to capture the opportunities I talked about is going to require us to carry some level of inventory above our sales plan. I would assure you that most of that is sitting in our basic categories, given the nature of our businesses that we have big, on the Tommy side, we have big essential replenishment business. On the Calvin side, we have big core replenishment business. I think about the underwear business, think about the denim and jeans businesses and those, some of those basic products we may own, even all sportswear. ","So huge opportunities I think to capture the growth, and I don't-- let me assure you there's not an inventory exposure built into our balance sheet that's causing us any concern about gross margins going forward.","John Kernan","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one follow up the Calvin business, obviously a source of margin pressure here, the Calvin International segment margins were down, domestic was up. Just wondering if you can help us understand which channel, wholesale, retail, international is driving the bulk of the margin pressure at this point in Calvin.","Manny Chirico","I think it goes back to clearly it's clearing the jeans business that we had in front of us in some of the markdowns and discounts that we provided for in the second quarter. I think what you'll see as you move forward you'll --you shouldn't see these things that you saw in the second quarter for Calvin going forward between international and domestic. I think international clearly will get back on the third --in the third quarter.","Operator","We will take our next question from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead.","Kate McShane","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. We continue to hear about how tight inventory is in the wholesale channel. So I wondered if you could talk a little bit about growth margin with respect to having more full price fell through specifically in the US x jeans wear.","Manny Chirico","Sure. I think you, look, I think that's been -- that continues to be a big benefit for everyone is the lack of excess merchandise coming out of spring coming, coming out- first coming out of fall and winter as we came into the first quarter this year. And as we're coming out of the second quarter into the third quarter. I think one of the benefits that everyone is seeing is the cleanliness of the inventory, and the ability to turn quicker and react and we're trying to build that into our inventory position in order to try and take advantage of those sales opportunities as we go forward.","I think that -- it really manifests itself significantly in our wholesale businesses as we go forward. You could see it in the Tommy business is clearly getting that incremental gross margin as we move forward. And seeing I mean fundamentally higher average unit retails going out the door at the department store level both in Calvin and Tommy is very helpful. The jeans launch and Calvin anticipates that as there's an upgrading of the product as we go in. And the product price points move up anywhere from 10% to 10% and we think that's critical for us as we move forward.","We've built in some safety net against that in our margin expectations, but if being successful with that relaunch and being able to gain that AUR increase in jeans really would be a huge benefit for us as we move into the fourth quarter and beyond.","Operator","We will take our next question from Chethan Mallela from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Chethan Mallela","Hey, good morning. So I wanted to ask about the Calvin women's and performance launch in Europe, and just a little more detail on the initial response you're seeing at wholesale. How you're thinking about the potential size of the business? And then if you can frame the contribution of those new businesses into the spring summer 2019 order books that you referenced, and what they would look like excluding these new categories? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Sure. I think it's a good question. From sales perspective, I think it's still --those are still really small businesses. And I think those businesses on the increase are worth maybe 200 or 300 basis points in the sales increases that we're seeing from an order book perspective I think was your last question. From an opportunity point of view, the women's opportunity long-term is a $500 million business for us, wholesale, retail in Europe that would make it comparable to where Tommy Hilfiger business is. And in every other region of the world the Calvin women's business is significantly larger than Tommy business, but we're using that as a benchmark as we go forward.","And in Europe overall, when you compare the two brands the Calvin business even with its strong growth that it's had in Europe and the repositioning of the brand and all the success over the last three years we've had with that business, it's still probably about 45% the size of the Tommy Hilfiger European business when you take all the categories into play. So that's where we talk about that we see white space opportunity for Calvin in Europe of about $1 billion for all sales, combination wholesale, retail and e-commerce. Just to get aligned with the Tommy business as we move forward. So that's the real opportunity as we go forward. The reaction to the product in the showroom has been very strong meaning retailers' response and that kind. ","But to be fair, the product is just being delivered 7\/25. So we haven't seen a whole lot of sell -through yet and we'll be able to give you a better sense of that in our third quarter earnings release.","Chethan Mallela","And then just a quick follow-up on --you talked about the task about the negative impact of a stronger dollar under domestic retail business, particularly in tourist centers. They delivered solid comps, positive comps in the second quarter, and it looks like the third quarter is off to a good start as well. So are you not seeing any reversal in tourist behavior or you seeing kind of other trends that are allowing you to continue to grow despite a softening of that --the tourist demand?","Manny Chirico","Yes. Look, what we're seeing based of all the data we see with our own North American retail businesses, the North America domestic consumer is very strong. We measure it against credit card sales and where they come from. That portion of the business continues to accelerate. And that's been strong --that's been which really drive our comp store performance in the second quarter as opposed to the international tourist piece of the business which is probably from a sales point of view flat to down slightly. And from traffic point of view is down even further than that.","And I think that's a function of the dollar and you could --we all have our opinions about consumer sentiment and China and some of these key markets with some of the trade disputes and discussions that's gone on. So clearly, although our retail business has been robust, that's been driven by the domestic consumer as opposed to the international tourist consumer.","Operator","We will take our next question from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning and congratulations on the nice progress. As you think of the denim cleanup Manny for Calvin Klein, when does that come to an end? How do you see that progressing? And then on North American wholesale and European wholesale what do you thing are the trends there in the department stores? What new or different are they doing and how are they planning orders? Thank you.","Manny Chirico","Okay. I guess I was --the impact that denim relaunches that'll be over by the third quarter. So there might be some tailwinds of that in the third quarter, but then after that that should be behind us. The trends that I'm seeing in department stores in North America business are good. AUR is up across the board and when we look at their AUR, I think everybody's honest, traffic continues to be flattish but conversion and AURs driving a lot of the sales increases. I think there's a lot of market shares in North America. There's a lot of market share, ships going on. ","I think looking at specialty retail, I think they continue to be a contributor to margin meaning they're losing margin at the expense of other players. And I think that shows itself in a lot of the comp store performance that's gone on. I think department stores are seeing --continues to see good retail comps on plan, and is seeing, I think what's really driving their bottom line is that this higher AUR and higher margin that goes along with having the clean inventories that we're all seeing at retail I think that's really benefited their businesses they move forward.","I would say the one thing I would say is they continue to buy very tight. They continue to demand inventory turn improvement. So at times we want as much as our sales performance would indicate we should get more open to buy dollars. We're constantly fighting for that and they're looking for more inventory turn and improvement which they benefited from a gross margin point of view. In Europe, the trends have been good. I think retail trends in general, I would just say is there was a moment during the summer that late June, July period, they --and I don't want to play weatherman, where there was oppressive heat. ","And I think everyone saw a bit of a slowdown at retail across the board. That's reversed itself as we moved into August. And you can see --we see in our own stores of significant acceleration of comp store performance in the first three weeks of August. So I think that's behind us. And I think it's relatively speaking, it's a pretty healthy market. We've got this pocketful of challenges as you would imagine like Turkey has been a challenged economy for us. It's not the biggest business for us, nicely profitable business for us about a US $50 million business.","We're also dealing within UK, the House of Fraser bankruptcy, which gets factored into the third and fourth quarter, but that seems to be an orderly process right now. And we think they'll work their way through that, but on balance, we are pretty happy the way retail metrics are working throughout Europe as well.","Operator, we'll take the last question.","Operator","Yes. We will take our last question from Heather Balsky from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Heather Balsky","Hi, thank you for taking my question. And first question can you talk about the decision to expand the IZOD to Europe? How do you size that opportunity? And does that change your view in terms of potentially acquiring a third brand to the portfolio? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Okay, yes, two completely different questions. For the first is the IZOD, the IZOD business opportunity is a question mark. I think we are excited about the reaction from our key retail partners. They love the product assortment and product mix that's available. Given the aggressive nature of IZOD from a pricing point of view, they love the price positioning of the brand that goes along with that design aesthetic. And I would describe it as a test. And we are --we're positioning the IZOD business right at or it's just slightly above most of the private label department store business brands throughout Europe.","And we think given the marketing dynamic we have, the legitimacy that's given to us by our European business platform from the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger business, the legitimacy that creates for us, it really creates an opportunity. I'm not going to size the business for you because I think that would be just a wild guess at this point. So we're really watching it. We're going to see it as -- we see it as an opportunity but clearly we think it's a $100 million business opportunity in the next two to three years. And we'll have to just see how quickly we can fill into that space and grow the business. And we like the competitive position that IZOD would be put into.","The brand awareness for the brand IZOD which is so high here in the United States does not have that same brand awareness in Europe. So that would have to be built over time. So that's the balance as we think of it. We think it's our best opportunity with our Heritage brands to take it forward. From --it has almost; I would say the IZOD experiment has no connection to would we like to acquire a third brand, global brand to match Calvin and Tommy along with our Heritage businesses. That exists. Our balance sheet clearly gives us the opportunity to take advantage of that. The business opportunity that creates given our operating platforms here in North America, Europe and Asia. That clearly would fit into that and now and I think our track record of bringing in brands and businesses through acquisition and being able to integrate them relatively quickly to get all the benefits and synergies we see in the bit. And the opportunities are there.","We did it with Calvin Klein. We've done it with Tommy Hilfiger; bring in the Warnaco transaction as well. I think all those things have paid significant dividends for us. And I think that track record along with our strength of our balance sheet clearly is one of the strategic drivers that we'd love to acquire a third brand. But it will happen when it happens as opposed to trying to force it. ","And with that I want to thank everybody for their attention. We look forward to updating you in November. Enjoy the rest of the summer. And speak to you in a couple of months. Thank you very much.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen.

Joining me on the call are Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer, and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President on Business Development and Investor Relations. ","Overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the first quarter, which exceeded our earnings guidance by $0.10 per share. In the first quarter on a constant currency basis, revenues increased 3% and EPS grew 20%. This outperformance was driven by strong underlying results in our international Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. At the same time, we did see softness in our U.S. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses where a strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted international tourist spending. ","Moving on to Calvin Klein, on a constant currency basis revenues increased 5% while operating earnings increased 25% in the first quarter, driven by the strong performance of our international businesses. The Calvin KIein brand initiatives are taking hold, and we continue to be pleased with our latest Justin Bieber spring campaign and our recently announced denim series featuring Kendall Jenner. We believe we are beginning to connect with a much younger consumer.","Moving into the second quarter, our international businesses continued to post strong sales gains. International retail comp store sales are running ahead of plan in the second quarter and are trending up high single digits in Europe while our Asia business is posting mid-single digit increases. We are seeing particular strength in China, France, the U.K., and the Middle East. ","In Europe, the Calvin Klein wholesale business continues to improve with our 2015 spring and fall order books, excluding Russia, up about 10% over the prior year. In North America in the second quarter, our Calvin Klein retails comps are running flat and on plan. We are seeing strong sales in our permanent population stores while stores located in tourist destination locations like Miami, Orlando, New York and Las Vegas are feeling the pressure from weakened international tourist traffic and spending. ","Speaking on some product initiatives, on Calvin Klein underwear globally we continue to drive our iconic basics while delivering new elevated product. In men\u2019s, we have launched two new programs globally for spring, Intense Power and Air FX, and we have seen very strong first quarter selling which has continued into the second quarter. Overall, the Calvin Klein North America men\u2019s underwear business has gained 300 basis points of market share in the first quarter. As a reminder, Intense Power is what Justin Bieber was featured in and which has sold so well at retail. Air FX is more of a performance underwear, which taps into what\u2019s happening broadly in the active arena.","In the women\u2019s area, our Modern Cotton logo product leverages the best of what Calvin Klein underwear does for men and translates it for women\u2019s with an active appeal. Modern Cotton continues to drive the improvement in our women\u2019s business in North America and Europe. Overall, our Calvin Klein North America women\u2019s intimate business has gained over 200 basis points of market share in the first quarter of 2015.","We continue to see great performance from our elevated Black Label product across both men\u2019s and women\u2019s in Asia and Europe. Our women\u2019s bra business in Asia continues to outperform the competition through the tailored bra category in both the push-up and solutions category. Overall sales for Asia in the first quarter ran up mid-single digits at retail, and that strong sales trend has continued into the second quarter.","Moving into Calvin Klein jeans, the new product that we have delivered, we are seeing a strong reaction from the consumer, particularly where we have installed new jeans shops. We continue to see men\u2019s outpace women\u2019s across North America and Europe, but women\u2019s continues to see an improvement. In North America in the newly installed shops, we experienced a 25% retail sales increase over the prior year. First quarter overall AURs were up about 10% and that trend continues into the second quarter of 2015. We are targeting 150 new jeans shops installations in North America for fiscal 2015.","In Europe, we are in the early stages of a turnaround in the jeans business. We have significantly improved the quality level of our jeans line with better fabrics, trends and packaging. This has resulted in strong sell-throughs and higher AURs in the first quarter with growth across all European markets, excluding Russia. Second quarter jeans sales trends in Europe had continued to improve and are running up high single digits.","Moving to our Tommy Hilfiger business, revenues on a constant currency basis increased 1% in the first quarter. The increase was driven by solid performance in our international business, including a 2% increase in European retail comp store sales. In North America, revenues declined 1%, resulting from a 3% decrease in retail comp store sales. As with Calvin Klein, we experienced a decline in international tourist traffic and spending in our Tommy U.S. stores. Operating earnings on a constant currency basis decreased 6% in the first quarter due to weak international tourist traffic in the U.S. which drove more promotional selling and higher markdowns. ","Moving into the second quarter, we have seen significant improvement in our Tommy Hilfiger sales trends. Retail comp store sales at Tommy have accelerated in the second quarter with international comps up mid-single digits and North America comp store sales up low single digits. In Europe, we have seen a significant improvement on our men\u2019s side of the business across all key categories, in particular in our largest market, Germany. We believe we continue to outperform in men\u2019s and denim relative to the market, and our women\u2019s wear business is also seeing improvement quarter to date.","At wholesale, our Tommy European business continues to outperform the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 full-year European order books, excluding Russia, are running up about 5% for the year. The strongest performing regions continue to be Germany, France and the Middle East.","Moving to our heritage business, first quarter revenues for the heritage business increased 5% while operating earnings increased $5 million over the prior year. This increase is principally driven by the shift in the timing of shipments into the first quarter of 2015 from second quarter of this year, and also driven by a strong retail comp store increase for our Van Heusen business of about 14%. Our heritage sportswear business continues to perform very well, both at wholesale and retail. We expect that our dress shirt business will continue to underperform through the first half of 2015; however, we believe that this business will significantly improve in the second half of the year.","Finally, we were very pleased to announce a $500 million three-year stock buyback program which reflects our confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. Our first priority will be to continue to strategically invest in our two global powerhouse brands in order to fully maximize our organic growth opportunities. That said, given our strong balance sheet and growing free cash flow, which we estimate to be at $450 million in 2015, we are confident that we have the financial flexibility to, one, acquire and take more direct ownership in certain Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger license businesses, continue to pay down debt, and return capital to our shareholders through our new stock buyback program. ","With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Mike Shaffer, our CFO, to quantify further some of these results.","Michael Shaffer","Thank, Manny. The comments I\u2019m about to make are based on non-GAAP results and reconciled in our press release. On a constant currency basis, revenue for the first quarter was up 3% versus the prior year, and ahead of our guidance. Driving revenues was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 5% increase over the prior year fueled by an 8% increase in our Calvin Klein international business with comps of 10% benefiting in part from the timing of Chinese New Year. On a normalized basis, international comps were mid-single digits.","Also favorably impacting the current quarter at Calvin Klein was the timing of wholesale shipments. Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold and we are seeing improved performance particularly in our international businesses. Our heritage business revenues were up 5%, also ahead of plan but heavily influenced by earlier than planned wholesale shipments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 1% and missed plan due to softness in the U.S., where a strong dollar negatively impacted international tourist spending.","Earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.50 and included a $0.27 negative impact related to foreign currency and expected weakness in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 20% over the prior year. Our quarter one EPS was $0.10 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.10 beat versus our guidance was driven by $0.02 of taxes, $0.02 of favorable foreign currency, and $0.06 related to the business performance, which was predominantly Calvin Klein and favorably impacted by the timing of shipments.","For the full year 2015, we raised our guidance to a now projected earnings per share of $6.85 to $6.95. If we exclude the negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in our Russian business of $1.25, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 11% to 12% over the prior year. Overall, we are projecting revenues of approximately $8 billion, which includes the negative impact of about $500 million related to foreign currency. On a constant currency basis, we are projecting overall revenues to increase 3%. Overall operating margins are expected to increase about 20 to 30 basis points, excluding a negative impact of about 60 basis points due to foreign currency. ","Driving the growth when excluding foreign currency is the continued improvement in the Calvin Klein business, which is projecting revenues to grow 6% on a constant currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 70 to 80 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 30 basis points of FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned slightly down, excluding the negative impact of approximately 80 basis points of FX. Our heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 3% due mostly to our exiting of the Izod retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our heritage business are planned to increase about 60 to 80 basis points, driven by the second half planned turnaround of our dress shirt business. The impact of foreign currency on our heritage businesses is relatively immaterial. ","Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $100 million and $125 million compared to the prior year of $139 million, due to the average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we completed in the second half of last year\u2019s first quarter. We currently expect to generate approximately $450 million of free cash flow in 2015, which will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for license buybacks and stock repurchases under our newly announced plan. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 21.5% to 22%, which is in line with the prior year.","Our revenue and earnings comparisons for the second quarter are heavily impacted by launches in the prior year for our Calvin Klein underwear business, which had a major repackaging initiative in last year\u2019s second quarter, as well as the initial sell-in of Izod at Kohl\u2019s in our heritage businesses. In addition, we saw earlier shipments in this year\u2019s first quarter versus the prior year and recognized about 25 shipments in quarter one that shipped in quarter two of last year. These launches coupled with earlier shipments are driving flat overall revenues in the second quarter on a constant currency basis. By business, we\u2019re estimating second quarter revenues on a constant currency basis to increase 3% for Tommy, flat for Calvin, and to decrease 8% for heritage. ","Second quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.25 to $1.30 and includes approximately $0.30 of estimated negative impact for foreign currency and a decline in our Russian business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS is projected to increase 3% to 6% over the prior year. Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes in the quarter about 19 to 20%. ","With that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","We\u2019ll go first to Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Morning. I guess Manny, when you think about the jeans business and some of the performance that we\u2019re seeing, the improved performance that we\u2019re seeing, when you look at the women\u2019s business, can you just talk a little bit about what else needs to happen there, what you\u2019re most optimistic about in terms of the overall jeans business, but how can the women\u2019s business continue to improve, what needs to happen there?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure, Bob. I think the thing I\u2019m most optimistic is about the product improvements that I see in the pipeline. I think we\u2019ve consistently talked about the fact that we saw that the men\u2019s product initiatives around quality and fit were six months ahead of where the women\u2019s initiatives were, so I really feel as we get into the second half of this year and into \u201916 as well, that you\u2019ll see more dramatic improvements in that business because of those initiatives.","In addition, I think when you think about the overall market, the women\u2019s denim category has been under just greater pressure around this whole active leisure trend in the market, so I think that\u2019s also pressured the women\u2019s business in a much stronger way. I guess really we\u2019re starting to really better understand our consumer on the women\u2019s side, what drives their purchasing decisions, and I think that our marketing campaigns are really starting to align with that, particularly with the Kendall Jenner campaign that just kicked off in the last month or two. I think that\u2019s really starting to connect even more directly with our female consumer.","So I feel very optimistic about what\u2019s going on, but clearly we\u2019re seeing bigger improvements on the men\u2019s side of the business today.","Bob Drbul","Manny, with the Kendall Jenner marketing, do you have any plans to include Caitlyn Jenner in any of the marketing programs?","Emanuel Chirico","No, Bob - thanks.","Bob Drbul","Alright, just one more question. When you think about \u201916 and you look at the foreign exchange pressures, can you just give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about pricing and some of the transactional pressures as we go forward?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. We\u2019re raising prices. I think now the question is to what degree, what opportunity that presents, what\u2019s the competitive positions that are out there. I think there\u2019s two things that go on. First is you raise ticket prices, sit down with your retail partners, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really in significant discussions with our key retail partners about what they\u2019re seeing and where we are, and then also particularly in North America but around the globe, in Europe in particular, how much do we have to promote off of that and how much regular priced selling will come off of that. So there\u2019s a number of levers to press, and we\u2019re really going to determine that over the next three to six months as it plays itself out and try to give ourselves as much flexibility as we go forward.","We\u2019ll also be testing in fall and holiday some price increases as we go forward to see how the market is receiving that. Competitively, we know a number of our competitors, particularly in Europe, are starting to move prices up for fall. We\u2019re following that trend and watching it very carefully, but we also want to make sure as a market leader and in a turnaround situation with Calvin Klein, market share gains are critical to us, so we want to make sure that we\u2019re not overpricing ourselves in the market. So we\u2019re really trying to bring a balance to it, but clearly there will be an opportunity to raise prices in the spring 2016 time frame, given what\u2019s going on competitively.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you very much, Manny.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick","Thank you. Manny, just to start off on the Tommy Hilfiger business, obviously the Calvin business had a very strong quarter, a little softer on the Hilfiger side. You talked about some of the issues in North America. What\u2019s driving the improvement in Q2, and how are you feeling about the potential to re-accelerate the Hilfiger growth as you close 2015 and head into 2016?","Emanuel Chirico","I think a couple of things, David. Let\u2019s talk about Europe first. I think--we have on the Tommy side of the business in our own retail stores, each month in the first quarter as we move through the quarter, the retail comp performance improved, and as we\u2019ve moved into May and we\u2019ve just finished the month of May, that was by far the strongest month. So I think we\u2019re really starting to see improvements in the European overall environment. Our men\u2019s business is really working very strongly, both on the sportswear side and the denim side of the men\u2019s category, and I think we\u2019re getting paid real dividends given our strong position in the market. Inventories are very clean. There\u2019s not a need to be overly promotional.","So in Europe, given what\u2019s gone on in the external environment, Tommy\u2019s significant exposure to that European market, it\u2019s by far our largest market. For Tommy, it\u2019s about 45% of our sales, so it has a much bigger impact to the business as we went through what I would describe in 2014 a softer kind of environment, second half of the year into the beginning of this year. That overall economic backdrop seems to be improving, and our business seems to be capturing that. Hopefully that continues.","In North America, I think we are going to potentially struggle with this international tourist spending. The Tommy business has such a strong following internationally in the United States, but that business I think, particularly in our biggest, most profitable stores, we\u2019re seeing traffic trends down in the 8 to 10% area in the Tommy Hilfiger business, although in the second quarter that trend improved, and I think some of that has to do, we believe, with the World Cup that we were up against last year when we saw a softer second quarter. I think that trend will probably continue into the third quarter this year.","As we get into the fourth quarter, which is by far our largest quarter for our retail business, the comparisons start to get easier. The differential from a currency point of view also starts to balance out a little bit, so we\u2019re hopeful as we get into the late third quarter and into fourth quarter that that trend will start to improve.","We\u2019ve gotten a little bit more promotional in those tourist destination locations, and we\u2019ve seen a reaction to that and have been able to drive the comps on a very profitable basis there. So from the first quarter where our retail comps in the U.S. and within North America were down about 3%, we\u2019re actually seeing them up 2% to 3% in the second quarter, so hopefully that\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re starting to see an inflection point, but we\u2019ll have to watch it for a little bit more data as we move forward.","David Glick","The timing of this improvement in Europe, Manny, you have--I guess you\u2019ll be working this month with your European wholesaler partners, so does that give you an opportunity potentially to see an acceleration in your wholesale order book for this next booking period?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, we go on sale in about two weeks. I think there is--in general I would say the European market, there is more optimism at the consumer level. I guess you\u2019d have to go country by country - there\u2019s a story everywhere, but I think clearly the backdrop is better today than it was six months ago, so we are more optimistic as we go forward. The retailers are still being cautious, I believe, as they buy. Our At Once [ph] business both in Calvin and Tommy Europe continues to be very strong. We have gotten behind those businesses with inventory even more significantly in order to try to drive opportunities that we see, so clearly I think there is opportunity in the second half of the year and we are more optimistic about the business in general in Europe than we\u2019ve been for the last nine months.","David Glick","One last follow-up on the transactional pressure you\u2019re going to be feeling into next year. You talked about pricing. Are there other strategies you can employ, such as pushing down AUCs, maybe controlling SG&A, so that you could potentially offset perhaps up to half of that transactional pressure?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, I think that\u2019s a good call. I should have mentioned that on the last question. There\u2019s three key areas. One is raising prices and doing it in a very thoughtful but aggressive way. Two is looking at the supply chain both logistically and also with our partnership with our key sourcing partners and vendor base throughout the world. We believe there is opportunities on the core side of that business, and we\u2019re also looking at potential expense savings that might exist. We\u2019re targeting to try and offset 50% of that transactional problem in those three areas, so we\u2019ll see where that takes us at this point. But again, it\u2019s a little too early to get ahead of it, but we\u2019re feeling good about the initiatives that we have in place and also the way the market seems to be addressing the issue. There\u2019s a clear understanding that retail prices need to move up, and that\u2019s what seems to be happening.","David Glick","Thank you very much. Good luck.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson","Hi, good morning. Could you talk maybe a little bit, Manny, about the Calvin Klein margin expansion, because there was some strong margin expansion there despite the currency headwinds, particularly internationally. Based on how the business is trending at this point, are your expectations changing at all for how the overall Calvin EBIT margin could ultimately look, but also how the European margins could ramp up?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think the European--just purely on an operating basis, operating margin basis, I think the biggest opportunity is Europe to see a significant improvement in the Calvin Klein margins. We have a $500 million Calvin Klein European business that is marginally profitable today from money-losing over the last two years, so our long-term target in Europe is to get that to about a 10% operating margin within the next four years. I think we\u2019re on track to deliver against that. The currency headwinds are just causing us some caution on that as we continue to look at the pressure that it\u2019s going to put from a costing point of view, but clearly there is opportunities from pricing and better sell-throughs to significantly improve the Calvin Klein European operating margins. To put it into perspective, Tommy Hilfiger European operating margins for full-year of 2014 were at 14% operating margins, so clearly with a well-run business of some scale there should be the opportunity to get to double-digit operating margins in Europe.","Overall, I think we continue to talk about 15% operating margins for the Calvin Klein business, and as we bring in some of the licensing businesses, which carry almost 100% operating margins today, convert those into much larger direct control businesses, in those parts of the world you would expect that our operating margins in Latin America and Asia should be in the high teens as we go forward. So again, I think there continues to be that opportunity and overall goal to get our operating margins in Calvin Klein to about 15%, and then take it from there.","Joan Payson","Okay, great. Then in the context of the overall denim category in North America, it sounds like maybe trends are improving a little bit, so could you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the category more broadly and how Calvin Klein jeans compared to the rest of the marketplace?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think on the men\u2019s side, you see the category has improved. The negatives have now turned to low positives, so the bleeding has stopped and I think the business feels better. I think retailers have planned it more tightly, so it\u2019s becoming a category that should be nicely profitable because there\u2019s not a real issue for us. We\u2019ll focus on fall with all the retailers on the denim area, so I think you\u2019ll see a lot of marketing around denim by retailers and the wholesale community, and I think there\u2019s an appetite on the consumer side in men\u2019s to really refill their closets, some real fashion statements that are going on there, that I think that category overall will start to improve over the next two or three years, and see significant improvement in 2015.","Calvin men\u2019s business in particular, I think I called out the numbers - we\u2019re seeing double-digit increases, so clearly we\u2019re gaining market share, but we have to be honest with ourselves, we\u2019ve lost about 50% of our market share from where we were four or five years ago. So really, recovering that, getting new doors that are opening in North America, and larger footprints in some of the key doors in North America, I think will be critical as that business goes forward.","On the women\u2019s side, I think the improvement from a category point of view has not been as strong as on the men\u2019s side, but it has been an improvement. I think it\u2019s kind of flattish at this point, the best data that I see. You hear different things when you talk to different retailers, but I think there the pressure from the active wear and leisure side has been more intense on the women\u2019s side, and I think we\u2019re really seeing that business start to turn around on the women\u2019s side but I think it\u2019s going to be behind the men\u2019s turnaround as we go forward.","Our women\u2019s business, we\u2019re really seeing a lot of improvement. We\u2019re seeing it in denim bottoms, but we\u2019re also seeing it in non-denim bottoms with a jeans construction, so really seeing a big change there and we\u2019re trying to really take advantage of that, both from a supply chain and logistics point of view to really capture some of that innovation that\u2019s going on on the women\u2019s side of the floor.","So it\u2019s better than it\u2019s been, but I still wouldn\u2019t characterize the jeans denim area as a hot category at this point. It\u2019s just not bleeding like it was, and it\u2019s actually slightly growing.","Joan Payson","Great, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess Manny, on the buyback, I do believe this is the first buyback you guys have done since the end of 2007. Can you just talk about your philosophy behind that, and does that change the interest in pursuing and bringing back some of the global licenses? And then just maybe remind us where you\u2019re at from a priority perspective on some of those international license take-backs. Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think, one, philosophically I don\u2019t think anything has really changed, with the one caveat that over the last 27 months since the acquisition of Warnaco, we\u2019ve paid back about a billion dollars in debt. I think that\u2019s just given us more financial flexibility as we\u2019ve gone forward. We really look at it as a balanced approach to return capital to our shareholders as appropriate and also to take advantage of what we see as the growth both in our Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. The opportunity to bring back licensed business, we think is our number one priority that we really have to go after. The way that lays itself out, given the nature and length of some of our license agreements, the buyback calls that we have in those license agreements, I think the triggering point to that is really 2016 that you really would see an impact from that, so we\u2019re working on that diligently. The opportunities from a geographic point of view continue to be Asia and, to some degree, Latin America. Those are both growth regions for both brands, both Calvin and Tommy, and they give us the greatest opportunity to take advantage of our operating platforms in those regions to really see some outsized growth as we move forward. So that would be our priority.","We\u2019re also looking at some product categories that would make some sense to either bring in-house directly or to take joint venture ownership position in those businesses, depending on the category and region what vehicle would make the most sense. But there\u2019s been no change in that being our number one strategic priority, along with investing in the organic growth of the two global powerhouse brands.","Erinn Murphy","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. If I could just add a follow-up on Europe to one of your former responses. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on what you\u2019re seeing in southern Europe in particular? I guess I\u2019m curious in Italy, just given how Calvin indexes there, are you seeing pressure continue from doors being closed from some other ma-and-pa independent retailers there? Would love an update there, thanks.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I\u2019d say southern Europe, so it\u2019s two big markets - Italy and Spain. The Italian market continues to be soft. It\u2019s not as soft as it was, it\u2019s not as negative as it was the last 24 months, so we\u2019re seeing a deceleration of the negative trends and I think a bottoming out of that region and that country\u2019s retail situation as we go forward. So we\u2019re starting to feel a little better about Italy. We\u2019re still not looking to make major investments there at this point, but I think as the year progresses and we turn into 2016, we are optimistic that we could actually see some small increases as we go forward there and really stop the bleeding in that country.","In Spain, which is our other big southern market, there\u2019s clearly been a change in the direction of the consumer spending habits there, and we\u2019re seeing it with our biggest retail partner, El Corte Ingl\u00e9s. Our business in Spain is more of a wholesale or concession-driven model. We have some stores, but really not that significant. It\u2019s really driven through El Corte Ingl\u00e9s, and that business has improved significantly over the last six months. We\u2019re actually seeing the business and our order book grow in Spain, and I would expect that that would continue to happen. We\u2019re seeing it in the mid-single digit kind of range, so I think the bleeding there has stopped and that\u2019s been a big market particularly for Calvin and Tommy. So I think hopefully as we get into 2016, we should start to see improvement there as well.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thank you guys, and congrats on the great first quarter.","Emanuel Chirico","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Eric Tracy with Janney Capital.","Eric Tracy","Hey guys, good morning. Just a quick follow-up as to the timing of the pricing increase. It sounds like spring \u201916, but maybe talk through when some of the transactional impact, the currency hits on the hedges potentially roll off. Is it a lag, or should it be relatively aligned with some of those moves to offset?","Emanuel Chirico","Well look, I think you\u2019re going to see fourth quarter as the euro drops--just to remind everyone, the euro in particular fell out of bed probably September 2014, so as we were buying contracts at that point and hedging as we go forward, that\u2019s kind of when I think you\u2019ll start to see some of the impacts. We\u2019ve talked about that this year, fiscal 2015, that 70% or thereabouts of the foreign currency hit was translation, and transaction was about 30% but that 30% really sat predominantly in the second half of 2015. So there is going to be some pressure third, fourth quarter. We are trying to increase some prices there and to adjust some costing there, but I think that\u2019s where you\u2019ll start to see some of the pressure associated with it and not be able to really significantly offset some of the cost increases since they happen so quickly at that point.","So early fall deliveries, we\u2019re not touching our retail prices at this point. As we get into resort deliveries that hit November-December, I think there we are trying to really change some of our pricing as we move forward, and then to be even more aggressive as we get into 1\/25 deliveries. ","Eric Tracy","Okay. Switching gears a bit, you discussed the pulling in of the licenses. Is there anything--you know, beyond just the timing of the contracts, is there anything from a management capacity perspective that would limit or prohibit the ability to pull those in? I guess just as it relates to all the investments and those being made on the CK business, do you feel like there\u2019s any sort of constraints that would limit the ability to do that?","Emanuel Chirico","I think there is--look, there is just acquisitions, bringing them in-house, whether they\u2019re $2 billion acquisitions or $200 million acquisitions, there\u2019s a level of integration that goes on that size matters, but it\u2019s not geometric. So there is a capacity issue, and that\u2019s one of the reasons I don\u2019t see us being able to execute all of these in a 12 or 18-month period. There are going to have to be stretched out over a three to four-year period beyond when the contracts come up. So clearly, we\u2019re looking at the opportunities that we feel we can execute best and would deliver the most strategically from a financial point of view, so we\u2019re doing that together with our management teams. ","I think it\u2019s important for us to be diligent and prudent about how we bring these in. That will be the key to success. I think rushing, especially where we have strong strategic partners in these regions--it\u2019s not like these are areas that are being mismanaged or the brand is not being treated appropriately or we\u2019re not seeing appropriate growth. This is really an opportunity to just capture more of that growth internally, so we\u2019re not under the pressure of we have a bad licensee or a bad strategic partner and we have to take them out. I think the urgency that that might have created is not there. We clearly had that situation in India and Australia and South America with the Warnaco acquisition, and we moved very quickly to deal with that by replacing licensees or taking more direct control of those businesses. I think that answers the question.","Eric Tracy","Absolutely, perfect. Thanks guys. Best of luck.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Morning guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Manny, I wanted to just ask you back of the napkin math here on the guidance. It looks like you\u2019re expecting Calvin Klein brand revenue growth to accelerate to high single digits in the back half of the year versus a low single digit growth rate in the first half blended to get your 6% constant currency guidance for the year. Could you maybe talk through some of the components of what accelerates in the back half from the trends that you just mentioned, which actually are already very good, so I\u2019m just curious what you see accelerating in the second half.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, hold on. I want to make sure your math is right, as opposed to--so I\u2019m just taking a look at some schedules. Hold on a second as I do that. Yes, I think what we are seeing really is second half of the year, not necessarily second quarter but second half of the year, we\u2019re seeing a significant improvement in business. We\u2019re seeing the Calvin Klein underwear business really significantly start to grow, particularly on the women\u2019s side of the business. The Modern Cotton business really starts to take off second half. Our bra business in general, the opportunity getting our supply chain in order to meet the demand as we start to roll those new programs out with our key retail partners, I think we feel very strongly about that and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving a big piece of the growth. ","Continuation of the jeans progression as we move forward is really starting to pay off. We have some significant store openings throughout Asia that\u2019s driving the business, and as we get into the second half of the year, we\u2019re not up against a number of the launches that we had last year from a wholesale point of view. We had a significant fixture sell-in, and that\u2019s first half of 2014, had a lot of fixture sell-in so we saw the improvement in the Calvin Klein businesses because of that, and we\u2019re up against it but still putting up increases. As we get into the second half of the year, that fixture fill-in is behind us both in North America and in Europe, and I think we really think there\u2019s a big opportunity for our direct EDI replenishment business, never out of stock businesses, particularly underwear but also basic denim categories that we should be able to capture on the Calvin Klein side of the business. ","So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving it. We think the big opportunity is really third and fourth quarter.","Michael Binetti","Okay, thanks. As a follow-up, having proven your ability to do math quickly, I\u2019ll follow up with that. If you add back the $25 million shift, that implies the second quarter revenue growth is maybe 1.5%, and you\u2019re telling us that most of the same store sales for the businesses around the world are running better than that for maybe everybody, except for Calvin Klein North America. So it seems to imply the guidance is set for second quarter below the trends you\u2019re seeing today. Maybe you could just elaborate on why you wanted to bake in some conservatism there.","Emanuel Chirico","Well, it\u2019s two things. We always try to be as transparent as possible, and I think you\u2019re right - I think the May trends overall are better than the implied retail sales guidance that we were using for the quarter. But it\u2019s one month, and to be honest it\u2019s just too early to really get too far ahead of ourselves. But if the trends were to continue, obviously if the kind of retail comps that we\u2019re seeing right now continue, there\u2019s clearly upside in the second quarter and obviously for the year as well. But I\u2019d like to see a little bit more of that as we go forward, so we\u2019ll see how that all plays itself out. But clearly there is an opportunity as we go forward. ","But my back of the envelope math also is that that piece for the Calvin Klein side of the business is worth about 2.5%, so just to put it in perspective, the timing of the shipments.","Michael Binetti","Thanks again. Great quarter. ","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Kernan with Cowen.","John Kernan","Hey, good morning guys. Congrats on some of the greenshoots you seem to be seeing in Calvin Klein Europe. Just coming back here to the States, I think, Manny, you said that North America you\u2019re seeing 25% retail sales increases at some of the new jeans shops that you built, and that there\u2019s 150 planned for 2015. Over the next few years, how many more of those shops do you think you can open?","Emanuel Chirico","I think for the next two years, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 100 shops a year. I think what\u2019s more important is that we need to get bigger square foot presentations, particularly in the top 150 doors in the United States. If you were to walk the floors in some of the best department stores in the United States, and when you walk into a Macy\u2019s or if you walk into a Belk\u2019s or a Dillard\u2019s and look at the Calvin Klein presentation, I think it\u2019s as strong as any brand in the market. But when I compare our presentation in men\u2019s sportswear, tailored clothing, dress shirts, with our jeans presentation, I would say it\u2019s 25% of the presentation that we get in sportswear on jeans, and that\u2019s not logical if we execute. We should be very--with a brand like Calvin with its heritage in jeans on the men\u2019s side, our jean shop should be as big as our men\u2019s sportswear shops around the country, and they\u2019re currently running about 25% of that size. ","So performance will dictate getting more square footage, taking it--you know, they\u2019re not building bigger stores. It\u2019s going to be taking away step by step from some of our competitors, but over the last five years we\u2019ve given it up. ","It\u2019s the same thing on the women\u2019s side of the floor. If you look at the amount of space that G3 has captured in the major department stores in the United States with Calvin Klein and the kind of growth that they\u2019ve experienced with the Calvin Klein brand, which has been high double-digit teens kind of growth, and if you look at our presentation in jeans, it\u2019s not 25% of what it is in some of the other categories, it\u2019s more like 10 or 15%. So although we\u2019ve got in position and now we\u2019re in the game and we have presentation to compete, we clearly have an opportunity to grow the square footage in North America and that is going to be the key to driving the success of the Calvin Klein business in jeans in this part of the world.","John Kernan","All right, that\u2019s helpful. You\u2019ve seen a lot of ebbs and flows to the global consumer. Given the significant move we\u2019ve seen in FX rates, we start lapping that in holiday of this year. Do you think some of that tourist consumer comes back, or do you think the exchange rates relative to the dollar at these levels permanently impairs some of those tourist doors?","Emanuel Chirico","[Indiscernible] I\u2019m not sure if it comes back. What I think happens is it reaches equilibrium [indiscernible], and I want to just be--even at this level that I talked about, the Tommy business under some more pressure than even the Calvin business, and with comps in these tourist destination locations at Tommy down 8%, let\u2019s say, those stores are still some of the most--are the most profitable businesses of the entire chain. So I just want to be careful when we use words like impair. This is still a huge significantly profitable business. There may be some rightsizing as currencies are under pressure, but I think that levels out and as you get that behind you, unless there\u2019s another drop in currencies again, but I think at this level I think that consumer finds their footing and I think the strength of the Tommy Hilfiger and the Calvin Klein business globally really allows us to capture that international tourist that travels to the United States consistently. I think we should be in a better profit position because we should be better in 2016, late 2015 in managing the flow of the inventory into those stores, getting it right, less need to be maybe as promotional as we were in the first quarter of this year, so I think that presents an opportunity as well.","John Kernan","Okay, and if I could just sneak one more in for Mike - will you only plan to buy shares back with free cash flow after debt paydown? The leverage ratio, if we looked at it on the balance sheet, is coming down pretty significantly and you\u2019ve maintained leverage on the balance sheet for a long time now, so is the share buyback only going to get done with cash flow that\u2019s left after debt paydown, or would you essentially keep the leverage ratio elevated to buy back some stock?","Michael Shaffer","So right now, what we\u2019re talking about is generating 450 of cash flow, and we\u2019re talking about paying 350 down in debt, and then with that balance that\u2019s left, we have opportunities to look at license take-backs and look at buying shares.","John Kernan","Okay.","Emanuel Chirico","And I think as we look out, I think the point being is after we pay down this $350 million of debt in 2015, I think the leverage ratio is at a point where we are more comfortable than we are today at the current level, and I think we\u2019d potentially be more aggressive as we move into 2016 and \u201917, really balancing out the strategic acquisitions and the ability to buy back stock and looking at those as we move forward.","John Kernan","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank.","Dave Weiner","Great, good morning everyone. So just two questions, if I may. Number one, I was hoping, Manny, you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. department stores. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about maybe a bump-up in inventories there over the last couple months, probably in part due to the port situation, but just kind of your view and if you have seen higher inventories, if you think those are coming down or normalizing. And then also, if you could talk a little bit about your accessories business. It\u2019s something that you guys don\u2019t talk about that often, so I\u2019m curious where you are in terms of a percentage of your business and how you think that can help your revenue and margin profile going forward. Thanks.","Emanuel Chirico","I think inventory levels, it\u2019s really a story retailer by retailer. I think some of the places where we have seen softer business that may have been more impacted by the international tourists, I think those retailers are aggressively moving to get inventories down. We don\u2019t really have any bulge in inventory sitting anywhere. We\u2019ve been very diligent about moving goods. We haven\u2019t--our flow of goods hasn\u2019t really been impacted by the port situation. We got ahead of that and really we\u2019re moving goods to the northeast and are really now just getting back to our normal balance of how goods are coming into the country. So we don\u2019t specifically see it.","I think there are--look, I think it continues to be promotional at retail. I think it\u2019s going to be a promotional Father\u2019s Day as we get into June and July, so nothing is really changing, but I don\u2019t see anything that would directly impact our business or the trends we are seeing at retail. So I think it\u2019s a little higher in some places than people would like, but I think they\u2019re taking steps to deal with it, so I feel pretty good about that overall. ","Accessories, we always tend to just pull that together with our apparel businesses when we talk about comps and we talk about trends, only because we don\u2019t want to confuse people and start talking about big increases on what I would say three years ago were relatively small numbers, but has become big businesses for us over the last three years both at wholesale here in North America, our business is growing double digit with department stores with both Calvin and our Tommy Hilfiger business with department stores, and in our own retail stores. We\u2019ve really grown the square footage associated with accessories, and that business has been healthy for us overall.","I think that accessories in general, what I would say is the category is not as robust, and I\u2019m not speaking now about our business, I\u2019m speaking just in general terms. I don\u2019t think we are as significantly exposed as some of our competitors to that category. We have a big, healthy business there that\u2019s doing well, and I think there\u2019s runway and growth for us particularly as we\u2019re price positioned in the market. But I think the kind of growth that\u2019s been experienced the last four or five years, I think that growth, be it watches and jewelry or be it handbags directly, I think it\u2019s starting to level out in general. It\u2019s still a healthy business as long as you don\u2019t get into inventory problems, and margins, particularly in a business like for PVH Calvin and Tommy, where clearly accessory margins are much higher than are apparel margins. ","We\u2019re an apparel company that has an complementary accessory business as opposed to an accessory business that\u2019s trying to develop some type of a lifestyle brand or apparel business. I think that\u2019s a much harder formula to navigate, given the high operating margins in accessory versus probably half those kind of margins when you talk about apparel. ","Dave Weiner","That\u2019s really helpful. If I may, can I just sneak in one other quick one? You had also commented that you expect an improvement in the dress shirt business in the second half of the year. Could you just talk a little bit about, is that based on some new product or something else? What\u2019s the expectation there?","Emanuel Chirico","There is some exciting new product that\u2019s going on there, but we\u2019re not counting on that for huge increases. This whole flex collar technology that\u2019s coming out, we haven\u2019t really spoken about it that significantly. It\u2019s really a second half launch, and I\u2019ll probably talk about it on the second quarter call. It has had very good sell-in, and we have to see now--we\u2019re testing it with the consumer to the reaction, but we think it has a real chance to have some legs for the business at slightly higher margins and price points. ","What we are counting on for the turnaround in the business is just getting the inventories completely rightsized and getting the business rightsized. If you recall, we had a very tough third quarter in dress shirts and a disaster in the fourth quarter, so to be honest, what we\u2019re counting on is that we\u2019re going to run the business as we normally do and comparatively you\u2019ll see an improvement particularly in the fourth quarter.","Dave Weiner","Very helpful. Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico","Given the time frame, this is going to be our last question, Operator.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from Eric Beder with Wunderlich.","Eric Beder","Congratulations on a good quarter. Thanks for squeezing me in. Could you talk a little bit about the licensing business? I see that was up on a year-over-year basis, even with the currency, and could you talk about where you are in the evolution in the off-price channel? I know you have been reducing your dependence upon that. Thank you. ","Emanuel Chirico","Eric, you just broke up. The last piece of that about the dependence, just say that again?","Eric Beder","On the off-price channel, I know you\u2019ve been cutting back on the off-price channel, and where are you in that evolution, where do you want to be in the off-price channel?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, let\u2019s talk about the licensing business. It was healthy, both for Calvin and for Tommy. The Tommy business just continued good performance with a number of key businesses, particularly internationally is where we really saw it. Our Asia business continued to do well and our South America business is doing well. On the Calvin side, the real growth driver has been G3 - that continues. Also the men\u2019s tailored side of the business for both Calvin and Tommy continues to do very well for us, that\u2019s Peerless and Marcraft, G3 on the women\u2019s side. They\u2019ll speak probably tomorrow, I think, on their call, so they\u2019ll give a bit more color on that, but we\u2019re seeing really healthy growth there. They are a great licensing partner and just do a fantastic job for us.","On the off price channel, we talked about it, the Warnaco business was overly dependent on the business in Europe and North America. In Europe, we are exactly where we want to be and the only business being done in the off-price channel is selling off clearance at the end of the season, which is normal, as opposed to selling in business in-season and treating it as if it was a department store account. That\u2019s behind it. ","On the underwear business, we\u2019re exactly where we want to be from a channel and distribution diversification, very well balanced. Eighty percent of our business is being done in the regular price channel of distribution, exactly like we would want it to be, premium positioning both in North America and Europe, that\u2019s very healthy. The jeans business has continued to be a story. In North America, we\u2019re at the right sales level at this point as we particularly turn to the second half of this year, so the comparisons will be fine. What we really need to do is to grow the department store business to a healthier level, so I think there the financial hits that we\u2019ve had to take by limiting profitable off-price sales, that is behind us particularly as we get out of this first quarter. That\u2019s completely behind us and shouldn\u2019t be a real topic of discussion as we go forward.","So I feel good about where we are, and I think as we grow that jeans regular price business, it will be in balance with the rest of the Calvin Klein businesses over the next two years. ","Eric Beder","Great, thank you. ","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, thanks Eric. I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you at our second quarter earnings call, which will be in late August of this year. Everyone enjoy their summer, and have a great day. Bye bye.","Operator","Again, this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We thank you for your participation."],"18361":["PVH Corp.

Good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President in charge of Investor Relations. Also, Ken Duane is on the call as well, and Ken handles all of our Wholesale businesses in North America.","So overall, we were quite pleased with our results for the third quarter, which exceeded the top end of our guidance by $0.16, despite the volatile overall market environment. Our results continue to highlight the strength of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger International businesses, as well as improving trends in our Heritage businesses.","Let me give you a quick update by region, what we see going on in the third quarter and as we move into the fourth quarter. In the US, the US market during the third quarter and currently into the fourth quarter continues to experience increased softness in traffic trends, in large part driven by a decline in international tourist traffic and spending trends, coupled with unseasonably warm weather.","Not surprising, getting all the news reports that the US is almost challenged macro environment. We had a good Thanksgiving, Black Friday weekend, but overall, November was a soft month, driven by highly promotional - highly promotional macro environment as a result of elevated inventory levels throughout the industry. For the fourth quarter, we expect these trends to continue and are anticipating a highly promotional holiday selling season.","Moving to Europe, Europe continues to be our strongest market. Both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger posted double-digit comp store increases in the third quarter. As we moved into the fourth quarter, we continued to see strong comp store sales performance at both of our European businesses.","The trend of plus-mid single digit comps continues despite a brief slowdown due to the Paris attacks. We have seen improving trends in all major European markets, including Spain and Italy, which had been under pressure, and those markets seem to have significantly turned around. We expect these positive trends to continue throughout the fourth quarter.","In Asia, Asia continued to post healthy sales gains for Calvin and Tommy in the third quarter, driven by our China business. These trends continue into the fourth quarter, as China continues to demonstrate strong results.","However, we anticipate continued weakness in Korea, driven by more - driven more by the broader market environment and softness in Hong Kong, in large part due to the lack of mainland Chinese tourists coming to the island.","Brazil-Latin America continues to be difficult and volatile, but very profitable for us. We expect this business to continue to be under pressure and volatile. We believe we are gaining share from our peers and the business continues to be highly profitable.","However, growth levels are significantly lower than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year, given the volatility that's going on particularly in Brazil.","On a brand basis, moving to Calvin Klein, overall we continue to see great momentum with the brand and our business more broadly. Calvin Klein revenues increased 7% on a constant currency basis for the quarter.","We have seen great progress across our businesses, as we continue to expand our directly operated businesses across jeans, underwear, sportswear and accessories. In addition, our Calvin Klein royalties increased 10% in the quarter, further demonstrating the overall strength of the brand. We are seeing strong growth in women's apparel and accessories. Women's and men's footwear and men's tailored clothing.","Globally, our underwear performance continues to be a great - continues with great momentum, with the women's performance outperforming our strong men's business, with a lot of opportunity ahead of us.","Key initiatives in this business include, faster replenishment, maximizing our high end Black Label fashion product in all international markets, and most significantly, keeping up with the growth of our women's Modern Cotton logo business, which continues to grow dramatically in North America and Europe.","To give you a sense of how we're doing with the brand in the United States on the men's side, on the men's underwear bottoms business, our market share has grown to over 30% in department stores and that's up high single digits for the year.","On the top side of the business, we have historically been a number 3 player in department stores and in the third quarter we moved into the number 2 position for the first time in the brand's history.","On the women's side of the business, the bra category up overall is up low single digits and the Calvin Klein business is up 15% year-to-date. And we are one of the top categories in all major department stores. Our panty - the panty category overall in the US market is flat and the Calvin Klein business is up double-digits for the year.","We have seen - we have also seen strong performance in our Calvin Klein jeans business, with the continued improvement in product, which has been evidenced across all of our markets. We are increasingly focused on key initiatives to drive the business forward, including supply chain initiatives around our denim efforts across the company, significant number of capsule collections and faster overall replenishment.","Asia and Latin America continue to be our two strongest markets for jeans, with continued mid single digit sales growth and improving profitability. As it relates to our two turnaround markets, the US and Europe for jeans, we have seen an acceleration in our European jeans business as our improved product execution and customer satisfaction is paying off.","On like-for-like product, we are seeing outperformance against our plan, against both genders. Our best performing markets include Spain, the UK, and the Italian market for jeans.","Overall for Calvin Klein Europe across all product categories, our spring summer 2016 order book is up mid-teens, excluding the Russia business. We continue to see increasing acceptance and performance for the brand across all wholesale accounts in all major European markets.","As we look at our US jeans turnaround, we saw solid performance in the first half of the year in this business, but as we moved into fall holiday season, as a result of the softness in the overall US retail landscape, primarily driven by unseasonably warm weather, we have begun to see a softness in this business.","We - overall, department store sales growth decelerated in the quarter to 2% to 4% - 2% to 4% increase by major account, with strong performance at some of our other retail partners, including urban outfitters and Amazon.","Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Overall our Tommy Hilfiger sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by our Tommy Hilfiger international businesses. In 3Q, we saw strong performance with growth of about 7%, driven by a tremendous 10% increase in comp store sales, which further highlights the strength of the Tommy business across Europe.","These strong comp store sales increases have continued into the fourth quarter of this year, with comp trends up mid-single digits. Given these strong trends, we believe we are growing our market share in all major European markets.","We saw great feedback from our marketing campaigns with all our major retailer accounts. The Rafael Nadal fall marketing campaign which focused on underwear and tailored clothing had positive results. The Nadal marketing campaign will continue with the spring-summer 2016.","As a reminder, our European spring-summer 2016 wholesale order book is up about 4%, excluding Russia, driven by a 2% increase in retail selling prices and a 2% unit volume increase. The category is experiencing the most growth included underwear and our denim category for Europe.","In North America, the US market in particular was plagued by further deterioration of traffic and consumer spending trends in the company's US stores. These stores are highly penetrated in international tourist locations and were affected by the unseasonably warm weather. Margins in the US Tommy business were under pressure throughout the quarter, as we were forced to be much more promotional in order to manage inventory levels.","As we have moved into the fourth quarter, we have seen these challenging sales and margin trends continue. We expect the holiday season to be highly promotional, especially on cold weather product. And we are planning the fourth quarter accordingly.","It is critical that we move through inventory and end the year clean from an inventory perspective, so that spring 2016 is not burdened with carry-over merchandise. That's what's driving our plans for the fourth quarter.","As we move to our Heritage business, Heritage had a good third quarter and is in the midst of a strong turnaround. Earnings for the group was up 18% and this improvement should continue into the fourth quarter. We are seeing strong performance in just about all of our divisions.","Just some quick highlights, in the dress shirt division, the Van Heusen Flex Collar has been an extraordinary success for us. We are seeing much higher average unit retails out the door, and we believe the consumer is reacting very favorably to our marketing campaign. This new technology will be introduced into our other major dress shirt brands, including Calvin Klein, Kenneth Cole, and Tommy Hilfiger.","We are also seeing strength in our Warner's intimate business in the mid-tier channel, especially at Kohl's, and we expect that trend to continue into the fourth quarter with strong selling through Black Friday holiday weekend.","We're also in a wholesale sportswear business seeing improvement from the prior year, led by the IZOD division with strong performance throughout its count chain. Our direct-to-consumer retail business also saw operating profit improvement in the quarter with Van Heusen posting 11% comp store increase for the third quarter and those positive trends have continued into the fourth quarter with mid single-digit increases for the Heritage division.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of these results.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. On a constant currency basis, revenues for the third quarter were up 3% versus the prior year and in line with our guidance.","Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 7% constant currency increase over the prior year. Both our North America and their international business had revenue growth of 7% in constant currency, driven by strong wholesale shipments.","Our Calvin Klein strategies are taking hold and you're seeing improved performance in underwear globally, as well as strong performance in our international business, particularly in Europe and China.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% in constant currency, also in line with our guidance with strong revenues in our international businesses, which had revenues up 6% in constant currency and Europe comps up 10%, with all major markets showing increases.","Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein United States retail stores located international tourist destinations continue to be under significant pressure from a lack of traffic and spending, but these declines were more than offset by the performance in other areas.","In addition, our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein US retail stores located in centers that are not heavily penetrated by international tourists performed well and had positive comps for the third quarter.","Our Heritage business revenues were down 5% due to the continued rationalization of our Heritage business, which included exiting the IZOD retail business, as well as several licensed dress shirt product lines in our dress shirt business.","Earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.66, and included a $0.44 negative impact related to foreign currency and continued weakness in our Russia business. Excluding this negative impact, EPS would have increased 21% over the prior year.","Our quarter 3 EPS was $0.16 ahead of the top end of our guidance. The $0.16 - was comprised of $0.10 related to the business outperformance, which was predominantly in Calvin Klein, an interest expense benefit of $0.02 and a tax benefit of $0.08. And that was partially offset by $0.04 of FX headwinds.","For the full year 2015, our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $6.90 to $7. This includes an additional $0.05 hit for foreign currency versus our previous guidance. If you exclude negative impact related to foreign currency and weakness in the Russia business of $1.35, our earnings per share growth is projected to be 13% to 14% over the prior year.","Revenue is now projected to be up 3% for the year excluding the foreign currency impact of 6%. Our new revenue guidance reflects a decrease of 1% to the prior year versus our previous guidance on a constant currency basis.","Overall operating margins are expected to be flat to the prior year, excluding a negative impact of about 80 basis points due to foreign currency. Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 8% on a constant currency basis and operating margins to increase 80 to 90 basis points, excluding a negative impact of approximately 40 basis points of FX.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis, with operating margins planned down 120 to 130 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 100 basis points of FX.","Tommy Hilfiger international margins are planned up, with North America operating margins planned down after FX. This decline in North America is due to pressure on US stores located in international tourist locations.","Our Heritage businesses plan to have a revenue decrease of 3% due mostly to the exit of our IZOD retail business in 2015. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 120 to 130 basis points. The impact of currency on our Heritage business is relatively immaterial.","Interest for the year is planned to be $115 million compared to the prior year amount of $139 million due to our lower average debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in last year's first quarter, as well as lower revolving borrowings [ph].","We currently expect to generate approximately 450 free cash flow in 2015, which will be used to pay down debt of about $350 million and allow for continued stock repurchases. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 20%.","Our revenue for the fourth quarter is planned up 5% on a constant currency basis. By business, we are estimating third quarter revenues on a constant currency basis to increase 15% for Calvin Klein, driven in part by the Chinese New Year, increase 1% for Tommy Hilfiger, and decrease 4% for our Heritage brands. Heritage brand revenues are negatively impacting by the closing of the IZOD retail division.","Fourth quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.37 to $1.47 and includes approximately $0.33 of estimated negative impact from foreign currency and the decline in our Russia business. If you exclude this negative impact, EPS is projected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 2% increase over the prior year. Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes to be about 20.5% in the fourth quarter.","Finally, as we look forward to 2016, the strengthening of the US dollar will negatively impact our 2016 earnings versus 2015 earnings by between $1.50 and $1.60 per share based on current exchange rates. Approximately 80% of the 2016 projected negative foreign currency impact is expected to be on transaction basis, while 20% of the negative impact is expected to be on translation basis. Our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to the purchasing of inventory in US dollars by our international divisions.","And with that, I'll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick","Thank you, good morning. Couple questions. Manny, I thought I'd start off with the revenue trends that you're seeing in Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. Obviously, a very strong year in Calvin Klein accelerating into Q4. Tommy Hilfiger slowing a bit, obviously US being a big part of that challenge.","How do we think about sort of the ongoing growth rates of these two businesses and will the Heritage business go from being a headwind to a tailwind now that you're past some of these rationalizations? That's the first question.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. So on the revenue side, I think it's clear that the, on the Heritage, let me start with Heritage. I think Heritage will start to be - will not be a headwind any longer. I think we'll get back to our historical rate of growth that's in the low single digit range, moving our profitability closer to 10%.","And I think that from an earnings point of view for at least the next 12 months to 15 months, we'd anticipate that the Heritage business would be a contributor to our earnings growth.","On from a Tommy point of view, I think for the next - in the short-term, I think that business will be under more pressure. I think the pressure will come, as you rightly said, much more from the US business, which is feeling even more dramatically the strengthening dollar and the impact it has on tourism in the United States.","Our Tommy business has benefited in the past from growing that tourist trade and really is benefited from both South American and Latin American travel, as well as European travel. And both of those currencies are anywhere from 20% to 25% weaker, and in the case of Brazil, closer to 40% to 45% weaker. And that has discouraged travel into the United States.","So I think that clearly will continue into the first quarter, fourth quarter of this year and probably into the first and second quarter of next year, as we go forward, as we cycle the strengthening dollar as we move forward.","Long-term, I don't think it's really changed what we see with the Tommy business. We think that business should continue to grow in the mid to high single digits. I think that growth will be driven more substantially from outside the United States, particularly Asia, South America, and Latin America, where we hope to be adding new businesses to our portfolio that today are either joint ventures or licensed businesses today.","On the Calvin business, we see nothing but momentum in the business, both on the underwear side, which is clearly really outperforming all of our expectations. And on the jeans outside of the United States, that business continues to outperform for us as well. And there I think our goal would be on a local currency basis to continue to grow that business in the high single digit range. So that's where we are, David.","David Glick","Okay. Secondly, Mike just talked about your updated sense of translational and transactional FX. Obviously, the currencies can move a lot between now and March.","But I was just wondering from a higher level whether you could talk us through, you know, some of the offsets to that $1.50 to $1.60, whether it's pricing, sourcing, SG&A, organic growth. How we should think about some of the offsets to that headwind, which, you know, hopefully is transitory?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, hopefully it is transitory, but I think it's with us. And clearly it's going to be with us for all of '16, since we are hedged out, you know, 12 to 18 months is where we go, as we try to position ourselves as we go forward.","So the difficulty we're facing is given the European market, given the significant lack of any sign of inflation in that European market so far, we've been challenged to really raise prices dramatically.","I think as I mentioned in my comments, we raised retail selling prices into the market about 2% for spring. We've continued to grow units. We think it's challenging in this environment.","Most other players I think have agreed with us to really go into that market and start to raise price, especially when your market leader in every major department store throughout Europe, with the Tommy Hilfiger brand, it's very challenging in key core categories, classification businesses where we have major positions to start to raise prices too dramatically.","So we're looking at other levers. But I think unfortunately the offsets that we'll be able to create purely from a pricing point of view and sourcing point of view, you know, are probably - will probably be able to offset 20% of it. But that's what we're looking at right now.","And then I think the improvement in the business as we go forward, as we go into fall, I think there is a greater opportunity to potentially raise prices if the market starts to accept it and as it starts to really take hold hopefully in the market.","As we start to see some of this improving sales trends that we're seeing in our business, hopefully cascade throughout the entire retail industry.","David Glick","How about on the SG&A side? Are there any levers you can pull there? Obviously currency will\u2026","Emanuel Chirico","Well, David, I don't think - I think that's the last thing we want to do. If you really look at the underlying businesses, we've got such strength going with both Calvin and Tommy, to pull back now on marketing, to pull back now on the investments in e-commerce and in the growth areas we see, I think would be like shooting ourselves in the foot.","So I think as we're going - I think we are in the industry, given our exposure to the international markets, as a US company reporting in US dollars, 65% of our pretax income is exposed to international currencies. And our two biggest are - our three biggest are Canada, Brazil, and then Europe. And we've known what's happening with those currencies.","So I think we are - we are being whipsawed right now, and there are some things we can offset and some things we're going to have to wait for the market to recalibrate as we go forward. And I think as we look at '16, that's the position we're going to be in.","David Glick","Last question\u2026","Emanuel Chirico","As we report fourth quarter, obviously we'll give guidance, we'll give more clarity. But to be honest with you, it's very much a moving target. And just this morning, I walked in this morning at 6.30 and the Euro hit its all-time low for the year at $1.05, and then just before we got on the call, Mike came in and said it's trending at $1.09. So you know, it's a tremendous amount of moving parts right now as we move forward.","David Glick","There's $0.10 of EPS right there.","Emanuel Chirico","There you go.","David Glick","Question for you, you mentioned Thanksgiving, a good weekend. It seemed like a pretty big improvement from what you've been seeing earlier in November, a lot of retailers talking about first half of November really being quite difficult.","Does that give you any optimism and what did you see across the industry over Thanksgiving and can we see some improvement here as we get into the fourth quarter?","Emanuel Chirico","You know, I'm not optimistic. I'm not pessimistic. And by that, I mean is, you know, Black Friday tends to be a moment, and there clearly was a spike and a change in trend. And I'm really anxious to see what this weekend brings.","But it's such a compressed selling period and when I look out industry wide and I'm focused now just in the United States, when I look out and I see inventories and when I walk the floors at specialty retailers and department stores, I see more inventory than I've seen in a long time. So there's a tremendous amount of promotional cadence going on.","So even if sales were to pick up, which would be great, I think margin's going to continue to be pressured in the US. So I would like to be more optimistic, David. But I just think that's the reality of this moment in time of where we are.","As we like to say here, the only good news is we get the comp business next year. So hopefully that creates an opportunity for next year when we get to some seasonable weather.","David Glick","Okay. Great. Thank you very much for your answers.","Emanuel Chirico","You're welcome.","David Glick","Good luck.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Hey, good morning, Manny. Good morning, Mike.","Emanuel Chirico","Good morning.","Bob Drbul","I guess the question I'd like to focus on a little bit, Manny, when you look at inventory levels, you know, within your business, inventory levels at the department store level.","Can you talk about sell-in versus sell-through and the visibility that you have in these new forecasts on, I'd say gross margin and the markdown support levels that, you know, you anticipate as we go through the next several weeks?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, we are - I guess we are projecting our margins down in the United States during the fourth quarter. We had a big earnings beat in the third quarter, and normally if things were more, much more reasonable, we'd be anticipating - we would have anticipated that we would have taken the year up.","But at the same time that we had a strong August and September, October was weaker and as we got into November, we saw weaker. So this unseasonably warm weather is putting a lot of pressure on it. Inventories are built, particularly in cold weather categories, and it's going to be an expensive fourth quarter to get through a lot of that.","I think competitively, we are in as good position as anyone. Our two fashion brands aren't overexposed from a pure cold weather category. We've got outerwear business, but it tends to be much more fashionable and more lightweight. So we don't have some of the exposure some other brands might have in those areas.","But we do have a big sweater business, big flannel business, big henley business, big heavyweight outerwear business. And to be honest, these are some of the lighter weight categories we're just not getting the traffic in the stores that you'd hope for, that usually the cold weather drives people in.","So it is the holiday season. Christmas will come, people will shop. The consumer is in relatively good shape. But the consumer is really getting some great bargains out there and the mall is definitely on sale, especially at specialty apparel.","You're really seeing prices that are 50% to 70% off store-wide. This weekend I think is going to be pretty aggressive. You can see it online. So long-winded answer to I expect margins to be under pressure in the US and inventory levels to come down, but will come down over the fourth quarter into the first quarter as people move through it.","Bob Drbul","Great.","Emanuel Chirico","And it's all been factored into our guidance, I believe.","Bob Drbul","Okay. And Manny, you mentioned Amazon as an account. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're approaching that business with your brands?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think it's critical for us that where we do business in any channel of distribution, what's critical for us is our presentation and our price integrity. And as long as those two are met, we are a multi-channel distributor of product.","We sell online direct to consumers ourselves, through our websites globally. We sell through some third party players like Amazon, and we have a big business with our key department store accounts, Macys.com, Kohls.com, JCPenney.com, that continues to over penetrate and grow.","Some of our - the categories of our business, particularly underwear, when you think about it, dress shirts is another one, given size and usually it's not a category to try on goods, given that nature of that product, I think it over skews in some of those areas to an online distribution and we're seeing tremendous growth in that area.","So we're very cautious about it. We are very concerned about how the brand is presented. By working with some of these third party players and not allowing them just to go out to buy goods in the gray market that's out there.","And, you know, have 10 items and that - but they are screaming on the Internet that they have Calvin Klein at 999, by cleaning it up and selling to them in a disciplined fashion, you clean up a lot of that noise, a lot of counterfeit product that winds up, and it really helps the integrity of the brand globally. And that's what we've tried to do in order to appropriately sell those channels of distribution.","Bob Drbul","And then just one last question, I don't know if this is for you or for Mike. But on the inventory that you have still on the books, is this a period where you would just continue to work it through your outlets, through your department stores or will you be more reliant on the off-price channel to try to, you know, work through some of this product that seems a little backed up?","Emanuel Chirico","So, look, we - our inventories are usually designated to our appropriate channels, Bob. So we have goods that go to the out, goods that go to the off-price channel, goods that go to the department stores. At this point, we'll continue to look at where we can move those goods when the opportunities present themselves.","We're fairly clean in terms of where we want to be. I'm sitting here with 65 degree weather, so I do have some fuzzy goods sitting in our stores that we'd like to get out of. But for the most part, we're up 3% when you exclude the FX on our inventories against a flat sales plan for the fourth quarter. And a lot of that investment in that 3% is on basics and it's in core replenishment products.","So I feel pretty good about where we are. I don't think I have to make any huge adjustments.","Mike Shaffer","I think probably the challenge for us going forward I think is not going to be selling the inventory that's on the books today, because that's been earmarked. It's all factored into our margin.","The concern we have right now, and Ken's really been focused on is, given the softer selling retailers are now looking at turns as they get into the spring season, they are trying to be much more cautious, they are coming - look, they are coming out of the season with higher inventory positions, they are trying to reposition it.","So what we are trying to do is help work with them to deal with some takedowns and some sales estimates right now and reallocate the goods to do off-price market, but do it in the most efficient fashion.","The challenge that that's going to face as we go into spring is that the off-price channel has got just about anything they want right now. There's more inventory in that channel than ever before. They are being very aggressive in the pricing point of view.","So we are being very aggressive of about using our own retail stores to clear the goods in the most efficient way possible and try and really capture that business, in especially warm weather, store locations as we go, as we start the turns into January.","So we're proactively working through it, but I think it's an industry problem that's going to be with us as we go through first quarter.","Bob Drbul","Thank you very much. Good luck.","Operator","We'll go next to Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson","Hi, good morning. Manny, could you talk a little bit more. You mentioned that retailers are being more cautious on the outlook for next year and some of the key department store customers are having a more challenged year right now.","Does it change the longer term strategy at all in terms of North America wholesale or any of those discussions changing?","Emanuel Chirico","No. I mean, fundamentally, no. I think what it does highlight is, you know, is that the wholesale model is built in a way that you don't necessarily - you don't necessarily feel all the pain as sell-through is happening.","Now, in the US markets, since you support gross margins and allowances, you feel it. But as retailers, when they miss their sales plan and then they adjust their sales plans going forward, you have to adjust accordingly. So we won't get caught with inventory, but it will put pressure on sales growth in the US as we go forward.","And it's a reason that we've always tried to be as balanced as possible with our distribution strategy. Our own stores, both outlet and regular price not only in North America, but globally, selling online directly to consumers ourselves, and also using third party Internet players to sell through that makes sense.","It's all about how - that our brand is appropriately positioned, what's the holistic outlook for that and trying to position ourselves that we are agnostic about where we sell the goods, whether it's through our own brick and mortar or through wholesale department stores or direct to the consumer on the Internet.","Now, the only thing that's challenged is in the last few years, as we've had to scale up the Internet business, that business has not been as profitable as it\u2019s been cannibalized. But over time as we go into '16 and '17, that business should get to a profit level that equates pretty much with our wholesale and retail business, just as that business scales up.","So we feel, we feel we're on track. We've made the investments systemically. We've made the investments from a marketing point of view. In Calvin Klein, I would tell you that over 50% of our advertising today direct to consumer is digital and Tommy is probably close to 40% and both of those, that explosion will continue because I think that's where you really can connect with your consumer and do business. And we are really moving more and more toward that and engaging with the consumer on a digital basis.","So I think the world's changing and our brands need to move with it and our distribution channel needs to move with it as well.","Joan Payson","Okay. Great. And then you talked a little bit earlier about the strength in China this quarter. Has the view or timing changed at all in terms of potential acquisition of licenses?","Emanuel Chirico","No, it hasn't changed because it's been a priority and it is a priority. And I think we'll continue to just move that forward and hopefully be able to talk about more concrete, some acquisitions that will bring businesses in-house in early 2016.","Joan Payson","Okay, great. Thank you. And happy holidays.","Emanuel Chirico","Thanks to you. Merry Christmas.","Operator","We'll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Calvin Klein's fourth quarter top line guidance, up 13% constant currency. I know you spoke about some of that being the timing of Chinese New Year.","Could you maybe parse out for us what piece of that is just from accelerated shipments versus just the business improving right now?","Emanuel Chirico","I think there is a couple of things. One, the business is very healthy. And I think and secondarily, you mentioned Chinese New Year. We operate the Calvin business directly. So we benefit from that. We are in the Tommy business, the licensed business, so we don't see the top line growth there in the same fashion. So that's the difference between the two.","Secondarily, we've also converted a number of stores, our accessory stores and underwear stores in North America, which came on - which really came on in late third quarter and will be in place for fourth quarter. That's really helping the business. Those stores are off to a really nice start for us. We feel really positive about that.","So there's a number of - I think 15% is by its nature, if you're looking at guidance, too high. But I think the similar 7% to 9% kind of growth, that's what's factored into the ongoing business and nothing has really slowed down there that would that give us any concerns.","Erinn Murphy","Got it. That's great to hear. And then just on the tourist impact domestically, could you just help us think about the incrementality for Q3 versus what it was in Q2?","And then it sounds like you're still anticipating just some of that pressure from tourist traffic domestically to cycle through into the fourth and into the first part of - fourth quarter and into first part of next year. Just help us think about kind of some of the incrementality there as dollar continue strengthen?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. The best way to say, on the Calvin Klein business, round numbers, it represents about 25% of the retail volume. On the Tommy Hilfiger business, it represents probably 45% of the retail volume. So those are those big markets that are Miami, Las Vegas, LA, New York, New York metropolitan area, Orlando. Those key big markets, Tommy has major presence in those markets, even greater than Calvin. And it's really - and they will feel it more.","I think what you'll see next year is, if you look at how it's progressed is, last year we really didn't feel much of an impact as currency started to move in last year's fourth quarter. As we got into the first and second quarter, we saw some impact, but I think the full impact of that came through starting in the third quarter of this year, July and August of this year, in particular.","And I think that's, for a couple of reasons. One is people tend to book vacations six months out. And they book them and I think there was a tendency not to cancel as much. And so that will start to factor in as we go forward.","So I think quarter-by-quarter, I think we'll be impacted in first quarter and then to a degree in the second quarter, and then it should hopefully start to level out as we go into the second half of next year. And that's the way we are probably going to be planning our business unless we see some change.","Erinn Murphy","Got it. And then just last question on Europe, it's pretty encouraging to see you guys finally start to see that turn in Italy, which I think has been the biggest laggard there. It\u2019s a big business for your Calvin business in particular.","Can you just talk about how you're thinking about that going forward and is that big enough to continue to help that order book in Europe remain very healthy as you get into the back half bookings for next year?","Emanuel Chirico","We're - so let me speak to Italy first. The Italian market, we are very encouraged about what we see, mainly because the last three years it's been a drain, both the Calvin and Tommy. And by that I mean it's probably down over a 3 year period from where it had been 45%. So it's been down 10% to 15% a year for the last 3 years.","This year second half is the first time we saw that trend start to turn. I wouldn't - just to put things in perspective, I wouldn't classify the Italian market as healthy and vibrant. But I would say it's in the midst, beginnings of a turnaround. It's stabilized, and we're growing off of it in the high single digit kind of range. So that feels good.","Particularly in Calvin we are really seeing stronger growth, because I think we - one, our exposure in that market and the consumer\u2019s acceptance of the Calvin Klein brand in Italy and how well we've done historically there.","I think we're starting to get paid back for some of the product advancements we've made, for some of the closedown of the inefficient stores to better stores direct-to-consumer, and even in the wholesale channel there we've really gotten the business back on track. So I think we can continue to see outsized growth on the Calvin Klein business there.","But I guess I would say is, we are encouraged by what we see in Europe overall. You know, Spain in particular has been - it\u2019s been ahead of the Italian market, but if you go back, it went through a tough period of time with our largest wholesale account, El Corte Ingles, really struggling during a period of time. We've seen that business really stabilize. We saw it strengthen as we've gone forward. So our business in Spain continues to grow.","And then with the Calvin product, the UK, France, Scandinavian market, Germany in particular, which is by far the biggest market in Europe where Calvin had 3 years ago a very limited presence. It will probably become our biggest market for the Calvin Klein brand in 2016.","So we are excited about how the brand is performing across Europe. Unfortunately, we're being hurt with currencies. But we are well ahead of schedule on the turnaround in Europe with Calvin Klein business, if you look at the fundamentals of the business and where we are positioned.","Erinn Murphy","Great. That's good to hear. And happy holidays to you and the team.","Emanuel Chirico","Happy holidays to you. Merry Christmas.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe this might be one for Mike. But I'm trying to reconcile a few comments you made on the FX outlook as we think ahead compared to where we were recently.","I think on the second quarter call we were talking about maybe a dollar pressure next year to maybe even $1.20, but also earlier in the year also talking about offsetting, call it 35% to 50% of that with some price increases, manufacturing costs, negotiations lower and maybe some SG&A control.","It sounds like what you're getting the low single-digit price increases that you talked about. I haven't seen which currencies have moved much since we talked to you guys on the second quarter. So I'm just trying to reconcile the GAAP and what you seem to be leading us to for the FX outlook next year?","Mike Shaffer","Sure. I guess, the biggest change was second quarter when we reported the euro was at $1.13. Today, it's at, you know, when we closed the quarter, we were at $1.05 and that's by far our biggest currency exposure from marketing. That's been the biggest - that's probably been the biggest change from the second quarter as we've gone forward.","The other change is, I guess we were, again, in the early stages of it and where we are now, we were thinking more - we were thinking there might have been more opportunity to potentially raise prices higher than the 2%. And right now for the spring season, that's where we - that's where we are. We hope that can improve as we go into the third quarter.","So the $1.20 number, $1.25 number that we talked about last time really increased to the $1.50 to $1.60 number, totally based on what's really gone on with the euro and to a limited degree what's gone on with the Canadian dollar. So that's the fundamental change.","And as that - as we've now, we're probably 85% locked in to 90% locked in with hedges for 2016. This is where it's kind of looks like it's actually falling out. So that's been the change from our second quarter call.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And Manny, on your conversations with retailers in the US, and obviously I think you say, the current trend seems to be little bit isolated to weather, you're working with them to help clear inventories.","But then as we look ahead to next year, I mean, is there a general sense in the industry that we're going to order more cautiously, even though we do know - it was at least in large part impacted by weather.","I mean, do you want to - do the retailers want to plan more cautiously with their orders for next year, even though we think it\u2019s weather or are they just saying, let's focus on margin next year, maybe order a little bit lower just in case, even though the weather, you know, we're not really forecasting it to be as big of a drag as next year at this time?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes. Michael, I guess it's a fair point and it's clearly a fair point from a financial guide. But that's just not the way retailers work. Retailers work off of this is what was last year and they may say, look, we think there's opportunity, so we're going to plan our comps instead of up 1.5%, we're going to plan it up 2.5%. But it's not like they'd say - they won't go back and say 2 years ago we did X dollars and we're going to do that much and we're going to drive it.","So, you know, they tend to do what's safe. And what's safe is they are getting - besides getting hurt on the top line, they are really getting hurt on the margin line. So what I always like to say, there are some years that are sales years and some years that are margin years. And I think for retailers and probably for most apparel companies, next year has got to be a margin year.","Because the margins are depressed, you can see it in front of you. So you can really plan better for that and then they will tend to chase goods into the fall season as those opportunities present themselves.","So we'll also try to, maybe try to be smart about inventory and decide where it's appropriate to take some risk next year in the second half with some inventory, if we start to see some positive trends and some selling.","But I mean, that's the reality of it. I think you hit it on the head when you said, they are really going to try to manage the terms and manage margins and manage their markdowns for '16.","Michael Binetti","Let me ask you one last. Manny, you know, it sounds like there's a general sense that the market, we should expect it to remain at least a little bit sluggish next year, if that\u2019s a fair comment, at least to be ready for it. No one has really have accused you've been lazy about pursuing opportunities.","So as you go back to Erin's question about, the license roll-ups next year. Is it really like we have to sit here and wait to we have a willing seller on these licenses that we're focuses on or is it time to say look, maybe we should look little bit more strategically, is there a brand that we could add to our portfolio and is 2016 the right year for us to start thinking about that a little bit more broadly, given somewhat muted outlook for the industry?","Emanuel Chirico","Look, there's - we've done a lot of acquisitions over the years. And in the last five, six years, we've done some major acquisitions. So my - those are impossible, the kind of acquisition you're talking about, adding a brand, and something that's going to fundamentally change the company to a degree, it's impossible to anticipate that. That happens when it happens.","I think I've tried to be clear to say is, we're in a position right now where the Warnaco acquisition is fully integrated systemically. We're there, we're moving it forward. We seem to be really capturing a lot of the opportunities from the acquisition in underwear in particular, in jeans, as we continue to make advancements in that category. So I think that's behind us and we can see that ahead of us, some of the growth that will come with that.","So it gives us - all that said, paying off a billion dollars of debt in the last three years, the balance sheet is in strong position. As opportunities present themselves, where two or three years ago we just said we're not looking, today we are looking. We are interested to see what the opportunities might be.","And from a strategic point of view, based on what we own today, the best acquisitions we could do are the ones I've talked about, which is the re-acquisitions of the licenses. But at the same time, opportunities present themselves. We are - we've been very good at being able to take advantage of those opportunities. Nobody anticipated that we would acquire Tommy Hilfiger when we did.","It turns out to be a fantastic acquisition for our shareholders. And we'll look for those same type of opportunities as they present themselves. Planning for it from, you know, projecting out earnings and whatnot, you can't - it's impossible to do. But be assured this management team is not sitting back and waiting for something to happen. We're out there trying to make things happen.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll go next to Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the underlying expectation for the fall order book, as you start thinking about inventory buys for seasonal product in holiday in the fall of 2016.","I know it's a long ways off, but just want to see how you're approaching that as you build out your plans for the year for next year?","Emanuel Chirico","You know, we are half way into - I don't mean this is going stop, in any way disparaging but we haven't even gotten through the holidays '15 season, so it\u2019s really planning inventory purchases is challenging.","So as we are looking at the overall projections and thinking about the business, we are - we're fortunate in that we had some real core replenishment businesses, particularly our underwear business, our dress category business, even our sportswear businesses, the denim categories. We continue to get behind those businesses to make sure we execute and maximize those businesses.","As we are working out, there's no reason for us, except to secure production, where there's no reason for us to get ahead of the order cycle in any significant way. So to commit inventories, there's no reason for us to do that. So we are staying as nimble as possible to try to take advantage of every opportunity from a top line point of view and also at the same time to manage the risk against that, that presents itself by overexposing ourselves to commitments in production.","You know, the cold weather product, how that all works out next year, I think that will take care of itself and the lead times on that are such that we'll have plenty of times to react, not to get caught in any way with inventory. And to take appropriate risks in order to capture potential opportunities as we go forward. And since it is about - it's well after 10 O\u2019clock we're going to make this the last question, operator. We'll take one more question.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Kernan with Cowen & Company.","Krista Zuber","Good morning. This is Krista Zuber on behalf of John. Thanks for taking our, getting our question in. So just very quickly, just wanted to circle back on AURs. Just how far do you think you can push AURs higher in Europe, kind of starting in Q3, '16, as you alluded to for both Calvin and Tommy? Thanks.","Emanuel Chirico","That's the interesting question, how far we can press it. That\u2019s we're in the process of really trying to figure out. I would say the high point is mid single-digit increase to a low single digit increase. And we're talking somewhere between 2% and 5% I think for fall. I think that's reasonable.","I know there is been one or two others that have been out there talking much more aggressively about it and we just don't think it's logical. We think that even if it's accepted by the retailer, it's got to dramatically affect your sell-throughs and you have to really look at your competitive set and what you're seeing. You can't look at it in isolation.","So we are really trying to manage that and think it through very thoughtfully about managing gross margin percentage versus gross margin dollars to see what the, what will give us the optimal answer.","And as we are trying to protect with the Tommy business a very large market position, we're not giving up market share to the competitive set, so they can come in and underbid us for potential categories. So that's the balancing act that's going on right now.","Krista Zuber","Okay. Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico","You're very welcome.","Emanuel Chirico","I would like to thank everybody for joining us. Look forward to seeing you on the New Year. Wish everybody happy holidays, Merry Christmas, and a happy and healthy new year to you and your families. Thank you very much. Have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"18375":["PVH Corp.

Good morning. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relationship. Our President, Stefan Larsson is traveling and visiting some of our international locations and will be joining us on our fourth quarter call.","I am pleased to report that PVH posted strong third quarter results, especially in light of the challenging and volatile global backdrop. We reported earnings per share of $3.10, which exceeded the high-end of our previous guidance by $0.10, despite the higher than planned interest and taxes of approximately $0.10 per share. This outperformance was principally driven by our European businesses and better than planned performance in our Asia Pacific businesses.","Revenues rose 4% on a constant currency basis, which also exceeded our previous guidance. Although we are raising our annual earnings guidance for the year, we continue to take a conservative approach to planning the fourth quarter holiday season. Our sales and earnings guidance assumes a competitive and promotional macro holiday environment. And we expect continued headwinds from uncertainties surrounding trade and tariffs.","Before I go into the specific brand details, I would like to provide a few key things from the quarter. First, beginning with our performance by region. Our European businesses continue to post strong results, despite the macro situation and uncertainty around Brexit. Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein are outperforming their competition, demonstrating strong performance across the vast majority of markets in Europe. Both brands are resonating with consumers and our fall holiday product is experiencing strong sell-throughs. We believe this favorable trend should continue as we move through the fourth quarter.","Moving on to the ex-U.S business. As many of our peers and key customers have indicated the U.S market was challenging during the third quarter. During the third quarter, we saw traffic under pressure with no change to the soft international tourism trends. And we\u2019ve also seen a highly promotional environment which pressured margins.","We believe that the increasing focus on inventory turns and the cautious stance by our key retail partners on spring 2020 open to buy levels will continue in this U.S market. Finally, in Asia, we continue to see volatility in the Greater China region, driven by ongoing protest in Hong Kong, the continued U.S China trade tensions and a stronger U.S dollar. Our teams continue to be nimble and react to emerging business trends, especially in Hong Kong, as the business disruption has gotten worse over the last few months.","As we turn to November, I\u2019m pleased to report that we did have a strong 11\/11 Singles' Day in China, and we\u2019re seeing improved sales trend across Mainland China. We\u2019ve great confidence in the underlying power of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and believe we are positioning our businesses to succeed in its ever changing consumer landscape.","Looking at the business today and where we believe the company's opportunities continue to build, PVH is well positioned to capitalize upon our targeted purposeful investments. We are dedicated to ensuring our brands to remain authentic to their core DNA with a clear purpose to connect with consumers, as consumers are increasingly focused on purchasing brand that connect with their core values.","We continue to progress on our consumer data journey to learn and connect more with our consumers and leveraging these insights to power our marketing and product decisions. We believe this will allow us to better deliver unique consumer shopping experiences with the goal of improving our sales and margins and providing a more seamless consumer experience.","Additionally, our investments in digital from our e-commerce sites to mobile platforms and incorporating digital elements into our stores remain a priority. Today digital sales continue to track at over 10% of our total revenues, and we continue to see robust online growth with sales growth exceeding 20% in our owned and operated businesses going forward.","Looking ahead, we remain committed to seeking and achieving efficiencies across the business, from our supply chain, including our design and go-to-market processes to warehousing and distribution to optimizing our global retail footprint and our operating models around the world. In summary, we are focused on executing against our strategic priorities, which over the long-term will drive stronger brand loyalty, capture the hearts of consumer and deliver sustainable sales and profitability.","Let me now move onto the brand results and I will begin with Tommy Hilfiger. We continue to be extremely pleased with how strong our Tommy business brand is performing. In particular, the brand is experiencing outstanding traction globally as we deepen our connections with our core Tommy consumer, while, at the same time converting the next generation of consumers.","The offering of both our Tommy Hilfiger and our Tommy Jeans lifestyles will allow us to capture and target the full spectrum of consumers out there and make them part of the brand. We see strong growth across our sportswear categories as well as through our global growth categories such as jeans, footwear and accessories.","During the quarter, we continued to embrace our global and local ambassadors with exciting consumer activations to drive brand heat. Our collaborative collection with Louis Hamilton for Fall 2019 has proven to be the most successful commercial collaboration to date. They are doing it at a one night experiential event in Milan, which has generated strong sell-throughs and earn media value versus spring 2019.","The successful launch of the Fall 2019 Tommy Hilfiger collection in China with b brand ambassador Shawn Yue has -- which was amplified on China Tmall single day sales has outperformed all our sales plans. As we look into holiday and spring 2020, we are excited about the activations ahead of us, which will leverage local ambassadors and influences in key marketers -- markets to further create more unique engagements and differentiated Tommy experiences for consumers.","Moving to the business, Tommy's revenues increased 10% in the quarter and 12% on a constant currency basis. With earnings flattish or up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by -- primarily by outperformance in Europe. Internationally, revenues rose 20% on a constant currency basis with retail comp sales rising 8%.","International revenue growth was primarily driven by outperformance experienced in Europe as well as the addition of revenues resulting from the acquisitions of our Australia and Central and Southern Asia Tommy businesses. We continue to be extremely pleased with Tommy Europe's business, which was the driver of double-digit international revenue growth.","Significant growth continues across all channels of distribution and key markets, highlighting the market share gains we have been able to deliver. For 2019 Sell-throughs continue to be very healthy and we have seen retailers continue to pull orders forward, which we believe bodes well for our for 2020 order books where early indications are quite positive. As a reminder, spring\/summer 2020 order books are up 12% versus the prior year.","In Asia, our Tommy Japan and Australia businesses continued to experience strong performance amid a favorable consumer backdrop, while pressure in the Greater China region persist as a result of the protests in Hong Kong and the U.S. China trade tension.","Moving on to North America, revenues were flat and margins were also under pressure, down 590 basis points. While our wholesale trends continue to be strong despite the tough North America department store landscape, we experienced continued softness in our retail stores as comparable store sales declined 5%.","As many retailers have commented over the last few weeks, there were weak traffic trends across retail during the quarter, which was largely driven by lower levels of international tourists coming to the U.S. These factors in fact led to higher promotional activities than we planned, which pressured margins. We are planning for these pressures to continue throughout the fourth quarter.","Let me end with licensing. This continues to be a very positive story for us across the majority of our businesses demonstrating that Tommy Hilfiger brand is extremely healthy. In particular, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our North America women's sportswear business under G-III. This is experiencing strong growth and excellent sell-throughs.","Moving to Calvin Klein. During the quarter, I'm pleased to report that we saw an uptick in the Calvin Klein brand engagement and awareness as we remains in the top 10 to earn media value against its competitive set, demonstrating the health of the brand. As important as consumer engagement is on the health of the brand, I'm pleased to see that we are experiencing healthy sell-throughs for our fall in our core go-forward denim, our core men's underwear and women's intimate franchises as well as in accessories.","In October, Calvin Klein celebrated 50 years of self-expression with the CK50 Collection, a special capsule of iconic styles featuring Justin Bieber back in his Calvin's, this time along his -- alongside his wife Hailey Bieber, which marked the couple's first marketing campaign together. The collection was celebrated globally with events in Brazil, Mexico and Peru and activations across Asia and Europe. And we saw strong success with the product capsule and campaign resonated with our consumer base, delivering stronger engagement and earned media value results.","Overall, our teams are delivering targeted consumer experience not only delivered better engagement, but also to drive sales conversion. One recent example was our event in Berlin, which focused on amplifying the brand engagement in our largest European market and support product stores for fall, with campaign star Hailey Beiber, which generated celebrity influencer and product content across Europe.","Additionally, we are very excited about the opening of our new multi-brand lifestyle store in Paris, which will have a soft opening in December. Finally, as we look to catering more unique products and consumer experiences in our Asia region, we continue to work with Lay Zhang as our brand ambassador and are launching our capsule collection celebrating Chinese New Year in the fourth quarter, which will offer products from Calvin Klein Underwear, Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Performance.","From a business perspective, Calvin Klein increased revenues 3% on a constant-currency basis in the quarter and reported earnings increased 7% to $129 million, driven by strong margins in North America, partially offset by continuing weakness in the Greater China business.","By region, Calvin Klein International revenues increased 7% and international store comps declined 3%. Calvin Klein Europe saw an improved momentum in the business during the third quarter as strong year-over-year growth was demonstrated across all channels and across the majority of product offerings, specifically as new fall products hit stores -- hit the stores, we experienced better sell-throughs in our key categories including in jeans, accessories and underwear.","As a reminder, our spring 2020 order books are up 12% and we're getting early indications for fall 2020, which are quite positive, demonstrating the health of the brand in the market. Still as those Calvin Klein lifestyle is increasingly resonating with the European consumer, it reinforces our confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for the brand throughout Europe.","Moving on to Asia, we continue to experience weakness in traffic trends in our brick-and-mortar stores in the Greater China region, as the business disruptions caused by the ongoing protests in Hong Kong and the U.S China trade tensions continued to impact business. These declines were partially offset by favorable results across our digital businesses and the other major markets throughout Asia. As a reminder, Calvin Klein has a significantly larger business presence in Hong Kong than most of our competitors.","Moving to North America, revenues declined 5% as planned largely driven by our decision to license the women's jeans business to G-III. Despite the challenging North American environment, our Calvin Klein North America business posted a healthy increase in earnings driven by significantly higher gross margins than last year.","At wholesale, we continue to see positive results from the digital businesses. In our retail business, comps were down 4% as we continue to experience the weakness in traffic and consumer spending trends, especially in our international tourist locations. We saw a significant margin improvement compared to last year driven by lower clearance markdowns. We continue to be in focus on enhancing our store productivity as well as our merchandising efforts, which we believe will pay dividends as we move forward.","Finally, our heritage businesses had a difficult quarter. Revenues for the quarter were down 13% with comparable store sales down 2%. EBIT margins remained under pressure, down a 180 basis points as the wholesale and retail businesses experienced gross margin pressure attributable to the weakness in the overall North America retail landscape.","Our mass and pure-play businesses continued to outperform our department store and mid-tier accounts in line with industry trends. As we look to 2020, we continue to seek ways to optimize and streamline the Heritage Brands business to generate enhanced returns. In our wholesale business, we are looking at which brands serves the business best and are reevaluating the licensed brands in our dress furnishings and sportswear businesses. In retail, we continue to be keenly focused how we can further rationalize our store portfolio as we move into 2020.","Finally, as you look to the fourth quarter and as we are reporting before the Thanksgiving holiday, I can only comment on trends for the first two weeks of November, which have started off somewhat ahead of plan, but given the calendar shift business is difficult to read. Although I am cautiously optimistic about the holiday season, we\u2019ve taken a conservative approach to projecting our fourth quarter results. And I believe we are well-positioned for the fourth quarter to outperform our sales and earnings guidance, despite the overall uncertainty of the retail landscape.","Now I will turn it over to Mike to provide more color around our third quarter and our fourth quarter outlook.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on Non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $3.10. It was $0.10 better than the top end of our previous guidance. The beat was driven by strong Tommy Hilfiger performance in Europe and Asia-Pacific.","The actual beat from the business was about $0.20 with interest also better than guided by $0.02, partially offset by tax expense, which was higher than guided for $0.12 as a result of timing.","Part of the business beat was due to the acceleration of $20 million of Tommy Hilfiger international shipments and a shift in the timing of marketing expenses, which both benefited Tommy Hilfiger in the third quarter. These shifts will negatively impact the fourth quarter earnings projections by about $10 million.","Moving on to guidance. We are still planning revenue and earnings conservatively for the fourth quarter. Pressure continues in the channels we operate in North America as we look at the balance of the year. We continue to see heavier industry-wide inventories in the channel than last year along with the decrease in traffic.","Our international consumers who shop in our tourist outlet stores are not in the USA at the same levels as last year. In Asia, our businesses continued to be impacted by Hong Kong protest, along with overall weaker traffic trends across China. In our European businesses, we see Tommy Hilfiger outperforming plans and Calvin Klein slightly better to plan.","With significant amounts of business to be done in the upcoming holiday period and with our earnings release earlier than prior years, we've not reflected our current trends and instead have reflected trends more in line with third quarter into the fourth quarter. Our current trends are somewhat better than our plans.","We\u2019ve also not planned to change the level of promotions in our business. We have anticipated a highly promotional macro retail environment as elevated industry-wide inventory levels in all channels will result in higher markdowns and in turn lower gross margins.","For the full-year 2019, we're projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be $9.43 to $9.45, which is a much tighter range than our previous guidance with an improvement of $0.13 on the low end of the range and $0.05 on the high-end of the range. Our total FX headwind on the year continues to be estimated at $0.35 of translation. No change to our previous guidance. Our guidance continues to include a negative $0.20 impact from tariffs.","Overall, for the year, we're projecting revenues conservatively and to grow approximately 1% as-reported and approximately 4% on a constant-currency basis. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 6% as-reported and 9% on a constant currency basis.","We project Calvin Klein revenues to be down 2% as reported and flat to last year on a constant currency basis. Our Heritage business is planned to be down 3% to last year. Overall, our operating margins are planned down 60 basis points for the year. Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned down about a 120 basis points versus the prior year.","Fourth quarter Tommy Hilfiger operating margins will be down almost 400 basis points. The majority of this operating margin decline is in North America. But it's also negatively impacted by the timing in Tommy International I mentioned earlier.","Calvin Klein operating margins are planned up 50 basis points for the year and our Heritage business operating margins are planned down a 150 basis points for the year. Although we are holding our overall operating margins to our previous guidance, we aggressively cleared inventory in the third quarter, resulting in gross margins lower than we had planned.","We plan to continue to aggressively clear inventory through the fourth quarter and end the year with inventories flat versus the prior year. Lastly, we continue to plan share repurchases for 300 million on the year and our long-term debt repayments are planned with $50 million.","And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.","Bob Drbul","Hey, good morning. Manny and Mike, when you guys talk about the promotional levels in the third quarter and your expectations around promotions in the fourth quarter, can you just talk through a little bit the assumptions around markdown support, the assumptions around just the absolute risk that you have in the environment versus just how conservative you are planning the fourth quarter, especially around gross margins?","Manny Chirico","Sure. Look I think we -- I mean you've seen the results especially some of our key accounts department store sector, the off mall sector. The third quarter has been somewhat disappointing when we look at the comp trends and margins and we're expecting that that -- from a projection point of view, we are projecting that trend to continue. I really believe there's very little risk in our guidance and projections for the third quarter. I think we built in conservative estimates when it comes to margin support and what would be necessary as well as our own growth margin markdown activity.","If you see some health in the environment, I think we're in very good position to capture that as we go forward. So I think we will react to how the consumer and how the holiday trends have come in, it's given the calendar shift with shorter time between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which gives the hard season to project at this point. We really have our arms on it. But given our systems, we\u2019re able to see things on a deal basis and react very quickly. So we will stay on top of this, but I feel I feel good about our guidance and projections for the fourth quarter and feel that really, really good shape to outperform against that guidance.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And, Manny, I was just wondering if you could spend a little bit more time on China and Hong Kong. And I guess my questions are, are you seeing the impact from the China U.S. trade relations impacting sort of the brands of Tommy Hilfiger or Calvin Klein when you think about the results there? And can you just talk generally around the total exposure that you have at this point on Hong Kong? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Sure. Let me take the last part first. Hong Kong is just -- its about -- just a little bit over 1% of our business, $100 million volume for that market. And when we look at that specifically, it's a big -- it's -- relatively speaking, as our competitive set. It's a big business for us and highly profitable. So that's putting pressure on the region. I think we've done very -- during the third quarter, we did some brand work in China around the issue you just talked about. And we did not see from talking to consumers, panels and talking to consumers leaving off stores, probably over a thousand consumers, we didn't see any deterioration in the strength of our brand or the receptivity to buy both the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brand. So we haven't seen -- I know some people are concerned about this potential negative reactions with American brands. We haven't seen that in any significant way in China. What we\u2019ve seen is -- and putting it into context, we have -- Calvin in particular was a first mover into the China market. We have a large and probably larger than most of our competitors positioned in China with the business and we see the pressure in the brick-and-mortar stores through the third quarter. And I think that's really just an -- we're positioned as a premium brand not a luxury brand, but a premium brand, I think that particular segment of the market is feeling the pressure is that the consumer is feeling in purchasing and we're seeing negative comp store trends in our brick-and-mortar. And despite really strong growth on the digital platform given the size of our brick-and-mortar business, it's not enough to offset that negative trend. Some of our other competitors have relatively small store base and are growing similar to us online, but they don't have the pressure that we have in our stores. I think as we turned into the fourth quarter, we've seen a bit of its sales improvement, I mentioned in my comments. It's three weeks old. We will see if that continues, but that gives us some way as we move into the important fourth quarter in China. So we will see how that all progresses as we move forward.","Bob Drbul","Thanks, Manny. Happy Thanksgiving.","Manny Chirico","Happy Thanksgiving, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Manny, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your view on the current logo cycle, particularly as it relates to the Tommy Hilfiger brand. It seems like some of your peers you're starting to see pockets of slowdown in that trend. So just curious how you feel the Tommy brand is positioned as we go into 2020 and just your views on the overall kind of where we sit with a logo cycle?","Manny Chirico","Look, I think it's a good call out. The logo cycle, I think -- there's still a key portion of the business that's done there. I think as we move into spring, in the United States region, you will really see a shift as to back to more of our core sportswear categories key items core driven products and you will see more -- you'll see less logo products. Still appropriately, the brand has -- always has an important component in logo, but we're not counting on that as we go forward. Both in the performance area, or in denim area, logo continues to be key part of that business and we're seeing strong trends in the Tommy jeans business overall.","Internationally, I think we moved even quicker to move away from the logo trends, particularly in Europe and Asia. I think we're benefiting with that shift. We are seeing strong growth, particularly in our jeans business throughout Europe and Asia. And I think that trend should continue as well. But it's clear both for Calvin and Tommy, logo is continues to be an important part of the product offering, but it just reduce the exposure to it as we move forward.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just my second question is on the -- excuse me, Calvin Klein margins in North America. They\u2019re up nicely as you lapped last year, but just curious if you can unpack a little bit more on the drivers there and just the sustainability of recapturing that market here in North America for the Calvin brand? Thank you.","Manny Chirico","Look, I think -- look, you started to see -- you're seeing it in the third quarter. I think that you'll see gross margin improvement continue into the fourth quarter. I think when you look at operating margins, depending on the shift in marketing and whatever, I think you really need to look at the six months season. So I think if you look at third and fourth quarter, gross margins will be up in both quarter and operating margins for that period of time should be up as well as we've really been focusing on that product execution moving forward. And I think as we go into 2020, that's a key part of the story as we are really focusing on our product offerings and the enhancements that we see coming forward. So I think that's going to be a key issue for us. We're starting to see it now. We're starting to see improved operating income performance and gross margin performance and that trend should continue into the third -- sorry, into the fourth quarter.","Erinn Murphy","Got it. Thank you and happy holidays to you all.","Manny Chirico","Thank you. Same to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking all my questions here. Manny, I know you don't want to get over your skis here, but as we look out past 2019, I know there's some fairly real intangible puts and takes in the business next year that we can see coming with pretty good visibility this year. I remember on this call a year-ago you and I talked about there being some translational FX coming in 2019. But you said there was no transactional FX, it's all been translational. So far, as you've reported, in the past, transactional has tacked on an impact in the following year. Is it fair to assume we should already expect that to show up next year a little bit? And then who knows on tariffs obviously, but all else equal the $0.20 headwind this year was largely in the second half if there's no change. We probably get the other half of that in the first half of next year. Are there any other broad brush strokes puts or takes we should think about as we think higher level about the low double-digit longer term earnings algorithm for the business as we try to look at 2019?","Manny Chirico","Look, I will -- I think you've hit the two key headwinds. I think you hit the two headwinds that we are looking at for next year. Foreign currency transaction will be a headwind depending where the dollar won. Well, sometimes they\u2019ve been [indiscernible] since we\u2019ve hedged out 9 to 12 months. And as we look at it so no past this prologue, that you'll see that piece come in. On the tariffs, it's really hard to understand what\u2019s going on because we're not sure exactly what's going to be in place given the protests [ph] that are going on in Hong Kong. But you said it correctly, and it was worth about $0.20 this year. A bigger tranche comes into next year. Our exposure overall goes the other way as we reduced our exposure to China. But I think you said it well and that you could expect that what it was this year, you should see a similar impact next year on top of that. So that's how we're looking at it. Those two key components are what we are trying to manage that. I don't think it really -- I think we think about our long-term earnings algorithms. I don't think it changes anything on a constant currency. I think we're comfortable that we can grow our sales in the 3% to 5% kind of range and we can grow our bottom line double digits moving forward. So that algorithm continues. And we\u2019ve to deal with the vagaries of currency favorable or unfavorable, but the business model I think the underlying strength of the brand continues to be in place and we are confident in it.","Michael Binetti","Got you. And let me ask you I guess a longer-term question, Manny, I\u2019ve to ask. As you think about you reflect back on this year and last year, I guess you think about the next several years in the business, how do you feel about your U.S. distribution footprint today?","Manny Chirico","I think -- look, I think our brand -- look, when you think about Calvin and Tommy brands, we\u2019ve significant strength with those brands and we will -- we have consistently found the right channels of distribution to sell off on the [indiscernible]. Department stores will continue to be a critical portion of our growth. For those two brands, Macy's will continue to be a key customer for us. Nordstrom will continue to be a key customer for us as we move forward. And we also have a direct-to-consumer business here in North America. And I think we can manage that business as we go forward as those customers go through it as well. You know, no surprise when you talk about it, there's too much retail real estate. In the United States, I think we're going to continue to see that shift down. For us, we've always managed the U.S market as a slow growth market and we'll continue to manage it that way. The online -- our online presence in North America continues to grow both that we operate directly and through a number of our pure-play retailers as well as our key department store retailers here. So I'm confident that that will continue to grow. But the real growth for us with those -- our two brands should continue to be internationally in those markets and that's how we're looking at it as we go forward.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thanks a lot for all the detail, Manny.","Manny Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS.","Jay Sole","Great. Thanks so much. Maybe I just follow-up on the tariff question. It seems like for this third quarter and fourth quarter prices were sort of locked in and that sort of put the burden of absorbing the tariff costs more on brands and maybe other parties. Just looking back over the last three months as negotiations have gone on, do you see more of a sharing of the cost burden, or an ability to pass it on, or can you just give us any color about how that dynamic is changing about who absorbs the tariff as we look into fiscal '20?","Manny Chirico","You know it is -- it continues to be a volatile environment. They are because the uncertainty just continues and the talks go on and you hear one source telling you, there is a Phase 1 agreement commenting that there will be no new tariffs. And so it's very hard to plan. We are partnering with all of our key factories. And our key factories are working with us as we go into spring. It really is going to determine what happens post spring as we move forward. If these long-lasting tariffs, are these short-term in nature. If they continue to be short-term in nature, I think our factories are going to partner with us to work through it as we go forward. At the same time, we're reducing our exposure. We should be around 10% to 12% exposed. U.S sourcing out of China will be about 10% of our overall sourcing mix and I think that compares to three or four years ago we were close to 35% to 40%. So I think we're moving strategically as we plan. That should be somewhat of an offset. We will look at targeted price increases as we go forward. So we have to be also cognizant of the consumer and not going too hard too fast. They're working with our retail partners. So that's an ongoing discussion. And I think they're all leveraged to pull. And we will pull those revenues as we go forward. So that -- it's a challenge and the uncertainty it's making it more of a challenge.","Jay Sole","Got it. And then I apologize in advance for asking a short-term question, but just on the calendar this year for the six fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. I'm sure as many retailers look at their comps over the last week, it looks significantly down year-over-year. And is the assumption that look over the next week you know everything gets make backup and everybody is back to square would expect to be and then sort of just the rest of the season is the rest of the season, or at what point because you said at the top of the call that it's sort of hard to kind of figure out where the businesses is at given the shifts? At what point do you say just the average retail out there decided, okay things are trending as planned at what point is maybe the retail environment get concerned that there's calendar shifts having a negative impact as we get through Cyber Monday and things aren't good, then there's only a handful of weeks left before Christmas and then maybe people start to incrementally promote maybe more than they expected. How does it play out in terms of how retailers are going to think about their decision-making process, because of the shorter calendar.","Manny Chirico","Okay. That's a -- it's a bit of a load of questions, but let me start with by saying our assumption in our guidance is going to be promotional. And Christmas is going to come late. It's been coming later every -- throughout the last five-years, they've been coming later. And this compressed calendar I think is only going to put more pressure on it. That's why we're trying to be as conservative as we are about fourth quarter margins and fourth quarter sales trends. I think we're going to get a really good picture at the end of this, as we get through Cyber Monday into the early part of next week. And is there -- there will be a catch up there obviously, but how big a catch up. And then how much of -- even if you're somewhat behind, which I would expect to be because you have your six less shopping days at that point, there's an assumption that the next two or three weeks is going to be positive comps during that period of time year-over-year because of the compression of the calendar. And that's what everybody will be watching. I have to be honest, our assumption is it's going to be more promotional. We feel that way because, let's be honest, the third quarter was not a strong quarter. The seasonal weather patterns weren\u2019t great for early sell in the spring. We are also bouncing business early November, so some really good sell in early November. As the weather turns cold, this is a good sign. So now we're looking to see where it all plays itself out and it's -- nobody loves that this calendar is setting up the way it is. This is what we are trying to deal with and we're trying to be as prudent as we can about projecting out the fourth quarter.","Jay Sole","Got it. Super helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I guess, Manny, just a question I want to focus on Tommy Hilfiger profitability. So we saw the margins in Q3 and when you gave the guidance for Q4, I guess my question is what exactly is driving the margin degradation? Is it the promotions and the deleverage in the North America retail fleet? And then the follow-up to that is, assuming that there's no improvement in tourism and the dynamics that are basically causing that, should we assume that that continues into the first half of next year because you really didn't start to see that pressure build until this quarter. So I guess that's my way of kind of asking on the margin performance into next fiscal year, while I know you're not giving guidance, is it safe to assume there's probably more upside or more earnings growth in the back half of next year relative to the first half? Just kind of curious how you would answer all that stuff.","Manny Chirico","Okay. Look, we're not giving guidance for next year, but let me put some color on what you said, because I think some of what you said is not -- I will -- let me just say, we have to put things into context. Tommy Hilfiger, 2018 is coming off -- North America comps were up between 6% and 7% for the year. Strong trends coming in. And given that trend of the business, we bought into a portion of that sales growth. We started to see in the first quarter of last year, starting in February, we started to see a real pull back in international tourism trends into the U.S and we started to see negative comps. That intensify the second and third quarter. So we start to lap these negative comp store trend beginning in the first quarter, but really going into the second quarter of 2019, 1SO that comparison. Also, since we bought into those sales trends six months out, we had clearance inventory that needs to be moved and we moved aggressively to get to move through that inventory. And that's the pressure you saw the sell-off at spring\/summer bids in the second -- and the second quarter and into third quarter this year. We're assuming it's going to continue to be promotional, so margins will be under pressure in the fourth quarter. That should ease a bit into the first quarter. And then you should really start to cycle that as we go into the second quarter of 2020. So I think that's the way you have to look at it. And keep in mind, Tommy Hilfiger North America business is coming off of three years of significant comp store growth into this 2019 year. 2018 was a record year for the brand in the United States. So it's lapping that has been challenging for us as we've gone forward. I think it starts to level out as we get into 2020.","Ike Boruchow","Thanks, Manny. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. I mean, we've had some consolidation in the luxury space announced this week. Maybe your state of the union on the industry is challenged. Would you expect more M&A in the space? And then kind of how are you thinking about that as it pertains to your company?","Manny Chirico","Sure. I think, look, over the next 12 to 24 months, I think the retail sector and the retail apparel sector is going to have consolidation. It's -- I think it's -- given the dynamics of the industry, it's -- to me it's almost a given. The challenge, I think from a pure M&A point of view, at this point financial -- financing markets are very strong. Credit is available. We have a very strong balance sheet, which can give us the ability to do a transaction. We'll be looking -- we will really be looking forward to doing that. One of the challenges you always face as the sector has gone through a multiple compression is people are looking at the stock price or evaluation and they're comparing to where it was 12 to 15 months ago. And that leads to sell in a bit, in people's minds to get a sense of what current valuations actually are as we move forward and deal with all this uncertainty. But my general feeling is there will be consolidation and then they will be a key part of PVH as well and we'll continue to look for opportunities.","Ike Boruchow","Great. Thanks happy holidays to everyone.","Manny Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone. Manny, just following up on the M&A acquisition, you've done small acquisitions and large acquisitions. You\u2019ve done acquisitions with online and data and then you've also done brand acquisitions. What do you think is most appealing to you that helps to move the needle in enhancing the platform of the entire business going forward? Thank you.","Manny Chirico","Sure. Look, Dana, the acquisition -- principally the acquisitions we've done has been recapturing our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger business, international businesses around the world. Australia, the South Asia, Southeast Asia, looking at Brazil, a number of the transactions that the China transaction a few years ago. That's been the focus in the last three to five years. I think that that consolidation is a few things still to do, but relatively speaking nothing that dramatically moves the needle. I think we're really thinking about it along the branded side. And we will think about continue -- looking to add another brand to the portfolio or collection of brands depending on the acquisitions. I think scale is becoming more and more important. I think the investments that you need to make in order to be competitive, the digital journey that we're all on, the shifting channels of distribution moving online, more so the investments, in order to compete there that you need to know, I think scale becomes even more important as you go forward. I think we have a demonstrated track record of knowing how to do acquisition, how to integrate them to get the benefits out of it, how to manage that from a portfolio company, which I think people underestimate the awareness to keep what's critical to operate the brands and keep those separate from the design product, aesthetic point of view and being able to leverage the back office, all of the systems, the capabilities and the strategies in order to take advantage of that and make the investments for each of the brands. I think we understand how that's done and that\u2019s -- we are aggressively looking to move in that direction.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.","Heather Balsky","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Can you dig a little bit more into the Calvin business and your first -- just your thoughts on your expectations for operating margin? A couple of quarters ago, you\u2019ve been talking about 200 basis points improvement, but the environment has clearly changed. Also, it sounds like the new denim products is resonating. Can you just talk about the trends you\u2019re seeing especially in U.S. channel. And is there more opportunity into next year on the product side. Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Okay. So I think on the Calvin business for the year, we're looking at some -- we are looking at operating margins up about 50 basis points. I think we were looking for slightly higher than that at the beginning of the year, but some of the pressures that's going on particularly in Asia, in the Hong Kong and China businesses, has played an impact on that. I think over the next three years, there's the opportunity to expand margins to another 200 basis points. I think if we're -- again, we're not giving guidance, but I think if we were looking at next year, we'd be looking for something between 40 and 70 basis points improvement in operating margins going forward. And hopefully, we can outperform that, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about the business. I think the second part of your question was on denim, because you broke up a little bit. So I apologize. I think we are seeing really -- we are seeing good results, specifically in core denim products. On the -- on jeans and bottoms, here in the United States, that's been the driver is the bottom side of our men's business. G-III just launched the women's products here in North America. The receptivity of that product has been outstanding. We are seeing really strong sell-throughs there and they\u2019re starting -- and they've gotten strong placements. And I think you -- if you've just got to Herald Square, you see outstanding presentation they have there with the Calvin Klein Jeans product. Internationally, I think we are probably six months ahead of where we are in North America. The international product I think has really taken an upgrade to see very strong sell-throughs of all tops and bottoms throughout Europe and in all regions with the exception of China, given the dynamics that are going on there. We've seen this sell-throughs of products. So I think we're seeing good receptivity of products from the consumer and the retailers. The order books in Europe, which is our best indications are continued to be very strong for the Calvin Klein jeans product in the spring and the initial offering of product [indiscernible]. So I think we are on the right track with that product back to the brand DNA. And I think the receptivity of our products that we've seen particularly internationally gives us confidence in the turnaround on that business.","Heather Balsky","Great. Thank you very much [indiscernible] my questions. So thank you.","Manny Chirico","Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein.","Jamie Merriman","Thanks very much. Just picking up on the M&A topic, do you have a view on -- with the brands that you acquire, whether you have a preference for wholesale exposure given what you know with Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. Are you -- would you be more interested in brands that have more of a direct-to-consumer go-to-market strategy? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Look, I think it's two things. I think if you look at our balance of wholesale to retail, we're probably on a dollar basis we're 55-45 when you think about where we break out. And as you move internationally, we're even more direct-to-consumer, particularly throughout Asia, for the most part is probably 80% retail direct-to-consumer. And our Europe business is probably in that 55%, 45% range. I also think when you think about wholesale versus retail, strength of the market is different when you are in Europe and when you are -- versus the United States or when you\u2019re in South America and Asia. So our wholesale businesses continue to be our most profitable businesses overall. Our retail business is highly profitable as well, but our wholesale businesses are even more profitable [ph] as we go forward. And the department store channel internationally continues to be very healthy for us. I think we are comfortable running both a direct-to-consumer model, which we do with both Calvin and Tommy, and we're comfortable understanding how to manage that wholesale channel distribution and even more importantly how to manage both at the same time. And we have always been multi-channel retailers. We understand that you have to speak to the consumer where they want to buy the product and I think we understand how to really go after both of those market. So it would depend on the brand and where the brand is currently positioned.","Jamie Merriman","Thank you.","Manny Chirico","Operator, this will be our last question. It's kind of long. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our last question from John Kernan with Cowen.","John Kernan","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Manny, can you talk about the theme of speed and the ability to flow inventory faster, control markdowns better throughout the entire retail ecosystem. It feels like there's a long-term opportunity here. I know you're using data. You've made a lot of investments in digital. CapEx has stepped up quite a bit in the last several years. I was just wondering when you think PVH and the industry in general is going to reach a point where the working capital and the lead times get improved across the entire ecosystem?","Manny Chirico","Okay. So I don't want to speak for the whole industry because I find the apparel industry to be an undisciplined industry. There always seems to be excess product. There always seems to be -- it's advertised to create more. And then, yes, it's crazy [ph]. So the industry I think is an undisciplined industry in many respects. I think we've made tremendous investments and continuing to make investments in 3D design, in shortening our core replenishment businesses with reduce lead times overall. And I think you'll see that continuing. I think over the next two years, in particular, you will see more and more of that in the business environment. I think the challenge that's going on, we have to at least be intellectually [ph] honest, is as of the fourth quarter of 2018, just to put things in perspective, the industry was coming off of a very strong fourth quarter. Everyone bought into that and business [indiscernible] department store business in North America, in particular, and our business in China and mostly in Chinese real estate feel the pressure of that business. The lead times people [indiscernible] the positive comp store sales trends. Most of the sales trends in North America, in particular, were low single-digit negative minus 2, 3. That got worse in the third quarter. I think when we're trying to really get ahead of that trend, cycles -- lead times have improved from nine months to six months, but they are not six days. So those cycles are -- and buying [indiscernible] is really what's causing the challenges. The drop of overall retail from private label programs in department stores in oversaturation of certain brands is putting pressure on business. The fact that we had the towers that everybody is dealing with and people were accelerating shipments into the United States in order to avoid the deadline on tariffs coming into effect force people to take the 30 to 45 days earlier than planned and then the tariff phase pushed out and that we\u2019ve done again in September. Those pressures are real. And it's -- look, that\u2019s a deal with what's coming out of [indiscernible], but that's partially the reason why you're seeing some of these heightened inventory. I think when you -- I know the way retailers are buying spring 2020, we are seeing the real tightness of open-to-buy dollars much more conservative -- conservatism being built into sales plan. I think next year is going to be much more of a margin year as opposed to a top line growth year here in North America. And that's how -- I think you have to plan the business and think about it. But clearly the investments are being made across the board to really move the lead times down, reduce your markdown exposure as you go forward. And I think it's a good call out on your part, but the industry overall is not being a leader when it come to leadership in managing inventories and working capital. So [indiscernible] really needs to move forward on that.","So thank you. So with that, we want to wish everybody a happy and healthy Thanksgiving to you and your family. We also wish you a happy holiday season going forward. And we look forward to speaking to you on our fourth quarter earnings call in March. Have a great holiday season and all the best. Have a good day. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"18387":["PVH Corp.

Please go ahead.","Manny Chirico","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone and thank you, for joining me on the call. Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations are also on the call. ","I\u2019m pleased with our earnings performance in the third quarter, which exceeded our expectations, driven by the power of our diversified global business model. We continued to over deliver against our 2018 earnings plan and are raising our full year earnings outlook based on our third quarter outperformance and our confidence in the opportunities for the fourth quarter, despite the recent bankruptcies in the U.S. and the UK, and increasing geopolitical volatility around the world.","In the quarter, consolidated revenues grew 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis, while our earnings per share of $3.21 for the quarter was $0.08 above the top end of our guidance, despite a $0.06 unplanned charge relating to Sears and the House of Fraser bankruptcy. This earnings beat was driven by the outperformance of our Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage brands businesses, partially offset by the underperformance of our Calvin Klein businesses, and I\u2019ll get into the discussion about our three brands momentarily, but I think first let me touch on our regional performance.","Our international businesses continue to experience momentum, driven by strong growth in Europe, where our performance has been outstanding. Our brands are very desirable, and we are gaining share with both new and existing consumers. In Asia, our business performed well as a whole. I do want to note that while our Chinese business performed well and was ahead of plan, we have experienced some softer trends in traffic relating to a softening economy and the related trade concerns between China and the U.S. Despite this backdrop, we continue to see strong results out of China. I\u2019m pleased to report that we continue to see healthy trends in our North American business, particularly in our wholesale businesses.","In our retail business, we are experiencing growth with our domestic consumers, particularly at Tommy Hilfiger, yet we continue to experience a slowdown in international tourist traffic in the U.S. relative to the strength we experienced in the first six months of the year.","From a digital sales point of view, we continue to see growth at an outpaced rate with revenues growing over 20% across our third party and our owned and operated businesses. Again, our digital sales for the company represent about 10% of total revenues. We are off to a strong start in the fourth quarter and including an excellent Black Friday weekend. As we look to the full year, we are raising our earnings guidance by $0.10 per share at the high end of our range. It is important to note that we are projecting underlying business to be more than $0.10 per share, covering an incremental FX headwind related to the strengthening U.S. dollar and the unplanned write offs related to our Sears and House of Fraser businesses.","Our new earnings per share guidance range implies a year-over-year EPS growth of 18%, and we continue to prudently forecast our holiday season, especially given the strong start to the fourth quarter business. Mike will further quantify some of those results.","Now moving to our brands results, let me begin with Tommy Hilfiger. Tommy Hilfiger had a truly outstanding quarter, continuing the outperformance we\u2019ve had delivered throughout the year. The brand continues to experience global momentum with strength across all product lines and channels of distribution. This has been fueled by strong product offerings and consistent brand execution around the world. We believe that our consumer-centric brand approach is helping us gain meaningful market share, particularly on the younger end of the age spectrum. For example, Tommy\u2019s capsule collection, with streetwear label Kith sold out online in 37 minutes. Notably, our recent brand studies have confirmed the average age of a consumer has come down several years as we continue to connect with more millennials and GenZ.","We also are delivering compelling marketing campaigns both from a regional level and a local influencer perspective, which demonstrates to consumers all of the outstanding products that Tommy Hilfiger has to offer and doing it in a way that highlights diversity of our markets and the needs of our consumers. Our current marketing campaigns personify this from Lewis Hamilton to Hailey Baldwin, Winnie Harlow, and Maggie Jiang, as well as diverse global influencers that are featured in our Tommy Jeans campaign.","We also are excited that Zendaya will serve as one of our global women\u2019s wear ambassadors beginning in 2019. We believe that this will help drive the momentum of our women\u2019s business, further expand our women's consumer base and capture both Zendaya\u2019s and our commitment to self-expression and individuality.","Looking at the business, revenue for Tommy grew 11% and earnings rose 16%, primarily driven by strong revenue growth and expense leverage. International revenues increased 16% in the third quarter and comps were up 13%, again exceeding our expectations as Europe and Asia both posted outstanding performance. Beginning with Europe, performance continues to be robust, despite its challenging consumer backdrop in Europe. We continue to be impressed by the strength experienced across all channels; retail, wholesale, and digital. Notably, the recent turn in weather to more seasonal temperatures has been beneficial for our sales of cold weather categories, particularly sweaters and outer wear. As a reminder, our spring and summer 2019 order book is up over 10%, and this positions us very well for the upcoming 2019 fiscal year.","The momentum in our Tommy Asia business also continues, both our China and our Japan businesses continue to deliver strong growth across all channels with exceptional performance in e-commerce businesses. Beginning with China, we see significant opportunity to expand Tommy in China as many of our lifestyle offerings are underpenetrated. While we did see some slowing in retail traffic, our business delivered strong performance overall, and we capitalized on the immense consumer demand to shop digitally. Our Super Brand Day with Tmall was exceptional, and we continue to be opportunistic leveraging our digital partnerships.","Another brand highlight from the quarter was our TommyNow fashion show, which we hosted in Shanghai in September. The event was extremely successful and helped us to continue to grow our visibility in this market, which is driving consumer engagements toward the full breath of our lifestyle offerings. Overall, we remain energized by the strong opportunity to grow Tommy Hilfiger in China. The health of the brand continues to improve, and we believe that we can realize the full brand potential by growing our category offerings, investing in the business, operating more tier 1 and tier 2 cities directly and leveraging our local brand ambassadors.","Finally, for Asia moving to our Japan business which experienced very strong results as we continue to invest in the market through our recent Tommy Icon acquisition event and our digital partnerships with Zalora. We continue to see strong performance out of our Japan business as we vote to our top line and the bottom line basis in this important market.","Moving to North America, our overall revenues were up 3% and earnings increased 13%, driven by strong gross margin performance. Our wholesale business performance has had another outstanding quarter with strong sales through across all categories. Our wholesale customers continue to be excellent partners for us as they are giving us strong support to Tommy in terms of marketing, promotions and position of product on the floor. On the retail side, our comps were flattish. However, profitability improved as we were significantly less promotional than last year, resulting in a higher level of profitability. On the licensing side, we saw strong results across the board and in particular in the Tommy Hilfiger women\u2019s business that\u2019s being operated by G-III, we saw outsized performance there.","Moving to Calvin Klein, our business came in below plan for the third quarter. Revenues increased 2% and EBIT declined 15%. While most of our businesses are performing very well from underwear to men\u2019s and women\u2019s apparel, tailored clothing, footwear and accessories, we did experienced some issues in our 205 collection business and in our Calvin Klein Jeans business as we offered more elevated fashion forward product at higher price points, particularly with our jeans re-launch, which did not sell through as well as we planned, resulting in more promotional sales and higher overall markdowns. Despite this, we remain confident around Calvin Klein\u2019s long-term growth opportunities.","From a brand health perspective, Calvin Klein remains extremely strong. Global brand awareness continues to be exceptional. The earned media value of our marketing campaigns was almost $160 million year-to-date with our ranking among our competitive accelerating two spots, putting us ahead of key peers. However, our tracking studies indicate opportunity in terms of Calvin\u2019s consideration for purchase ranking, particularly for our collection and jeans businesses, which suggest that we have work to do on the product and marketing side of the business. Calvin is an incredible brand with tons of potential, but there are several execution issues that we are addressing to better capture the brand's top and bottom line opportunities.","First of all, we\u2019ve been disappointed that our investments in the 205 collection business have not delivered the results we expected. We will cut back on a number of these planned investments in the 205 collection business, and as we move forward we will retaking a more returns oriented commercial approach to this important business. Second, we will shift the focus of our marketing campaigns going forward, as they have been two skewed towards our higher and 205 line and the high fashion consumer. Further, we will focus on driving a digital-first approach to the brand. Importantly, marketing is one of the faster leverage that we can address.","For holiday 2018, we are shifting more of our media spend from halo marketing to more commercial, digital and social media advertising. We have up the frequency of our post on social platforms like Instagram, and we are increasingly using micro influences and hosting local activation to drive meaningful engagement, particularly with millennials and GenZ. These changes are just the beginning of what you will see as we head into 2019. Currently, we believe that there are some elements of the new Calvin Klein jeans re-launch, which have been too elevated and too fashion forward for our core consumers, which lead us to taking earlier and deeper markdowns than we previously planned.","From a product perspective, we went too far, too fast on both fashion and price. We are working on fixing this fashion miss and we believe that our CK jeans offering will be much more commercial and fashion right beginning in 2019, especially for the full 2019 season. Let me focus now on our third quarter segment results.","Calvin Klein international rose 3%, reflecting healthy top line results in Europe. Consumers have a strong desire to purchase the brand and they have started to discover and purchase our newer product lines in Europe, including sportswear and performance. While these businesses will continue to ramp up over the next 12 months, Calvin Klein Europe continues to experience healthy growth and our new businesses are on plan. As we look to 2019, I would like to reiterate that our European spring 2019 order book is up 20%. Overall, we remain excited about the brand's long-term opportunity to expand its core product lines in Europe and capitalize on the white space opportunities we have identified.","Moving on to Asia, our business in Asia experienced some softness during the quarter, which we attribute to a combination of the geopolitical issues and the consumer sentiment that are affecting the consumer in this region, as well as the consumer reception to the new jeans product. We continue to see digital as our fastest growing and best performing channel, especially in China, reflecting how consumer prefer to shop. In response to this, we continue to enhance our own digital experience and partner with the key pure play accounts in Asia to offer the best product, exciting capsule collections and deliver the best overall consumer experience.","Moving to North America, we saw revenues up about 1% in the quarter. By channel our transit wholesale were very healthy. We continue to see strength across the majority of our product lines. In our directly operated businesses men\u2019s underwear, women\u2019s intimates and men\u2019s sportswear was quite strong. From a licensing perspective, our tailored clothing, footwear and the women's apparel business from G-III were very strong during the quarter and continued to have outsized growth.","Our North America retail business was challenging during the quarter. Comps declined 2%, reflecting the weaker traffic from international tourists, as well as the softness in the new jeans line. As we look to 2019, we believe that many of the issues that we face in Calvin Klein in 2018 will reverse. We are taking critical steps to offer a more commercial brand and product experience that our consumers want. Our Calvin Klein operating margins are not currently performing at optimal levels, and we believe that there is an opportunity to increase operating margins by 200 basis points over the next two years. The two key letters to deliver on this operating margin opportunity are; first and foremost, our ability to deliver more commercial fashion-right CALVIN KLEIN JEANS product. We are working hard on this design and merchandise issues, and we believe that we will see improvement in 2019, especially for the full season; the second is that we continue to re evaluate our investment spending and the overall expense structure associated with our 205 collection business. This process is well underway and we are taking current actions to ensure that we are well positioned to deliver 75 to 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2019.","Finally, moving to our heritage business, which continue to perform very well for us. Revenues grew 8% in the quarter in line with our expectations, while comps were down 1%. Overall, we expect the revenue growth three years to be out about 2% for our Heritage businesses. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our dress furnishing and sportswear businesses as we believe that we are gaining market share as consumers are responding well to our enhanced fabrication, such a stretch capabilities and temperature activation. The new technologies we have added to our core intimates business are also driving solid results as our consumers love key franchises like our Wire-Free Easy Does It bra and our Cloud 9 COLLECTION.","Digital continues to be a key initiative for our heritage brands division. We are growing our penetration with our department store partners online, and we continue to expand our partnership with Amazon to further enhance our business with them as the core offerings we sell in Heritage brands works very well on that platform. We have seen a nice response to-date on our Van Heusen and IZOD commercials. Van Heusen our celebrated our first of its kind sponsorship partnership with the UFC, featuring MMA fighters and new brand ambassadors, TJ Dillashaw and Stephen Thompson, which had digital and social rates that far exceeded our expectations.","Additionally, IZOD launched its largest media campaign to-date featuring new brand ambassadors the Green Bay Quarterback Aaron Rodgers and comedian Cali Joseph from the Saturday Night Live production. This campaign is targeted at millennials and the campaign has performed very well to-date where we've seen excellent sales within our sportswear businesses. We're also excited to continue to work with these brand ambassadors for the holiday season as we look to continue to drive our outsized sales growth.","Finally, as we enter the fourth quarter, our early holiday sales and margin results are running ahead of our financial plan. Our international businesses continue to see nice momentum with Tommy international comps up low double-digits and Calvin International comps running up a solid mid single-digits. We have seen a strong start to the North America holiday season with comps for Calvin Klein North America trending up one and Tommy North America trending up low single-digits quarter-to-date. We also continue to see strong performance in our wholesale business in North America and in Europe. ","We are well positioned to the balance of fourth quarter and believe given our underlying brand momentum and the strength across our businesses that we will continue to over-deliver against our financial plans. Our Calvin Klein business is a priority for us and I believe will be able to see significant top and bottom line growth as we head into 2019.","And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the third quarter results and outlook.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Due to the 53rd week in 2017, comps to sell for 2018 and more appropriately compared on a one-week shifted basis. Comps store sales I mentioned for the third quarter are compared with the 13 weeks ended November 5, 2017 instead of the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2017.","Our reported revenues for the third quarter were up 7% inclusive of a 2% negative impact from FX and in line with our guidance. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were very strong, up 11% inclusive of the 2% negative impact from FX and above our previous guidance. Tommy Hilfiger international revenues increased 16% inclusive of a 3% negative impact from FX. The Tommy international revenue increase was driven by strong performance in all regions and channels with comp store sales up 13%. Tommy Hilfiger North America revenues were up 3%, including 1% negative impact from FX with retail comp stores relatively flat. North America had significantly more full price selling in the current year quarter versus the prior year quarter, and yielded strong gross margins and operating margin expansion. Our Calvin Klein revenues were up 2% inclusive of 2% negative impact from FX in the quarter, and were below our previous guidance. Calvin Klein international revenues increased 3% inclusive of a negative 4% impact from FX. Our niche international comp store sales were up 1%. Calvin Klein North America revenues increased 1%, including a negative impact of FX of 1%. North America comp store was down 2%. As Manny discussed our Calvin Klein business was negatively impacted by our collection in jeans business. We have taken all appropriate action in the quarter and have lowered prices on slow-moving product creating a gross margin shortfall for the quarter.","Heritage revenues were up 8% for the prior year and in line with our previous guidance. Our heritage retail business comp store sales was down 1%. Our heritage business performed well in the quarter but was unfortunately negatively impacted by the Sears bankruptcy. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.21was $0.08 better than the top-end of our previous guidance. The EPS beat versus prior guidance was driven entirely by strong Tommy Hilfiger business. Interest and taxes for the quarter were as guided.","We ended the quarter with inventories of 15% versus the prior year due to a shift in the timing of receipts as a result of the 53rd week in 2017, or 8% on an aligned calendar basis. We have also accelerated receipts to the U.S. sales as a result of potential new China tariffs, and we continue to increase our investments in basics and core product, particularly in the Tommy Hilfiger to Capitalize on strong business trends. In addition, at year-end we expect inventory levels to be in line with future sales growth.","For the full year 2018, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be $9.33 to $9.35, an 18% growth over the prior year, which is a $0.10 increase at the top end and $0.13 increase at the low end compared to our previous guidance. And this is despite a reduction of $0.04 to our foreign currency translation benefit for the full year. Our new guidance at the high end was compared to our prior guidance reflects $0.12 of business improvement despite $0.06 negative impact resulting from the recent retailer bankruptcies in the U.S. and the UK. $0.02 improvement associated with interest in taxes, which is partially offset by $0.04 of unfavorable currency. Overall, we are projecting revenues to grow approximately 7% with an immaterial impact from currency. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 30 basis points for the company. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 10% inclusive of the positive impact of 1% related to foreign currency.","Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned to increase about 100 basis points. We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 7% with an immaterial impact from foreign currency. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to be down about 70 basis points, which is a reduction of 20 basis points to our previous guidance. This reduction is a result of Calvin Klein business underperforming the sales and margin plans in the third quarter as a result of softness in our jeans and collection business. Calvin Klein operating margins for the fourth quarter are projected to increase about 70 basis points to the prior year. Our Heritage business is planned to have revenue growth of about 2% with operating margins relatively flat to last year, including the negative impact of the Sears bankruptcy.","Interest expense for the year is planned to be about $117 million compared to the prior year amount of $122 million. This decrease is primarily as a result of lower interest 600 million Euro bonds issued in December, partially offset by higher interest rates on our variable debt. In 2018, we are planning to pay down around $200 million of our debt. Stock repurchases in 2018 are planned to be around $300 million. Our tax rate for the year is estimated to be between 13% and 14%. Additional IRS regulations are expected to be issued in the near-term related to the recent tax reform act. Our current estimates could be subject to change if the regulations defer from our current interpretation. Negatively impacting our fourth quarter earnings per share projections is an $0.11 unfavourable impact versus the prior year due to foreign currency translation. In addition, revenues are negatively impacted by about $125 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 from the 53rd week and result in calendar shift.","The $125 million reflects about $80 of revenue that does not repeat from 2017 into 2018 due to the loss of the one week of business in 2018 versus 2017, and $45 million of revenue that moves earlier in the year as the calendar shifts of high volume retail sales and wholesale shipping week out of the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $1.58 to a $1.60 and includes approximately $0.11 of estimated negative impact for foreign currency. Revenue in the fourth quarter is projected to decrease 4%, including the negative impact of 3% related to foreign currency. In addition, the impact of $125 million in the fourth quarter due to the 53rd week equates to 5% of revenue. When adding back the negative impact of foreign currency and the 53rd week impact, our fourth quarter revenue increase is approximately 4%; Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned 4%, including negative impact the 4% for foreign currency; Calvin Klein revenues are planned 6%, including the negative impact of 3% related to foreign currency; Heritage revenues of planned down 2%. ","Interest expense is projected to be about $30 million for the quarter and taxes to be about 13% to 19% in the fourth quarter. And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Erin Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erin Murphy","Manny, I wanted to start with you, just focusing on the Calvin Klein business. I mean, you've clearly invested a lot behind this brand from talent, marketing product, and with the setback you're seeing in denim, and kind of the halo areas of brand, what gives you the confidence that you have the fix under control? And then as we go into '19, what are some of those guideposts that we should be looking at whether it's pricing or product or even how you're thinking about evolving the marketing message?","Manny Chirico","I think I need to say upfront, and when you think about what's happening within the Calvin Klein business, I think first and foremost, we recognize we have a product issue, and we recognize that that product issue really centers from a material point of view on the jeans business. I can only say it so many times, but I have some metrics that I just would like to share with everyone is I really feel strongly that there is not a brand issue here in any way. When you think about the Calvin Klein brand, it is universally one of the most well known and understood brand. It has a global brand awareness of about 90%. That puts it at the top echelon of brands.","It also has a very high relevance rate and intent to purchase around its consumer, which is just quite remarkable for the brand and the relevance is about 65% when we talk directly to our consumers, and that\u2019s consistent across the U.S., rest of North America, and as you move to Europe. And as you get to Asia, obviously, the awareness goes down a little bit like with all global brands as that -- in those markets, particularly China grows more and more, that's why we feel it\u2019s such a strong growth market for us.","So, I think as you know, as I tried to say on the call, I think there's two areas that we really need to focus on, and I think if you know us as a management team, we are very aggressive when we see a problem to really go after and address it. So, on jeans side, for the last 2.5 months, we've been working very hard on the product as we look at 2019 adjusting and we\u2019re not re-designing, but adjusting the 2019 spring buys and merchandising plans, trying to get our price offerings back in line. I think we went too far and too high right out of the gate and adjusting some of that as we go into 2019. And as we go on to fall, we really completely reengineered the product and the design and the approach to it getting the feedback from the local markets both in Europe, North America, and Asia, because it's different in different markets, how we could position the brand. So, I think we truly understand the product issue around jeans.","Secondarily, as we talked about over the last three years, we've been making significant investments in the Calvin Klein brand, particularly at the top of the pyramid, the brand halo in the 205 collection business, and I think based on my comments over that period of time, if you were to quantify that number, over this three-year period, we\u2019ve probably invested between $60 million and $70 million into that business, and we've been reasonably growing into that increased expense structure. As we look at it now, we don\u2019t think that we\u2019re getting the full pay back on some of those investments, and we're taking a really hard look on the planned investment spendings that we had as we looked into 2019 and taking a hard look at that whether those are necessary, should we redeploy some of those investments, or should we take it out of our expense structure, and looking at our overall expense structure associated with 205 and overall Calvin Klein. And it gives us great confidence based on the investments we've made in how we know to run the business that there\u2019s real opportunities to trim that down, redeploy those assets, and we\u2019re highly confident as we go into 2019 that we can improve operating margins in the Calvin Klein business, somewhere in the neighborhood to 75 to 100 basis points. You asked me what should we watch, I think as we go into -- somewhat into the fourth quarter but particularly into 2019, we need to watch gross margin and we need to do a good job of explaining what's going on because sometimes driven by mix, geographic, the U.S., which is our lower gross margin business versus some of our international pieces, we need to be even more transparent about what's going on in that gross margin, and we will be, but I think that will be a key.","But fundamentally are we delivering on the operating margin expansion of the 75 to 100 basis points that we feel confident we can deliver. We are going to have to continue to message that. I guess, on a personal level, for me this is a credibility issue and I really feel strongly about what needs to be done and the actions that need to be taken as we go forward. So we will reposition the expense structure, we will reposition the brand positioning and the focus of our marketing as we go forward. And like always, we\u2019re very aggressive in moving in and out of inventories, that\u2019s why I think you saw such a big gross margin hit in the third quarter for Calvin Klein is because we were aggressive about marking goods on the floor, providing the gross margin reserves that we needed to get through the fourth quarter as well and into spring, so we've tried to be as aggressive as we can and as transparent as we can about that.","Erin Murphy","And I appreciate the candour, thank you. And then just a follow up, Manny, on China. You mentioned you still outperformed your expectations in the market but you are starting to see traffic flow a little bit. Is that in the mainland, is that in the tourist markets? And then when did you start to see that flow down? Thank you so much.","Manny Chirico","It seems so coincided with the trade tensions as you would expect. Clearly, as I've travel throughout Asia but in particular in China, there is real concerns about what's going on there. I mean, I know everybody quantitatively is thinking about tariffs. But I consistently been talking about that\u2019s issue and that\u2019s managed as we try to have as flexible sourcing base as possible. And if we have time, meaning that some lead time with some of the tariff concerns we'll be much more effective in managing that. But I guess secondarily what I'm concerned about is Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger are two great American brands and if there is tensions in different parts of the world about America, it's position in the world, I think in and of itself, it does create some port. We haven\u2019t seen that kind of a backlash anywhere, but what we have seen is in China is just the consumer has slowed down from the accelerated pace we saw in the first two quarters of 2018. So we\u2019re still comping positively, we\u2019ll still move but the traffic levels in the store are not what they were in spring season and it does give us some pause as we go forward and we\u2019re managing that business a little tighter than we have in the past.","Operator","Moving now, we\u2019ll take our next question from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities. ","Bob Drbul","I have a Calvin jeans questions for you. I guess when you take a step back 90 days from the last quarter and just walk us through. Is the inventory -- so you got rid of some of the inventory coming out of the second quarter that was order inventory. Can you walk us through when you think about the supply demand equation for the denim business, where you think we are in terms of the purging of some of this product that isn\u2019t working? And when it turns -- so you talked about changing the buys into the spring. When you walk us through the ability to really impact the product or get it more equilibrium in terms of where the product is. Can you just walk us through the steps that you still need to take? And I guess the second question is just related is. Is the creative sort of the design organization with some of the changes that you see necessary on the denim business? Are they signed up for these changes that you need to see happening?","Manny Chirico","So, I guess let me take in pieces. On the inventory position and as we\u2019ve gone forward, I think as good stock gets delivered in August, I guess the reaction we saw on the floor, the sell throughs weren\u2019t as strong as we had anticipated. And given that reaction and we feel that there was price resistance on some of -- we\u2019re taking price up on some of our core denim and some of our key categories 20% to 25%, and we felt we've built product attributes that we want that the reaction from the consumer either because of the fashion component and design or just the price positioning, we're just not getting the weekly sell through we anticipated. The initial reads in early August were fairly good, but that was just really the start of the season as the delivery start of the come through, we basically came to conclusion we were too fashion forward and our price positioning was too high.","And given that is we\u2019ve been very aggressive about moving through inventory and also providing more of that, not just taking POS markdowns. We\u2019re actually either permanently -- we've taken markdowns on price on the floor or we've provide for those markdowns for the balance of the 2018 fiscal year. So I guess we could have -- over a number of quarters and what we\u2019ve tried to do is get the pain behind us on what\u2019s actually in the pipeline and being deliberate on the floor and the warehouse on the boat soon to be delivered in for us November and December. So we\u2019ve tried to address that. By the end of fiscal '18, by the end of January, our inventories will be in the right position and priced appropriately on the floor that the jeans they will not be an issue of carryover inventory on the floor from a margin point of view. That\u2019s been all captured in our quantification of this problem, both in the -- particularly in the third quarter, but also plan for the fourth quarter. So we think we have that behind us.","Now, the real question. Now, we get the product and design as it goes forward. Obviously, you know lead times in this industry. So we\u2019re able to impact spring to a degree in the architecture of the business but not necessarily at the same level from a pure design aesthetic point of view. So we think we\u2019ve repositioned the pricing appropriately as we go into spring. We think the product is more driven less fashion and we rebalanced to buy but I think when you really see the big changes in the design is as it goes forward in for selling season.","Last piece about talent and where we are, our design center of excellence is in Amsterdam for our jeans business, and I think that is fully staffed, our teams are there and a lot of the players there also do Tommy jeans and understand the sourcing and dynamics of the market. So, we have the talent in place and key designed talent in place to really deliver against that whole jeans assortment, and we need to get back to what is Calvin and the core DNA of the brand.","Bob Drbul","And Manny, as you get through all the denim product that is off in mist. Is this disposition through like online with Amazon or your outlet business or off-price? Can you just talk us through how you manage it from the brand perspective going forward now?","Manny Chirico","Bob, this is all happening in channel. This is -- so we're clear. This is not like we got a pile of inventory, we have got millions of dollars of inventory and there is a flow to this business. And we\u2019re adjusting that flow as it goes forward. And we do have, obviously -- we didn\u2019t wake up to this problem today, we\u2019ve been tracking and we've recognizing and dealing with it. So I\u2019m confident as we get through 2018 that this all go through. And it\u2019s going to be captured in the seasonal promotions that go on in the channels of distribution where the goods are at department stores and our own retail stores. This is not we got a swag of inventory we got to burn or anything like that. This is current inventories but it\u2019s just not getting the sell-throughs that are there. And when you said of being promoting at lower rates, so we\u2019re going have to promote a little bit harder but it will be part of the overall presentation that\u2019s going on at retail during this highly promotional time of the year. So, I don\u2019t think it has any brand damaging issue and I think we\u2019ve tried to be as conservative as we can to build it all into the guidance.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.","Matthew Boss","So Manny, on the Calvin business, I guess what\u2019s your confidence in the 70 basis points CK margin expansion forecast for the fourth quarter? And then as we exit this year, anything at all that changes your view into this brand is a mid to high-single-digit top-line grower next year and beyond?","Manny Chirico","I think on the 70 basis point improvement, I guess that\u2019s implied in our annual guidance. I think, obviously, there\u2019s two components to that. I said the first piece of that is on the gross margin side. I think there we\u2019re looking for something between 10 and 20 basis point improvement in the Calvin Klein business gross margins. I think given the type of reserves and markdown reserves and allowance reserves we built up in our third quarter, I think we are very confident. More importantly, given the trend of business right now that we're seeing through November, we're outperforming our sales plan and we\u2019re outperforming our margin plans in the businesses as we go forward. So that gives us a lot of confidence as we go forward.","There is still a big Christmas season to go and everybody knows this is extra week in December. So we don\u2019t want to get ahead of skies, but it feels good now. I think we got a brand, a product that that\u2019s problematic positioned on the floor at the right retail selling price that the consumer is really reacting to it. So I think we\u2019re getting momentum and velocity on the brand and I think that gives us confidence. On the SG&A side, we don\u2019t miss SG&A. We know what the numbers are, it's the way we have our marketing plan. It\u2019s the way we feel about the business and how we\u2019re moving forward. So given the investments and where we are, we are highly confident about the 70 basis points.","Matthew Boss","And then just a follow-up for the total company, I guess, Manny, what should comfort today in your mid single digit top line and 13 to 15 bottom line algorithm, maybe as we look to next year?","Manny Chirico","I\u2019m not going to give out all the guidance, but I would say nothing has fundamentally changed about our algorithm. I can't factor in especially the unknown and there is two big unknowns for us, is current and a related, to great extent all that\u2019s going on with trade, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, I can\u2019t factor that into where we are. Hopefully, that settles down and there is a solution. And what\u2019s going on with currencies, which I think as a direct result of a lot of what\u2019s going on with the trade tension as the U.S. dollar over the last four or five months has continued to strengthen, which just mathematically puts pressure on such a big piece of our business as we try to -- when we translate that forward.","We've been able to, in 2018, even with some of the issues that we've had to deal with, we've been able to make up for currency hits that probably total somewhere about the 35% range this year against our initial guidance back in March and we've been able to cover all of that and continue to raise our guidance for the year. So there are levers to be pulled with some of the stuff. But the algorithm for PVH overall is impact and we still have great confidence as we go forward. And I talked about the two external issues that has the potential to pressure that for 2019.","Operator","Moving on, we will take our next question from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. ","Michael Binetti","Thanks for all the help during the transparency, Manny, very, very helpful, I know you had a tough quarter there for Calvin. I just want to follow up on that quickly. Is the FX and the bankruptcies that we've seen recently and then some of jeans overhang issues. You've walked us through how those extend into this spring, you've made some changes a lot more confident reversing that by fall. Is there anything that gets us to a point where we\u2019re saying 13% to 15% next year is going to be lower than that in the currency and anything that we should think about today related to those things that we're going to enter the year with perhaps?","Manny Chirico","I think you need to be cognizant of currencies. You need to cognizant of what\u2019s going on in tariffs. I don\u2019t think the bankruptcies that we experienced this year is -- the bankruptcies that we experienced this year really shouldn\u2019t impact business at all. The Sears business is relatively small. I\u2019m not -- again not a crystal ball. But if Sears survives in some form it\u2019s going to be much smaller. The House of Frazer situation seems to be a real restructuring and they seems to be coming out of it, better capitalized as they move forward. So I don\u2019t think that will be a negative impact as well. So, those are the factors outside of everything that\u2019s going on. And when we get to the first quarter of next year, the beginning, we\u2019ll give you the appropriate guidance. But we\u2019ll also try to be as transparent as we go through this as things develop in the market to keep you informed about how this might impact us in those key areas as we go forward.","Michael Binetti","I guess just on the currency, as you guys \u2013 there has been some changes and I know in the currencies that are a little bit tougher to hedge that make the currency mile that we run a little bit harder to think about lately. So as we think about you guys have such a big input, if currency stay where at today. How should we walk through the transactional effects into next year? I know that\u2019s operated traditionally quite a lag, maybe anywhere from 12 months to 18 months even, as you look that...","Manny Chirico","I think transaction next year will be relatively minimum I mean, again, because we\u2019re hedged. And I think we understand where that is. And if we are -- if it\u2019s -- it will probably be a small headwind if I had to guess right now but a lot depends on what happens as we go forward. We\u2019re hedged out as far as 12 months on certain purchases, but it builds over the year, as you know. It\u2019s really the translational that\u2019s the wild card, because obviously that is something we don\u2019t hedge and I don\u2019t think most companies hedged And particularly, in the first half of the year, our biggest currencies, it\u2019s not the small currency you\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s a big currencies, it\u2019s the Euro, Pounds, the Canadian Dollar, The RMB, the China currencies, The Brazilian Real. ","If you look at where currencies were when we initially gave guidance back in March of this year for the current year, the Euro, as an example, was $1.24. Today, the Euro is $1.13. So, that is going to be an issue if there is not movement in that as we go forward. I don't think I'm telling you anything that everyone doesn't know.","And there's not much that I think you can do in the short-term to manage against that. We manage our expenses but there's only so much you can do because you have to manage the business in the currency that it's being supported in. So, again, just to summarize it, I don't think that transactional issues, because we're hedged out, is a real issue for us but I think the concern might be more on the translation side.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thank you very much.","Manny Chirico","And I think -- I guess I would just add, because this always comes up, for a U.S. company that's U.S. dollar-denominated, 50%-plus of our sales is coming out of the international markets with the currencies I discussed and over 60%, 65% of our profitability is coming out of those markets. And that's why currencies present a bigger issue relative to, say, some of our competitors in this market here who have a much smaller geographic diversification than we do.","Operator","Yes, sir. Moving on, we'll take our next question from Chethan Mallela from Barclays","Chethan Mallela","It sounds like there's a big distinction between the performance of the Calvin Klein Jeans and Collection businesses and just the balance of that brand. So, can you maybe just talk about the magnitude of the differential that you saw on the top and bottom line between Jeans and Collection versus the balance of Calvin in the third quarter? And just how you're thinking about that relative performance into the fourth quarter?","Manny Chirico","So, I guess I'm not going to get into profitability by product category but let me just try to put the Calvin business, the Jeans business in size perspective so you get a sense. And also, last night on Cramer, I did the math in my head and I was wrong when I said that Jeans represented 10% of our business globally. It represents about 15% to 16% of our business globally. But for PVH, from an owned and operated, when you distinguish between half of our business, more or less, is licensed and half of our business is directly operated by us, so it represents 15% to 16% of our overall Calvin Klein brand business, retail sales globally, but for the businesses that we operate directly that we report sales on, it represents about just over 30% of our business, to give you a sense. And it has a bigger financial impact, given that, on our own P&L. So, that's a bit of a background.","So, what I would say to you is, look, we're seeing -- all you have to do is just go to Macy's or go to Dillard's or some of the key department stores and see the Calvin Klein presentation at retail and you'll see, on the women's side of the floor, it's been spectacular. The results for a brand that's as big as it is at Macy's, in particular, we continue to see -- and G3 will talk about it in their conference calls as they go forward -- but we continue to see very strong growth out of the Calvin Klein business and our partner, G3, just does an outstanding job.","The men's tailored business continues to be very strong. Our Calvin Klein dress furnishings business continues to be very strong. Our sportswear business is performing on the men's side the way we look at. Our footwear business continues to be a good business for us. And, obviously, the crown jewel of our portfolio is our men's underwear and women's intimates business and that business is just off the charts and you can't help but walk in the store and just recognize that.","So, to give you a perspective, and my point being is I know this Jeans issue is something we clearly have to deal with and it's a key part of the brand, but I think, at time, it does overextend its importance to the overall brand as we move forward. So, I think it's important to share that.","Chethan Mallela","And just one quick modeling follow-up. I know that some of this is still in flux but should we be thinking about the fiscal '18 tax rate, where we're looking to land at the end of this year, as a reasonable assumption to use on a go-forward basis?","Mike Shaffer","Look, guidance is still coming but the model did imply that and that's where we are at this point. We're still waiting. Regulations are being firmed up. There's so many moving pieces. But I think that's a safe assumption for now.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Tiffany Kanaga from Deutsche Bank.","Tiffany Kanaga","Hi. Thanks so much for taking our questions. I think we've touched on this tangentially but when you discussed 200 basis points Calvin Klein operating margin improvement ahead, would you outline what's also baked into those plans in terms of retailer bankruptcies, as well as FX, tariffs, and global macro risks? And, additionally, would you break down the opportunity between North America and International? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Tiffany, I'll do this. I'm not counting on any bankruptcies as we go forward, obviously. It'll be what it'll be. There's always something going on and I don't think that really should be meaningful unless there's some major issue out there that I'm not aware of. So, I don't think bankruptcies are an issue.","I think, geographically, and we've said it, International will grow faster than the North America business, only because the North America business, on a relative size level, is so much bigger and the product categories here in North America are much more developed. We always are talking about the European opportunity for Calvin Klein. And what I continue to say is, today, the Calvin Klein brand for us is doing just under $1 billion in sales in Europe. The Tommy business is more than twice as big as the Calvin business within Europe and we think there's the opportunity to be as big in Calvin as we are in Tommy long-term. Developing our men's and women's sportswear business, developing more of a performance business, our tailored clothing, our footwear and accessory opportunity that exists for us.","It's the only region in the world where Tommy is larger than Calvin. So, it gives us a lot of confidence. Plus, we have the management team, the expertise, and the model in place with our operating platform in Europe to really take advantage of that and have the credibility with our key retail partners there to have two of the premier brands in the world to really use as leverage as we go forward. So, we have a tremendous amount of confidence that we can deliver against that. And just, not to go back too far in history, but when we took over that European business five years ago, it was $500 million and it was losing money. And today it's $1 billion, making double-digit operating margins. So, that gives us big confidence.","And the continued growth within Asia, just as that market continues to grow, driven by China and the related greater China markets as we go forward, there's just significant growth and white space opportunities for the brand. And just like Europe, the product category offerings are much more limited overseas in Asia than they are as developed here in the United States. So, I think that's where we are. And then keep in mind that the operating margins internationally for Calvin and Tommy are higher than the operating margins of our North American business. So, I think that's what gives us confidence as we move forward.","Tiffany Kanaga","All right. Thanks so much.","Manny Chirico","Thank you. Operator, we're going to take one more question. It's already after 10:00 a.m.","Operator","Certainly. We'll take our final question from Kate McShane from Citi.","Kate McShane","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one small question with the tourism softness in the U.S. that you had mentioned. Is that across the board in tourism or was it just specifically with the Chinese tourists?","Manny Chirico","For us, I guess there's two big categories that we see. It's what you touched on, which is China, but it's also Brazil. Given what's gone on there in this hemisphere, particularly this time of year, that's always a strong consumer for us, particularly for our two brands that have great market position in Brazil, both Tommy and Calvin. I think we outsize performance with that target consumer. So, it's really that South American consumer and it's the China piece that we've seen slow down. The European tourism we haven't seen really slow down at all in the United States. But I think a number of people have talked about it on their calls that that international piece is not as strong as it was in the first half of the year.","Kate McShane","Okay. Thank you for that. And then I just wanted to ask a quick question. Tariffs, I know, are a big unknown. I just wondered if you could maybe quickly walk us through how much you're thinking you can mitigate, in terms of pushing back on your suppliers and finding efficiencies in supply chain versus what would be your view on pricing if tariffs were to be enacted here?","Manny Chirico","Kate, let me put it into some context first. If you look at imports for apparel and accessories from China into the United States, the last statistic I saw -- it's a bit of a moving target -- is about 40% of imports for the U.S. market come from China. We are, as a company, we are below 20% of our production for North America. For U.S., it's about 17% or 18% and we're constantly adjusting that. If you were to look at us three years ago, we would have been over 40%.","We have been strategically moving, because of cost pressures -- because we didn't like the way that market was developing for the U.S. market, we've used our China sourcing base for China and also for the European market and that's been a really strong strategic move for us, particularly in the environment we're in.","But, given our size, 17%, 18% of our production, which represents about 8% or 9% of our cost of goods sold globally, is still coming out of China and that number is about $75 million of tariff impact to our cost of product if it comes through at 25%. So, it's not insignificant.","I think now we get into a couple of things. If it happens and the tariff is put on, if it happens and it happens that the administration makes the decision we're going to raise all tariffs, we're going to do 25%, and we're all going to do it on January 1st, we've got a problem in the short-term. There's no time to react. You can't even change tickets to adjust it on the floor to move your retail selling price if you so desired to do that. The purchase orders are already written with all of the retailers and I'm sure we're going to get pushback to say, \"Well, we've got a deal.\" It's not logical to me that that's what would happen but everyone would be dealing with that issue.","Now, if it was more like this fall and an announcement that tariffs are going to go in place and it's going to be 10% in April and then if nothing's resolved, it's going to be 25% in July -- I'm making this up -- then there's an opportunity to start to really mitigate as we get into the second half of the year and, clearly, into 2019. So, I do think, if tariffs come, it's going to do two things. It will pressure cost and create inflation on the goods from China but we also have to be realistic. It will also create inflation globally for products coming into the United States because if Vietnam is now more in demand, there's going to be cost increases coming through as we start to place production there. So, that's going to have to valued.","So, I think this entire exercise on tariffs has got the potential to create some real inflation in the apparel and accessory area. And there is going to be some movement to be more efficient but there is also going to be, unfortunately, some pain to the consumer. And we are going to have to raise prices. What does that do to demand? I mean, we could run through all these theoretic exercises, and be assured, we're looking at it, but that's the exercise that really needs to happen.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Manny Chirico","Thank you. And with that, I think we're going to close the call. I want to wish everybody a healthy and happy holiday season. Happy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas, everyone, and a healthy and happy New Year to you and your families and we look forward to speaking with you in our fourth quarter press release in March. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And, again, that will conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"18423":["PVH Corp.

Please go ahead, Sir.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you, [Voger]. Joining Mike and myself on the call is Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President in charge of Investor Relations; Allen Sirkin, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ken Duane, our CEO of our North American Wholesale.","In general, we are very pleased with our first quarter results. We beat the top end of the guidance by $0.05. And given the momentum in our business, we also increased our 2012 earnings guidance by $0.05 to US$6.15 to US$6.25.","Let me jump into some of the businesses, I\u2019ll start with the Tommy Hilfiger business. The Tommy business continued its strong momentum during the quarter. We posted an 8% revenue increase and a 13% increase in operating income.","When you take out the foreign currency headwinds that we felt in the first quarter, our operating performance was just outstanding on a constant currency revenue basis. They were up 11% and operating income was up 18% for the quarter.","Focusing in on our International businesses, the Tommy international revenues were up 9% in local currencies. Our retail comps in Europe posted a 5% increase for the quarter, while wholesale revenues were up 9%.","Geographically, we continue to see strong growth in Central, Northern and Eastern Europe, partially offset by the softness in Spain and Italy. On a product category basis, we saw a strong performance in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sportswear denim and footwear. Overall saw a strong sell-throughs within our retail department store counts throughout Europe and feel like, we\u2019re gaining significant market share during this turbulent time in Europe.","Moving to our North American business, we posted a 12% increase for the quarter driven by a 16% comp store sales increase in our retail businesses and mid single-digit growth in the Tommy wholesale businesses. We continue to elevate product and gain an additional [four] space in top doors at Macy\u2019s, which is fueling the brands exposure. We see tremendous momentum in this business and strongly believe that the significant investments we are making in product and in our marketing programs are paying dividends for us with the consumer.","In North America, we experience to get 10% increase in our average unit retails at the door at both wholesale and retail. We strongly feel that our marketing and product initiatives only intensify in the second half of the year and believe we are well position to continue to exceed our plans for the balance of the year. For 2012, we are planning our overall Tommy revenues to grow 7% to 8% on a constant currency basis. Given the uncertain economic environment, we are planning our revenue growth more conservatively for the balance of the year than the current business trends would indicate.","Moving to our Calvin Klein businesses, these businesses continue to exceed our financial guidance and post strong results. Total revenues in the first quarter for the combined Calvin Klein businesses were up 7% and operating profits increased 5%. The Calvin Klein wholesale and retail businesses that we operate directly reported a 12% increase in sales in the quarter. This strong performance was driven by our Calvin Klein retail businesses, which posted a 9% comp store increase and equally strong performance in our wholesale businesses.","The businesses experiencing comp store sales increases and growth in square footage. The square footage growth is being driven both by new doors, as well as the expansion of existing doors and shops.","For the year, we are planning our Calvin Klein wholesale and retail businesses to grow about 10%, which will be driven by a mid single-digit comp store growth in our own stores, and growth in square footage at both wholesale and retail.","Moving to our Calvin Klein licensing segment; licensing revenues were up, royalty revenues were up 2% on a constant currency basis. The business posted strong revenue growth across all regions with the exception of Europe, specifically North American sales were up between 4% to 5% despite a significant reduction in jeans sales for the value channel.","Asia sales were up 6%, driven by double-digit growth in China, partially offset by soft sales in jeans and underwear in Korea. Latin and South America sales were up 10% driven by Brazil; and Europe sales were down 8% and I will put some more color on that.","Focusing in on some of our key businesses with our key licensing partners, the overall Warnaco business was down about 6% on a constant currency basis in the first quarter. This reduction was due to a 11% decline in jeans, driven by poor performance in Europe and a $30 million planned reduction in U.S. jean sales sold to the secondary channel.","Moving to Calvin Klein underwear, revenues were up 3% for the quarter led by strong growth in both the U.S., Asia and South America.","Our men\u2019s business continued to perform well up 7% for the quarter with a launch of Bold that is driving that growth. Women\u2019s was down slightly in the quarter, reflecting the timing of new product launches versus 2011. In 2011, we had the CK ONE launch; we\u2019ve had significant fixture fill in the first quarter. For 2012, our launches are much more second half driven and for women, we have the launch of push positive, which is an innovative new product for women\u2019s Calvin Klein underwear.","Moving to fragrance with Coty, our fragrance business continued its strong performance across all regions. For the current year, our new fragrance launch schedule is all second-half weighted, compared to last year\u2019s spring launch of CK ONE. Despite that timing issue, fragrance sales were flat for the quarter and well ahead of projections. We continue to see strong performance from our Euphoria, CK ONE and Calvin Klein beauty franchises.","For the second half of the year, we have two new product initiatives planned. The first is the new men\u2019s fragrance for fall, which we call encounter. And the second is the new global marketing and advertising campaign with Euphoria, our largest fragrance franchise. Both of these launches will be supported by a significant marketing and advertising spends, as well as new celebrity talent, which should fuel significant growth in the second half of the year. We will have much more to say about these two exciting initiatives on our second quarter earnings call in August.","Moving to our U.S. women\u2019s business, our North American U.S. women\u2019s apparel and accessory businesses were very strong in the quarter. Our royalty revenues with our licensees G-III and Jimlar were up over 15% for the quarter. On the apparel side, this growth is being fueled by the strong selling of women\u2019s sportswear, women\u2019s performance, dresses and suits. In footwear, revenues are ahead about 20% with strong growth in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s businesses.","In addition our new handbags and accessory business continues its very strong performance. G-III has seen excellent sell-throughs at all department store accounts. We are targeting 20% growth for this category in 2012.","Our CK Bridge business in Asia continues to grow dramatically, posting an 8% increase for the quarter. We expect this business to grow about 20% for the year. The growth has been fueled by the China, Korea and Hong Kong markets where we are experiencing significant door expansion and comp store sales growth.","For 2012, we\u2019re planning the overall Calvin Klein royalty growth more conservatively than in prior years due to the uncertainty in Europe. We\u2019re now planning royalties to grow on a constant currency basis at 3% to 4% compared to our prior guidance of 4% to 5%, with foreign-exchange providing about 200 basis points headwind.","The primary driver of this reduction is the weakness we see in Europe particularly in the Warnaco apparel businesses. In order to take the financial risk out of those businesses, we are currently projecting the European jeans wear and CK Bridge businesses at contractual guaranteed minimum royalties for fiscal 2012. As such our overall European royalties are being planned down in the high single-digit range for 2012.","In North America our royalty revenues plan to grow for high single-digit growth with department stores being partially offset by a $30 million planned reduction in sales to the off-price channels, resulting an overall North American royalty growth of mid-single digit for 2012.","Moving to Asia and South America, we see these two regions continuing to grow at double-digit rates. Retail store square footage coupled with strong comp store sales increases will drive the growth in these regions. Our Heritage businesses, revenues were down about 3%, which was on plan and in line with our previous guidance. Retail comparable sales growth of 3% was more than offset by a 6% decline in wholesale businesses.","Our Heritage business is in turnaround mode, and we feel we are very well positioned in this business. Our full orders are on plan, inventory levels are in line with our retail sales plans. Second half product course are decreasing in the range of 5% to 8% and our in-store presentations are being enhanced and expanded with key customers. All of this gives us a high degree of confidence that we\u2019ll see a dramatic improvement in this business in the second half of 2012.","Let me move just to some of the trends we\u2019re seeing at the beginning of the second quarter. Our second quarter in May is off to a strong start, in particular, business trends in our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses continue to outperform our plans. In our U.S. Retail businesses, the comps for the Calvin Klein are running up about 7%, while the comps for Tommy are running up about 12% against mid single-digit comp store plans.","Comp store, our Heritage business are running up low single-digits in line with plan. In the U.S., wholesale portion of our business both the CK and Tommy Hilfiger businesses continue to perform ahead of sales plans, and we continue to see increases in our out the door retails. Heritage is continues to be challenging, while we\u2019re moving through inventory and seeing improvements in spring and summer sell-throughs.","Moving to Europe, wholesale which represents about 70% of our business continues its strong momentum. Our spring and summer 2012 season we started shipping in the fourth quarter is ahead 13% against last year. For the fall holiday 2012 season, our order book is up 4% to 5%. And retail, our comps for Europe have improved from 5% to high single-digits against a 3% comp store plan.","Finally, we\u2019ve been prudent with our guidance and our estimates. We believe we have taken a significant portion of the risk out of the Calvin Klein European royalties by planning the jeans and CK Bridge royalties at contractual guaranteed minimum royalty levels. We feel that we put together sales and operating margin projections that we can not only meet, but if business trends continue we can exceed as we go forward.","We believe that the momentum we have seen in our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses will continue to drive our growth and should allow us to continue to outperform our current projections.","And with that I will turn it over to Mike to quantify some of our guidance and our results for the quarter.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks Manny. The comments I\u2019m going to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our earnings release. We are very happy with the first quarter results.","For the quarter, we delivered revenues and earnings per share above our guidance and greater than the prior year. Our revenues for the quarter increased about $60 million or 4% over the prior year and were about $35 million greater than our previous revenue guidance.","Revenue growth over the prior year was driven by increases of 8% and 7% at Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein respectively.","Our Tommy Hilfiger revenue growth of 8% includes a 3% or $20 million FX hit. On a constant currency basis, Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 11%. We delivered earnings per share of $1.30 for the first quarter, which was $0.05 greater than our guidance of $1.25, and 6% greater than the prior year.","Our earnings per share was driven by stronger than expected revenues for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, as our gross margin and operating result percentages were in line with our previous guidance.","Moving to our guidance for 2012, we\u2019ve raised our full year EPS guidance to a range of $6.15 to $6.25, an increase of 14% to 16% over the prior year. Revenues are planned to be up 5% to 6% excluding the impact of foreign exchange and our discontinued businesses.","Including the impact of foreign exchange and discontinued businesses, we\u2019re expecting revenues to be up 1% to 2%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to be up 7% to 8% on a constant currency basis with Tommy Hilfiger North America increasing 5% to 6% and Tommy Hilfiger International increasing 8% to 9% on a constant currency basis.","Including the negative impact of foreign exchange, we\u2019re expecting total Tommy Hilfiger revenues to be up 2% to 3%. Calvin Klein revenues are planned to increase 6% to 7%, while our ongoing Heritage businesses are planning revenues up 1% to 2%, excluding the impact of exiting our IZOD and IZOD women\u2019s and Timberland businesses.","Our total Heritage revenues are planned to decline 4% to 5%, including the negative impact of related [exhibitors]. Gross margins for the year are planned up about 125 basis points with expenses for the year planned up about 50 to 70 basis points, due in large part to an increase in pension expense. Impacting our gross margin and expense in 2012 is on mix of business, as a result of faster growth in our higher gross margin and higher expense Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses.","Operating margins for 2012 are planned to increase about 60 to 70 basis points over 2011. Our tax rate for the year is planned to 23.5% to 24% and reflects the continued benefit of additional foreign earnings, which are taxed at a lower rate than domestic earnings.","Interest expense is planned between $115 million to $117 million reflecting a reduction to the prior year as a result of debt repayments. We currently anticipate to make $300 million of term loan payments in the current year.","For the second quarter of 2012, earnings per share are planned at 1.18 to 1.20 or an increase of 10% to 12% over the prior year. We are planning our revenues to increase about 4% to the prior year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and exited businesses. Including the impact of foreign exchange and exited businesses, we\u2019re planning our revenues basically flat.","Our gross margins for the second quarter will be up about 125 basis points with all businesses plan to show gross margin improvement as we begin to sell four product later in the second quarter, which is showing cost decreases of about 5% to 8%.","Overall operating margins will be relatively flat for the second quarter as expenses were up the mix of business and as a result of the pension expense increase. Our tax rate for the second quarter is planned to 26.5% to 27%.","And with that we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.

When you look at the European outlook and the performance of Tommy, are you more concerned about your Heritage business performance given the Q1 results or are you more concerned about the outlook on the European side?","Emanuel Chirico","You know, look, I guess, we get paid to worry about everything, but on balance, I think is feel very confident about the Heritage turnaround, because the business is in front of us. We see the cost declines that Mike discussed a 5% to 8%, we see where we\u2019re positioned from an audit flow with our retailers, the inventory is in line. If the inventories are controlled and we just continue to see the kind of sell-throughs that we are experiencing in spring and summer, we should be very well positioned for second, third, and fourth quarters outperform our guidance and so to really see significant improvement in the second half of next year. So that seems to be within our grasp and the only thing that can really screw result of this inventories get on line and we lose control of the promotional agenda, which I just don\u2019t see happening at this point.","Europe, we\u2019ve consistently seen strong performance there since the acquisition of Tommy. We are now approaching now a 30th month of running that business. And feeling very strong about the trends in the business, we feel very strong about how that business is happening and, but you have to be concerned what you read in the paper and a constant drum beat that goes out there. So it\u2019s really a balancing, I read the headlines and then I look at our daily sales reports, and we continue to comp, meet the high single-digit comps there and we see a spring, summer of retail sell-throughs very strong.","So I know we are gaining market share. I know we are doing everything that\u2019s in our control to manage that business. And if Greece pulls out, I can tell you what kind of impact it\u2019s going to have on the consumer and where it is. So this uncertainty that\u2019s just over all lines of the business, and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been much more cautious with our guidance. Given all of that, I couldn\u2019t be more confident given where we are in the world, then we are going to deliver or exceed with the guidance that we\u2019ve given to the street. It just seems like there is a lot of momentum in all of the businesses we operate.","Robert Scott Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it and in terms of the progression of the comps in Europe, can you just talk about like, was there a major change from the beginning of the quarter until sort of where you are right now, through the second quarter?","Emanuel Chirico","No, I think the trend has been pretty consistent. It\u2019s just all of it is just moved. So in the last three or four weeks, we\u2019ve just seen business get better almost in every market from what it was three months ago. And it was obviously the plus five moving to high single-digit comps for the last three weeks.","Now, leading into that, it\u2019s a three week trend, feel very good about it. But, I\u2019m not ready now to that take and extrapolate it out. So, at this point in time, it gives us confidence and it makes us feel good about that, obviously the spring and summer lines are very strong and the consumer\u2019s reaction to it. But, I wouldn\u2019t want to draw any conclusions of the economy in Europe overall.","Robert Scott Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks very much. Good luck.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Adrianne Shapira at Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne T. Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Manny when you initially provided the guidance in January of this year, it seems if what has changed since then, besides the fact that obviously we\u2019re starting off with a strong feed and you\u2019re passing that on. On the one hand, the world has gotten a bit scary, but on the other, it seems like you\u2019ve taken out risk to your guidance, especially with the Calvin Klein business now planned at contractual minimum. So, maybe in terms of where we sit today versus where you\u2019re ahead with that in January, you provided the initial guidance, how do you feel about the remainder of the year, especially with the back half being better than the first?","Mike Shaffer","Sure. Well, look I think, let\u2019s put it in perspective. When we first came out in January, we said that the first half would be flat to down. And right now the first quarter was up, earnings per share 6%, and the second quarter, we\u2019re guiding now to a 10% to 12% increase.","So clearly, what\u2019s in front of us, we feel really good about. And that\u2019s enabled us to do a couple of things. It\u2019s enabled us to take some of the risk out of the Calvin Klein royalty business by taking future royalty in Europe down and also at the time we were looking at a Euro that was $1.30, and now we\u2019re projecting something more like $1.27, $1.26.","So clearly, we factored that into it as well and took those EPS hits while raising guidance from January, up probably $0.15. So we feel much better about the tone of business right now. But just don\u2019t have a crystal ball to tell you how everything is going to actually come together in the macro environment.","Adrianne T. Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, okay. So in light of the Q1 6%, 2Q 10% to 12%, we should still be thinking about the back half better than the first half, even though you had thought, it was going to be flat to down, that still holds through that the back half still presents an opportunity?","Emanuel Chirico","Yeah, just the math, I don\u2019t have it in front of me, but the earnings per share growth in the back half of the year is well in excess of 15%, when you put it altogether, since we\u2019re growing at the top end of the guidance 16%. So clearly, I don\u2019t have the math in front of me, you guys can do your own, but based on our guidance we\u2019re looking for even a stronger second half. I think two things will fuel that.","Overall, just a natural flow through of the cost declines that are in the system have been ordered, booked and in place and we should really, we were feeling more and more confident about Heritage getting back on to its track that delivering steadier earnings, nine out of the last 10 years. So with the exception of the blip that we had last year with Heritage with all the chaos in the market, we really feel strongly that business get back on track second half of the year.","Adrianne T. Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then Manny just following on that, it is exciting to hear that you see opportunity for Heritage to get back on track, but on the flip side, we are obviously seeing some pretty strain out of JCPenney was comps down 19% in Q1. Maybe help us think about how you\u2019re getting more excited about Heritage, but we\u2019re obviously seeing some challenges as JCPenney tries to transform that business?","Emanuel Chirico","I guess on a couple of this, overall in the Heritage side, we sell everyone, so I think that\u2019s important to take into consideration. On the Heritage side also the key in the Penney situation from an operating point of view, I think is to make sure your inventories continue to be on plan. Not everybody was surprised business was softer in the first quarter for Penney\u2019s and we\u2019ve adjusted all of our inventories and out flowing our order book to really take that into consideration.","One of the advantages we are going on as we have two new brands with JCPenney, we have one brand at JCPenney that didn\u2019t exist which is the ARROW business, which is growth against last year. And in addition, the IZOD business which is the same number of doors, but it is getting stronger presentation and a deeper buy is very positive for us as well.","So all those businesses at Penney, as top as the Penney\u2019s business has been or Van Heusen or ARROW and our IZOD business for the first quarter we\u2019re right on plan against our projections, our inventories are in line and we\u2019ve just adjusted the inventory flow and the inventory purchasing for the back end of the year. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening there. Offsetting whatever chaos that Penney\u2019s is creating in the market is just very strong business with Macy\u2019s with our Heritage Brands and very strong businesses at Kohl\u2019s with our businesses there as well, both sportswear and dress shirt. So that flow is really coming back and the order flow seems to be in place for us.","Adrianne T. Shapira \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Perfect. Best of luck.","Mike Shaffer","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Omar Saad at ISI Group.","Omar Saad \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Mike Shaffer","Hey, Omar.","Emanuel Chirico","Good morning, Omar.","Omar Saad \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","Hey, guys. We\u2019ve been hearing some rumbling about in Europe that some department stores are getting a little bit more cautious in terms of their planning given all the kind of macro and headline stuff that you mentioned. Are you guys seeing department stores kind of book to maybe kind of orders a little bit, just to manage inventories a little bit more tightly, and then how do you feel overall about the inventory levels in your business and then at retail in Europe?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, we\u2019re not seeing with any of the major accounts any cancellations at all on the Tommy business. For Fall and holiday as you can see we open to buy our sales order flow in our order book, we\u2019re planning the business 4% to 5% based on the order flow, so clearly based on five to six consecutive seasons since we\u2019ve been operating the business of double-digit growth open to buy dollars has shrunk in the second half of the year, retail is getting their inventories back in line.","And that\u2019s all factored into our 4% to 5% growth in the wholesale business for the second half of the year. We\u2019re not seeing any attempt by the retailers to cancel goods at this point. We believe, Tommy unlike most of the brands in Europe continues to gain market share in this environment and is been a proven performer at retail with our key customers. So they continue to get behind that brand and we haven\u2019t seen any softness in that business at all. Whatever orders that we have canceled has been more our decision from a credit point of view with some of our smaller specialty store accounts, but clearly immaterial to the overall business and feeling good about other business seems to be progressing.","Omar Saad \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc","Gotcha, thanks that\u2019s really helpful. And then could you step back and think about the success you guys are having with that brand and many of the management team has been excellent, and the execution has been great. We were starting to hear other brands over there, comping down, comping down mid-teens, even in Northern Europe, it\u2019s not necessarily just as kind of Southern Europe, Northern Europe split. I know stepping back and you think about that business, how can you explain, what your explanation of why it\u2019s doing so well. Is just execution, is there fashion trend in Europe where they had a Tommy Hilfiger, preppy, red, white and blue fashion, is in fashion right now. What are your thoughts on that? Thanks.","Emanuel Chirico","Look, I mean, this is one of those things which you can never really put your thumb on exactly why we\u2019re outperforming, but clearly the execution is a big part of it. I think the management\u2019s team for localization focusing on each market from a merchandising point of view product assortment point of view really staying on top of it. From that point of view, I think it\u2019s always been a strength and continues to be a strength of the Tommy brand. I think, to some degree, we are in a preppy traditional, very much color focus from a brand point of view.","I think that does benefit the Tommy brands to a degree. But again we\u2019re up against a lot of competitors that fill that bill as well so and getting market shares. So I really believe it comes out of the execution and product assortment. And I think is the intensification of the marketing that\u2019s been going on as 24 months has really been a key both in Europe and in the United States from that point of view. So I think that\u2019s the best I can do from an explanation and just monitoring the business and not seeing any kind of slowdown at this point.","Omar Saad \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group, Inc.","All right. That works for me, Manny. Thanks a lot, great job.","Emanuel Chirico","Me too, Omar.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Evren Kopelman of Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","All right, good morning. Thank you. Your North America outlook business seems to really have outsized growth ahead of your other channels. Can you talk about why, kind of the reasons behind that and also how is the profitability in that channel relative to your other channel?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I guess, look, I think where we\u2019re seeing the most outstanding growth is with the Calvin and Tommy. Our Heritage brands are doing fine, low single-digit comp increases, which are on plan delivering, I think the outlet channel, that channel in general is a robust channel. I think there is a significant international tourist component to that in key markets, Florida, Vegas, the New York Metro market, the West Coast. And I think, we benefit dramatically from that both with Calvin and Tommy.","And we have not seen any slowdown in that tourist inflow at all. So the business has been, both from a domestic tourist flow, which I think only intensify in the summer and from an international tourist really adding to the business. Our biggest international tourist for most of those key markets continues to be Brazil, and both the Tommy brand and the Calvin brand are extraordinarily strong in the Brazilian market. And when they come here, they shop significantly in that channel distribution. So I think those are some of the reasons why we are doing as well as we are.","And I think the last reason is we\u2019ve also really focusing on some key markets, expanded stores in those markets to take advantage of the growth that we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ve been able to really capture more market share because of that.","Evren Dogan Kopelman \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","And how is the profitability?","Emanuel Chirico","I am sorry. The profitability in our Tommy and Calvin businesses are one of the highest in our franchise, so somewhere in the 11% to 13% range.","Evren Dogan Kopelman \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Howard Tubin, RBC Capital Markets.","Howard Tubin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Equity Research","Oh, thanks guys, great quarter. May be just some more color on inventories and how do you feel about kind of carryover in your inventory if is there any and how you are planning inventory for the fall season?","Emanuel Chirico","Yeah. I think inventories are in terrific shape in-house and also best as we can sell we monitored weekly and retail and with our key department store accounts. We really jumped on the fall holiday inventory mid fourth-quarter to really keep ourselves well-balanced. So I feel like I guess on true levels I think we\u2019re in excellent position. We\u2019re in excellent position from a quality point of view and from a quantity point of view and being able to stay out of trouble on seasonal goods, but we\u2019re also very liquid and we\u2019ve been chasing and I feel confident that as sales hopefully materialize above our plan then we\u2019ll be in a position to capture that.","So I think we\u2019ve really been able to balance that particularly in some of our quick response in our EVI businesses dress shirts and in particular neckwear, we\u2019ve been really able to be very liquid and stay on top of that in order to drive that business. So I think that will continue.","Howard Tubin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets Equity Research","Great, thanks.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go next to Robbie Ohmes at Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hello. Hey, Manny, good morning.","Emanuel Chirico","Good morning, Rob.","Robert F. Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hey, two questions for you. The first question was just the strength of the AUR, the Tommy Hilfiger AUR up by 10%. Can you walk us through the timing of when the AUR, tailwind began and when you anniversary that in? Does that mean if I look at Tommy\u2019s comps in North America up 12%, the 10 points to that is AUR and, sort of if so how you\u2019re thinking about AUR in the, I think the fall season, I think you start to lap that?","And then second question on Heritage, so IZOD I think you\u2019re doing the shop and shops with JCPenney and then you mentioned ARROW going into JCPenney. I was just, I remember historically there was sort of a desire for some exclusivity from Macy\u2019s versus Kohl\u2019s and Penney and Kohl\u2019s versus Penney, and it sounds like ARROW and IZOD are sort of broadening distribution and maybe being less exclusive. Can you just sort of walk me through what\u2019s changing there with your partners? Thanks.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I guess, there\u2019s a couple of questions there. On the Tommy AUR, we\u2019ve experienced AURs improvement in Tommy and Calvin really starting in the last year, so we have already anniversary some of that. Last year\u2019s AUR increases first half of the year were close to 4% or 5%, that was in spring and summer, we moved to fall holiday, it kind of went to high single-digits and now we\u2019re seeing about a 10% increase. I think I guess driven by a couple of things and we\u2019re looking at like-to-like products, so mix plays into this. So, it\u2019s not just everything. It\u2019s not just that overall everything is 10%.","But when we like-to-like product, we\u2019re seeing 10% out the door retail increases. So, it really is being driven by combination of a couple of things, AUR is the key component. It\u2019s not quite as the percentage that you described, but it\u2019s probably 50% of the increase is being driven by AUR and 50% of the increase is being driven by units conversion some of the other metrics at retail.","On the exclusivity question for some of our Heritage brands, first, let me take it in pieces. ARROW is the basically a Kohl\u2019s, JCPenney brand. It\u2019s not at Macy\u2019s at all. The IZOD brand is that JCPenney, it\u2019s historically always been a JCPenney, it\u2019s been there since our acquisition back in 1993. It is always been the halo brand for JCPenney and I think what hurt that business is when American Living went into that business and attempted to be the halo brand and then couldn\u2019t transact at the prices that IZOD transact having and we\u2019re selling at, in our reality 50% below the IZOD price point. And that basically to the big piece of that business, that business began to shrink.","With new management team at JCPenney, they\u2019ve really taken a different focus, taking the American Living brand out of Penney\u2019s and they\u2019re really focusing on IZOD as the halo preppy traditional brand at the store. For Macy\u2019s, we\u2019re a main floor of brand. We compete with Levis and some of their private labels; so it\u2019s a somewhat different strategy at Macy\u2019s it\u2019s more of a category business as opposed to a lifestyle business.","And it\u2019s based on historical performance Macy\u2019s has continued to have the IZOD business on the men\u2019s side of the floor in a big way, where Penney\u2019s is at it across multiple categories. So that\u2019s the best, I can give you a sense of it, and we believe that distribution will continue, because the brand works within the strategies of both of those retailers.","Robert F. Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","No, that\u2019s really helpful. And just really quickly meaning, so lot of your confidence in the turnaround in Heritages, it sounds like you\u2019re picking up the American Living business in your fall shipments into JCPenney. So I assume JCPenney is going to be on a year-over-year basis are strong as Heritage wholesale customer in the back half, is that right?","Emanuel Chirico","No. Macy\u2019s will still be larger than JCPenney, overall the Macy\u2019s and the IZOD business. The IZOD business will be a strong business at Penney\u2019s and it will grow as it performs and gets to a certain level. The improvement in Heritage is all about gross margin, and it\u2019s all about the significant clearance and promotional activity that we are on the third and fourth quarter of last year. Our margins in the third and fourth quarter combined were also down between 400 and 500 basis points. We are anticipating getting half of that back. We could do better than that and we\u2019re in a strong position to really do that. So it\u2019s much more margin that itself.","Robert F. Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks so much, Manny.","Emanuel Chirico","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Now, we\u2019ll go next to Jeff Klinefelter with Piper Jaffray.","Jeff P. Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Manny, I was just curious if you could share a little bit of perspective on comparing contrasting maybe the Calvin Klein business in Europe, the Tommy business in Europe. I mean clearly, there are more challenges in the apparel side for the Warnaco Calvin Klein business. And do you see that as the regional, more exposure to the South, are there issues in pricing, product maybe just a little bit more context around that; given the relative outperformance for Tommy? And then also that very strong op income growth in Tommy in the first quarter, and your success in driving marketing dollars to that brand, maybe a little bit more color on what your expectations are for profitability in Tommy for the year?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure, I guess, I\u2019m going to give the second part of that question to Mike. I\u2019ll deal with the first part about the comparison between Calvin Europe and Tommy Europe. I think you hit on one of the key factors, one of the key factors is the strength of the Calvin business, has historically been Southern Europe, where the Tommy business Southern Europe, Spain and Italy represent probably 20%, 25% of the business, where represents 65% of the Calvin business.","So I think how the brands developed, Tommy is much more geographically balanced than Calvin particularly on the apparel side of the equation. And I think the real issue we\u2019re having in Calvin in Europe, if you really focus on product category is really on the apparel side, and it really is the sportswear and bridge apparel which hasn\u2019t been successful, since its launch. And the jeans business, which Warnaco talked about in great length and I\u2019m not going to speak for them, but clearly they are putting initiatives in place.","The nearest some of our design focused how they are focused on design, how they centralizing it, at the same time trying to localize it to get a benefit out of that, we report all those initiatives. We think they\u2019ll start to pay dividends in 2013, probably not going to really be able to see that much in the business this year given lead times and cycles.","So I think, those are really some of the key drivers that are going on, we\u2019d like to see better presentation of products and we\u2019d like to see a better product offering, but I think the regional focus on the Calvin business versus the Tommy business is the biggest change. And then I will just I make Mike put a little bit of color on the Tommy profitability for the balance of the year.","Mike Shaffer","Jeff Manny really talked about it, but just in general, operating margins for the first quarter were slightly down about a 125 basis points. As we look to the second quarter they are flat and for the year they are up a 100 up about 60 to 70 basis points. So obviously the bulk of our improvement for the company is coming in the second half of the year as we\u2019ve talked about and driving that in particular our gross margin and costs. So as we look to Tommy, they will also have a significant improvement in the second half due to that product, the cost of product decreases and the gross margin improvements.","Emanuel Chirico","And I guess Jeff if you\u2019re asking when we see the Tommy business, I guess, we see the Tommy profitability somewhere between 12.5% and 13% operating margins for the year and then directionally looking out we really think those operating margins start to move between 13% to 14%, 13% and beyond. So I think just getting that cost dynamic back in balance and taking advantage of the growth that we\u2019re seeing and leveraging SG&A line, I think it will drive the overall profitability.","Jeff P. Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","Okay, thank you, that\u2019s helpful Manny. One of the follow-up on the Tommy business, given this kind of unprecedented volatility and as you said kind of headline risk to confidence. What is your management team, the Tommy management team in particular, any changes and how they are kind of approaching the wholesale customers, they\u2019re utilizing systems to maintain visibility into the booking profile. Just curious how these management teams are attempting to deal with this uncertainty?","Emanuel Chirico","I guess a couple of things on the, I think as we\u2019re constantly investing on supply chain and focusing on getting good data from our retails both in North America and Internationally, I think that continues. I think those things are ongoing, but I think it\u2019s also how you manage the business intuitively. I think when we were in a cycle where the brand was growing and had an order book that was flowing at 12% to 15% increases, and feeling that there was so much momentum in the business, we were being more aggressive on our inventory buys and really feeding it.","So if you have an order book that was the 100, you might be buying a 110% of that inventory with a strong belief that you\u2019d be able to sell in season and really manage the business. In an environment we\u2019re in now, I think we\u2019re very cautious about that. So we have orders that are a 100 again. I think we\u2019re buying something close to 98 right now, and really not the risk reward is just not there to go chasing business that may or may not materialize, and if it doesn\u2019t materialize, you could be left with inventory that really could create risk for you.","So we have the visibility in that, European wholesale business is much greater than the U.S. visibility just by the nature of how retail has done there, or is it given, or is stick or you don\u2019t have the cancellation issues that you do in the United States, it\u2019s just more easily manage business from that perspective.","And given that visibility, we are being very cautious on the inventory buy not to get ourselves in trouble on with excess inventory at the end of the season. So just the mindset about how to manage that inventory going forward.","Jeff P. Klinefelter \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","Thank you very much. It\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Weiner at Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, everyone. Can you hear me okay.","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, I can.","David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Okay, perfect, thanks. So, just I was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of an update on your plans in China. You did go through some of the numbers in Asia for the quarter, but I mean, I guess any update there in terms of how you\u2019re planning for that business for the back half of the year and into 2013?","Mike Shaffer","I guess, on the Calvin Klein China business\u2026","David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Mike Shaffer","The business is, it continues to be very strong, continue to make investments in square footage there, strong jeans and underwear business are very strong. CK Bridge business, and strong accessories fragrance business as well. So, really haven\u2019t seen anything to slow us down in China from a royalty point of view on Calvin.","On Tommy businesses is significantly smaller than the overall Calvin brand and, but it\u2019s growing dramatically. We\u2019re really now operating, we\u2019ve been operating the business as a joint venture for about nine months now. And for the first time, I think we\u2019re actually breaking out the joint venture income and you\u2019d be able to track that as we go forward.","So that business is very healthy. We\u2019re seeing 15% to 20% kind of growth in that business that we we\u2019re projecting for the year, it\u2019s actually stronger than that, haven\u2019t slowed it through yet. We continue to, just to remind everyone, we continue to collect royalties like a normal licensing relationship and then we owned 45% of the China business.","So that growth continues to happen and it\u2019s a franchise distributor model, we\u2019ll operate some, the joint venture will operate some owned flagship stores, basically selling more of a wholesale model into partners, and it seems like a very good model for us and its off to a very strong start, and the infrastructure is being built, the investments are being made and that\u2019s all included in joint venture income that you see reported in our numbers.","David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","On the Tommy side in China, is the product, I mean are there any major differences and kind of how the product looks there like for local pay some things like that are pretty similar to what you\u2019d see kind of otherwise in other countries?","Emanuel Chirico","","I think if you go to everyone of our key markets, there is always localization from a merchandising point of view that takes place sizing and all the issues that go on with that. So clearly that goes on local purchases will go on for a percentage of business. But if you walk into those stores, and if we are doing our job right, I think we are right now, do going to those stores, those stores should look very much like our European stores.","David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Emanuel Chirico","We\u2019re position at premium level there and there should be a consistency globally how the Tommy brand is positioned. So localization from a merchandising point of view, but the brand DNA stands always as a key focus point. So\u2026","David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, that\u2019s very helpful.","Emanuel Chirico","We\u2019re executing, really well against that.","David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great and just a last question. How many stores roughly do you have in China, or run in China?","Emanuel Chirico","","I think, operated directly a handful.","David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Emanuel Chirico","The point of sale, I think right now we are just under a 100, somewhere in that area.","David Weiner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right, okay. Perfect, thanks very much.","Operator","We will go next to Carla Casella at JPMorgan.","Carla Casella \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hi, I was wondering if you could talk a bit more on the jeans business on the weakness. Is it that you\u2019re losing distribution or losing share or do you think we could be seeing a slowdown in the denim cycle?","Emanuel Chirico","Carl, I think on the specificity on some of the Calvin Klein Jeans business. I think some of these questions should just go to Warnaco. And I think they\u2019ve been raised ad nauseum with them, so I\u2019ll defer on that side. I will say that the jean side, we\u2019ve been in a 12-month jeans cycle that has been tough, but we\u2019re now starting to anniversary that and we are starting to see growth in North America on the jean side of the business.","And we are starting internationally where we should start to see some growth in that business as well, a lot of initiatives going on, on the Calvin side with color denim and I think a lot of those have been worked very well. But at this point especially for spring, there is still too smaller piece of the overall jeans business to change the direction of what\u2019s going on there. So I can\u2019t get much more color than that, that you really need to speak to Warnaco.","Carla Casella \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that\u2019s great. Then one follow-up on the acquisition front, can you just talk about your views of either diversifying into more women\u2019s to balance the assortment more or would you prefer on the acquisition front to look at men\u2019s business and how important is an international component when you\u2019re looking at acquisition opportunities?","Emanuel Chirico","I think, look, at this point in time, it\u2019s less about women\u2019s and it\u2019s more about whatever we decided to get involved in strength of the brand. Our choice would be a brand that is both men\u2019s and women\u2019s focused. Our choice would be depending on the expertise that comes with the brand and a potential acquisition, it will be determination whether we run a woman\u2019s business ourselves or license it out as Tommy business, because of the in-house expertise that we have and how it\u2019s been developed, we directly operate most of the woman\u2019s businesses we\u2019re in.","On the Calvin side, where it\u2019s been where the brand has grown from a licensing model, we obviously operate we don\u2019t operate in any of those business and use licensing model. So I think it will depend on the circumstances from that point of view.","Our first choice from an acquisition component, we\u2019d be continue to do more Calvin and more Tommy and grow those franchises either by product categories like we are doing in Europe with the sportswear businesses there, and what we are doing with Tommy taking back tailored clothing, dress shirts and neckwear in Europe and Asia to run those in-house directly till 2013, those are 2013, 2014 initiatives. But, clearly they will be big growth drivers for us as we go forward. So I think that would be our first priority more Calvin and more Tommy.","Carla Casella \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Kernan at Cowen.","John D. Kernan \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Hi guys thanks for squeezing me in and taking my question. I went back in September of 2010 your Analyst Day in Amsterdam for Tommy Hilfiger, you laid out some pretty ambitious door growth plans both in the wholesale side of things and the own retail. Where are we in that cycle? What type of door growth I guess year-over-year in each of those businesses that we are looking at going forward?","Mike Shaffer","","Okay I guess based on anything that we presented in September 2010; we are dramatically ahead of plans. We clearly opened internationally significantly more retail stores and flagship stores reopened the Lord\u2019s, London store; Tokyo, second in Osaka, we\u2019ve opened a new store in Paris on Champs-Elysees, a new Hamburg store in Germany. So just those are just the examples of not only opening stores, but also opening stores at a profitable and at the same time significantly brand enhancing, giving the global feel.","Our plan, I guess from a store opening point of view, globally for the Tommy brand is probably owned and operated stores to add between 50 and 60 stores a year in North America, and the rest of the world. And then probably another 25 to 30 franchise partner stores around the world.","For Calvin, we are adding in excess of 150,000 square feet a year. We probably will add in excess of a 100 stores doors internationally with significant focus on Asia, China being the biggest market there, but also Korea with our sportswear, with our CK business. And then Southeast, South America, Latin America, Brazil being a real focal point, continuing to open square footage throughout Latin America. So that gives you a sense of the two big brands and the kind of growth we are looking for and clearly it\u2019s accelerated over the last two years.","John D. Kernan \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then the Tommy Hilfiger flagships in Japan that you announced, Tommy has been in Japan for a long time? What do you see in that market, what do you see the long-term potential there for Tommy?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, that business is about a $275 million business depending on currency bouncing around, but about a $275 million business, 10% operating margin business. The brand position there, we are really in an elevation mode for the last two years of continuing to try to lift the brand presentation. It became much more of a jeans plus Tommy, a little bit too urban brand for us in Japan, really the only market outside the states that really had that issue. And we have been really on a mission there, to upgrade our positioning there and really are focusing on the Tommy sportswear on men\u2019s and women\u2019s product as the anchor. And have opened as I said the flagship store in Tokyo, one in Osaka and continue to open full price stores, a lift of perception of the brand there.","We don\u2019t view in all of our growth models, we don\u2019t view Japan as a huge market. We believe that the brand could be twice its size, but our financial plans call for it to continue to grow in the low-single digit kind of range with the economy in Japan. But, clearly there is an opportunity if we breakthrough to really get some momentum and acceleration typical to what we see in the United States where we never would have planned double digit kind of growth and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been experiencing in the last 27 months.","John D. Kernan \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Okay great, thank you and good luck.","Emanuel Chirico","","Okay operator, we are supposed to be at another Investor Meeting. So we are going to take one more question and then end the call.","Operator","Okay. And next question comes from Christian Buss at Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you very much for squeezing me in. I was wondering if you could provide some perspective on the game plan and the timing for the Bridge business in Europe, an update there would be very helpful?","Emanuel Chirico","","Sure, we are still in a lot of discussions and a lot of planning with our retail partners. The plan right now is to launch with men\u2019s before 2013. We are working very closely with the key department stores account in our largest markets in Europe right now. So the plan is to launch in men\u2019s probably 12 months later to follow that with women\u2019s, it will be apparel and accessories.","And I think we\u2019ll have a lot more to talk about in the next three to six months, then we really put some flesh on it for you. We\u2019ve sized the market and it\u2019s just a guesstimate over the next five years that we really believe it\u2019s a $500 million business for us long-term men\u2019s and women\u2019s, sportswear, apparel and accessories there.","So I guess at this moment in time, that\u2019s about as far as I\u2019m willing to go with talking about the positioning of brand, how we\u2019re going to market it. We\u2019ll clearly give a lot of color and transparency on that as we get to the fall of this year. But be assured that start up costs are all accounted for, we had everything placed in our guidance in our budget and we feel confident about it that we have what we need and the resources both financial and people wise to really make this a success in Europe.","And with that we\u2019re going to end the today\u2019s call. We really appreciate your attention. We look forward to our second quarter call and I guess I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t Allen Sirkin.","Allen Sirkin is our President and Chief Operating Officer. I know all of you know him. Allen will officially be retiring on June 21, at our annual meeting. We will have some nice things to say about him then, but just with this group I know has had a lot of interaction with Allen, we all wish him all the good luck in the world in his new phase of his life and congratulations.","So with that thank you for your attention and we\u2019ll see you in August. Take care, bye, bye.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Joining me on the call this morning is Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. She'll be pinch-hitting for Mike Shaffer this morning, who is on a business trip. Ken Duane is also joining me, our CEO of our Heritage Brands, and responsible for all of our North American wholesale businesses.","We were quite pleased with our results for the third quarter. We beat our third quarter revenue and earnings guidance. We saw a strong outperformance against our projections in both our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses despite the overall promotional environment that we experienced in the quarter.","Let me start with the Tommy Hilfiger businesses. The Tommy business continued its strong performance during the quarter, posting a 10% revenue increase. Revenues in North America were up about 10%, driven by strong performance at both retail and wholesale. Our retail business showed a 3% comp store increase, while we grew square footage in the high single-digit range. Our wholesale business has posted strong double-digit sales increases. Internationally, revenues are up 11% for the quarter. Strong wholesale and retail revenue growth in Europe was partially offset by the continued weakness in our business in Japan. Our retail comp store sales in Europe posted a 4% increase in the quarter, while our European wholesale revenues recorded a double-digit revenue increase in the quarter.","Operating income for the Tommy Hilfiger business grew 6% in the quarter. The sales outperformance in our North America and Europe businesses was partially offset by the continued weak performance in Japan, coupled with gross margin pressure caused by a higher promotional selling environment in order to drive traffic.","Moving to our Heritage businesses. Sales and earnings for our wholesale Heritage businesses came in on plan for the third quarter. The performance in our retail Heritage businesses for the third quarter was disappointing. Comp store sales were minus 3% and were particularly weak in the Bass division, which we sold on the first day of the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Operating earnings were down in the quarter and were negatively impacted by increased markdowns and promotional markdowns in order to drive sales and keep inventories clean.","Moving to our Calvin Klein businesses. All of our Calvin Klein businesses exceeded our sales and earnings estimates in the quarter. We posted strong sales gains and higher-than-estimated operating income. By region, we saw the strongest results in South America, Asia and North America, while our European business continued to underperform. In our South America business, we had a very strong business, particularly in Brazil, where we continued to see sales growth of about 10%, driven by the performance of the Calvin Klein Jeans business. Comp store sales were up about 5% in the third quarter. Our order book for the fourth quarter is also running up about 10%. So there continues to be good momentum in Latin America. Asia, overall comps in our Asia business were up about 1% for the quarter. We saw strong sales in China and Southeast Asia, where comp sales were up about 5%. The only difficult market in Asia continues to be Korea, where comp store sales trends have improved somewhat running down minus 5% in the quarter.","As I said, our European Calvin Klein business continued to be under pressure, particularly the jeans component of that business. Comp store sales came in at minus 5% in Europe, and margins were impacted by markdowns in order to move through goods and position the business properly for the new spring deliveries that we have a lot of optimism about as we go forward. In North America, our Calvin business continued to perform strongly across all product categories with the exception of jeans. We have seen very strong performance in our wholesale men's sportswear and our men's and women's underwear businesses. In addition, our North American retail business posted a 3% comp store sales increase and higher operating margins due to better sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. The Calvin Klein Jeans business in North America, as well as Europe, continues to be the only difficult business within the Calvin Klein franchise. We have planned these businesses down mid-single digits and are anticipating a continued pressure on margin in order to move through goods. In the licensing area, ongoing royalty revenues were up 15% in the quarter due to the strength in our global handbags and accessory businesses, and our women's apparel businesses, which are operated by G-III in North America and Club 21 in Asia.","Let me speak a little bit about fourth quarter holiday sales trends. In the fourth quarter, our sales to date are on plan globally. In North America, we continue to see low-single-digit comp store increases with Tommy and Calvin, while our Heritage business continues to post mid-single-digit negative comps. Internationally, our Calvin businesses in Asia and Latin America continue the strong sales trends we saw in the third quarter, while our CK Europe business continues to underperform. The Tommy Hilfiger Europe comp store sales trends also continue at positive mid-single-digit rates. As we've previously mentioned to you, our Tommy Hilfiger European spring order book is projected to be up 1% for the spring 2014 season. The spring wholesale season begins to ship in December and that is all anticipated in our fourth quarter guidance. From a margin perspective, the global environment has been more promotional to date than last year's fourth quarter. We have been cautious with our projections and are planning for the promotional environment to continue throughout the fourth quarter.","Just to give you a quick update on the integration of the Warnaco businesses into PVH. We continue to review our plans and are on track with all our processes and conversions. Over the last 3 months, we have successfully converted a number of systems in North America, as well as Europe. We also made strong strides in our merchandise planning systems throughout Asia. There have been no surprises in this area since the last time we updated you, and we are very comfortable with our integration time line. We are also comfortable with our projected expense synergies, and they continue to be on track. From a people perspective, we have our senior management teams in place across the globe and have had some key hirings across the globe with the announcement of the new Calvin Klein President in both Europe and Asia.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Dana to quantify some of the fourth quarter trends.","Dana M. Perlman","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.","Revenues for the third quarter were $2.259 billion, a 38% increase or $616 million increase over the prior year. Driving our revenue increase over the prior year was the Warnaco acquisition, which accounted for approximately $503 million, our Tommy Hilfiger business, which increased $87 million or 10%, and the pre-acquisition Calvin Klein businesses, which increased $55 million or 19%. Overall, our pre-acquisition Heritage business was down to the prior year, as our ongoing wholesale businesses performed well for the quarter but was offset by a continued disappointing performance in our Bass and Izod retail businesses, in addition to the loss of sales from exiting the Izod women's wholesale business.","As a reminder, we sold the Bass business the first day of the fourth quarter. Versus our guidance, revenues were up as a result of strong performance in Calvin Klein North America, China and Brazil businesses, coupled with strong revenue growth in our Tommy Hilfiger North American and European wholesale businesses.","Our earnings per share for the third quarter was $2.30 as compared to our previous guidance of $2.25. Driving the earnings per share beat was a revenue increase which was slightly better than planned. Our revenues for 2013 are projected at $8.24 billion. Calvin Klein revenues are planned at approximately $2.79 billion. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at approximately $3.44 billion, up around 7% to the prior year. Our Heritage revenues are planned at about $2.01 billion. Year-over-year comparisons for our Calvin Klein and Heritage Brands revenue are significantly impacted by both the Warnaco acquisition, as well as the sale of Bass.","I wanted to put some color around our 2013 operating margins for the company and our individual businesses.","Operating margin for the year is expected to be approximately 11.8%, a 60-basis-points reduction to 2012. Driving this overall reduction is a switch from running a licensing model to direct operations for our Calvin Klein jeans and underwear businesses, combined with our expenses associated with rebuilding and investing in our acquired Warnaco businesses.","For the year, we're projecting our Calvin Klein operating margin to be approximately 15%; Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned at approximately 14%; and our Heritage Brands operating margin will be approximately 8%.","We are planning the full year tax rate at approximately 26%, and full year interest expense at approximately $190 million. For the fourth quarter, we're projecting revenues at approximately $2.08 billion, with earnings before interest and taxes in dollars planned to increase in excess of 15%, and earnings per share for the quarter of $1.40. When comparing to the prior year, earnings per share for the fourth quarter is impacted negatively by approximately $0.10 due to the loss of the 53rd week and the calendar shift associated with this lost week, coupled with a $0.10 decline due to an increase in the tax rate over the prior year. Lastly, we have raised our debt paydown estimate by approximately $50 million from our previous guidance to $450 million for the year.","And with that, I'll turn it over for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from David Glick from Buckingham.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Manny, just a follow-up on the Warnaco acquisition and the potential shareholder value creation from that deal. It sounds like it's very much on track from a systems and a people perspective, and making some progress on the product. Obviously, when you guys gave the 15% to 20% sort of forward-looking growth goals in terms of EPS, the environment was different than it is today. You made some references in your press release about investments in 2014, which you certainly had already planned to make. I don't know if there are any incremental investments. But I'm just wondering how you're thinking about 2014 relative to '13 as a sort of a transition year? Is there a point next year where you can start to make some progress and grow within that range, perhaps in the second half of the year? I just want to know how you're thinking about it today and whether that's changed at all.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure, thanks, Dave. I think you have to think about it in a couple of ways. On the investment spending side, or rebuilding the jeans and the underwear business, the infrastructure and people point of view, a lot of those expenses are going into the third -- those investment spending, hiring of people, is happening in the third and fourth quarter of this year and will continue into next year. So we're going to have to deal, with -- particularly in the first half of next year, with some of the annualization of that expense. We're also making investments from a shop and a presentation at retail point of view. The plan to do that is in coordination with the new product that's being shifting into 2014. So some of that expense starting a little bit in the fourth quarter of this year, really gearing up into the first half of next year and then annualizing as we go forward. So really trying to make those investments at retail. At the same time, we're going -- as we feel very good about the kind of sales reception that we've gotten with our wholesale customers both in North America and Europe, with our regular accounts in department stores, we're also cleaning up and rationalizing the off-price distribution that we've talked about that was just, it was just overweighted in both jeans and underwear. So bringing balance to that in North America, the United States, Canada and Mexico, doing the same in Europe to get that right, while we're growing the regular price business. So we're not seeing -- we're seeing some really strong increases in sales from a regular price point of view, but at the same time, we are reducing pretty profitable sales that are going into the off-price channel or the warehouse club channel. And then just to continue with some of the issues that 2014 is dealing with, we're dealing with the dilution impact of Bass, which will happen next year, it's worth about $0.15 a share, and the Tommy Hilfiger European spring order book, as I mentioned in my comments, is up about 1%. We expect the fall book to be stronger as the second half of the wholesale business in 2013 has shown some strength. So all that put into balance, I think, to amplify your question, is we're really seeing next year being a tale of 2 halves. We think the first half will continue to be an investment and transition point of view, integrating the Warnaco business. And we'll start to really see some more improvement in second half of the year, particularly with the new fall product in jeans and in underwear that is being presented to the market as we speak and goes on sale now into January, February. We'll have a better sense of how that order book shapes up when we discuss year-end results in March. So I think we are well positioned. The integration continues to move well. We still feel very strongly about how the growth will come together in the Calvin business long-term, into the second half of 2014 and beyond. But the first half of the year, I think, will put pressure on our earnings as we continue to make these investments to rightsize the business from a distribution point of view and also make the appropriate investments in the business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So can you talk -- there has been some management changes since the last time, your last conference call, Fred Gehring is stepping into a little bit of a new role. Can you talk about where the management stands today? It sounds like you feel like you're in pretty good shape, the roles of the key different leaders, and maybe also just if you could extrapolate and talk a little bit more about Fred's new role.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. Thanks, Omar. I think, just to clarify, first and foremost, Fred's role, and I'll talk about some of the other positions then. Fred will be working full-time throughout 2014. So his transition out of -- from CEO of the Tommy business and our European business and our International PVH business will really take place in the second half of next year, end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter is the kind of plan that we've talked about. But even when that occurs, he'll still be working full-time through 2014. The plan is that in -- beginning of 2015, he'll transition to a 50% role; become Chairman, really be available from a strategic planning point of view from the business both Tommy and in the overall PVH business, will continue to be a Director of the company and be Vice Chairman of -- become Vice Chairman of PVH. So still a very active role, still very much involved in the business and in developing the strategy, as we go forward. In the Tommy business, Daniel Grieder, who's been with us for over 10 years, has been with the Tommy Hilfiger brand, and has been the CEO in Europe operating the business for Tommy, both for Calvin and Tommy, will now move into the global role for Tommy Hilfiger worldwide. And I think that's just a natural transition that's been planned for, for a number of years. We've just tried to be as transparent about that transition as possible, but it's really been something that's been on the table for the last 3 years. And it was discussed as part of our acquisition plan that after 3 or 4 years that Fred would transition into more of a role as we go forward -- more of a strategic role and Daniel would step into the CEO role. So I don't think a transition could be better orchestrated than we've had there. We also announced that Tom Murry will be staying through the next 3 fiscal years, this year and the next 2, as CEO of Calvin Klein. And then he will, during that period of time, provide a transition as we go forward and will step into a chairmanship role for a period of time as the Chairman of Calvin Klein. So I think we have that key position covered as we go forward from a succession planning point of view. And then the 2 key positions that we really -- that we filled over the last couple of months have been the President of the Calvin Klein Europe business, which is Iris Epple, which is an internal promotion from our Tommy business. Iris has been with us for over 10 years. She's been a key player throughout the Tommy development, so we think she's a natural to step into the presidency role in Europe. And then Frank Cancelloni comes to us from the Lacoste group with 20 years of experience in Asia as the President of the Calvin Klein Asia group. So we think that positions us very well. So we feel really good about how we're positioned now, some of the key hires that are in place, and I think it is very much on plan, and we think it's really going to help our execution going forward.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's really a helpful explanation, Manny. And then if I could ask quickly on the -- your commentary about the tale of 2 halves for next year and the investments necessary to continue to position the Calvin Klein brand and the Warnaco integration. How much of this is functions and processes that were never in place, and then how much of this would you say is, you mentioned rightsizing the distribution, are there a lot of Calvin Klein stores that Warnaco opened that you need to get out of, things like that, of that nature?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, I think -- let me take the second one first. The first part is about distribution. We talked about it. In Europe and in North America, in those 2 markets, the jeans and underwear, the distribution was skewed above 50% into the off-price and club channel, and that just has to change. None of our other Calvin businesses are anywhere near those percentages, usually half at most in some of those markets. So our plan is over a couple of year period, to rightsize that. A combination of shrinking some of that distribution and, more importantly, growing the regular distribution of jeans throughout Europe and North America. And I think both of those are under way, that I'm very satisfied with what's going on. We've also, in Europe in particular, have targeted to close 15 to 20 stores. 15 will close by the end of 2013 and another 5 to 7 closing in 2014. Those are unprofitable doors that are really closing the end of this year into next year. So I think that will also be a positive as we go forward. As far as -- some of these investments are by choice -- our choice to do what's right for the business. And I would just say in the -- I guess I would describe it as in the zeal to deliver earnings growth, there were areas that just were under-invested from when Warnaco operated the businesses. Marketing being a key place and people the other place. And we just feel so strongly that these are the 2 largest apparel categories that we operate, jeans and underwear. And that the growth prospects are so strong here that to continue to starve them for talent and marketing dollars is a major mistake. So there, we're clearly making those investments. And when I say marketing dollars, it's not advertising in glossy magazines. This is at point of sale, this is investments in shops and presentation. This is investments in signage at point of sale, that we put up once a year when all of our competitors are doing at least 4x a year. It's about making the investments in people at the store level, merchandise coordinated with sales support. Those programs were eliminated for jeans and underwear, where we have significant programs in all of our sportswear businesses throughout Tommy and Calvin businesses that we operated directly. So reinstating those were critical, we feel, for the right presentation of the brand and in order to meet the competition head-on and to take back our market leadership position in jeans and to grow our market leadership position in underwear.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Christian Buss from Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are from a systems integration standpoint from the former Warnaco business? And any time line for any major changeovers would be helpful.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. North America will be completed in the -- Calvin Klein will be completed the end of the fourth quarter this year. The rest of the Heritage North American businesses will be completed by the first quarter of 2014. The European business is completely converted systemically, and all the processes and integrations will be completely consolidated by the end of the fourth quarter. The plan for Asia is to begin the transition country-by-country beginning in 2014. That should be completed by the first quarter of 2015. And then Latin America will follow second half of 2014, first half of 2015. So we feel pretty good about how all that is moving and don't see any major issues. The warehouse distribution in North America will be completed by, for Calvin, in the fourth quarter, and the first quarter of '14 for 2014 for Heritage in North America, and Europe is already complete.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And how are we feeling about the $100 million cost savings target or synergies target?","Emanuel Chirico","We are on track to what we said back 6 months ago, and there's been no change to that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just 2 questions for you, Manny. One, how are you feeling about inventory in the channel in Europe? I mean, it clearly is very promotional there, but it sounds like you guys have been actually converting with your European wholesale business up double-digits. Can you just speak a little bit more about what you're seeing there in the channel? And then just secondly, structurally, is there any reason, if you think about Tommy Hilfiger's International business, why the margins over time shouldn't be higher than North America? Could you just help us kind of think through some of different puts and takes there?","Emanuel Chirico","I think, Erinn, the -- let me take the last part first. On the margin question, European margins are slightly higher than the U.S. margins. What you see is the International margins, and that's being taken down probably almost 200 basis points or more, slightly more than that, by the business in Japan, which is just marginally profitable. So $250 million, $270 million business in Japan, marginally profitable, showing that the International segment of Tommy is slightly, I think, 50 basis points below. Don't hold me to that number, but obviously, you have it in front of you as you asked the question. So I think that's what's really driving the change. I think the International business should operate at a level that's comparable to the North America business. We really just -- we've surprised ourselves to some degree how strong North America has been and will -- and feel strongly that Europe will continue to be at that level as well, and moving the Japan business forward is key for us from that point of view. And I think the inventory and the channel at -- in Europe, let me take our inventory first. We're moving through it very quickly. As you can see from our comp store performance in our own stores, both regular price, the Internet, as well as our outlet business, we're moving through goods, so there will be no inventory hangover at the end of the year at the Tommy Hilfiger business or the Calvin Klein business. That business -- any issues in Calvin are clearly being moved out, and Tommy is just naturally selling through it as planned. In the channel, I think it's really a country-by-country story. And I guess I'll just fall back on I think the channel is very clean in Northern, Central Europe for the most part, and continues to be a challenge in Southern Europe, particularly Italy. We're starting to see some leveling off in Spain. And we are even hopeful that as we get into the second half of next year that we can -- we will see our wholesale business in Spain actually up positively. But the real challenge will continue to be Italy, which we don't see any real change in that consumer pattern. We continue to be very rigorous on our accounts and our payment terms, so we've been rationalizing down some of our account base as some of the smaller retailers were just concerned about getting paid, so that's put more pressure on the Italian business. So Italy continues to be a major problem for us and, I think, everyone going forward. But the rest of Europe, I think relatively speaking, I think moving through units, but probably with margin pressure, as people have hit the sales button this year, I think, as much as 4 to 6 weeks earlier than they had last year. I hope that's helpful.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That is. And just a follow-up on that, I mean, I think you alluded to this in the text. But I mean if the sell-through rates are pretty strong in Europe right now, your inventory, specifically yours, will be lean by the end of this year. That should be very favorable for building back into a stronger backlog as we think of fall for next year. Is that -- are we thinking about that correct?","Emanuel Chirico","Absolutely, I think that's really true. I mean, we pride ourselves in getting whatever inventory issues are behind us. And I think that's clearly the case here, and we really tried to move very quickly in Calvin to try and get that position, that inventory position, and work through some significant amount of aged inventory that was there. The Tommy business really hasn't experienced what I would call an inventory issue. It's just been a promotional environment that competitively been required to be -- to break price a little quicker than we had hoped, and that's put some pressure on margins. So I really don't think it's going to be a unit issue at all. As we get through spring, I think if selling continues the way we see it now, I think we'd be very well positioned coming out of this fiscal year and as we transition spring.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Kate McShane from Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the promotional environment domestically, especially around the holiday season. Are you seeing categories that are more promotional than others? And with the markdowns being greater year-over-year, how do you view the full-price sales business going forward after such a highly promotional season?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, I guess I would characterize the -- I talked about the promotional environment -- by category, specifically where we play, I would say the jeans category in general has been and continues to be one of the most promotional categories that we see, both in North America, and in Asia and in Europe as well. So I just think that category, from a fashion point of view, has had its pressures. I think we've talked about that in Asia, particularly in China, that denim has -- inventories have built up and everyone's moving through them. And I think some of our competitors have spoken about that. And I think it's -- that's the category that we see the most pressure under where we are. I think sportswear, men's generally is pretty good. I think when most retailers are talking about their businesses, the men's sportswear category is one that, both from a sales and a margin point of view, continues to perform. And we've seen it, particularly in the Calvin businesses and the Tommy business, that, that continues to be the shape. Dress furnishings, the margin pressure there has been less, given the type of category it's in, to replenishment. The sales trends have been good. I wouldn't say great, they've been good, but nothing that's been at all of an issue. And obviously, outerwear has been just very strong both as a category and as part of the collection sportswear business, given the weather patterns versus last year, that's been very positive. So just to put a little color on it. I think the real challenge at -- with the holiday season is been the calendar, to a degree, it's been the consumer patterns and just the choppiness, and in order to just drive sales at a level, I think everyone has had to be more promotional than originally planned. It doesn't make it a disaster at all, it's just putting more pressure on it. And the calendar, to be very honest, is just -- it's hard to read. Here we are 1.5 weeks past Thanksgiving, but closer to Christmas, with less shopping days, and we're expecting it to really build and to build late, and traffic's been up and down across the board. So it's been erratic, and that's been the hardest part of trying to plan the business.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Howard Tubin from RBC Capital Markets.","Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Manny, maybe just a follow-up on inventory. Your comment, does that apply to North American and the U.S. as well? Do you feel equally as good about your inventories, and inventory in the channel, in North America?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, very much so. It's -- I hope I was clear. Yes, very, very much, the inventories are clean. We've been very aggressive across the board moving through goods. And we've been aggressive on even from a promotion point of view in keeping moving. February 1, as we turn, we'll be very clean coming out of the year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dave Weiner from Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just 2 quick questions. One, Manny, a follow-up to a point you made earlier about a tale of 2 halves, incremental investments, particularly in the first half. I think you made a comment that, that will drive incremental, relative earnings pressure. I guess I wanted to just clarify, when you said earnings pressure, were you just saying relative to some positive run rate, like 15% [ph] down?","Emanuel Chirico","Look, we are not giving guidance. I'm saying the first half will be under pressure. I'm not saying at this point whether it will be plus or minus from where we were last year. But clearly, it will be a second half story, not a first half story. I just think it's premature to start getting into 2014 when we just can't get through, when we're still fighting our way through the holiday season in 2013. But I think, clearly, the first half of the year has got significant pressure ahead of us. So given the kind of investments we are making and the kind of pressure we're seeing in Europe on the wholesale channel. So I think that's where we are.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Jay Sole, on for Kimberly. The North American comps look solid in what's, obviously, has been a very tough environment. Can you talk about what categories and styles are working best for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I will -- let me -- if I could just categorize, I'm not at all downplaying that our strong comps, our strong comps, our comps in the third quarter, which were up 3% and 4%, were relatively good from the outside performance. But if you compare that to where we were in the first half of the year, we were riding much more in the high single-digit range, 8%, 9%. So as much as we've been on plan, it's still been a deceleration from what we saw early on in fiscal 2013. And it's come with more promotion than we would have liked, putting some pressure on margin. So -- and again, I think I really touched on it, I would say to you the categories that are really working well for us are men's sportswear across-the-board, both Tommy and Calvin, our outerwear businesses or anything that's really cold weather are very strong, in some ways we wish we had more. And the most difficult businesses we really are struggling with is our denim category, which is 15% to 20% of our business. So with all of those -- with those positives, are offsetting a pretty large negative comp in our denim business. And then obviously, not obviously, but accessories in our own stores just very, very strong as we go forward. Handbags, particularly in Calvin, continue to put up double-digit comp store increases.","Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then if I could just ask one other. What's driving the continued Calvin Klein strength in Asia and Brazil?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, look, I think there is the brand is just very, very well positioned in the market. It's always been a growth channel for us. Brazil is just -- I think the brand is very -- it resonates with that consumer. We're starting to expand the jean categories in 2014 to include more sportswear. And I think that's been a real positive in Latin America. In Asia, the growth vehicle has been really China, and as happy as we are with the business that we are comping positive, it's still a deceleration from where it was at the beginning of the year and where it was last year. So from that point of view, I think we feel good about it, but we would like to get back on to that higher growth rate, which was, instead of comping 4%, 5%, was comping closer to 9%, 10%. So again, we see the deceleration of the business as everyone has from that point of view.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, I guess that will wrap it up for the call. We appreciate you joining us. We wish you a very happy and healthy new year and Christmas as you go forward, and we look forward to speaking to you in March of 2014. A happy new year and healthy to everyone. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you, Dana. Good morning. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, and Ken Duane, who runs all of our wholesale businesses in the United States.","Just some general comments. We\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, which exceeded our expectations despite the difficult macroeconomic environment and the highly promotional retail market in the U.S. We grew 2015 annual earnings per share 15% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our long term growth targets. Our Calvin Klein business was the highlight as the investments we\u2019ve made over the last two years continue to generate solid results, and we saw strength across all regions where we operate. Our Tommy Hilfiger business also saw positive momentum in all of its international markets, highlighting the global power of the brand. Lastly, our heritage brands produced a notable improvement in overall profitability. ","I\u2019m going to get into the Tommy Hilfiger business a little bit. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger business for the quarter increased 5% on a constant currency basis. The performance was driven by our business in Europe, the brand\u2019s largest market, with European comp sales up 10% for the quarter and 8% for the year. We continued to gain market share from our peers in almost all markets throughout Europe. ","Our wholesale performance in Europe was also very strong in the fourth quarter and we expect that to continue in 2016. Our European spring\/summer 2016 wholesale order book is up 4% and we are planning our fall\/holiday 2016 wholesale sales also up about 4%. ","In the U.S. market, we were challenged with unseasonably warm weather and the further deterioration of traffic and consumer spending trends in our U.S. stores that are highly penetrated in international tourist locations. North America retail comps declined 7% in fourth quarter. The strong U.S. dollar continues to negatively impact international tourist spending throughout the United States.","Some marketing highlights for the brand. Rafael Nadal was signed as the brand ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger Underwear, Tommy Hilfiger Tailored, and the Tommy Hilfiger Bold fragrance. Beginning with the fall 2015 marketing campaign focusing on these categories that we see significant growth in, the launch of the Nadal partnership was accompanied by a global multimedia advertising campaign in over 40 countries, campaign video that went viral and was one of the top 10 videos on Google for the launch period. The campaign had over 500 million impressions during the second half of \u201915 and helped full-price sales of underwear nearly double in Europe and in the U.S. during the second half as well.","We also took strategic steps to strengthen the Tommy Hilfiger women\u2019s business globally during the quarter. We signed supermodel and millennial icon Gigi Hadid as the global brand ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger women\u2019s collection beginning in the fall of 2016. Gigi will also be collaborating with Tommy on a capsule collection which will be distributed globally with key retail partners and on our own ecommerce site. ","In February, we announced our new licensing agreement with G3 apparel to design, produce and distribute the brand\u2019s women\u2019s wear collection in the U.S. and Canada, beginning with the holiday 2016 season. We believe that G3\u2019s expertise in the women\u2019s wear business can significantly enhance our women\u2019s presence in the U.S., and I feel that over the next five years they can build a Tommy Hilfiger women\u2019s business in the U.S. to well over a billion dollars, which is what they have done with our Calvin Klein women\u2019s wear business over the last five years. ","We also announced in February that we will be buying back the remaining 55% interest in our joint venture in China that we did not already own. The business has experienced strong momentum over the last several years with brand awareness doubling and our retail footprint more than tripling over the last five years. Since 2012, the first full year of operations after the joint venture was acquired, the Tommy Hilfiger China business has more than doubled from approximately $70 million in revenue to a little bit more than $140 million in revenues for 2015. We have over 350 stores, of which 65 are directly operated by the JV.","Moving to Calvin Klein, overall we continue to see great momentum with the Calvin Klein brand and our business more broadly. Revenue in the Calvin Klein business for the quarter increased 21% on a constant currency basis, with international comps up 6% while North America posted a 4% increase. Earnings on a constant currency basis increased 31%, reflecting the strong top line growth with continued gross margin improvement in both Europe and Asia. North America posted a 20% revenue growth on a constant currency basis for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year despite the challenging market conditions in the U.S. At wholesale, we saw healthy top line performance driven by the continued outperformance of our underwear category. ","As we look at our U.S. jeans turnaround, we saw solid performance in the first half of the year as we had previously discussed with you, but as we moved into the fall\/holiday season, as a result of the overall U.S. retail landscape, we experienced a softness in business at our department store customers, but we did see strong performance through our new retail partners, Urban Outfitters and Amazon in the U.S. Additionally, our U.S. retail business posted healthy performance despite the market headwinds that were experienced with comp stores up for the full year about 2%. As we move into the first quarter, the strong wholesale sales trends have continued. ","Our Calvin Klein international business also posted strong performance with sales growing 21% for the quarter and 11% for the year on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein Europe saw a significant turnaround in the overall business with operating profits moving to mid single digits for the year. We saw an improvement across all categories, including jeans, accessories, as well as underwear, and we continue to see Europe as a major growth opportunity for the brand. ","We\u2019ve seen an acceleration in the Europe business as our improved product, marketing and retail execution is paying off. We are seeing outperformance against our plan across both genders, with women\u2019s outperforming men\u2019s. Our best performing markets in Europe are Spain, the U.K., Germany and Italy. Overall for Calvin Klein Europe, our summer\/spring order book for CK is up mid teens, and fall\/holiday is also planned up about mid-teens. We continue to see increasing consumer acceptance and strong retail performance at our wholesale accounts in almost European markets.","Moving to Asia, Calvin Klein continued to expand its presence in Asia, which is the most significant opportunity for long-term expansion. Strong performance in China with comps up high single digits for the quarter building on strong performance for the entire year. We also launched directly operated ecommerce platforms in China, Hong Kong and Macau. We experienced strong performance in Southeast Asia and are aggressively opening travel retail stores, which are an important brand building and profit growth opportunity for the business. Hong Kong and Korea continue to be our softest markets in Asia, but we have strategies in place in order to move that business forward and drive the brand in 2016 and beyond.","From a market perspective, we drove brand relevance with strong campaigns and strong digital advertising campaigns as well. Our marketing focus has been on lifestyle advertising in order to encourage cross-category shopping leveraging through the hashtag, My Calvins, to connect with consumers. The brand has had over 20 million consumer engagements across its own social media channels during 2015. We have significantly increased our distribution to youth-minded shoppers through our expanded global distribution at Urban Outfitters, Opening Ceremony, mytheresa, Amazon, Zalando, and TMall. ","From a product category perspective, Calvin Klein underwear has had a great quarter and year driven by our investments in marketing, product, and in technology. We focused on faster replenishment and better in-stock levels in order to meet the strong consumer demand. Our men\u2019s division grew its market share and continued to hold the number one market position across U.S. department stores. Women\u2019s also posted stellar results with a 20% year-over-year increase driven by new specialty store and ecommerce distribution, growth in panties and our focus on better bra fits, as well as the exceptional response to our modern cotton assortment, which is a casual alternative to our core lingerie business. Importantly, our modern product line is increasing our engagement with a younger consumer, which we believe will create loyalty over the long term as the younger consumer graduates in the future to our more elevated product categories and our more elevated product offerings. ","We have also seen strong improvement in our Calvin Klein jeans business with a continued investment in product, which has been evidenced across all of our international markets through their strong growth. We are increasingly focused on key initiatives to drive this business forward, including investing in supply chain across all of our denim efforts globally. We\u2019re also investing in capsule collections and the ability to respond faster to the consumer demands.","Moving to our heritage business, revenue in the heritage business for the quarter decreased 10% from $447 million in the prior quarter. We saw a double digit increase in earnings as we discontinued our Izod retail business during the year, as well as a number of underperforming product lines in our dress furnishing business that did not meet our profit goals. In dress shirts, we launched the Van Heusen flex collar featuring an expandable collar, and given its initial success we are taking this technology and moving it across a number of our other brands in 2016. Our Izod shops at Kohl\u2019s continue to post very strong performance following their 2014 fall\/holiday launch last year. Warner\u2019s and Olga improved market share positions for bras in the U.S., both in the chain and department store channels with both brands significantly increasing their market share. During 2015, the Warner\u2019s No Side Effects bra drove significant performance improvement as its television commercial effectively communicated its key [indiscernible] features and led to significant conversion at point of sale. Our Speedo division continued to post healthy performance during 2015 and we see a significant opportunity for the Speedo brand in 2016 with the Summer Olympics, which we believe we can commercialize with our key retail partners as we move forward. Van Heusen also had a solid year with comparable store sales growing 8% in the quarter and 10% for the year, and also exceeded all of our profit expectations. ","As we look forward into the first quarter and we look at the environment today by region, let me give you a little bit of a backdrop to what we\u2019re seeing. In Europe, our business continues to persevere through the volatility that is plaguing the region, especially the recent terror attacks in Belgium, Turkey and Paris. We continue to see strong comp store sales growth out of both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, with no signs of slow down. Comps for Tommy continue to perform in the high single digit range, and the Calvin Klein Europe business continues to comp low double digits. ","Moving to the U.S., as we\u2019ve come out of the highly promotional fourth quarter, industry-wide inventory levels are elevated across channels. We aggressively cleared inventory in the fourth quarter and are not aggressively promoting in the first quarter as we are managing gross margin rates against lower unit inventory levels at retail. As such, we are currently seeing comps down in the Calvin Klein business low single digits and down low double digits for the Tommy Hilfiger North America business. Our Van Heusen retail business is posting high single digit comp store growth.","At the same time, we are seeing higher gross margins across the board in the U.S. We continue to see the strong dollar\u2019s negative impact on our international tourist stores; however, we are seeing solid sales performance continue in our Canadian business.","Moving to Asia, China continues to demonstrate strong results similar to what we\u2019ve experienced in 2015; however, we were up against a shift in the Chinese New Year relative to our first quarter last year. We are expecting the weakness to continue in Korea and Hong Kong driven more by the broader macro environment in large part due to the lack of mainland Chinese tourist spending in those markets. Overall, Asia comps here are trending down in the high single digit range due to the year-over-year compare against Chinese New Year. China continues to outperform the region and continues to outperform the rest of the world.","I guess as an overall backdrop, the global retail landscape continues to be uncertain with major foreign currencies largely weakening against the U.S. dollar. Global consumer spending patterns are volatile. The consumer is dealing with a tremendous amount of uncertainty and also dealing with geopolitical risk. Given this backdrop, we believe that we can successfully manage this challenging environment and have taken a prudent approach to our 2016 plan. We believe that our best-in-class brands and management teams will continue to manage through the volatility by leveraging our powerful brands and our operating platforms while not losing sight of our long-term vision and our ability to deliver double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the results.","Michael Shaffer","Thanks Manny. The comments I\u2019m about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I\u2019m going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2015 and then move on to 2016.","On a constant currency basis, revenues for the fourth quarter were up 7% versus the prior year and exceeded our guidance. Driving our revenue increase was our Calvin Klein business, which delivered a 21% constant currency increase over the prior year. Both our Calvin Klein North America and international businesses had revenue growth of over 20% in constant currency. The North America growth was driven by our wholesale underwear business and square footage expansion in our retail business, which included the conversion of the Izod retail stores to Calvin Klein accessory and underwear stores. Calvin Klein International growth was mostly driven by Europe and China.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 5% in constant currency, also exceeding our guidance, with strong revenue growth in our international business which had revenue up 8% in constant currency and Europe comps up 10%, with most markets showing increases. Our U.S. Tommy Hilfiger retail stores located in international tourist destinations continue to be under significant pressure from a lack of traffic and spending.","Our heritage business revenues were down 10% due to the continued rationalization of the heritage business, which included exiting the Izod retail business and several licensed product lines in our [indiscernible] business. Our heritage revenues were below our guidance due to shipments that were planned to go out at the end of \u201915 shifting into the first quarter of 2016. ","Our overall strong revenues drove an earnings per share beat for the company of $0.05 for the quarter versus our guidance, with favorable taxes and interest of about $0.03 being offset by further foreign exchange pressure of $0.03.","Moving to 2016, our 2016 earnings will be significantly impacted by foreign exchange in 2016 we are anticipating, based on current exchange rates that will be impacted negatively by about $1.60 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.60 impact is approximately 85% driven by transaction and 15% driven by translation. As a reminder, our exposure at a transactional level is mostly due to our international divisions purchasing their inventory in U.S. dollars. To partially protect against this, we buy foreign exchange hedge contracts about 12 months out for about 80% of our projected inventory purchases made by our international divisions in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the hedges we entered into during 2014 at more favorable exchange rates impacted our operations in 2015, while the hedges we entered into in 2015 during the strengthening U.S. dollar will negatively impact our operations in 2016. Our exposure at a translation level is simply due to converting the revenue and earnings of our international divisions into U.S. dollars. ","For the full year 2016, we are projecting earnings per share of $6.30 to $6.50. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.60, we have earnings per share growth of 12 to 15% over the prior year. Overall, we are projecting constant currency revenue to grow approximately 2% excluding the negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency. Overall operating margins are expected to increase approximately 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis. ","We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 6% on a constant currency basis, excluding a negative impact of 2% related to foreign currency. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase about 50 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 100 basis points on a reported basis. ","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis excluding a negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency with operating margins planned to increase about 50 basis points on a constant currency basis and to decrease approximately 175 basis points on a reported basis. ","Our heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 7% due mostly to the exiting of the Izod retail business and several licensed product lines in our dress shirt business. Operating margins in our heritage business are planned to increase about 50 basis points. The impact of currency on our heritage business is relatively immaterial.","Interest for the year is planned to be between $100 million and $125 million compared to the prior year amount of $113 million. As a reminder, an interest rate swap converting variable to fixed interest began in February of 2016 and is the reason for the increase. ","We currently expect to generate approximately $500 million of free cash flow in 2016, which we will use with existing cash on hand to fund the acquisition of the remaining 55% stake in our Tommy Hilfiger joint venture and to make similar debt pay downs and stock repurchases as we did in 2015. Our tax rate for the year is planned at about 20% and in line with the prior year.","First quarter earnings per share is planned at $1.40 to $1.45 and includes $0.50 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we are expecting earnings per share to increase 27% to 30% for the first quarter. Revenue in the first quarter is projected to increase 3% on a constant currency basis excluding the negative impact of 2% for foreign exchange.","Calvin Klein revenues are planned at a 12% constant currency increase, excluding the negative impact of 4% for foreign currency. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 2% constant currency increase, excluding the negative impact of 1% for foreign currency, with North America planned down mid-single digits due to continued weakness in our retail stores located in international tourist locations, while our international business is planned up high single digits due to its continued strength in Europe. ","Heritage brand revenues are projected to decrease 9% due mostly to our exiting of the Izod retail business and several licensed product lines in dress shirts.","Interest expense is projected to be about $28 million to $30 million and taxes to be 23% to 24% in the first quarter.","With that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","We\u2019ll go first to Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good morning. ","Emanuel Chirico","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Drbul","Manny, just a couple questions for you on some of your comments. I think the first one is in the first quarter now, and you\u2019re talking about lower inventory levels, less promotional environment, are you seeing your competitors act that way, and are the wholesale customers also sort of warming up to that type of approach as we look to this full year?","Emanuel Chirico","I think, Bob, in the first quarter we\u2019re not seeing that in the market environment, because they\u2019re still working through pretty heavy inventory levels that came out of the fourth quarter. I think as we turn into second and third quarter, I think you\u2019ll see a significant decline in inventory levels as retailers have really tried to contract their open to buy dollars for fall and holiday. They\u2019re being very aggressive focusing on inventory turns, and I think everyone is really trying to manage gross margin rates going forward and limit their markdown exposures. So I think you\u2019ll start to see that play out.","My point in my comments was I think we\u2019re a little bit ahead of the market. We really took the fourth quarter--you know, we had a good quarter and we really took advantage of clearing goods to get to the right inventory level, so we could start to see the gross margin improvement maybe earlier than you\u2019ll see in the overall market. ","Bob Drbul","Manny, as you think about the Tommy Hilfiger business and you look at U.S. trends, the announced relationship now with Tommy and G3, how do you separate sort of brand positioning in the U.S. versus tourism pressure on the Tommy Hilfiger business?","Emanuel Chirico","I think, as you know, we\u2019ve seen strong growth in what we characterize as our domestic store base, which is really 95% driven by the U.S. consumer - middle America, some of the large urban centers. We\u2019ve seen that business very strong. Where we\u2019ve seen a difficult business environment has been in the tourist destination stores - you know, the Orlandos, the Las Vegas, some of the California markets, New York, which had enjoyed a significant level of tourist spending from key markets like Brazil and South America, as well as the European markets. With currencies going the opposite way and the U.S. dollar continuing to strengthen, this has not been an attractive place to travel to and we\u2019ve seen that really impact our business, more directly on the Tommy business that has such a premium position globally - Europe, Asia and Latin America - that we\u2019ve really taken it on the chin on the Tommy business from a comp store performance. ","On the positive side, we\u2019ve also seen tremendous growth in our international business. European comps are double digits increases, and our Asian business, particularly in China, just continues to do exceedingly well. So I think we\u2019re trying to balance that out, manage inventories, and we understand the impact that\u2019s going on.","Bob Drbul","Just one last question, Manny, from me. On your relationship with Amazon, what have you learned so far? How are you approaching the business as we look forward?","Emanuel Chirico","You know, we see it as a real growth opportunity, but we\u2019re being very cautious as we move forward. We\u2019ve focused on key product lines and key product categories to grow the business. Obviously when you think of the underwear category, by its nature it tends to be a natural for the online business, and we see penetration not only growing with Amazon but in all of our department store accounts that that business just continues to drive. I think we\u2019re going to watch that business, manage inventory levels there with them. We are trying to really control the promotional agenda not only in department stores but also online. It\u2019s all interplayed, and I think we really are taking an omni-channel approach to all of the brands and really trying to not only grow the pure play business but really are focused on our key department stores accounts like Macy\u2019s, like Kohl\u2019s, like Nordstrom\u2019s where we\u2019ve really invested inventory and invested from a technology point of view our ability to respond to that business.","So we see it as a real growth vehicle for us going forward and we\u2019re really managing it cautiously from a promotional agenda. And I really focused on the U.S., but globally we\u2019re seeing similar trends in Europe that\u2019s growing very fast online, and in Asia we are really--on a small base, we\u2019re seeing very significant growth in the rate of sale, and we\u2019re doing it in a very profitable way.","Bob Drbul","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick","Thank you. A couple questions. Mike, starting with the margins for 2016 embedded in your guidance, you said down 100 basis points on a reported basis. Can you walk us through sort of the reported gross margin and SG&A, and how you get to that down 100? That would be the first question, thanks.","Michael Shaffer","Okay, so on a constant currency basis, operating margins are up 75 basis points. When you flip to a reported basis, we\u2019re down 100 basis points in operating margin. A couple things - one, FX, transactional FX headwinds are significant. We talked about $1.60 of pressure there, and that\u2019s a big piece of that take down, obviously. In addition when you look at the components, gross margins are up on a reported basis and on a constant currency basis. As we layer in the higher growth businesses for us in 2016, which is the China business for Tommy as well as the faster growing international businesses that have higher gross margins, our gross margins are up, operated and reported. With those higher gross margin businesses - China and the other international business, come a higher expense rate as well, so when you layer that in, our SG&A is up more than the gross margin on a reported basis, and that\u2019s what\u2019s taking the operating margins down on a reported basis.","David Glick","Okay, so the dollar growth in SG&A, up mid singles, is that a fair--?","Michael Shaffer","That\u2019s absolutely correct.","David Glick","Okay, all right. Secondly, I think there\u2019s some confusion about the FX. In early December, late November when you reported, you gave an estimate of $1.50 to $1.60. Since then, the euro is up about $0.065. Some of the other currencies which you have a lot of exposure to got worse, then they got better, so I\u2019m just wondering if you can kind of foot to the little bit higher FX pressure when I think investors were expecting somewhat lower.","Michael Shaffer","Okay, so I think you\u2019re going back to the last call, and I think we\u2019re in that range; but just to pull it apart a little, when we talk about FX impact for \u201916, it\u2019s predominantly transaction. Where FX rates are today impacts translation. Where the FX rate was when we bought our inventories impacts transaction. So when you look at where we were at the end of the third quarter and where rates were throughout the balance of the year when we placed our purchases, Canadian dollar was down significantly and the Mexican peso was down significantly, so the euro might have been in the range but the peso and the Canadian dollar took us to the high end of that range.","Emanuel Chirico","And those currencies only recently improved over the last two and a half weeks, so as you\u2019d say, David, it\u2019s just a very volatile situation when you look at those currencies, and making estimates in $1.50 to $1.60, and now we\u2019re saying $1.60, there\u2019s a lot of movement going on and a lot depends on when you place the orders for the goods and you place your hedges.","David Glick","So essentially what you\u2019re saying is that when you placed some purchases after your call, that negatively impacted--that timing negatively impacted the transactional FX slightly?","Michael Shaffer","Exactly.","David Glick","Okay, great. Just one or two more, if I could. In terms of your free cash flow, $500 million, how are you going to prioritize that in debt pay down versus potentially additional accretive acquisitions, and how do we think about the potential interest savings after 2016 if you do elect to use all that free cash flow to pay down debt?","Emanuel Chirico","I think our first priority are these strategic acquisitions, as we said, but I think when--our assumptions that are built into our projections assume that we\u2019ll have a similar debt pay down to what we had this year and assumes that we\u2019ll have a similar stock buyback to where we were this year as well. In addition, we\u2019ll use just our excess cash in order to make the China acquisition this year, as well as the cash that\u2019s on the China JV itself. So from that perspective, I think when you\u2019re doing your modeling, that\u2019s how you should look at it.","We continue to try to target a leverage ratio in the range of about 2.5 times, and I think we are on our way to get there.","David Glick","Okay. Last, if I could, any different view on the U.S. outlet business? It seems like we\u2019re probably at the peak of the toughest tourist compares. Would you expect those, based on the timing of the currency, the strengthening of the dollar in late \u201914 and the lag for when people buy their plane tickets, make their travel plans, et cetera, do think that this summer we should see an inflection point, and given a normalization in terms of clearance levels versus the competition and promotional activity, do you anticipate an improvement in your outlet trends after we get past the first quarter?","Emanuel Chirico","Short answer is yes. We are planning the business as we project it out to be challenged, more challenged in the first and second quarters of this year. We see the inflection point as sometime in July as we look at the business and how we trended last year versus how it\u2019s trending right now. You can imagine we\u2019ve got analyses, reams of analyses as we look at sales and what\u2019s going on with the consumer. So short answer is yes, more pressure on the first half of the year, and we expect that to subside in the second half. ","David Glick","Right, thank you. Good luck.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks. Good morning. First, with the momentum that you\u2019re seeing the Calvin Klein brand right now and the order book trends that you alluded to for the second half of the year, and I look at your guidance on a constant currency basis with Q1 being up 27% to 30% full year, just being 12 to 15, it does seem that there\u2019s a disconnect based on the strength of what you\u2019re seeing right now with how you\u2019ve implied the second half of the year. So could you just maybe walk through some of your key assumptions as we go throughout the year? It just seems that there\u2019s a pretty considerable level of conservatism.","Emanuel Chirico","Look, I think it\u2019s a really good question and there is a lot of momentum in the Calvin Klein business. It\u2019s also a very long year as we try to really lay out what I would describe as a prudent plan that we continue to invest in. When you think about the quarters, second half of 2015 really saw a substantial growth in the Calvin Klein business, so the comparisons get tougher in the second half of the year and we are assuming that we\u2019re just not going to be able to have the kind of double-digit growth that we experienced in the first and maybe into the second quarter of this year to continue into the second half of this year.","In addition, I\u2019d just remind everyone, in the U.S. open to buy dollars at retail for the second half of the year, major department stores have really shrunk those open to buy dollars. The challenge there is that they went into that season expecting comp store growth. We all know it didn\u2019t happen for a lot of reasons - the unseasonably warm weather, international tourism issues, but suffice to say that second half of the year was generally very tough. The assumption here is we\u2019re dealing with these compressed open to buy dollars and we\u2019re managing inventories tightly, so we\u2019re planning that second half level of sales growth much more cautiously as we go forward.","If the trends were to continue what they are now, we would chase that business and I think there\u2019d be a sales upside opportunity we don\u2019t have in our numbers, but I think it would be premature to call that out now.","Erinn Murphy","Got it. That\u2019s helpful, and fair enough. Just secondly, if we think about longer term on some of the margin opportunities with both Calvin Klein jeans as a category, as well as the underwear business, can you just kind of pencil out for us where those businesses are trending now from a margin perspective by category, and then where do you still see the longer term opportunity?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, I think when we talk about margins, I\u2019ll just give you some perspective. I\u2019m not going to lay it all out. The Calvin Klein underwear business is by its nature one of the highest margin businesses we have from a profitability point of view. Our underwear business in general is one of our highest operating margin businesses, so I would not anticipate significant margin expansion in those businesses but I would expect continued top line growth in those businesses which are margin-rich, so I think as they grow faster than the core, I think you\u2019ll see margins improve. ","On the jeans side, domestically there\u2019s significant opportunity to grow our operating margin. That business was the business that I\u2019d argue when we made the Warnaco acquisition was the most damaged. It\u2019s about a $300 million business, men\u2019s and women\u2019s, and I think we can continue to see margin expansion there. I think you should think about that we are in the low single digit kind of margin rates in jeans in North America, and there\u2019s no reason why that category as it expands and as we get better sell-throughs from the better investments that we\u2019re making in product and marketing, that that shouldn\u2019t be a 10% operating margin business. ","The last piece I would say is our European business from a margin point of view is clearly the biggest opportunity we have. That business has been the most impacted on the Calvin side by currency, and it\u2019s really transactional currencies; but despite that last year, we operated in the mid single digits. With the headwinds we\u2019re seeing this year transaction-wise, I\u2019d expect that business to continue into the mid single digits this year and then to start to expand to that 10% goal we talked about. So Europe, both from a top line basis for Calvin Klein and on an operating margin basis probably geographically holds the biggest opportunity for continued growth in profitability.","Erinn Murphy","That\u2019s very helpful. If I could just sneak one more in, can you help us think about the mechanics of the Tommy Hilfiger women\u2019s business as you\u2019re transitioning that to G3 this year? Are you guys just winding down kind of the product and the channel as they sit here and then they take over and start shipping that sportswear business in Q4 of this year? Just help us think about that dynamic as we start to model that out, and I\u2019m assuming from a P&L perspective in fiscal \u201918 for 2017, you\u2019ll start seeing an uptick in the royalty on that line. Just anything you can--","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, you captured it. What you\u2019ll basically see is this year is a bit of a transition year. I think the whole transaction net-net for us in 2016 will be a small negative, but on balance as we move into \u201917, I think you\u2019ll see it as a significant positive in that we basically will be taking a business that was marginally profitable, cover the overhead so we\u2019ll have to deal with that, and replace it with about--with a higher margin licensing business that you\u2019ll see growth in the licensing revenues associated with women\u2019s on an annual basis in that $18 million to $20 million range. So the trade-off there should be fairly positive for us as we go into \u201917.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thank you guys, and congrats on a good quarter.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Binetti with UBS Financial.","Michael Binetti","Hey, good morning guys. Let me add my congrats on a great quarter. I know it was tough out there. Just want to understand a couple things here. I think we talked about the Calvin guidance through the year, but the cadence on the Tommy guidance, I guess I don\u2019t understand what are the dynamics at Tommy to get to 3% growth, excluding currency, when the acquisition should add about two points, if my math is right, and the trends right now across the different businesses look pretty favorable. Would you mind helping me understand that a little bit?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, I think the biggest impact is we are planning the North American business retail down, and we\u2019re also losing a quarter wholesale sales of the women\u2019s business, which is about $25 million associated with the women\u2019s business that moves out, and then planning the retail business to continue high single digit negative comps for the first half of the year and then moderate in the second half of the year to low single digit negative comps. So more pressure on the Tommy Hilfiger North American retail business, which is the biggest component of our North America business.","Michael Binetti","Do I have the pieces upside down, though, because you\u2019re guiding it to plus-2 in the first quarter and then to accelerate to plus-3 for the year.","Michael Shaffer","The China piece is the big driver there.","Michael Binetti","Okay. I guess on China then, it seems like a strategic owner, long-term brand owner would be more incentivized for growth. Can you talk about what some of the immediate needs are for Tommy China, maybe as far as the investments you look at and how fast you think you can scale that business?","Emanuel Chirico","Yes, we will basically spend--we\u2019ll spend more on marketing than is currently being spent, but let me put it in perspective. The acquisition, even in a partial year, will be marginally accretive and then should be significantly more accretive in 2017. So our assumption is based on as the brand owner, we\u2019re making more of a marketing investment in the brand in China because we see the significant growth opportunity. It\u2019s $140 million business, highly profitable business that we think can grow long term over the next five to six years to somewhere in the vicinity of $300 million to $400 million. The Calvin Klein business today is approaching $300 million, to give you a sense of that, so we really see it there.","The other area is that in China, the Tommy Hilfiger business is really driven by men\u2019s sportswear. Women\u2019s is about 20 to 25% of the business, the balance is men\u2019s wear. so there\u2019s a huge men\u2019s wear opportunity and then when you think about our other categories that are just marginally represented there - denim, accessories, and tailored - we see filling out the full lifestyle for the Tommy Hilfiger brand in China similar to what we look like in Europe with the Tommy Hilfiger brand.","Michael Binetti","Okay. So if you wouldn\u2019t mind, Manny, I know you\u2019ve been getting a lot of near-term questions, so just as we think a little longer term, as you guys seem like you\u2019re on steadier footing with control over the P&L after the Warnaco acquisition and then some really unexpected FX issues here the last few years, as you take a breath here and think about strategy, how do you think about the priority between going after a few of the licenses that we\u2019ve talked about quarter to quarter that are low-hanging fruit for you guys to bring in, versus something more strategic like exploring a third big brand at some point?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, well first I would say from a strategic--not to play word games, but from a strategic point of view, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that\u2019s more strategic than to gain more control of the brands, both Calvin and Tommy, and layering those in. But I do understand what you\u2019re saying, is for a major impact it would be another global brand that we could add to the portfolio.","I think the way we\u2019re thinking about it right now, the focus will be on the incremental acquisitions that we\u2019ve talked about, continuing to bring those in, continuing to maximize what the opportunity is for Calvin and Tommy, and then as we turn 2016 into \u201917, opportunistically looking at what\u2019s out there in the world. As you know, we generate a tremendous amount of cash. We\u2019re not leveraged to any extent, given our strong balance sheet dynamics, so there is a significant amount of open to buy dollars that are there, and historically we\u2019ve been a significant acquirer of brands, be it Calvin, Tommy, Warnaco, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really going to change. But I think the timing in the next 12 months will be continuing to focus on the strategic licensing acquisitions.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot, and congrats again, guys.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Kernan with Cowen.","John Kernan","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a real nice quarter.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you.","John Kernan","So Manny, thinking longer term, I think there\u2019s a lot of investor concern about the apparel category in general. Clearly there were two disruptive factors over the past couple quarters, being FX and the warm weather, but as you look out at this category long term and when you look at the company\u2019s long term profitability profile, where do you think you can move the operating margin long term, and how sustainable is this 12 to 15% EPS [indiscernible] at the current top line run rates?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, let me start with the latter first. I think if you just took a step back and you look at--you really touched on it when you talked about the volatility, the market\u2019s been volatile, we\u2019ve had warm weather, we\u2019re dealing with a lot of issues caused by the geopolitical situation, but despite all of that - and I know from an investor point of view, it must be frustrating as it is for the management team - we\u2019ve grown our earnings on a constant currency basis about 15% over the last two years. So it\u2019s very frustrating over a two-year period looking at almost $3 of earnings per share that have gone against us on the currency line.","We see nothing that would stop us from continuing over least, let\u2019s use the next three years, that\u2019s how we do our strategic planning, that we couldn\u2019t continue to drive earnings per share growth at a double-digit rate, something between 12 and 16% continuing to drive it, given the dynamics that we see in the Calvin Klein business and the dynamics we see in the Tommy Hilfiger business. ","I think there is clearly an opportunity over time to regain the margin loss that has impacted us on an operating margin basis from the foreign currency impact, so when we look out, we think that there is somewhere in the neighborhood of another 100 to 200 basis points overall operating margin improvement in the business that we can build on as we move forward. If we get any kind of a tailwind from currencies, meaning that the dollar levels or starts to actually weaken somewhat long term against some of these currencies, as we get back to equilibrium around the world, that would clearly be a tailwind that would help us going forward and have the biggest impact on our operating margins as we go forward internationally.","So I hope that answers your question.","John Kernan","Yes, that\u2019s really helpful for our long-term models. Just one more follow-up on China for Hilfiger. Where do you see the potential sizing of this business and the long-term economics of the business? Historically, China\u2019s been a pretty high margin region for a lot of the western brands there, so I was just wondering what you think the economics of this Tommy Hilfiger China business looks like two to three years out. ","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, so look - I think you kind of answered the question yourself. Just the size of the business, we are thinking about a $500 million business over the next five years growing to, so that would be substantial growth. Margins, I think there\u2019s a combination of we will grow more balanced from a retail wholesale point of view. It\u2019s important to take control of your brand. I would say the current model that has been built is too franchisee dependent, so we will be bringing that business in-house. That\u2019s a lower margin business but still very healthy - very, very healthy, than just a pure wholesale franchise model business, but I think it\u2019s critical that you take ownership of your brand and how you present it, not only in Shanghai and Beijing but throughout the other Tier 1, Tier 2 cities throughout China. I think China should be our highest operating margin region in the world.","John Kernan","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. Best of luck.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks, good morning. Nice quarter, guys, especially given everything going on.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you.","Omar Saad","I wanted to ask--I noticed you grew SG&A dollars for the first time in a while, a few quarters at least. It sounds like you\u2019re going to grow SG&A spend again next year. What are the key areas you see, investment opportunities you see, and what\u2019s giving you the confidence there? It\u2019s certainly intriguing. I have a follow-up, too.","Emanuel Chirico","Well I think as Mike said, some of that is driven by the mix of business that we see, some of the international markets growing significantly faster. At the same time, we continue to make incremental investments in marketing, we continue to make the investments that are required in the digital space to drive ecommerce, both our own platforms as well as the pure play channels that we\u2019re dealing with, with some of the key players around the globe. It\u2019s a somewhat different model, so it really requires us to invest in those operating platforms and in people, but we think the returns long term are very high there as we move it forward. So that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing the spend - it\u2019s a combination of mix and then really investing, both systemically and technologically, and continuing to invest in the brands and products. ","Omar Saad","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful, Manny. You mentioned a couple times Urban Outfitters, Amazon\u2019s come up a couple times. I know you\u2019ve got a lot of digital and social media going on. I wanted to ask how you\u2019re thinking about channels of distribution longer term, bigger picture, especially North America, the two kind of traditional main channels for you guys - the wholesale and department stores and outlets have been very strong. I know they\u2019re obviously still important, but maybe there\u2019s some shifts going on in consumer behavior. Are you thinking differently about your points of distribution and the balance in the mix going forward?","Emanuel Chirico","I think you need--the short answer is absolutely the world is changing, and to be honest, it\u2019s changing faster than most of us would have anticipated. I think historically, you know, for the last 20 years we\u2019ve been a multi-channel distributor of product across different channels of distribution, so for us, this is another channel of distribution that needs to be managed and managed directly. I think the challenge is from a profitability point of view, short term the ecommerce profitability is lower than the brick-and-mortar opportunity, both wholesale and retail, but as that business scales, the profitability should level out and we should become agnostic to where we sell the goods moving forward.","But that will require over the next couple of years more investment in systems, more investments in technology and people in order to bring that to balance, while at the same time dealing with what in North America is a shrinking store pool. I mean, every major retailer is talking about some store closings, and I think we\u2019ll continue to see retail is pruning their store base 5% a year, and that\u2019s slow march I think is ahead of us for the next three to five years as we get balanced and they deal with, in their channels of distribution and their retail stores, their growing ecommerce platform and the need for less stores in order to connect with the consumers. ","Omar Saad","One last quick one, Manny. The $3 EPS from currency the last couple years, last year and this year, can you give us an update on the opportunity, if any, to recapture any of that lost earnings from pricing or other factors?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think over time--so I think there is three places that we are really focused on. We\u2019re focused on supply chain, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re making tremendous investments, looking at different sources of product, and that\u2019s a long-term opportunity to continue to improve our margin. Secondly, we\u2019re looking at, as you said, price increases, but you need to do that very thoughtfully. The idea of just raising prices to match your costs, it just doesn\u2019t work that way, that\u2019s not the real world. You have key price points, be it for core categories that are big and highly profitable and you need to manage that over time and have the consumer move with you, change your promotional agenda to a degree and try to get your average unit retails up. I think that\u2019s an opportunity as we go forward as well. ","The last piece is as we get equilibrium in the currency area, the real challenge that we had to face was that if you really look at what happened with currencies, the huge hit took place really in a compressed six to nine-month period of time. The euro was actually in, like, a three-month period of time that we saw a drop from the mid-$1.30 to somewhere around $1.10, and that drop happened so quickly to be able to usually blend it into your hedging strategy, react to it, there just wasn\u2019t time. The ability to raise prices all at once with the consumer that\u2019s feeling pressure wasn\u2019t there as well. So I think there is an ability to recapture that over time, and I would characterize it as against the 2016 margins and goals that we set, that there\u2019s 100 to 200 basis point opportunity in operating margins post-2016 as we move forward to improve operating margin.","Omar Saad","Thanks, Manny. Good luck.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. Last question, please?","Operator","Okay, we\u2019ll go to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning everyone, and congratulations. Manny, as you\u2019ve talked about brand acquisitions and license acquisitions, as you think about the landscape holistically, is there ever a time for brand dispositions or anything you\u2019d want to dispose of as you think of the portfolio?","Emanuel Chirico","You know, Dana, we\u2019re constantly looking at that. There are no plans, there\u2019s no discussions right now, so I don\u2019t want to start any rumors. But we are constantly looking at the portfolio, and either in the past two or three years we\u2019ve sold off divisions, we\u2019ve sold off [indiscernible], we\u2019ve closed divisions, we\u2019ve shut down the Izod retail business. We\u2019ve really consolidated a number of areas, and I think we\u2019re going to continue to do that. I don\u2019t see a dramatic move in the next 12, 18 months, something that would be a spinoff or whatever. Every time I look at those models, they sound good when you talk about them, until you sit down and actually try and execute those. They just don\u2019t make sense, especially when you have a healthy business like our heritage business that operating margins are improving, we\u2019re growing off significant cash flow. I don\u2019t know why we would walk away from that so quickly, so for me, I\u2019m still wedded to that business. I like the cash flow, I like the usually consistent earnings trends that go on in that business that we can count on as a balance to some of the fashion that we have going on in Calvin and Tommy. So no major plans.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, thank you everyone. I really appreciate the time. We\u2019ll see you in May for our first quarter earnings call, and have a great Easter holiday. Take care. Bye bye.","Operator","Again, that does conclude today\u2019s presentation.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. Joining me on the call are Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations; and Ken Duane, who runs our -- all of our wholesale businesses in New York and our Heritage businesses throughout North America, as well as all of our wholesale businesses throughout North America.","Just some general comments. We're very pleased with the first quarter results. We significantly beat our first quarter revenue and earnings guidance. We saw a strong outperformance against our projections in both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses, as well as in our Heritage wholesale businesses. We are going into the second quarter with a significant amount of momentum.","Let me start with the Tommy Hilfiger business to give you an overview. In the Tommy Hilfiger business, we continue to see strong performance during the quarter, posting a 5% revenue increase and a 15% operating income increase over the prior year. In North America, revenues were up 14%, driven by a 5% comp store increase at retail, square footage growth in our retail business and overall very strong performance in our wholesale businesses. We continue to see momentum in the North American business and strongly believe that the significant investments that we're making in product, in our stores, in-shop presentations and in our marketing program are paying huge dividends for us. Second quarter sales trends to date are strong. We've seen our retail sales comp performance accelerate, posting an 8% to 9% increase so far through the second quarter.","Moving to the International component of the Tommy business. Revenues were flat for the quarter. Revenue growth in Europe was offset by a continued weakness in our Japan business. Our retail comps in Europe posted a 4% increase. Looking at the second quarter sales trend in Europe, comps continue to run up, about 3% to 4%. We also see our fall and now our holiday sales bookings coming in at about a plus-10% growth over the prior year. Geographically, we continue to see strong growth in Central and Northern Europe, with particular strength in Germany, France and Russia, partially offset by softness in Southern Europe, which would be particularly Spain and Italy.","Moving to our Heritage businesses. Our wholesale Heritage businesses continued their strong performance. Sales came in ahead of our estimates, as strong spring selling resulted in our wholesale customers accelerating shipments into the first quarter. We also saw a strong performance in our newly acquired Speedo and Core Intimate business units.","Overall, first quarter operating margins dramatically improved to 12.8% for the wholesale Heritage businesses. This margin expansion resulted from a significant improvement in sportswear margins, driven by strong sell-throughs at retail and higher average unit selling prices. Second quarter sales trends have continued to be strong in May, and inventory levels are quite clean. We are well-positioned for a strong Father's Day and overall second quarter.","Our performance in our Heritage retail businesses was disappointing. Comp sales were minus 7% and were particularly weak in our Bass division. Second quarter sales trends continued to be soft, and we are not anticipating any significant improvement in this business until we get to the third quarter back-to-school selling season.","Moving to our Calvin Klein business. Our Calvin Klein businesses exceeded their sales and earnings estimates in the first quarter. We posted strong sales gains and higher-than-estimated operating margins, which were approaching 16.5%.","By region, we saw the strongest results in South America, Asia and North America. The South American business was very strong, particularly in Brazil, where we continued to see sales growth of about 10%, driven by the strong performance of Calvin -- the Calvin Klein Jeans business. The Brazilian business is principally a wholesale business. And as we look at our fall and holiday order book, that book is running up about 10% as well. So there's good momentum in this business as we go into the second quarter.","Asia, we saw very strong performance in China and Southeast Asia with comps were up about 5%. Wholesale sales also exceeded our projections, as our franchisee partners accelerated their shipments into the first quarter in order to meet consumer demand. The only difficult market in Asia continues to be Korea, where comp sales were running down about 10% in the first quarter. Second quarter sales trends have improved as new product has hit the floor -- sales floor in Korea, and May comp store sales for Korea improved to about down 5%.","Moving to North America. Our North America business continues to perform very strongly across-the-board in all product categories, with the exception of men's and women's jeans. We have seen very strong performance in our wholesale men's sportswear, and our men's and women's underwear businesses. In addition, our North American retail business posted a 4% comp store sales increase and higher operating margins due to better sell-throughs at higher average retail selling prices. The second quarter trends in these business continue to exceed our sales plans. And quarter-to-date, comps are up in the mid-single-digit range in our retail stores for Calvin Klein.","The Calvin Klein Jeans business in North America and Europe continues to be the only difficult business. We have planned these businesses down for the year, about in the mid to high single digit range, and they are performing at about that level. We continue to have initiatives in place to turn this business around. I'll talk about that a little bit more towards the end of my comments. And we're optimistic as we look at this business as we start to turn into spring 2014, as we start to see new product initiatives come through and start to make investments at the point of sale in North America and Europe to really improve our presentations with our key customers.","In the licensing area, ongoing royalty revenues were up about 4% in the quarter, due to strength in handbags and accessories and our women's apparel businesses, which are operated by G-III in North America and Club 21 in Asia.","Our fragrance royalties for the quarter -- first quarter were flat. This year, our key marketing initiatives are all second half weighted. We have a major women's fragrance launch planned for the fourth quarter. The fragrance is called Downtown and our celebrity talent is Rooney Mara. You'll be hearing a lot more about this launch in the third quarter. And as you would expect, there is a major marketing campaign around the fragrance launch, which will not only, we believe, help our overall fragrance business to continue to grow, but also help the overall Calvin Klein brand franchise.","Let me quickly give you a brief update on our integration of the Warnaco businesses into PVH. We've owned the business now for just about 4 months. We continue to validate our plans and are on track with all our processes and conversions. Over the next 3 months, we'll see some significant system conversions in North America and Europe. There have been no surprises in this area since the last time we updated you, and we are very comfortable with the timetable we have in place today for the integration of this business.","From a people perspective, we have our senior management in place across the globe. The final piece of this process was put in place early this month. We had a restructuring of our jeans design group from a centralized team based solely in New York to a more regionalized structure with centralized design direction from New York. This structure is consistent with the way we operate design for all of our other Calvin Klein product categories. We believe it is imperative to have design closer to the consumer, with regional design hubs based in Europe, Brazil, Hong Kong and New York that can quickly react to the trends that they see in the business and react to sales trends that they see both at wholesale and at retail.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify some of what I've said.","Michael A. Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.","Revenues for the first quarter were $1.94 billion or $40 million over our guidance and -- or 36% or more than $500 million greater than the prior year, driving our revenue beat was strong performance in Calvin Klein Asia and Brazil, where second quarter wholesale shipments were advanced to the first quarter, coupled with strong performance in our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger North America retail businesses. Comparing to last year, revenues were significantly impacted by the Warnaco acquisition.","Our earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.91, which was significantly higher than our previous guidance. Included in our first quarter earnings is $0.17 associated with favorable discrete tax items planned in the second quarter that were recorded in the first quarter. The first quarter earnings per share beat was also impacted by strong revenue and gross margin improvements in our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein North America retail businesses. In addition, our first quarter was favorably impacted by an acceleration of wholesale shipments into the first quarter that were planned in the second quarter, particularly in our newly acquired Calvin Klein International businesses.","At this point in time, we believe it's premature to adjust our full year earnings estimate. Given the short amount of time that has passed since the Warnaco acquisition and the complexity of the integration, we are maintaining our full year earnings per share guidance of $7, where the second half of the year will be heavily influenced by additional investments and expenses associated with rebuilding the Warnaco jeanswear and underwear businesses.","Our revenues for 2013 are projected at $8.2 billion. Calvin Klein revenues are planned at approximately $2.75 billion. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at about $3.4 billion, and Heritage revenues are planned to $2.05 billion. Year-over-year comparisons for Calvin Klein and Heritage Brand revenues are significantly impacted by the Warnaco acquisition, while Tommy Hilfiger is projected to grow approximately 6% despite the impact of a weaker yen.","I wanted to put some color to 2013 operating margins for the company and our businesses. Operating margins for the year is expected to be approximately 12%, a 40 basis point reduction to 2012. Driving this overall reduction is the switch from running a licensing model to direct operations for the Calvin Klein Jeans and underwear businesses, combined with our initiatives and the expenses associated with rebuilding and investing in the acquired Warnaco businesses.","For the year, we are projecting our Calvin Klein operating margins to be about 15.5%, Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned at about 14% and Heritage Brands operating margin at about 8%. We are planning the full year tax rate between 25.5% and 26.5% and full year interest expense at approximately $200 million.","For the second quarter, we are projecting revenues at about $1.9 billion and EPS to increase 5% over the prior year to $1.35. Operating margins for the second quarter is expected to be about 11%. Taxes for the second quarter are planned at 30% to 31%, with interest at approximately $50 million, while debt paydown remains at about $400 million.","Lastly, as Manny said, our integration plans are on track. Our synergies remain targeted at $100 million, and we're comfortable with that number. For this year, we're looking at $25 million, and we're looking to grow about $25 million per year thereafter.","And with that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Manny, I guess the first question that I have is on -- with these better-than-expected results, as you think about the $7 number that you have out there, would you accelerate further expenses into this year, or is there a point that you could let some of the better-than-expected quarter results flow higher?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure, Bob. I think as -- I don't think it's a question about accelerating expenses. I think we have the budgets built and they're all put in place. What it's really focused on is the comfort level we get as we're operating this brand-new business and understanding the seasonality of that business a little bit better and getting the confidence at this point that we could start to roll through some of the beat. I think we have to be honest with ourselves. When we look at how we estimated the first quarter, it was clear to us we were being very conservative in that estimation and dramatically beat it. So there -- I think a fair amount of the beat or a good portion of the beat was timing. But there's no denying the fact that as the -- as our wholesale customers are pulling goods forward, that, that's positive, hopefully, from a sales trend point of view as we start to get the orders to come through for fall and holiday, that we could see some permanent improvement in the sales trends that stick with us. And secondly, obviously, getting the goods on the floor earlier can only help your gross margins, getting more regular price selling. So all those things are very positive and make us -- give us greater confidence today than perhaps 2 months ago when we announced the fourth quarter results. So I think we're on a good trend, and we just want to see some more visibility as we go forward, and we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves with our guidance. The last point I'd make is -- and I've made this point consistently for the last 2 or 3 months, is 2013, as we look at it, is a true transition year. We've got a major acquisition that we're getting onboard and the fact that -- speaking frankly, the fact that we make an extra $0.10 or $0.20 a share is not as important as that we are well-positioned for 2014 to really get back to our normal growth rates of 15% to 20% for the next 3 years. And that's important for us as we go forward. So I think that's how we'd look at the guidance. We think we're being prudent. And obviously, as we get through the second quarter and get better visibility, we'll try to be as transparent as possible about it.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great, Manny. Just 2 questions in -- 2 more questions. In the back of the year, what are the big expenses that you will be incurring, especially around the Warnaco piece? And it sounds like you filled the open positions that you had within the Warnaco business. Can you give us some more detail in terms of who you hired on those key positions that were open when you completed the acquisition?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. Look, I think a couple of things is, the investments continue to be in the areas where we laid out in great detail a couple of months ago. It's into people, it's in product, it's in the design area, continue to build in -- and that is, in really putting the goods in product and in presentation, both our own stores and in -- both in our own stores and in our key department store accounts, to really improve that overall presentation. Those investments have started. On the people side, we've made some progress in hiring people, but there are still some very key positions around the world that need to be filled. We still are in the -- we're in the midst of interviewing for the head of our Asia region for Calvin Klein and also for the head of our European business as we go forward, and planning areas and filling those positions are just starting to be filled. So those positions will come onboard and are all factored into our guidance as we go forward. So I think that's where we'll see the investments being made. We're also focusing in -- we talked about closing unproductive stores. That's a process that's ongoing and we'll continue to do that as we go forward. And balancing -- the biggest issue that we really need to deal with is balancing our sales mix and distribution, both in North America and Europe, where in the jeans area, we are -- we over-distributed into the secondary channel, be it clubs and the off-price. And we're trying to bring that into balance as we grow the department store business and thoughtfully shrink the profitable off-price business as we go forward. So we're doing that in a very thoughtful way as we go forward. But those are the levers that we'll be pushing in the second half of the year.","Operator","We'll go next to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I just want to focus in on the Calvin Klein Jeans business, because, clearly, that's really the key to your creating significant value for your shareholders around the Warnaco acquisition. And now that you've owned the business for 3 or 4 months, can you give us some color on some of the initial conversations you've had with your key partners in Europe and the U.S. about how you see the pace of the business moving forward? And kind of help us benchmark what kind of progress we should see when in terms of, obviously, the product improving, which it sounds like spring of '14, but when we should see shops repositioned and price points begin to move up a bit, and hopefully, see a less promotional business and then also how the pace of your reduction of sales to the off-price channel.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. So I think as -- look, I think you have to look at it this way. We -- from a product point of view, we're presenting to the market in the next -- just recently and continuing to present to the market both here and in Europe the product for spring 2014. Initial reaction has been very positive. There are some -- we had some key benefits that we have and uniquely position us as we go forward. We have a great deal of credibility both in North America and in Europe with these retail -- with our retail partners in our ability to deliver quality product, to present product well, to service that product in retail. We do it across-the-board here in the U.S. with all of our labels. But in Calvin Klein, we do it consistently in men's sportswear. We support it in our own retail stores. We do it very well with our licensing partners here. Our underwear business continues to be very strong. And just as in a way of example, if you were in the jeans business, which in the U.S. is down double digits, even with that double-digit decline in our retail in that jeans business, we're seeing our wholesale businesses up with our key department store accounts, overall, high-single digits. So we -- the Calvin Klein brand has a great deal of credibility with the market. And the management teams both here in the United States and in Europe, what they've been able to deliver with the Tommy Hilfiger product, has significant credibility with the market. So it gives us a significant amount of confidence about turning this business around. The challenge we are going to be dealing with is, for 2013, we're just not going to be in a position to have dramatic improvement in the product. We're trying to tweak the fall and holiday products as we go forward, but it's more important that we keep moving it. It doesn't make sense to start investing at point of sale and in marketing until we get in a position to have the product to support that. So for us, in jeans, the turnaround we see is all 2014. The 2013 numbers that we're using, we think -- we're comfortable with. We think they've been secured. And that balancing of the off-price channel, I think, will start in the third and fourth quarter of this year and will continue into next year. And we will be very thoughtful about how we deal with it.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, great. And then a follow-up. It's interesting that you're going back to a regional design structure for Calvin Klein Jeans. Can you help us understand how that differs with Calvin Klein underwear? And are you -- my recollection is that was centralized. And what are the differences in the 2 businesses? Why it's more important to be a regional design hub and merchandising hub for jeans versus underwear?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure, okay. It's a great question. Look -- and some of this is -- to be brutally honest, some of this is what your management teams are comfortable with running. The operating structures can work in different environments for different companies as they go forward. For us, given the price positioning of the Tommy brand and the Calvin brand, how we're positioned here in the States where, just by the nature of the our premium position here, our out-the-door retails are, on average, $40 to $50 here in the States; where in Asia or Latin America or Europe, our out-the-door retails are approaching $90 to $100. So it's -- it is -- although it's a very coordinated design effort, it is separate lines that we utilize to really exploit all of the markets, trying to be very focused on the needs of those markets, while keeping consistent with the DNA of the brand. When it comes to underwear, historically, that has been a global line that has been marketed to the consumer on a global basis, and has been consistently merchandised across the globe to the consumer at that level. So there, there's a long history of this working. We make -- there are differences between North America and the Asia line from a point of view the weight of different product categories, but it all comes out of the same line. So there, it seems to work for us very well. It's been consistently working for us in that area, and we believe that there is no reason to change that at all and to keep that leverage and focus we have. But when it comes to jeans, very similar to our men's and women's sportswear efforts, we think the regional approach just is what's right for PVH to operate and what works for us in all of our other product categories. So we just found the structure foreign from that point of view, and I think this will give us the ability to react more quickly on a regional basis. It'll give us the ability to move, as appropriate, in each of the markets and not have to do it from a global point of view. And I think, tactically, that'll position us better, both in Europe and North America particularly.","Operator","We will go next to Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the European business and how you're thinking about the progression of that business over the balance of the year in your guidance, both for Tommy and for Calvin Klein.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. And let me start with the Calvin Klein business. We are planning that business in Europe down high single digits. We are planning it at low operating margins overall. We have a profitable, well-working underwear business, and we have a unprofitable jeans business in the 2 businesses. We are not looking for any significant improvement in the trends of that business through this -- through fiscal 2013. The improvement that we're expecting in the jeans business, both in North America and in Europe, it starts in 2014. We think that's a prudent way to plan it, and we're not trying to get ahead of the trends, given where we believe the product is positioned and how quickly we can have it impact presentation at retail. And in Europe, actually, we're in the process of really looking very hard at closing 25 to 35 stores. And that's going to be a process that's going to be take about 18 month, and it'll probably start in earnest in the second half of this year. So I would not expect a significant improvement in the Calvin business in Europe as we go forward. On the Tommy business, the business has continued to perform, as is obvious by the numbers. Our retail trends have been in the low single-digit area for the last 6 months, and I -- we believe those trends will continue. However, we've seen an acceleration in our wholesale bookings, initially first in fall, where the -- where orders were coming in at about 10% rate, and now with the holiday season coming in at also at 10% increase. That's in comparison to where we saw the fall -- the previous fall and spring season coming in closer to a 3% to a 4% increase. So clearly, that portion of the businesses continues to accelerate. We're seeing strong growth there, and I would think the overall performance in the Tommy International business for the -- will continue to improve from the second, third and fourth quarter sequentially as we go forward.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could I also ask on the inventory side? Could you talk a bit more about the clearance activities this quarter and where you feel you're positioned going forwards? Are there any pockets of excess? And where do you feel best about your inventories?","Emanuel Chirico","I feel very strongly on the preexisting PVH businesses. The inventories are in excellent position, and we are -- we don't see any excesses, both obviously in our own balance sheet, but also we don't see any pockets that are out there that need to be dealt with in our department store accounts here in North America. As we move to the newly acquired Warnaco businesses, the underwear business, for the most part, is clean. We don't see any real excess inventory build there that needs to be dealt with. The Speedo and Core Intimates business, there's no real excess inventories that need to be dealt with there of any size that would be visible to you. But finally, the jeans business, there are pockets that we're over-inventoried in. The Asia business, our franchisees, partners were over-inventoried. We made a commitment and we've taken that inventory back. We've taken some of it back already, in the process of pulling it back and bringing it in, to really open that pipeline, so we can get fresh goods into it. That has really started the latter half of the first quarter into the second quarter and should continue as we go forward. In North America, we found some excess inventory that's also being dealt with, and we expect that all to be cleaned up by the end of the third quarter of this year.","Michael A. Shaffer","And if I could just add. We -- obviously, on the financial side, we've taken appropriate reserves where we have to. And on the bath side, we've taken the necessary markdowns where that business hasn't been performing.","Operator","We go next to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Manny, I think before we heard from you today, there was a bit of noise just from others in the industry talking about the weaker spring because of the weather. And I wondered if you could help reconcile some of the strength that we saw in your business versus some of the trends that we saw in spring, and how much of your overall revenues were impacted by shifts out of Q2 into Q1?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. I think when you look at our businesses, our retail businesses in North America and in Europe were clearly impacted by the unseasonably cold spring weather. And nobody wants to play weatherman, but you don't have to be a genius to just look at it and know it was -- it had a negative impact on the business in March, April and early May. To reconcile that, just to keep some of the numbers in place, although Calvin and Tommy performed well at plus-4% and -5% in the quarter in North America, the trends, if you really looked at what was going on in the third and fourth quarter -- and in all of 2012, the trends were much closer. In Tommy, we're running double-digit increases and in Calvin, we're running high single-digit increases. So the trend did come off of where we were trending. And I think that we would've been closer to, I don't know what comps would have been, but clearly, they would have been higher. And there would be -- and there'd probably be less promotion in the market in April, May and June if we weren't dealing with such an unseasonably cold weather. In Europe, it's impacted our retail businesses. Clearly, we had a lot -- we had significant momentum in our retail business in third and fourth quarter of last year, posting high single-digit increases. And to go down to about plus 3%, is clearly a little bit disappointing given the trends we had. But it's very clear to see that the weather had an impact on that business as well, particularly in Northern and Central Europe where the trends have been so strong. So that's how we've looked at the business. Even our Heritage businesses, clearly there, we really think the weather was a big impact on our business at minus 7%. So it had an impact, but I think we've weathered the storm and got out of it and are well-positioned from an inventory point of view as we go forward.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then if you could just quantify overall how much you thought your revenues benefited from the shift of sales that came in Q1 out of Q2?","Emanuel Chirico","Look, I think it's somewhere in the range of $30 million to $50 million.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question is around supply chain. Again, it's another area where we're hearing a little bit more about higher labor costs. And even though this is an ongoing trend, I wonder if there was any updates, especially with the acquisition of Warnaco, about doing anything differently with your supply chain to further efficiencies?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, look, I think as the -- the focus on the supply chain is to integrate the Warnaco businesses onto the PVH platforms which, I think, will benefit responsiveness to market, timeliness to market, cycle times, much -- and with less of a focus on just pure cost of product. I think there's huge benefits to be able to get back into product quickly, to be able to react to trends, which I don't think the business is really capable of today. So that's been our focus. Look, in the sourcing -- what I could tell you is product costs on a -- in general, for the spring season as we go into the fall season, are just relatively flat. I mean we could start talking about labor costs up, product costs down, raw material costs down slightly, mix of sourcing, there's a whole plethora of things going on. And clearly, there is pressure out there as we think about 2014 and beyond, given some of the human rights situations around the world, particularly Bangladesh and other areas. But at this point, it would be premature to talk about any of those things. I don't have great visibility beyond the fall season on where costs are heading. So I think the initiatives we have in place on the supply chain side is really the focus on timeliness to market and getting product on a more timely, and taking the supply chain cycle down dramatically, particularly for jeans and underwear, so we can react to trends in our retail stores.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Manny, I was hoping just if you could focus a little bit more on -- you commented on the strength of both Brazil and China for the Calvin Klein Jeans business. Could you just maybe help us appreciate, is that more kind of how these brands are particularly -- or the brands are particularly positioned in these regions, or is there kind of a broader macro trend that you're seeing in both of those regions? And then secondly, if you relate it to the Tommy Hilfiger bookings in Europe being nicely strong, up 10% both in the fall and holiday period, you highlighted in your prepared remarks Germany as being strong. If we were to parse out kind of northern versus southern, could you help us think about that dynamic for the bookings? And then in terms of category strength for the Tommy Hilfiger bookings in Europe, is there anything to call out that seems to be outperforming the group in -- from a category perspective?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. Let me deal with the Tommy businesses because I think that's the easiest one to just quickly give you a sense. Look, when you think about the big businesses in Southern Europe, that are under pressure for the Tommy business, continue to be Italy and Spain. Those businesses are down. In general, high single-digits to low double-digits, with Italy being under more pressure than Spain at this point. Despite that, we're seeing significant growth in the market in Germany, U.K., France and Russia that's offsetting that. So clearly, it's double-digit increases in those northern and central markets. From a product category point of view, it is -- the strength continues to be men's sportswear and women's sportswear as we go forward. Those categories continue to do very well, as well as our tailored business, dress shirts, neckwear, suitings and related categories that go with that. That's a new category for us that's come on very strong, and that we're seeing significant increases in as we go forward. So those would be the broad categories. Footwear continues to do well for us and the accessory business for Tommy, which is relatively small continues to grow well for us. But when you put it all together, those are the areas on the Tommy side on the go-forward. On the Calvin Klein businesses, when we talk about China and Brazil, a lot of the dynamics has to do with the fact that we are so well-positioned in those markets. I think if you think about Brazil and if you travel it and if you -- what I think you'll see from most international brands, be it European and American designer brand, you'll go to Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo and you'll see a couple of flagship stores, but I don't think you'll see the depth of business that we have in Calvin Klein. We have a very strong wholesale business there, with specialty store accounts throughout the country that have been built over a 10-year period. And it's not easy to do. It's not easy to source product in that part of the world and bring it in with the duties and tariffs you have to deal with, so you have to manufacture close to market. So we have a tremendous advantage with the organization we have in place for Calvin Klein in Brazil and the management team that we have in place that they're really able to execute so well. We have really focused on, as we go forward in 2014 and beyond, expanding the product categories, because we want to go basically at jeans and underwear and nothing else. And we kept that very tight. So we are looking to bring more sportswear into that market beginning in 2014, footwear product categories, and really expand the Calvin Klein brand offering as we go forward. So I think the 10% kind of growth that we're seeing is just the tip of the iceberg. That's a dynamic market. It's still only $150 million in wholesale sales, so there is significant growth opportunity available to us in Brazil as we go forward. In China, the brand, again, is very well-positioned. It's had double-digit growth for the last 4 years. We've slowed that down, because we slowed down some of the square footage growth as we've taken the business on. We want to stabilize the business and bring it on. But it continues to be very healthy for us growing, overall, probably double digits in China, low double-digits, given the comp store increases of about 5%, coupled with square footage growth and the wholesale growth in that channel as we go forward. In a similar vein, we're looking in 2014 and beyond to really expand some of the product offerings there as we go forward. So there's significant opportunities in 2 dynamic markets for us that are growing very fast where the Calvin Klein brand is very well-positioned.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Manny, that's very helpful. I just have a quick clarification, actually, on a former question on this transition from the centralized to the regional structure for the Calvin Klein Jeans. And I -- sorry, if I missed this, are the people put in place as you think about that regional structure for Europe, Brazil, Hong Kong and New York, or is that going to be an incremental kind of team building piece of the initiative in the second half of this year?","Emanuel Chirico","A lot of what's happening is we're taking the existing centralized team that's in New York and really spreading that out around the globe. We're also taking advantage of the Tommy Hilfiger design talents in Europe to really -- that will be supplemented as we go forward. And we were in the process of building a design hub in Asia as we go forward, and that's an in-process. So I would say 85% of it is in place as we go forward and will be supplemented as we go forward. But I think we are very well-staffed there. We've got great talent in that group. The product has really continued to move forward for spring 2014. Karyn Hillman who was with -- has really moved the group forward, and I think we're in a position to take that forward in a way that will make us more efficient from an operating point of view.","Operator","And we will go next to Eric Beder with Brean Capital.","Eric M. Beder - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about 2 things here? For Tommy Hilfiger, I'm curious how -- what is the status of the shift over in Japan? I know that's a material change. And are you -- and what has been the focus here in the U.S. in terms of potentially rolling out full-price Tommy stores outside of this department store channel?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. In North America, we have a chain of about 20 specialty stores that we operate. It's marginally profitable. It seems to be working. We've opened up a test of about, I think it's now 3 stores, new stores that will be opened this year. The test is early on. We think it's great for the brand. The stores, I think, really present the best of what Tommy has to offer in a way that's very brand-appropriate. So we love it from a branding point of view, and I think you'll start -- you'll see some more of these as we go forward. If we're really -- we're not in any way calling out that we think there's a huge growth opportunity for us or a huge profit opportunity for us yet. And that's what we're really testing to see how this will play itself out. So I think it just -- it continues to be very much enhancing for the brand in North America. In Japan, the business continues to be under pressure. We continue to focus the brand to -- from a positioning point of view, more consistent with the European position as we've really positioned the rest of Asia. The Tommy business in Japan has been there for almost 20 years, so it has some of the -- it continues to have some of the legacy of what existed and some of the confusion around the brand as far as the urbanization and the big logos and some of the issues that we dealt with. So Japan is like this pocket of business, $250 million, that's marginally profitable that if we can get right, could be bigger and could be significantly more profitable. But for us, it's critical that we get the brand positioned appropriately in market because Japan as a fashion leader of Asia, particularly Tokyo, it's critical that the brand represent what we want it to be in all of Asia, so that we're able to really get the growth that we are going after in China, in India, in the rest of Southeast Asia, which we think has big growth -- future growth opportunities for us. But in order to really totally be able to capture all of that, I think Japan, from a branding position, needs to be appropriately positioned. I think we are appropriately positioned today, but the consumer is still, in Japan, trying to understand us. It's going to be a process, and I think it's a long-term process. And I think we have it planned appropriately. We've taken the hits in 2010 or '11 to reposition it, and I think at the level of profitability it is today, it's part of a blend that gets us to a 14%, 15% operating margin. So it's there, it's -- and I think that we could start to see some improvement as we go forward.","Eric M. Beder - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of Calvin Klein, so you're -- now you control brand entirely in the U.S. When you look at how you're positioned in department stores, as the entire presentation becomes more, I guess, uniform, as Calvin Klein Jeans kind of moves up the ladder to where it should be, what is the opportunity in department stores to get something like, I don't know, like a shop-in-shop or deeper positioning that's now -- then you have somewhat of a more cohesive focus in terms of both the product and potentially in terms of the advertising?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, I think it's -- that is the -- you basically laid out the whole strategy. It is really to do that in jeans, to get the consistency in jeans in line with what we do in the men's and women's sportswear, what we do in handbags and accessories, what we do even in underwear where we think there could be improvements in presentation. But even there, the brand is much better presented. It is a challenge to find the Calvin Klein Jeans on the floor especially in B doors throughout the United States and we have really -- we really need to step that up. So I think given the performance of the brand overall and the iconic positioning of the Calvin Klein Jeans as a product category in the House of Calvin Klein, there shouldn't be -- if we deliver on the product and execute well and if we make the investments at retail, there's no reason why this should not work. And we're very confident about that. It just takes time. It's what we've done in men's sportswear, building it from 0 to a $200 million wholesale business. It's what we've done with our partners at G-III and all of our women's businesses from 0 to over $1 billion in sales today. So I think we know the playbook. We know the formula that makes it work. It's a product category that we clearly understand, and it's one where we have the right -- from a brand history, to really own and to be significant in. And it's one that if you just go back 3 to 4 years, Calvin Klein had a leadership position in North America, and there's no reason why we shouldn't get that leadership position back. So it is in the works and I think you'll start to see it over the next 24 months.","Operator","We'll move next to Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions on Tommy. In North America, the wholesale business, can you give us an update where we are on your efforts to improve the average selling price and also remind us when the exclusive ends with Macy's on the sportswear side? And then secondly, maybe give us a little bit more color on Tommy Hilfiger business in Latin America. When should we expect maybe to start hearing from you about more efforts there, maybe utilizing some of the Calvin Klein strength in Brazil?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. On the Brazil side, I think when we talk about China, we talk about Brazil, we talk about Korea potentially, in all those markets, we've been very consistent. That's 18 to 36 months out. We need to get the platforms up and operating. We think we have the pipeline, and the distribution, and the knowledge and the management teams in place to take advantage of that long term. But I think that's really a 2015 story and beyond and really we'll be focusing on that. We just signed a joint venture partnership in Brazil for Tommy Hilfiger with a great partner in, in brands that really understands the retail market and the wholesale market there. The brand is well-positioned throughout Latin America, both in Mexico and in Venezuela, other parts, and Brazil is a huge opportunity for us to grow the brand as we go forward. The first part of the question was like a -- what's the...","Dana M. Perlman","AURs, Tommy.","Michael A. Shaffer","Tommy AURs.","Emanuel Chirico","Fine. In North America, in Tommy AURs, they continue to improve. They are up mid single-digits for the season. It's a continuous process, as we go forward, to move that on. I think we, given -- if the environment and, again, we talked about the weather, had been somewhat more cooperative, I think we could have seen some more improvement in the out-the-door retail prices. But given some of the promotional environment that's out there in shorts and some of the key categories that have now gotten under a little bit more pressure and are more promotional, we needed to move appropriately from a competitive point of view. All of that has been factored in. So we continue to see improvement, we're happy how we're positioned, and I think we're set up again for fall to see another increase in AURs as we go forward. The goal is to get Tommy above $40 and we still have about $6 or $7 to get there.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And when is the exclusive end with Macy's?","Emanuel Chirico","The exclusive -- the long-term arrangement with Macy's, we just re-upped for another renewal period. And in addition to that, we've got no intention of moving off of that, so that partnership continues very strongly. They are very supportive of the brand, and it's a focal point for us on the positioning of the brand as we go forward. So I don't see any -- no matter whether the relations -- whatever the agreement states, we don't see any change to that in the future.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if I could do one on Calvin Klein in China, I was a little confused. You've talked about the strength, but I also thought there's a lot of inventory to clear. And then you said -- I think your -- can you give us a little bit more color what it's looking like? Are you ahead of plan in the inventory clearance? Is that why you saw some strength? And give us a sense for the underwear versus jeans business. Was there more strength in underwear? Just, I actually don't know the size of the businesses at all in China.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you. Just a couple of things. On the inventory side of the business, again, the real inventory issue that we're dealing with is inventory in the franchisees. We've taken that inventory back. A lot of that inventory will be destroyed or donated. We're not putting it back into the channel. We don't want to pollute the Asian market. We're going to be dealing with it appropriately in getting it out. It is all jeans product. There is no underwear issue at all. The business is probably 60% -- at round numbers, 60% to 65% jeans and related apparel, 35% to 40% underwear. Both categories are very profitable for us, and whatever -- the inventory liquidation had no issue on us at all from a sales point of view, except that our franchisees' partners, we've cleaned up their pipeline, which will allow them to buy normally and to bring in fresh product in their franchisee stores, which will be healthy for the brand, there'll be less promotion in the market, which we think is critical for the growth market that we're dealing with. So I think that is, for the most part, all behind us and we're moving forward with it.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Kernan with Cowen and Company.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Manny, are you any less confident in the $100 million -- any more or less confident in the $100 million in cost synergies you initially planned with the Warnaco transaction? How should we think about the timing of when you're able to recognize -- be on the $25 million in synergies I think you're planning for in the back half of this year?","Michael A. Shaffer","So look, we've gotten through the first quarter. We validated our plans. We are absolutely on track to obtain the $100 million. For this year, we've talked about the $25 million being a number, it is back-half-weighted. And as we move forward, next year and the year after, we'll get another $25 million, and the fourth year as well, getting to the $100 million. So we are -- sitting here today, we have plans that are absolutely falling into place, integrations where switches will be turned on in the next 90 days, as Manny said, and we feel very good about our planned synergies.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then my -- back to the Tommy Hilfiger AUR and the margin expansion that's gone on there. I think the operating margin was up almost 400 basis points year-over-year in the first quarter. It seems like your guidance for the combined Tommy Hilfiger business, international and domestic, assumes some of that momentum stays into the back half of the year. What's driving that? And do you think you're being a little bit conservative in terms of the margin expansion for Tommy Hilfiger for the rest of the year?","Michael A. Shaffer","I think you're talking about North America only? Or are you talking about...","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I'm talking about North America operating margins for the first quarter, in North America?","Michael A. Shaffer","The operating margins in the first quarter, they obviously had a strong quarter. Comps were 5% against the plan of low single-digit, so they -- some of that beat was driven by a very strong revenue beat. So as we look forward, we're just not planning those kinds of beats, and we'll see how -- the business is trending better than the plan right now, but we haven't planned those same kind of revenue beats.","Emanuel Chirico","Look at -- 14% operating margin of [ph] last year in the Tommy Hilfiger business was a significant improvement from where it was the year before, which is great. And I think we're planning about a 50 basis point improvement this year. And I think at this point, that given the configuration of that business being Macy's exclusive, coupled with our own retail business, I think that is a pretty good place to be right now. So getting too far ahead of ourselves, I'd be cautious about.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We go next to Howard Tubin with RBC Capital Markets.","Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Guys, maybe just one more follow-up on Tommy Hilfiger. Any update you can give us, Manny, on new product initiatives or marketing initiatives for Tommy coming up North America in this fall and maybe into next spring?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think as -- I think the product expansions, the focus that we -- we've got a couple of initiatives in place to really grow some existing businesses. In particular, our tailored business, we think there's a huge -- there's a big opportunity in Europe, and there's also a big opportunity in North America that I think will start to capture particularly dress shirts, neck wear and with our licensing partner, tailored clothing, here in the States. So we're putting in some shop-in-shops around that will really be very brand-building and enhancing as we go forward, so we're excited about that. In the accessory area, that's an area where we continue to grow in our own retail stores pretty significantly. And we think worldwide, there's a real opportunity to grow that business. We're at the early stages of that as we go forward, and have been making investments in people and structure in Europe and in North America to really try to capture that accessory business as we go forward, both in our own stores and starting to really develop a meaningful wholesale business in North America and Europe as well. So those are the product categories. From a marketing point of view, we continue to want to invest behind the Meet the Hilfigers campaign. We don't -- that campaign continues to evolve and move forward, but we clearly aren't looking to get off of that at this point. There's a lot of momentum behind it. Consumer continues to really enjoy it. We're able to activate it at retail in a way that brings the brand to life at point-of-sale, both in our own stores and in our shop-in-shops around the world. So I think you will just see more of that marketing campaign just moving forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We go next to Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was hoping -- you guys called out in your release, actually, the Heritage wholesale businesses, particularly the gross margin side. I was hoping you could give us sort of an update on the go-forward look for Izod, Van Heusen and Arrow. Maybe give us some thoughts on what your JCPenney initiatives are for those brands right now versus what you're doing in Macy's with Izod and how you're positioning Arrow's at Kohl's?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. Look, that business was very -- the sportswear businesses for us, for those 3 brands were very strong. We saw a -- particularly, compared to last year's first quarter, which was difficult for the Izod business, so the Izod business now has put together 3 straight quarters of very strong performance. And the second quarter initial -- initial sales trends are very strong as well, so we really like the way that brand is positioned. Van Heusen, very strong launch at Kohl's, the sportswear and the dress shirts and the neck wear continue to sell. They're really making it a focal point for them as they go forward, investing behind that brand. JCPenney's initiative with Izod continues, the shop-in-shops. Izod Golf is becoming a bigger component at both department -- at all department stores including JCPenney, as we go forward. So the investments we're making from a marketing point behind golf personalities and celebrities and the Heritage that Izod has in that area, we think is really resonating with the consumer and working for us as we go forward. And I think the last point I'd make is with JCPenney, in particular, where we really saw softness in our business last year with Penney was on the main floor. It was in the dress shirt and the neckwear businesses. The old new management team that's come back and refocused has made it a strategic imperative for them to get back into those businesses. Dress shirts and neckwear, clearly being 2 businesses that they want to invest in inventory, presentation and deliver a value message to their consumer. And we are working very closely with them to try to position those categories for the third quarter with the back-to-school selling season in those brands. And their management team is very much committed to do that. So I think they are doing all the right things to take advantage of some of the initiatives that work at JCP, like Izod and some of the other shops initiatives that really worked well. But at the same time, refocusing the initiative back in the main floor where JCPenney historically has owned that main floor classification business and really trying to bring that consumer back in. So we're working with them very closely to do that. And I think that gives us a high degree of confidence about the second half of the year for Heritage wholesale.","Operator","And sir, we actually had no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to you then.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. Thank you very much.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining me on the call. Joining me on this call will be Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relationships; as well as Ken Duane, who runs our wholesale businesses here in the United States and North America.","We are very pleased with our second quarter and first half results. Our strong performance year to date exceeded our expectations and demonstrates our ability to deliver against our 2016 plan despite the challenging macro environment. Overall, we had a terrific quarter with revenues increasing 5% on a constant currency basis, while earnings per share grew approximately 40% on a constant currency basis.","The momentum across our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger International businesses continued during the quarter. Our European and China businesses continued to be our healthiest markets. The strength has been seen across all channels of distribution, wholesale, retail, and our digital channels. Speaking of digital, we continued to see outsized growth across all of our digital e-commerce businesses.","For the second quarter, we continued to generate revenue growth in excess of 20%, and this channel continues to be our fastest growing distribution channel. Key measures we have taken include enhancing the navigation on our own sites, elevating our own sites to focus less on promotions, investing in mobile capabilities, and taking steps to ensure that we are in-stock in high core demand items, which is the key to the profitability on digital commerce.","In the second quarter, the US market continued to be our most volatile market that we operate in. Similar to the first quarter, our US wholesale business continued to grow and show improvement. For the first half, we are running well ahead of our wholesale plans and our prior year actual results.","However, our US retail businesses have not seen much improvement in trend from the first quarter and continued to experience soft traffic and higher promotional trends. Specifically, our international tourist traffic and spending continues to weigh on our US retail business. And as we began August, these sales trends have not improved.","Looking ahead to the balance of the year, given the strong momentum in our businesses, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the year while also further investing in our brands. We have also taken a prudent approach to planning our business in the second half of 2016, particularly our US retail businesses, which we are now planning second half comp store sales trends at the same levels that we experienced in the first half.","Let me move on to a brand update to discuss each of our key brands. Moving to Tommy Hilfiger, let me start with an update on some of our brand marketing activities. A major focus of our fall campaign will be our women's businesses. As we have previously announced, Gigi Hadid will be our global ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger's Women's, representing apparel, footwear, accessories, and fragrance.","This initiative reflects the brand's strategic commitment to expand its women's businesses globally. We believe that we have a significant global growth opportunity in women's and we are beginning to see positive momentum in these businesses. As part of her exclusive ambassadorship, Gigi has partnered with Tommy Hilfiger to launch our first collaborative collection.","The collection will launch globally at the New York Fashion Week with Tommy Hilfiger's first consumer fashion show, where all looks will be immediately available for purchase. The collection will be available in over 70 countries around the world, in over 200 Tommy Hilfiger stores, and 150 wholesale partner stores, all with dedicated in-store marketing installations. The collection will also be available on our own e-commerce sites.","Another important brand initiative for us has been Tommy jeans. Now in its second season, Tommy jeans celebrates the most iconic styles from the brand from the 1990s. We evolved nostalgic classics with a fresh, youthful energy. We first launched the jeans collection in April 2016 in 15 countries across Europe with strong sell-throughs on both e-commerce and at retail.","The collection has allowed us to establish new wholesale partnerships that support our efforts to attract a new, younger consumer base. In the US and the UK, we have invested in the strategic partnership with Urban Outfitters. We have also established similar partnerships with specialty stores in France, Germany, and Scandinavia. The second delivery of the Tommy jeans capsule has hit stores in August and the collection continues to perform very well and has excellent sell-throughs.","Moving to the financial performance in the second quarter, overall revenues for Tommy increased 7% on a constant currency basis and EBIT was up over 20% on a constant currency basis. Our revenues were driven by the outstanding performance of our international business, which continued to generate 11% constant currency sales growth in the quarter.","Moving to our European business, we saw solid performance in all major European markets, demonstrated by a 8% comp store increase in Europe for our retail business with strength across all major markets. I think it's important to comment that our UK business continues to show strong momentum despite a short-lived slow down around the Brexit vote. We continue to be encouraged by the healthy comp trends we have experienced so far in the third quarter, which continued to run up high single-digits throughout Europe.","Moving to wholesale, the Hilfiger brand continues to resonate with the European consumer and our fall sales are projected to be up 6%, while our spring 2017 order book is running up 7% over the prior year. Growth in the order book was generated across all product categories with acceleration across our denim and women's businesses.","Strong growth is coming out of all markets, the UK, Germany, Scandinavia, Spain, and even Italy, which has not seen growth in many seasons. The only challenging market for the brand is Turkey, which is understandable given the current geopolitical situation there.","Moving to Asia, as a reminder, we closed our acquisition in China in mid April for the Tommy Hilfiger business there. That business continues to demonstrate strong results and is tracking to our plan. This plant has added about 300 basis points to the top line during the second quarter, and we see it being slightly accretive to our full-year earnings.","We affirmed up our planned marketing spend in China that we spoke to you previously about, and we believe this will help further support the brand and our fall initiatives that are primarily focused on promoting women's, as well as the foundation for sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond.","Moving to North America, starting with our wholesale business, I'm pleased to say that our Tommy's men's wholesale business continues to perform very well. And during the quarter and first half, we continued to see good sell-throughs and higher sales. During the quarter, we continued to see stronger sell-throughs and higher average unit retails. We believe this healthy performance from the first half of the year will continue into the second half and we are excited about the developments in the men's business.","Lastly, we are working with G-III to handle the women's sportswear business in the fourth quarter, and that transition continues to run on plan, and we continue to see strong positive reaction to the lines by our wholesale partners.","Turning to our US retail business, unfortunately, we have not seen a material improvement in this business year to date with comps running down year to date about 8%. The business continues to be under pressure driven by weakness in traffic and consumer spending in the international tourist stores. As a reminder, we're taking a prudent approach and are not forecasting for the first half trends to improve for the balance of this year.","Moving to Calvin Klein, let me take a moment and discuss some of the recent moves around the Calvin Klein brand. We announced a few weeks ago that Raf Simons has been appointed our Global Creative Officer to drive on new global creative strategy for the brand, which will unify all Calvin Klein brands under one creative vision across all other categories of the brand.","We believe that this undertaking will further solidify the brand's positioning worldwide and pave the way for future growth. As Raf has only been in the building a few weeks, he is working with the teams as he builds out how the brand will continue to evolve from a creative direction point of view.","As it relates to the overall brand\u2019s relevancy and the power of the brand globally, we continue to see our awareness levels and willingness to purchase metrics continue to improve in all markets. The fall 2016 global advertising campaign continues to roll out featuring a provocative blend of talent and deeper storytelling while continue to leverage #MyCalvins. The campaign is featured in 26 global markets with a diversified media mix comprised of digital, print and outdoor advertising.","As a reminder, we're also the official apparel partners of the European Justin Bieber's Purpose Tour, which kicks off in September and we will have dedicated branded top-up shops at the tour's Berlin, London and Madrid stops, similar to what we did for Justin's US tour.","Specifically from a brand's perspective, I want to call out a few exciting launches for fall 2016. On the jeans front, we have a major global launch of our sculpted jean, which will hit stores at the end of this month. This launch will be supported by a global ad campaign that features Bella Hadid, Gigi's sister. This campaign will focus on all major markets with a diversified mix of media, both digital, print and outdoor.","As a product category, we have seen significant growth in our Calvin Klein underwear and intimates business. And this is far and away been our most successful growth category, posting explosive growth and consistently growing its leading global market share position. We believe women's intimates will continue to be our most significant growth area and we have a number of fall growth initiatives taking place.","Our Modern Cotton logo business continues to gain momentum and has enabled us to capture the number one market position in the bra-led category. For fall 2016, we are taking this logo application to tailored bras and are launching our seamless [logo Bra]. It marries bra technology with a great CK logo. This will allow us to continue to cater to a younger consumer and offer those that want more support the ability to purchase logo product as well.","Additionally on the bra side, we continue to expand our Black Label offering, particularly in Asia and Europe, and have launched two new products for fall to address our broader tailored bra segment, offering seductive comfort with lace, adding new fashion details to our well-known proven seductive comfort silhouette, and offering a three-piece lace bra with a focus on our attempt to gain a larger portion the large size cup market both in US and in Europe markets.","Lastly, we launched the brand's latest women's fragrance, Deep Euphoria, earlier this month, which will help expand the Euphoria business. The print and video advertising campaign for the fragrance features Margot Robbie and will receive support through a global campaign with print, broadcast and digital media.","From a financial performance perspective in the second quarter, overall the global momentum in Calvin Klein continues as we posted revenue growth of 15% on a constant currency basis and non-GAAP EBIT growth of close to 50% on a constant currency basis.","Let me start with the international businesses of Calvin. International revenues were up approximately 17% on a constant currency basis with comparable store sales growth increasing by 11% in the quarter. Europe continued to experience very healthy wholesale selling and comparable store sales increases across every major market. And our branded presence across the major markets continued to improve each season.","The wholesale business continues its strong performance. Our fall 2016 sales are projected to be up high-teens, and I'm pleased to provide you with an update on spring 2017's order book, which is running up about 20%. The strength of the business is coming from all major markets and across all product categories with an acceleration in both jeans and the underwear categories. And we have seen growth in some of our newer categories, particularly accessories.","Our European retail business continues to gain momentum with comps running up in the mid-teens in the second quarter. As we have moved into the third quarter, comp store sales in Europe continues to post strong double-digit sales increases.","Moving to Asia, our businesses continue to perform very well with China outperforming our other markets. However, it is important to note that we did experience a nice improvement in our Korea business. The trends from our first quarter continues as we see strength across jeans, underwear, accessories and our newer performance at Leisure business.","We continue to see nice square footage growth across the region with some key new store openings in Hong Kong and Mainland China this year. Additionally, by the end of the year, our Asia CK.com sites will be shipping to all major markets across Asia, including Australia and New Zealand. Second quarter comp sales in Asia saw a nice improvement and we continue to see that trend into our third quarter running up about positive mid single-digits.","In North America, our revenues were up 15% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by the strong performance of our wholesale business across all categories. During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in our underwear business, as our women's business continued to see tremendous growth and market share gains in the department store sector.","We've seen market share grow in the bra business to the number five position overall in department stores and number one position in the bralette category. We also have grown to the number two position in panties with strong momentum in the logo bottoms business. In men's, we continue to hold the number one market share position in bottoms and the number two position in tops.","Our newest launch in bottoms in the US is the 3-pack micro, which is off to a strong start. Historically, we have not offered micro product in multipacks, but only in singles, and the consumers reacted very positively to this. While the department stores continue to drive the lion\u2019s share of our volume growth, penetration of our e-commerce and growth in these channels continues to outpace the brick-and-mortar trends.","Continuing on the solid momentum from the first quarter is our men's sportswear and jeans business, which continued to see improvement from the fall season with better AURs and strong sell-throughs. Women's jeans continues to see outsized improvement through our specialty store accounts like Urban Outfitters and we did see improvement trends across all of our department store businesses there as well.","Moving to our retail US business, that remains challenging with our international tourist traffic and spending under the same pressure that we are seeing in our Hilfiger US business. Retail comps continued to remain soft in the second quarter at mid single-digit negative and we are not planning for the sales trend to improve for the balance of the year.","Finally, in our Heritage businesses, the Heritage business revenues declined 14%, driven by the ongoing impact of our rationalization initiatives, including the exit of the Izod retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines within dress furnishing. Additionally, our Heritage Brands business was impacted by a shift in timing of our wholesale shipments into the third quarter from the second quarter.","Our Heritage businesses continue to track positively against our full-year 2016 financial plan. We are very well positioned in these businesses. Inventories are very clean and our sales orders at wholesale are very healthy. We believe we are poised to post a significant earnings turnaround in the second half of the year.","Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Speedo and its Olympic performance. I would like to congratulate team Speedo on their performance during the Summer Olympics. The Speedo brand was dominant during the games and very prominent to our consumers and we believe this exposure will continue to have a positive impact on our business.","Finally, to conclude my remarks, overall, we\u2019re quite pleased with our performance in the first half and believe that our world-class brands, proven business model and best-in-class management teams are well positioned to navigate through the macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility that we've seen, while being positioned hopefully to outperform against our second half projections.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to quantify some of the financial results.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.","Second quarter revenues were in line with guidance with a 5% constant currency increase over the prior year after excluding the negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses had a strong quarter. Calvin Klein revenues were up 15% on a constant currency basis, ahead of guidance and driven by all regions.","Calvin Klein International comps were particularly with strong comp store increase of 11%. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 7% on a constant currency basis for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Europe, as our Europe comp sales were up 8%, as well as the addition of our China business.","Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger US wholesale businesses performed well in the quarter and exceeded the plan. However, our US retail businesses for these brands remained under pressure due to continued declines in our stores located in international tourist locations","Heritage revenues were down 14%, primarily due to the exit of the Izod retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in dress furnishings business, as well as the timing of shipment.","EPS for the quarter was better than the top end of our guidance by $0.17. The beat was driven by our strong Calvin and Tommy performance for $0.10, a favorable shift of marketing spend into the second half for the year of $0.05, favorable timing on taxes of $0.03 and a partial offset from FX of $0.01. Our inventories were very clean at the end the second quarter, relatively flat to the prior year despite acquiring inventories as part of the Tommy China acquisition.","Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016, we're increasing our earnings guidance for the year while continuing to take a prudent approach to planning our business in the second half as a result of global consumer spending remaining volatile and the US retail market continuing to be promotional. In particular, we are now planning second half comp store sales trends in our US retail business not to improve. Specifically, we are projecting our second half comps to be at the same level as our first half trends.","For the full year 2016, we are anticipating based on our current exchange rates that we'll be negatively impacted by about $1.60 of earnings per share for foreign exchange, which is $0.05 worse than previous guidance and was primarily driven by the British pound. The $1.60 impact is approximately 85% transaction and 15% translation.","For the full year 2016, we're projecting non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.55 to $6.65. If we exclude the negative impact of FX of $1.60, earnings per share growth is 16% to 17% over the prior year. We've increased our earnings per share guidance to $0.10 despite the $0.05 negative impact from FX.","Our guidance continues to reflect a prudent view of our businesses for the second half of the year. In total, the second half of the year will include an increase of $40 million versus the prior year on brand marketing as well as investments associated with the recent Calvin Klein Creative leadership changes. Versus our previous guidance, our full-year marketing spend has increased approximately $10 million.","Overall, we are projecting full-year revenues to grow approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. This guidance reflects a revenue reduction of approximately $40 million in the second half of the year related to our proposed joint venture in Mexico, which is expected to close late in the third quarter and would primarily impact our Calvin Klein business. Overall, we expect this transaction to be earnings neutral on a non-GAAP basis for 2016.","Overall, operating margins are expected to increase 75 basis points on a constant currency basis and decrease 90 basis points on a reported basis. Our Calvin Klein business is projecting revenues to grow 7% on a constant currency basis with operating margins to increase about 50 points excluding the negative impact of FX of 160 basis points.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% on a constant currency basis with operating margins planned to increase about 75 basis points, excluding the negative impact of approximately 225 basis points of FX. Our Heritage business is planned to have a revenue decrease of 8%, mostly to the exiting of the Izod retail business and several licensed product lines from in our dress business. Operating margins in our Heritage business are planned to increase about 30 basis points. The impact of foreign currency in Heritage is relatively immaterial.","Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $2.35 to $2.40 and includes $0.45 of estimated negative impact of foreign exchange. Excluding this negative impact, we're expecting earnings per share to increase 5% to 7% for the third quarter. Included in our third quarter guidance is increased marketing and investment spend of approximately $20 million versus the prior year.","Revenue in the third quarter is projected to increase 3% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at 6% constant currency increase while the Heritage business is planned to decrease 6%.","And with that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick","Couple of questions. First, on the outlet business, can you talk through when you saw the big falloff last year? And why at this point you decided to not bake in any improvement? And then I have a couple followups. Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Sure, I guess, David, last year, the falloff, I guess, really started late August to September. We'll start to anniversary that right around Labor Day. I guess, from a guidance and projection point of view, it just seemed prudent to try whatever risk might be in the business, the idea was to try to de-risk any of the guidance as we went forward. Given the momentum that we see in other parts of the business, we felt comparable taking that sales trend down.","I think just to say it, if we were to see somewhat of a leveling off in that environment, we're well positioned with inventory there to take advantage with it, both from a top line point of view and even more importantly, I think, from a margin point of view as we go forward. So opportunity exists if that channel were to bounce back somewhat in the third and fourth quarter. I think the real opportunity to be, to sum it up, is really the fourth quarter, given the weather issues that we faced last year and the pressure that was put on margins last year to liquidate goods.","David Glick","A follow-up on denim, that was a big conversation at MAGIC. A number of retailers have talked about, a lot happening, a lot of newness in denim. Clearly, the underwear and intimates is driving your Calvin growth. And I'm really more focused on the Calvin Klein jean business. Can you talk about where you are in terms of some of these trends, whether it's stretch or ripped, destructed, narrower leg openings, et cetera, like how you're positioned in line on the women's side? And do you feel like you're where you want to be to really start to take advantage of what appears to be a fashion trend moving in your direction?","Manny Chirico","I think there's a couple of stores and some of it is geographic and some of it is men's versus women's. I think, geographically, outside the United States, I think the brand, the Calvin Klein brand in jeans is very well positioned. A lot of innovation really, and we're seeing very strong momentum in the business, both men's and women's. A lot of the fashion issues that you touched on and what's moving forward, be it skinny, flair, stretch, whatever case, we're really on all of those issues and really doing very well with it.","I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the Tommy Hilfiger, our Hilfiger denim line continues to really post very strong results as well. That business internationally, well, in Europe, is larger than the Calvin Klein jeans business there, and we're seeing real real strong growth in that denim category with Tommy Hilfiger in that area.","Moving to the United States, the men's business, as I've mentioned a couple of times, is ahead of the women's business both from a fashion point of view and from a performance point of view at departments \u2013 in our performance at department stores. I think from a fashion point of view, our fall line really moves us forward on the women's side of the equation and will be well positioned for the back-to-school season and hopefully to capture significant amount of growth in that area.","Our retail partners really feel strongly about how the line is positioned and we're starting to see in our order book as we look beyond 2016 and 2017 where our retail partners are gaining more confidence in the line and placing stronger orders as we go forward. So I feel positive about the moves that are being made on the Calvin Klein jeans side of the business. Men's, first and foremost, really performing very well in the US and then women's really seems to be coming on and we'll be able to report better to you as we get into third quarter.","David Glick","Last question, if I could. You talked about how you're kind of balancing the decrease in footprint in department stores, how this 100-door closure may affect you from, obviously, it'll affect you from a sales perspective, but your thoughts on a possible EBIT impact and then how you're kind of repositioning the organization from a staffing standpoint to grow the Amazon business, which is obviously not the easiest thing to do. But if you can talk to that dynamic, I'd appreciate it.","Manny Chirico","So I think what's critical, I guess, first, let's start with the Macy's 100-door closure. I think Macy's spoke to it as a net impact of about $1 billion. I think it'll be relatively immaterial to our top line as we move forward as that happens over a period of time. I think it may put a little bit of pressure on top line, but from a profitability point of view, these obviously weren't Macy's most profitable stores and they weren't our most profitable margin stores. So I think the opportunity is to have a healthier presentation and healthier profitability in the brick-and-mortar side of the business.","From a positioning point of view, for the last 24 to 36 months, we've been really trying to drive our digital growth, both not only site, but also our partner sites, Macy's.com, our key players there, and also couple \u2013 a number of the pure plays globally, be it Amazon, Zalando, Alibaba, Tmall.","So those are clearly areas for us. And we have tried to segment our product, make sure that we're well positioned in those areas, significantly investing. I mentioned in my comments the investments we're making from a digital presentation point of view. Clearly, our marketing campaigns have shifted their spend to \u2013 well over 50% of our marketing spend now is digital, both for Calvin and Tommy. So I think we're making all the right moves.","And we need to be where the consumer is. They want our brands and we're positioned there. And over the next 12 months, we're trying to position ourselves that we're agnostic about where we make the sale, whether it's in our own retail stores, department stores, through their brick-and-mortar or their own e-commerce sites. So that's the way we're positioned. I think we are as well positioned as anyone with our two key brands to take advantage of that.","Operator","We'll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","I guess, Manny, first question for you is on Calvin Klein. With Raf Simons coming in, can you just talk a bit more about the product, how to look under him? And then I guess the message is towards more unification. Does that change how you\u2019re thinking about your existing Calvin Klein licenses under Raf?","Manny Chirico","I think for the first time since we've owned the business and we're going to have one clear strategic direction for the brand. And I think you can't underestimate what that will mean to us from a brand point of view moving forward. I think we haven't had that since 2003 when Calvin Klein ran the business. So I have a cohesive view the brand and the product in being able to really take advantage of the collection business to diffuse it down to our white label and bridge lines. I think it'll be a huge benefit for us as we go forward.","As far as how that will impact our marketing campaigns and as we move forward, I think, look, that's a work in process. I think what you will probably see is the last two years appropriately so, given the size of the business, disproportionate amount of our marketing spend has gone to Calvin Klein jeans and underwear, and I think as we move into 2017 and beyond, you'll see more lifestyle marketing of the brand that will capture and take advantage of the other product category where we think there is significant growth. So I view this as all very positive.","From a licensing point of view, I don't think it changes any of our direction. I think we continue to look to take control of the more geographic components of our brand, where it makes sense, particularly where we have strong operating platforms like we did with the Tommy Hilfiger business in China. We could see that happening both with Tommy and Calvin going forward. And that there's always the opportunity as we move forward to potentially bring in some significant product categories in-house. Those opportunities exist. If anything, I think Raf's presence only gives us more confidence to take it on as we move forward.","Erinn Murphy","And then if I could just follow up on Glick's question on the digital growth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks there's a number of strategies towards [indiscernible] addressing more profitable growth in that channel. Can you just help us then where does that channel fit from a profitability perspective relative to the balance of your business? And then Amazon business, obviously, that's a wholesale business for you, but where is profitably on that spectrum to the [indiscernible]?","Manny Chirico","Sure, I'm not going to speak to specific customer, but I will just say that our e-commerce wholesale business where we are selling to our pure plays and all \u2013 where we are selling to our pure plays and to our department store partners is a very profitable business, consistent with all of our other businesses. The only business that is a challenge for us from a profitably point of view is our own e-commerce businesses, which we're truly running as flagship sites.","We don't over promote on those sites. It's very event-driven. We don't do flash sites and flash selling on our own sites. We don't drive excess product through our sites. We really view that as flagship sites where the consumer comes to our sites, be it Tommy or Calvin. They investigate the brand, better understand the brand. They can buy on our sites or we will drive them to our retail partner's sites, or they'll use that investigation to shop in department stores as we move forward. So we see it as a very cohesive strategy that works together.","And I think from a pure profitability point of view, the only issue we're dealing with on our own e-commerce sites is scale. As that business continues to grow, we've talked about the kind of growth rates we're seeing, we're 12 months away from going from a loss position on those businesses to a profit position on those businesses. And each incremental sale that we make online is as profitable as an incremental sale in wholesale on our own retail stores. So from that perspective, we truly are becoming agnostic about where the customer shops.","Erinn Murphy","[indiscernible] one clarification on the guidance for Mike. From a sales perspective in Q3, I think it was much better than a lot of us were looking for [indiscernible].","Manny Chirico","Erinn, we lost you.","Mike Shaffer","We lost you on the much better than...","Erinn Murphy","Can you hear me?","Manny Chirico","Yes, now we can.","Erinn Murphy","So just [indiscernible] I think a lot of us looked at it up 3%. It would basically imply your fourth quarter sales guidance effectively [indiscernible] your 2% sales guide for the year. So I guess it seems that you could be fairly conservative given the [indiscernible] the offsets the JV in Mexico [indiscernible] going forward...","Manny Chirico","I think we got it, Erinn. We understand your questions. It's more about fourth quarter sales and how the profits are evolving.","Mike Shaffer","So look, I guess a couple of things. As Manny said in his comments and I did as well, we are looking at the fourth quarter prudently. We are expecting our trends from the first half in our outlet business to continue through the second half. We are taking a prudent view of the wholesale business in North America as well. And then, lastly, I would just point out that there were some very strong fixture builds and launches in the fourth quarter of last year. I believe the comp \u2013 the Calvin Klein revenue increase was in excess of 20% in the fourth quarter of last year. So overall, I'd say it's a prudent view of the fourth quarter.","Manny Chirico","I think, if I could just add, I think the real \u2013 look, there could be sales opportunity for us as we move forward into the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. But the real key, I think, to go forward is overall profitability from a gross margin point of view.","Really, I think our department store partners and again this is a focus on North America, they've really heightened open to buy dollars, which is a positive, and I think they're going to be well positioned if we get any kind of reasonable weather in the third into the fourth quarter last year. So I think some years are top line growth years or some seasons, and some seasons are margin seasons. I think this is really a margin season where the opportunity really exists to show dramatic improvement over last year's fourth quarter on the margin line, if we can continue to keep the channel clean from an inventory point of view and if we just get some reasonable weather.","So I think it's laying out really well for us and I'm pleasantly surprised about how well positioned our department store partners\u2019 inventory seem to be. They really got under the sales trend and so I feel positive about that as well. So I think we're all well positioned to capture a strong back-to-school season and a strong Christmas holiday season.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Let me try to ask a little extension of Erinn's question there. I guess, if you could help us isolate how much of the, I guess, the implied revenue down for Calvin, 6%. Can you just help us isolate how much of that in your mind is non-recurring items that are holding back that growth rate in the fourth quarter and the optics that you spoke to so we can start to think about whether 2017 is still a mid to high single digit growth year for Calvin again, just to help us filter through some of the noise.","Mike Shaffer","Look, the Calvin business is strong. So there's nothing that has changed in our outlook as we look forward. In the third and fourth quarter, we are going to \u2013 in the third quarter, we'll execute our Mexico agreement, that's predominantly a Calvin Klein transaction. That will move this business from an operating business today to a joint venture. We'll have about $40 million revenue hit in the second half of the year and that's three quarters or more weighted to the fourth quarter.","Manny Chirico","I guess I would also just say on the \u2013 if we're focusing just on Calvin Klein, I don't think we can anticipate 15% constant currency growth for 2017 as we go forward. I mean, I'd love it to happen, but we'll see how it plays out. And when you go forward about a quarter, like any business, there's somewhat ups and downs. We've had such a strong first half of the year. I think there are some timing shifts that we\u2019ve had to deal with on shipping and accelerating shipment with the strength of the Calvin business.","I would not lead anything into the fourth quarter sales trends that would any way indicate that either Tommy Hilfiger business or the Calvin Klein business are seeing any type of slowdown against what we're seeing going forward. So I just think it's a quarter. Maybe we're being a little bit conservative, but there's no fundamental changes in the business, no fundamental changes in the sales trends that we see. And I think if you just talk to most of our North America department store partners, they'll tell you how strong that business is despite what's going on around everywhere else.","Michael Binetti","And then since you're focused on the profitability opportunity on the back half as well, could we get a little bit of color on how you're thinking about grosses for the balance of the year? I think you previously spoke to about 53% with grosses up in each quarter. But the inventories were flat including an acquisition so maybe down, excluding the acquisition grosses are really healthy in the second quarter. Sales momentum to your point is strong. Can we assume that directionally grosses should be up by more on a year over year basis in the third quarter than what we saw in the first half?","Mike Shaffer","Our gross margin view for the year has remained unchanged at 53%. As we move through the third and fourth quarter, we've got a little bit more opportunity in the fourth quarter because comp comparisons last year were just \u2013 it was a very promotional quarter. But Manny said it; this is more about the opportunity on gross margin than revenues this year. So we feel there is an opportunity there, but we'll plan prudently at this point.","Manny Chirico","And I just would say, if I think \u2013 just by the way things get recorded, the way things got hit, I think the opportunity is really the fourth quarter from a financial performance point of view, also see a little bit less pressure from foreign currencies, which is principally transactional gross margin related year over year. So just as you look at it sequentially this year to last year, I think the fourth quarter has the opportunity to see the biggest improvement.","Operator","We'll go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Can you talk a little bit about the Tommy Hilfiger women's license, how that's progressing, when we should begin to see things from that and also on China and the accretion opportunity for Tommy Hilfiger?","Manny Chirico","I think, the G-III \u2013 actually, in G-III sales, you really start to see it in the fourth quarter. Holiday 2016, they'll start shipping, I guess, there'll be some deliveries beginning of November as they set up. I'll leave it to them; I don't want to start talking about the business for them. I know they're optimistic and enthusiastic about how they see that business. I know the dresses hit the floor \u2013 the dresses are hitting the floor and women's suits are hitting the floor earlier. And they're really feeling good about that portion of the business as it relates to Tommy Hilfiger.","But I think they're reporting in another few days, I think let them lay it out for you. The transition really is going smoothly. The two companies have worked together very well to make sure from an inventory point of view, there's no carryover merchandise that's going to negatively impact the business. And it really worked well with Macy's, in particular, in our other key department store accounts to make sure that transition is seamless. And I'm very confident about the way that's moving.","G-III, what we're hoping for is what they've delivered in Calvin Klein over the last five to seven years that they'll deliver for Tommy Hilfiger and really take a business that's a couple of hundred million dollars and turn it into a $500 million to $700 million business at much higher price points and at better margins.","You mentioned China, again, this year with the transition and some of the amortizations and some of the accounting stuff that we have to deal with, it's going to be slightly accretive. I think that business will continue to grow. I think we are going \u2013 I guess, we were projecting it to grow high single digits. There's an opportunity to do more than that. But it's a question of how fast and quickly we want to move.","Clearly, if you look at the size of the business, round numbers, $140 million to $150 million compared to a Calvin Klein business that's at least twice as large. There's clearly a footprint opportunity for us to grow. And I guess just having the two brands under one roof, under one logistics platform, one operating platform, the synergies should start to come towards the second half of next year in a bigger way. So it'll be a much bigger contributor to profitability next year as we move forward. And it will be a big contributor to our top line growth as well.","So I feel \u2013 really think that, that will be, probably without a doubt, it will be next year for sure our highest operating margin business in the company for the Tommy Hilfiger brand, very similar to how profitable our Calvin Klein China business is. So as we look forward, we're enthusiastic and I think it'll be a contributor significantly to our top and bottom line.","Operator","We'll go next with John Kernan with Cowen.","John Kernan","I wanted to stay on the topic of licenses and potential acquisitions. What other regions are out there, whether licenses are out there that you could potentially bring back in-house? Obviously, the leverage ratio on the balance sheet continues to come down well north of $500 million in free cash flow this year, which is only going to grow over the next couple of years. So how do you think about deploying cash at this point between balancing acquisitions of licenses and maybe deleveraging the balance sheet?","Manny Chirico","I think, look, we've been pretty transparent about that Asia is the region that we continue to see the biggest growth and the biggest potential opportunity to take back license businesses and to operate businesses directly. Clearly, Korea will be a big market for us. We believe Japan could be a market for us. And Central and Southeast Asia, which would include Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, so some pretty substantial markets as we go forward, which should be nicely profitable as we go forward.","The key in all of that is Tommy have license expirations, really working hand-in-hand with our strategic licensing partners who've really done a great job in building the brand throughout Asia. The other opportunity will be Brazil. Calvin Klein has a very profitable business there that despite the economic conditions in Brazil continues to be close to 20% operating margin business for us and is about 25% -- the Tommy Hilfiger business in Brazil is about 25% the size of the Calvin Klein business in Brazil.","So clear growth opportunity there that we're doing with the strategic partner where we own a little bit over 40% of the joint venture and the ability there over time to bring that in-house will play itself out. So clear opportunities there. And that's really our focus area at this point, the focus areas at this point as far as license take backs.","John Kernan","Then shifting gears a little bit, Tommy Hilfiger International, the comps here have been incredibly consistent since you bought the brand. You're lapping double-digit comps with the high single-digit comps. Help us understand the drivers of this. Is this AUR driven? Is it traffic driven? Are there new stores coming in the comp base? How sustainable are the continued comp store sales increases? How much more productive it can \u2013 can your direct business get in Europe?","Manny Chirico","Look, I think that business, as you said, has been real high performing for us, particularly over the last two years. And then we are putting on comps on top of comps and we're comping on top of double digit comps from last year in certain quarters. As we look at it, we continue to see opportunities. The big improvement in our retail stores has been very healthy women's business and I think that only continues.","If you think about the brand in Europe, it is 65% to 70% men's versus women's. And we all know how much larger the women's market is than men's. So that opportunity keeps presenting itself. The productivity in our stores continues to improve and a lot of it is being driven by the women's sales per square foot growing closer and closer to the men's productivity in those stores.","So the opportunity is there to continue this momentum and a big piece of it will be driven by the women's component getting better. And as our men's tailored business becomes a bigger piece of the pie and we continue to get strong success there throughout Europe at the wholesale level as we bring that product category into the stores, given the much higher price point, it really \u2013 it does wonders for the sales productivity in the stores.","The margins are comparable to our sportswear apparel margins and footwear margins. So clearly, the opportunity there is to grow men's tailored in our stores and to grow the women's businesses in our stores. And there's a lot of momentum behind those businesses. So I think we'll continue to see positive comps. I can't talk about double-digit comp store increases, but I can continue to say we'll continue to see momentum.","Europe seems much healthier as a market to us. I know all the headlines about Europe and what you see. But as far as the consumers being \u2013 spending discretionary money, it's very healthy there. I think the fact that the dollar has strengthened has only made our \u2013 the pressure that puts on our US business, I've talked about, the flip side of that is it really significantly helps our international businesses as people travel or people stay closer to home in Europe, within Europe and buy when they're on vacation or on holiday that's really been a big win for us as well. So I think those trends will continue.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Tracy with Brean Capital.","Eric Tracy","I guess just a point of clarification, in terms of the spring order book, CK up 20% and I believe Tommy up 7%, just to make sure that was Europe? And if so, can you provide the global order book for spring?","Manny Chirico","Two things. Yes, to confirm, that was Europe. Second, we don't give global order book because most of our businesses tend to be retail based, not wholesale based. It's a misleading statistic, I think. And secondarily, in the US, we never give order books because we just don't believe in laying that out, given the fragile nature of orders in the United States. So there's a lot of momentum behind the business. Nothing has changed, but it doesn't make sense to call those out.","Eric Tracy","And then just a follow-up on that in terms of Europe, I mean, you mentioned some of the dynamics at play that sort of support that European business. But maybe just a little bit more color both for CK and Tommy in terms of the drivers, is it accelerating on the jeans wear side, just continued strength in underwear, just a little bit more color on that would be great.","Manny Chirico","On the Calvin Klein side, look, it's more product categories. I don't mean to sound cavalier about it when I say it, is the strength is across all countries, all major countries, all product categories, we're really seeing tremendous growth in jeans and underwear because they're the two largest categories, but our accessory business is also performing very strong there.","We've just only recently launched men's sportswear. And the percentages there are very, very high, but the dollars there are small as it starts to roll out. And we haven't done anything with women's sportswear and apparel outside of jeans and underwear at all. So that's really a major opportunity for us as we move forward. [indiscernible] just match up from where we are positioned geographically in the United States and or even in Asia, where Calvin women's represents about 40% of the volume, there's a huge opportunity in Europe for that to continue.","Just to remind everybody, the European strategy, first and foremost, was to take a broken Warnaco jeans and underwear business that was in the wrong distribution at \u2013 and still basically breaking even. And when you pulled out the bad distribution it was losing money. Our European business today is healthy, growing. You see the international numbers. You see the margins there. So our European business is really contributing significantly.","If you use Tommy Hilfiger as a comparison, the Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe is three times the size of the Calvin business. It's the only region in the world where Tommy is larger than Calvin. The profitability is 200 basis points to 300 basis points higher and that has to do with scale. And I think those opportunities as the brand now, the Calvin brand has solidified its position has got a profitable foundation. The ability to take that forward and the enthusiasm that our wholesale partners have for the brand just makes us just more optimistic about this European trend could continue for the next three to four years.","Eric Tracy","And then if I could switch gears, I mean, Manny, when you think about the US retail business, understandably the currency, tourism challenges, but a little bit bigger picture, as you think about potentially rationalizing some of those stores, is that a fair thing or is it just you really believe the challenges are more cyclical in nature?","Manny Chirico","I guess, here is the dynamic, the stores we're talking about that are feeling the biggest pain from the international tourist market are also located in areas like Miami, Orlando, New York, Los Angeles that they are by far our largest stores from \u2013 and our highest product profitability stores. So I used as a comparison is the Macy's Herald Square is the most profitable department store in the world, I believe. And it's being impacted by international tourism, but it is still one of the largest, most profitable department stores in the world.","And not to put us in the same category as Macy's Herald Square, but these stores are our largest, most profitable stores. And I think this tourism will balance out. I'm not going to sit here and say it's coming back. But I do think as we get through the third and fourth quarter of this year, it should level off, and we will continue to have very profitable stores.","If you look at our retail profitability, it's as strong as our wholesale profitably. And you see how profitable our Calvin and Tommy North America businesses are, double-digit operating margins, very profitable businesses. So this is just a shift in sales trends. And I think our European business is benefiting from that shift and our Asia business is to an extent and our Latin America businesses, but the US retail business is just such a big component of our sales. We just feel it directly here. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question as our last question.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole","Just want to ask about the US wholesale business versus US retail because you mentioned international tourist sales as one reason the US retail business was weaker than the wholesale business. But is there another factor because the difference is pretty stark? What is allowing you to it seems like grow at a such greater rate in US wholesale relative to the peers and also relative to the retail business?","Manny Chirico","Well, I think there's two things, right. I think fundamentally, it's the two brands. What we\u2019re really talking about is Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. We talk about all the momentum in the wholesale department store channels in the United States. And I mean, if you talk to most department stores, they'll tell you how healthy the Calvin Klein business is, how it continue to fuel growth be it on the women's side of the floor or men's side of the floor.","So I think we do have, with the Calvin brand in particular, a lot of momentum behind the brand. We've been able to take advantage of some of the weakness with some of our competitors to grow square footage and to gain market share in that channel. So I think we are outperforming.","We positioned ourselves and I don't believe we've overextended our brands in that channel of distribution where other players have talked about that they\u2019ve overexposed and we've been continuing to grow, but I think we've been doing in a very healthy way. We're in categories that department stores really are focused on growing, women's and men's, and we've been a solution in both of those areas.","With the Tommy brand, with Macy's, it continues to perform very well for us on the men's side of the floor. And now with the G-III initiative, Macy's has really gotten behind the brand and the things that really can make up for some of the market share losses that they've had with other brands. So I think we've been better positioned. We know where we play in the US and understand that market positioning and it has worked for us even in difficult times like last year's third and fourth quarter. Our two brands really outperformed the competitive set. And I think that's what's paying off for us now as we move forward. I hope that explains it.","And with that, we're going to close our call. I thank everybody for their attention. We look forward to speaking to you in December about our third quarter results. And I wish everybody a great Labor Day. Have a nice day. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"18369":["PVH Corp.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer, Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relationship and Strategy and Development and Ken Duane, CEO of our PVH Heritage businesses.","Overall our fourth quarter and annual 2017 performance exceeded our expectations and demonstrated our ability to over deliver against our strategic and financial plan. We grew 2017 non-GAAP EPS above our long-term targets and grew at 17% even with the additional marketing investments we made during the year.","Overall, we grew fourth quarter and full year revenues 19% and 9% respectively. Throughout the year, our performance was driven by the momentum across our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses. With our heritage businesses achieving its financial plan. In particular, our international businesses continue to be the highlight of our performance. Europe, China, and Japan continue to be our healthiest market and today our international businesses represent over 50% of our revenues and over 60% of our EBIT.","Throughout 2017, despite the bankruptcies and store closures in the North American market, we saw a relatively strong performance in our wholesale businesses as we executed well and gained market share. We also experienced an improving trend in our retail business in the second half of the year as international tour of traffic stabilized in the domestic consumers shop. Broad based strength was seen across all distribution channels, wholesale retail and [indiscernible].","Digital continues to be our fastest growing channel, we saw outsized growth across our owned and operated and third party digital e-commerce businesses with revenues up over 20% for 2017. Our diversification of revenue and earnings streams will be further highlighted in 2018 as our international mix grows and we expand across all channels of distribution.","Now moving to our brands, let me begin with Tommy Hilfiger. Speaking about the brand, the Hilfiger brand health and relevancy only further strengthened in 2017. The brand continues to experience significant demand especially from new and younger consumers with both brand awareness and interest to purchase up on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, we are seeing broad-based strength across all businesses and I'm very pleased with the strong growth in our women's business in particular.","Consumer engagement continue to be a critical part of our strategy this year. Our recent Tommy Now spring 2018 show in Milan, continued to highlight the incredible consumer engagement and excitement around the brand. We have seen double-digit increases across all key metrics from only engagements to earn engagements and most importantly we have seen e-commerce traffic and sales increase.","In 2017, we leveraged our brand ambassador and key influences from Gigi Hadid as our women brand ambassador to the Chainsmokers our ambassadors for all Tommy Hilfiger men's category. And Shawn Yue as our local ambassador for Greater China.","We believe that investing in the Tommy Hilfiger brand via these brand ambassadors have and will continue to drive performance in our global growth category. For spring 2018, we announced two new exciting partnerships. First, Tommy announced a multi-year strategic partnership with four-times Formula 1 world champions Mercedes AMG Petronas motorsports.","Starting with the 2018 season, Tommy Hilfiger will be the official apparel sponsor of the Mercedes AMG Petronas motorsport. Building on the sports sponsorship heritage that Tommy has embraced since the first founding of its brand. Second, we announced our newest brand ambassador Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton. Lewis will represent the world of Tommy Hilfiger men's. These partnerships underscore Tommy Hilfiger's vision to continuously elevate and expand the brand in key markets and further drive the global growth of its men's business bringing the next generation of fans to the brand.","From a business perspective driven by these initiatives, Tommy increased sales 22% in quarter and 11% for the year. With earnings up close to 50% for the fourth quarter and 28% for the year. A truly outstanding performance. We continue to be extremely pleased with the response from consumers and are benefiting from market share gains in all regional markets. Our international revenues increased 37% in the fourth quarter and 19% for the year. Retail comp stores were up 6% for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year.","Our Tommy Europe outperformance continue as we saw incredibly strong business across all markets with strong sell-through at retail with lower year-over-year promotion. As I previously mentioned, our Spring Summer 2018 orderbook is up over 10%. We are now providing our full 2018 orderbook outlook and I'm quite happy to report that fall orders are again running up over 10%. We continue to be impressed by the continued strength of the brand and the reception from customers across all of our product divisions and across all of our markets.","Moving to Tommy Asia, the performance continues to be very strong there. As we continue to build upon the continued momentum in China benefiting from the integration and investment in the Tommy Hilfiger China business. Additionally, our Tommy Hilfiger Japan business had a terrific end to the year. That business has found solid footing and we have demonstrated our ability to successfully elevate the brand position in the highly competitive Japanese market and we see future growth for the brand as we move forward.","Moving to North America, I'm pleased to say that we feel strongly we have seen a clearance action point in this business. We started to see a turn in our retail business in the beginning of the summer and the momentum has accelerated in this business as we move through the second half. For the fourth quarter, we saw our business up 5% in revenues with an outstanding 10% comp in our retail business for the quarter along with solid gross margin improvement.","Importantly, we not only saw an improvement in our retail business, but also saw continued strength at wholesale. Our Macy's business in particular has been outstanding with strong sell-throughs at higher overall margins.","Moving to Calvin Klein. Creatively the Calvin Klein brand had a tremendous year. We believe the one singular brand vision articulated by the design team can be felt throughout the product category from the runway in our 205 campaigns down to our jeans and underwear marketing and product.","In particular over the last few months, the momentum around the CK brand has intensified with its cultural relevancy resonating and consumer interest in conversion to purchase seeing nice improvements. We believe we continue to reach a new consumer and we are expanding our distribution reach across all channels. From premium luxury doors to new specialty retail accounts. Our family by Calvins marketing campaign continues to perform very well for us across the globe.","I'm happy that I can finally talk about the Kardashian, Jenner sisters as well as the entire brand family from Solange, and ASP Rocky, to Gerber siblings, Millie Bobby Brown and Paris Jackson all of which are driving engagement with the brand. The impressions and engagements we have seen as we rolled out this campaign has been amazing. We are seeing strong engagement and most importantly strong spring selling as we move into the first quarter. Specifically, we believe these marketing initiatives underline our commitment to our consumer centric approach and engaging the consumer to live the Calvin Klein brand.","While we discussed our Calvin Klein Amazon fashion partnership for the holiday retail season, last quarter I'm pleased to report that it really helped to drive awareness to all our channels of distribution and continues to show that Calvin Klein is thinking first about the consumer and is thinking digital first as well.","From a product perspective 2017 also delivered strong performance across all major product categories with an incredible improvement in selling of course our jeans and accessory business around the world. We feel really good about the direction of the brand from a creative and fashion relevancy perspective but most importantly about the traction we are getting in our core existing categories as well as our newer, faster growing businesses in Europe and Asia.","From a business perspective, revenues increased 23% for the fourth quarter and 10% for all of 2017 reflecting strong global trends. With a 30% increase coming from our international business in the fourth quarter and revenues up over 20% in 2017. As we discussed previously and planned for the fourth quarter was the first quarter we lapped our investments from 2016 and we saw a 5% increase in overall earnings despite the planned $15 million increase in brand marketing investments.","We continue to see strong top-line growth out of Europe and China with North America experiencing improved sales trends across all channels. North America and international retail comp sales both decreased 4% in the quarter. From an international perspective, our Calvin Klein Europe business continues to deliver terrific results with market share gains across the region and strong sell throughs across all channels.","As we previously mentioned, the Calvin Klein spring 2018 order book is up over 25% and based on the strong selling we experienced during fall 2017 and spring today our fall 2018 orderbook is projected to be up again over 25%. We are quite pleased with the broad-based strength across the business with Calvin Klein jeans showing tremendous strength and outsized growth above our average orderbook growth.","The elevated jeans product, we have been focused on in rolling out has paid huge dividends for us. In Asia, Calvin Klein continues to perform well with improving trends across the region. China which represents over half the business continues to outperform other markets across all product categories.","During the quarter, and throughout the year, we are pleased to report that we have continued to see strong performance and momentum across our Greater China business and Southeast Asia. Calvin Klein North America's saw an acceleration of growth across all channels of business in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we saw a tremendous growth in our digital businesses in part driven by our Calvin Klein Amazon initiative and our Calvin Klein North America retail business saw an improvement in comp store trends versus the first nine months of the year with comp's up 4% for the fourth quarter.","Finally, in our heritage business revenues for the quarter and the year were flat in line with our plans and earnings were up 2% over the prior year. Retail comps were up 1% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the year given the challenging overall North American dynamics, we are quite pleased with the financial performance of our heritage businesses.","Looking out to 2018, overall, I believe our 2017 performance demonstrates our strong execution and our continued commitment to execute against our strategic priorities. In 2017, we purposely invest in the areas most impacted by the changing dynamics in the industry. The growing prominence of digital, the importance of having a nimble and responsive supply chain and our ever-present commitment to driving consumer engagement. In 2018, we continue to build upon the investments made in 2017 around talent, our global operating platforms and systems, our consumer experience and most importantly our brand.","From a regional perspective, business perspective in North America in the first quarter the environment continues to improve. Despite door closures and the recently announced Bon-Ton bankruptcy. Our all North American stores continue to see improving traffic trends with comps up mid-single digits for Calvin Klein and high single-digits in the Tommy Hilfiger business. Our heritage business is also seeing low single-digit comp store increases.","Our international business continues to see great momentum to-date with Tommy Hilfiger international business up mid-single digits and Calvin Klein international comps running up high-single digits. Asia is also benefiting from a strong Chinese New Year selling season. We believe that the incredible brand power behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger position us well in the marketplace against our competition and will drive continued momentum with earnings growth projected this year of between 13% and 15%. This earnings growth outlook reflects the macro-economic and geopolitical volatility around the world and the uncertain global retail landscape.","Given that backdrop, we are conservatively planning the second half of 2018. If this global landscape continues to stabilize and our business trends continue at this current level, we are in excellent position to outperform our 2018 financial guidance. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike to quantify the fourth quarter and full year results.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to briefly touch on 2017 and then move on to 2018. Overall, our fourth quarter benefited from the 53rd week in 2017. Comparable store sales percentages that I mentioned exclude the extra week of sales. Our reported revenues for the fourth quarter were up 19%, which exceeded our guidance and was inclusive of the 6% benefit from FX.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues were very strong up 22% inclusive of the 7% benefit from FX. The Tommy Hilfiger revenue increase was driven by exceptional international performance of 37% inclusive of a 13% benefit from FX. Outstanding performance in all geographies and channels drove the increase. Our Tommy Hilfiger international revenues included a comp store sales increase of 6%. Tommy Hilfiger North American revenues were up 5% inclusive of a 1% benefit from FX.","North America was driven by strength in retail with 10% comp's offset in part by a planned decline in off price sells. Our Calvin Klein revenues were up 23% inclusive of a 5% benefit from FX in the fourth quarter. Calvin Klein international revenues were very strong increasing 33% inclusive of the 10% FX benefit driven by outstanding performance in Europe and Asia. Our international comp store sales were up 4%. Calvin Klein North America revenues increased 13%, strong wholesale performance across all categories and retail comps of 4% drove the increase.","Our Heritage revenues were flat to the prior year with our retail business running comp store sales up plus 1% comp.","Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.58 was $0.28 higher than the previous year and $0.14 better than the top-end of our previous guidance. The EPS beat versus the prior year \u2013 versus the previous guidance was driven by strong business for approximately $0.10 favorable FX of $0.02 and favorable taxes net of interest were approximately $0.02.","We ended the full year 2017 with record revenue of $8.9 billion, an increase of 9% over the prior year inclusive of a 2% benefit from FX and non-GAAP earnings per share was $7.94 which was 17% higher than the prior year.","Moving on to 2018. For the full year 2018 we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be $9 to $9.10, 13% to 15% growth over the prior year. Included in our earnings per share is the positive impact of foreign currency translation of $0.35. Overall, we are projecting revenues to grow by about 7% including the positive impact of 3% related to foreign currency.","Overall operating margins are expected to increase approximately 20 basis points for the Company. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 8% inclusive of a positive impact to 4% related to foreign currency. Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned to increase about 50 basis points.","We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 9% inclusive of the 2% related to foreign currency. We are planning Calvin Klein operating margins to be down 20 basis points due to our highest operating margin business, the licensing business will be down as a result of the impact of the Bon-Ton bankruptcy. Inspire of the headwinds created by the Bon-Ton bankruptcy, we are still planning Calvin Klein earnings growth to be in the high-single digits.","Our Heritage business is planned to have relatively flat revenues and flat operating margins and is also negatively impacted by the effects of the Bon-Ton bankruptcy.","Interest expense for the year is planned to be about $120 million compared to the prior year amount of $122 million. This decrease is primarily the result of the lower interest EUR600 million bonds were issued in December of 2017, partially offset by higher interest rates in some of our variable debt. In 2018, we are planning to pay down at least $250 million of our debt. Stock repurchases in 2018 are planned to be between $200 million and $215 million. Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 14.5% to 15.5%.","As IRS regulations are expected to be issued later in 2018, related to the recent tax reform act of current estimates could be subject to change if the regulations differ from our current interpretation.","Capital expenditures for the year are planned at $450 million and reflect the $50 million shift from 2017 into 2018. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at $2.20 and $2.25 and includes approximately $0.20 of estimated positive impact for foreign currency translation.","Revenue in the first quarter is projected to increase 15% including positive impact of 6% from foreign exchange. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at a 19% increase including 9% related to foreign exchange. Calvin Klein revenue were planned to increase 17% including the positive impact of 5% related to foreign currency. Heritage brands are projected to increase 2%.","Interest expense is projected to be $29 million for the first quarter and taxes to be about 16% to 17% in the first quarter. And with that operator, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will open our question with Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Bob Drbul","Manny, I was surprised Mike didn't correct it, but it's A$AP Rocky.","Manny Chirico","You said ASP Rocky. ASP Rocky, but that's \u2013 we're going to give you a pass on that one.","Bob Drbul","But speaking of that, when you look at the marketing initiative underway at both of your big brands now, the Tommy brand and now the Calvin business, where do you think we are in terms of like the dollar expenditure or the rate? Do you think that you know \u2013 are you at a good level in dollars or rate? Can you just talk us through like how you think about the business investments that are going on around your two big brands there?","Manny Chirico","Okay Bob. I guess as I would say as a percentage of sales, I think we're at an appropriate level today to continue to drive the business and to drive the growth going forward. We've taken advantage over the last couple of years. Our outperformance to do what I think is interesting and brand moving initiatives, and to really build upon that, so I guess I would say as I think we're more than covered from a marketing point as we go forward. As we hopefully continue to outperform our financial results, I think we might \u2013 we would like to take some of that incremental profitability and put it back into the brand in event or initiatives that really I think could \u2013 are game changers like the Kardashians, like some of the things that we've done with Amazon and I think it's really trying to connect with that younger consumer that next-generation that's coming into the \u2013 both brands, you know making those emotional connections with them. So, we are clearly at a very strong level today from really were three years ago and we'll look to continue to do it opportunistically as we go forward.","Bob Drbul","Okay. And I guess just my second question is on, whether it's in the North America market in the first quarter, you know or even throughout Europe, is the weather impacting your business at all? Do you think it's hindering it, or can you just maybe address that a little bit for us please?","Manny Chirico","Well, I would say in the first quarter here in North America, our business trends are very strong. We're living through a bunch of snow storms that clearly didn't help business and trends and it doesn't seem like we can get out of this especially in the Northeast and Middle America and Midwest. We can't seem to get out of this dreary winter weather and move to spring early. So, we're really not seeing our business trends in North America. So, I'm very happy with our trends, but from what I hear from other people, it is having an impact.","In Europe, it's just very cold, it's very dreary and it is having some negative impact on traffic and conversation at those stores. So, as we are so clear with goods, we are very well setup for spring. We are ready to really rock and roll for spring and I think just working our way through that, we get some normal weather. I think business will really pop again in Europe.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thanks very much Manny. Good Luck.","Manny Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question from Erin Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Erin Murphy","Great. Thanks, good morning and really nice end to the year. I guess just expounding on Bob's questions on North America in Q1, broadly you do sound pleased with the environment. Could you talk a little bit more just about how you feel about the inventory in the channel, the promotional environment and then if you think about the summer and fall business, how are retailers effetely positioning the forward business there?","Manny Chirico","Okay. So, I think inventories have really claimed \u2013 came out of January in very strong position, not just our businesses which you know given the sales trends we were chasing product constantly through the fourth quarter. But I think you know when I walk the stores, I was in Macy's, I was in a number of retailers, I just see a very clean inventory position. I don't see the aggressive clearance sales that we saw this time last year. So, I think it's really benefiting in North America. Everyone's profitability as we move forward, and I think as \u2013 if I think the top-line will be falling, but I really think most retailers are going to be benefiting on a gross margin basis as we move forward to the spring summer.","Erin Murphy","Okay. And then maybe just talk a little bit more about the denim category you referenced some positive traction there. I believe you are launching Calvin's denim globally. Can you just talk about how you are expecting to \u2013 how you are expecting that launch to kind of unfold as we get throughout the back half of the year and how big is denim overall both for Calvin and Tommy, and just any other context for that category which seems to be picking up?","Manny Chirico","Look, globally, we're very happy with our trends across both Calvin and Tommy on the denim side of the business. We're really benefiting from this -- Seems to be a bit of the 1990s fashion cycle back into the brands. Our brands from particularly Tommy from the logo point of view continues to be a big deliver T-shirts, that whole jeans area and even our performance business is benefiting both in Calvin and Tommy from that trend in the market. So, I think we're very well positioned as we go forward from that. We are launching you know in fall. It's more of an internal matter. For the last few years we've been developing our jeans product both in North America and in Europe, and the two teams have worked very closely together, but we've transitioned that now to one denim center of excellence in Europe. The fall product that's been previewed with all the retailers is that product. I think it just is \u2013 it has made the brand presentation globally more cohesive and consistent and I think you will see particularly in North America an elevation of products as we go into the fall season. And the reception of retail from our partners has been very, very strong. ","You know I think from a consumer perspective, I think you will see a much sharper presentation of our varied fix that are there. I think at times we weren't as clear to the consumer about our fits as we could have been. I think that's been adjusted and I think it gets further adjusted and very crisp, concise, clear messaging to the consumer and I think that's what they want to see understand the Calvin product. And now, all of that again will be supported with marketing that will continue the Kardashian-Jenner partnership continues into the fall season, run through all of 2018. That's been a real lift combined with great products. I think we're feeling really strongly about that business and we're seeing tremendous growth in the order books throughout Europe and Asia in that business, and that's like first clear indication and sell through at retail dramatically improved over the last four months in the whole jeans category. So, I think we're really in excellent position to capture all of that.","Erin Murphy","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Michael Binetti","Hey guys good morning. Let me add my congrats on a great quarter. ","Manny Chirico","Thank you, Mike.","Michael Binetti","Let me just pick on the guidance for as second. I want to think about after first quarter, Manny you did mention that the momentum today could drive upside through year based on what you see into the business today, but certainly understandable with the bankruptcy in the channel last month, why you'd want to be conservative. You know the implied revenue momentum slows down a lot in the back half. But you have things like pretty stick order books in Europe, 8.2, you got great trends in first quarter that's even with weather in both continents. Can you just talk about where you have confidence that we don't have any kind of macro shocks? Where do you see the most opportunities in the global model to deliver outside the back half of things continue today's pace.","Manny Chirico","So, I'd say the biggest opportunity right now, I guess is \u2013 I think there's too big opportunities for us, it's North America particularly in all retail businesses which really seem to have momentum right now, and I think it's being driven by couple of things. I think it's a strong consumer sentiment. There is general sense that the consumer environment is fairly strong and some positive momentum around that consumer as we move forward, coupled with foreign currencies moving \u2013 you know where the dollar has weakened somewhat from where it was a year ago. We're seeing more and more international tourist traffic throughout the United States and for our two big brands Calvin and Tommy that really plays very strongly. So, we've seen a real uplift in North America on international traffic that usually drives a higher consumer spend on average at higher average unit retails given the global brand perception \u2013 position of both brands elevated throughout Europe and Asia compared to North America. The value equation is that great.","The other area where I think against our guidance, we clearly should really outperform as Europe. The order books are really running ahead of our guidance. We've been surprised by that, I think as we look \u2013 as we get through the first quarter and start to get even more visibility, we'll start to adjust the second half sales. But given the kind of growth that we've already been able to come out with and just our past practices of trying to be conservative in the guidance and moving it along with the trends and not wanting to disappoint, I think we have a real opportunity to outperform those two sales plans in particular and that would clearly drive profitability in the second half of the year.","Michael Binetti","Can I just ask a follow-up, I think you've given us enough bread crumbs on how you think 2018 plays. Maybe we could talk a little bit about non-core opportunities like licenses and M&A. I guess does U.S. tax reform change your ability to access cash to make some strategic moves. Do you see any licenses that make sense to bring into the business based on opportunities in front of you this year and then thoughts on the third big brand, obviously your playbook is working through more than one brand at this point. How actively are you looking at new ideas and if so, where are some of the more interesting areas that you might hunt?","Manny Chirico","Sure, I think \u2013 let me take that in pieces. One is, I think the tax changes really don't impact our ability or access to cash in order to make investments, you know just demonstrated by the last year, we've made a number of license buybacks, we've made a number of investments, it's not slowing us down at all. Thankfully, we are not capital constraint and our capital \u2013 our capital allocation and our capital structure is just dramatically improved over the last two years. That gives us a lot of access to cash at these levels which I think are relativity attractive interest rates.","So, we're not constraint at all from growth from cash and capital. We'll continue to look at license buybacks. I think the most interesting opportunities continue to be international with both Asia, particularly Greater China and the effort of Tommy Hilfiger brand, the Hong Kong, Macau, Central Southeast Asia market which is with a license partner today, that's an area that we look to aggressively move in. Brazil is another area that we think is on the uptick. I think that's probably a little further out, but that's an area where we also like to take back Tommy Hilfiger license over time and grow that business as aggressively as we have. We feel that that geographic region over the next 12 to 18 months is going to start to see some significant improvement against where they've been. So, we are looking at that opportunistically as well. And there are some product categories, opportunities. They are not large, but there are opportunities that we're looking at as well.","As far as the third brand, it's clearly an area that we're spending time on. We're trying to be aggressive and at the same time prudent. We are looking at different opportunities. I think we're not going to go very far field from where we've been, so I don't think the market has to worry about going all the way to \u2013 skewing one way or another into categories that we don't have expertise in. So, I think we are looking, we are impressive and we would hope that some opportunity would come across that make sense.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot guys and congrats again.","Manny Chirico","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Matthew Boss","Congrats on a nice quarter guys. ","Manny Chirico","Thanks.","Matthew Boss","So, larger picture, Manny, do you see anything structurally constraining your ability to reach the 12% multi-year margin target. And just as we think across the brand portfolio, where do you see the most opportunity or low-hanging fruit remaining from here?","Manny Chirico","I don't see it up. I don't see any problem over time, next three years getting to that 12% operating margin. I think probably our finance projections aren't any way near that, but I think structurally there is nothing that should stop us. The biggest -- in that light, the biggest issue that we've had to deal with has been currencies in the past. You know and again, I think if currencies like the euro were closer to a $1.30 to $1.35, we'd already be at 12%. Those -- that transactional hedge and transactional hit that we've had to take has really put pressure on our profitability and you saw that in 2015 and 2016.","So, we're starting to recover from that and we'll start to see improvement in 2018 and 2019. And if currencies stay with our obviously the opportunity there. I think the biggest opportunity from a product and a brand point of view or region point of view continues to be Calvin Klein Europe. That's totally driven by the fact that the business today Calvin Klein is about 40% or 45% the size of the Tommy Hilfiger business and we use that as a benchmark, because we think from a sportswear and most categories we're in Tommy Hilfiger was the leader in market share throughout Europe and we believe on the more modern contemporary side will flow away from the traditional more U.S. preppy type of product that Tommy had we think Calvin can have a similar size business in Europe which would basically translate into a doubling in size over the next five years.","So that continues to be I think our biggest opportunity, I think after that both Calvin and Tommy have an unlimited runway in Asia driven by the growth that can come from China and our position with China in that region in the greater China market that continues to be a growth area for us and I think given our development in those two areas our operating platforms in Europe and Asia we're in excellent position to take advantage of those opportunities as we move forward and as we've done for the last three years.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow-up question. So, the 20% growth in digital to me was a clear call out. I guess what's your sales penetration of digital today? Do you think this kind of growth is sustainable and what's the best way to think about your digital margins versus your seller margin today and the best way to think about it going forward?","Manny Chirico","Okay. Our, I would say our digital penetration today on a retail sales basis not because a lot of our transactions are on a wholesale basis selling through always pure play and retail department store, customers. I think our penetration round numbers is around 10% and I think we would target over the next five years that it should be 20%.","The profitability in that channel overall is very similar to our profitability across our other channels. I think the wholesale business there is very nicely profitable and as we scale or direct to consumer e-commerce business that's clearly today under -- is not as profitable as our other channels of distribution. But we believe that's really scale driven, and as that scale grows there is no reason why that scale shouldn't be double-digit kind of operating margin moving forward and a 10% to 12% kind of range in our direct consumer e-commerce platform. Very similar to our retail model.","So, I think that's where we're headed and I think it feels like those numbers are very attainable as we start to drive the business forward.","Matthew Boss","Its great color. Best of luck.","Manny Chirico","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi Research. Your line is open.","Kate McShane","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Manny, I was wondering if you remind us with your Amazon business. Do you have a percentage or a general percentage of mix of what is pure fashion versus more replenishment?","And I'm just asking because I wonder how this mix might change over the upcoming year? And any insights on to how people are buying fashion versus more of the [indiscernible] product?","Manny Chirico","At this point in time, given our mix of product and their propensity to sell core much better than fashion at this point in their evolution. I think we're between 70% and 80% core replenishment. Core are basic kind of product. And I think that mix will change over time, but I think it's -- right now depends whose crystal ball you look into.","Right now, at this point in time I think that's a slow evolution as the consumer really gets more and more comfortable about buying fashion online and how well not only Amazon, but lot of the pure plays present fashion. I think their algorithms and how we drive the business are very much built on a replenishment continue to keep the consumer happy in key core categories. The maturity level at Amazon in particular when it comes to fashion needs to be further developed, it's just not where it needs to be right now and I think clearly that on it and there is opportunity there, but they don't have the metrics at this point and they don't have the presentation of product at this point that would really drive it.","Kate McShane","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you and Mike, I just wanted to ask a question about gross margins. I wondered what was being contemplated for some of the higher commodity cost that's here like cotton will there be any planned price increases and any thoughts around the potential for that and how that might be managed?","Mike Shaffer","Okay. So, I guess overall product cost we're looking at low single-digit kind of growth very low-single digits. We've seemed to manage to offset and move around get the price benefits we needed to offset some of the hot link. We have been feeling some pressure on silk and a lot of talk about freight, but freight have not impacted us the nature of our contracts are a little longer-term I think the most. So, we've managed to not see any freight increases.","On duties and tariffs, we do business, we do bring product in from China. If there were changes we would be impacted to some degree, it is one of our larger countries. However, for the U.S. it's not as significant as one might think. So, while we're about a third of our business coming from China for the company. the U.S. is only between 20% to 25%.","And I think when you look across the retail or the wholesale landscape, I think you'll find that that's much lower than most others in terms of how people source from China today. So there would be an impact, but we would over time look to raise prices and or move product out of that country over time.","Manny Chirico","And I guess Kate, the only thing I would add and I'll do a commercial. We are really opposed to the idea of tariffs to solve the problems, to solve this problem with China. Clearly there's a problem with China, it's not a level playing field and we -- and I personally think the administration needs to be aggressive and need some tools to bring China to able to have a reasonable negotiation. But it just doesn't seem appropriate for an apparel category that already has tariffs between 20% and 30% on our goods coming in from China today to think about putting another 25% on top of that.","It's not logical, it doesn't seem like that's really what where the wind is blowing in Washington that apparel would be one of the targeted categories but there's no guarantees, but that's how it -- what it feels like. It feels like as a parent if my son does something wrong this feels like I'm punishing my daughter for his misdeed. So, it's just does not, it's not logical to us that apparel tariff should be the weapon of choice if we're going to really deal with technology, communication, heavy industry issues with China that seems to place appropriately.","And sorry for the commercial.","Mike Shaffer","And Kate just overall for our guidance for 2018, we've reflected about 90 basis points of improvement in gross margin. A portion of that is mix. We are seeing our international businesses grow faster with higher gross margins and a portion of that is getting --.","Kate McShane","Thank you. Very helpful.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chethan Mallela from Barclays. Your line is open.","Chethan Mallela","Hi, good morning. I just want to ask about the True & Co acquisition that you're now surrounded a year ago. Can you provide an update on how that integration is gone and I think at the time of the announcement it's expected to see some benefits from their data mining expertise and sort of leveraging your capabilities to grow the brand?","To be helpful to get just a better sense of how that manifested.","Manny Chirico","Look, it's been from an integration perspective we've definitely seen the company move into PVH without a hitch. We've managed to retain the talent, we've managed to keep the systems up and running and it's been a good learning experience for us. Just to put it in perspective, it was a fairly small acquisition in PVH.","As we look backward at the acquisition, we did talk about some of the benefits of data. We are working with the True team, and the True team is working with the PVH team. We have seen some benefits across divisionally particularly in the underwear and the women's intimates categories and consumer data is a focus for us and we are moving it forward through True and with our underwear and intimates group with PVH.","Manny Chirico","Yes. And the only thing I'd add is the learning's that we really gotten have been on the data mining side. We're really sharing across platform both Calvin, Tommy and True to really understand that consumer and his shopping behaviors. And we've also learned a lot about what's the most efficient way to gain eye balls, drive sales and traffic we really had some real learning's that I think will benefit particularly the Calvin Klein business as we move into 2018, our online digital business about having to be more efficient with some of our advertising.","Chethan Mallela","Great. And then just sort of a quick follow-up. Can you just mention how you are thinking about the Chinese New Year shift in the context of the sales and EPS guidance for 1Q?","Manny Chirico","Yes. Sure, so Chinese. As I think Chinese New Year was a negative for us in the fourth quarter of 2017 and was nice positive for us in first quarter of 2018. And I think it explains part of the reason why the sales momentum and the earnings growth in the first quarter significantly exceeds guidance for the full year besides our conservatism about second half of the year, the first quarter is really benefiting from Chinese New Year.","And I think that does it well.","Chethan Mallela","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Manny Chirico","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Heather Balsky","Hi, thank you for taking my question. Can you just talk about your supply chain initiative and where you are in terms of the market and your ability to take down? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Sure. Mike?","Mike Shaffer","Yes, look speed to market is a focus for us. One of our opportunity continues to be more and more on the core product side. We've made great strides in terms of replenishment product and being able to do quick replenishment in 10 to 20 days in terms of getting product from factory or from order to the North America and even in Europe now as well.","So, we're very much up and running on the basic categories and on the core categories of our business and now we're moving more into the read and react and the fashion categories and trying to understand how to get quick replenishment or quickly back into goods there. So, we've made some great strides on the underwear side of the business and on the dresser side of the business and now continuing to move that forward outside of those two categories.","Manny Chirico","And if I could just let, the last point I'd just add to that is particularly in our international markets which I don't think in general are as developed from a core replenishment point of view as our North American businesses, I think there's been a lot of progress made there I think that has been a big part of our outperformance. If you're able to get, you get great sell throughs and great selling, if you're not able to keep that momentum going you lose the momentum and you lose the potential sale and the teams have done a great job of positioning product, positioning inventory and raw materials in order to really narrow that cycle and capture that growth opportunity.","And I think that's one reason over the last six to nine months you've seen our inventory grow a little bit more than our sales growth because we're really making those investments in raw materials, positioning in order to have the goods in order to sell it and the risk on that core replenishment business from a markdown point of view is very low when you think about it both even in core sportswear it's very low and you just have carry close to the inventory and given our margins globally and even in the United States on core being so high the pay back on that is tremendous.","So, I think it's been a great investment for us and I give the management teams great credit for going after it.","Heather Balsky","Right. Thank you and as a follow-up on operating margin would you be able to help sort of break it down a little bit more for 2018. There are a couple of I guess, one-time items like the Bon-Ton bankruptcy and the 53rd week and you're getting a benefit from currency. Could you just help us piece it all together? Thanks.","Mike Shaffer","Yes. Look, I guess I have been trying to lump it all together and when I, the way I look at it is we've got about $0.35 in benefit for FX we've got a hit of about $0.20 on the Bon-Ton which reflects both direct business as well as hit on the licensing business and then the 53rd week losing it this year offset by the benefit of the Chinese New Year is worth a dime.","And that's how I have been just pushing it altogether at this point.","Manny Chirico","Yes. I think that explains the earnings really well. And I think on the margin side Mike laid it out really well the details by business category. The Bon-Ton particularly on the licensing side of the business, it's got -- obviously licensing is a 100% gross margin business with no product cost. So, when you lose a nice stream like that and we're really planning it for zero this year that has a minor hit on the Calvin Klein operating margins for 18, which I think if you took that out of it you'd be seeing growth on those operating margins.","Heather Balsky","Okay. Thank you, again.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","John Kernan","Good morning, Manny and Mike. Thanks for squeezing me in. A follow-up question on the conservatism and the guidance for the back half. Would you consider reinvesting into SG&A if the environment does turn out to be better than what you're planning for at this point. You've obviously earned some fairly high returns on the top-line from the marketing investments in fiscal 17. So just wondering if you ramp that back up in the back half should the environment get?","Manny Chirico","Well, I think a couple of things. John we're maintaining even with the investments we made in 17, the incremental investments. We're maintaining that marketing spend as a percentage of sale at that level. So, we're not backing away from where we are. I think there is a potential that we might potentially invest a little bit more if we outperform significantly. And I don't have the math in front of me because part of that outperformance would be driven by top-line growth and if grow the top-line we'll increase the marketing spend as a percentage of sales and might be if there is something that's dramatic that we could do from a marketing point of view like we did with Amazon, what we've done with the Kardashians or Lewis Hamilton. Might we want to take advantage of that, yes.","But we would only do that in the context of outperforming our plan. So, I think the guidance we've given the projections we have more than enough marketing, SG&A investment in order to deliver the plan and beyond. It's just a question if we start to outperform, I think we will take some of that outperformance and put it back into the brand and the growth initiatives.","And that formula for last three years has worked really well for us as we've been able to in a tough environment continue the momentum keep going. So, the real focus will be marketing and digital investments and we're making substantial, but being able to do more could drive business in the future.","I think operator will take our last question.","Operator","And our last question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Ike Boruchow","Hi. Thanks, good morning. And let me add my congrats. I guess Manny just a quick one from me. You talked about how clean the U.S. whole channel looks right now. You also talked about a plan pullback at Tommy within the U.S. the off-price channel. Please talk about how you're looking at the off-price space maybe into 2018 now just for Tommy but also just Calvin is going to thinking about how you are, thinking about that channel as you balance your growth domestically.","Manny Chirico","Sure. I think that you used the last sentence is really the key. It's all about balance. I think as that channel distribution is not a channel I shop directly all that often, but it's a channel that continues to appear pretty healthy to me. I know there has been some blips along the way and some of those things. But I think as a child we off-price retailers continues to gain share in the overall market and it's a market that in the U.S., if done appropriately is a great compliment to your business and to your profitability but it needs to really be done appropriately.","For us, what we've done over the last four years is as our top-line has grown we've actually lowered the percentage of our exposure into that channel although the total dollars are about flat as a percentage of sales it's come down. I think that will be more of the strategy as we go forward and we want to especially for the two big brands Calvin and Tommy, we want to as we are really expanding our higher end component of that business both the Calvin with some of our key retailers in North America and Tommy with some of those key retailers in what I would call the premium distribution. Macys up, we want to really support that, so we don't want to be exposed in the off-price channel.","But I think there is a balance given the dynamics of this market and we continue to press those levers going forward. And with that, we're going to close our call. I want to wish everybody a Happy Easter and a happy Passover and we look forward to speaking to you at the end of May and early June about our first quarter results.","Have a great day everyone.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President in charge of Business Development and Investor Relationships; and Ken Duane, the CEO of our Heritage business and\/or North American Wholesale businesses. ","Overall we were quite pleased with our fourth quarter results which matched the top end of our earnings guidance despite the highly challenging market environment and foreign currency headwinds. In the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis revenues increased 5% and EPS grew 30%. Mike Shaffer will take you through the details of the financials for the quarter and our guidance and I\u2019ll also highlight some of the issues surrounding foreign currencies, which I know there is a lot of interest in. ","I\u2019m going to get into the business right now and talk about Calvin Klein. In the fourth quarter revenues on a constant currency basis increased 6%, while earnings increased about 9%, driven by strong sales performance in our North American business and higher international operating margins due to the elimination of clearance and off price sales in Europe and Asia. ","Moving into the first quarter, we have seen a significant improvement in our international sales trends. Retail comp store sales are running ahead of plan in the first quarter and trending up high single digits in Asia with particular strength in China and South East Asia. We are also seeing high single digit increases in our European businesses on a comp store basis, so both regions really are performing much stronger for us. ","In Europe the CK wholesale business continues to improve with our 2015 spring and fall order books, excluding Russia up about 10% over the prior year. ","In North American our CK retail comps are running on plan up low single digits. We are seeing strong sales in our domestic permanent population stores, while our stores located in international tourist destinations like Miami, Orlando, New York and Las Vegas are feeling the pressure from the weaker international tourist traffic, which we believe is a direct result of the strengthening U.S. dollars impact on international travel to the U.S. ","Focusing now on some of the Calvin Klein brand initiatives and update, our Calvin Klein jeans and underwear marketing initiatives have focused on reaching new consumers over the last 12 months. We have increasingly invested in and focused on our digital outreach through our #My Calvin Klein\u2019s campaign and our subsequent extension of that campaign with our spring 2015 Calvin Klein jeans and other wear campaign featuring Justin Bieber and Lara Stone which launched in January. ","We have seen a significant increase in the number of fans since the launch and we have generated well over 30 million fan interactions to-date. From a business perspective this has allowed Calvin Klein to engage with our existing and new customers and has helped to drive purchases of the brand. ","Further to the initial My Calvin\u2019s campaign, the spring 2015 campaign featuring Justin Bieber was the number one global trending topic on Twitter at launch. We have seen traffic more than double on calvinklein.com and the campaign in the first two weeks achieved over $350 million of publicity value. We believe the campaign has helped to continue to fuel the momentum that we are seeing in our jeans and underwear businesses globally. ","From a product point of view I\u2019m going to focus on the Calvin Klein underwear first. We have delivered new core product along with significantly improved and elevated packaging. We have launched two new men\u2019s programs globally, Intense Power and Air FX for spring 2015 and have seen very promising initial selling results. As a reminder, Intense Power is what Justin Bieber was featured in and has sold well at retail. Air FX is more of a performance underwear, which taps into what is happening more broadly in the active arena.","In the women\u2019s area our modern cotton logo initiative leverages the best of what Calvin Klein underwear does for men and translates if for women with an active appeal. Modern cotton continues to drive the improvement in our woman\u2019s business in North American and Europe. ","We have also continued investing in our point of sale presentation, with new graphics and new fixtures. In addition, we have upgraded and installed new shops in key markets in the U.S., in New York, Miami, the West Cost, in California, San Francisco. Additionally we have installed new shops in stores internationally in key markets throughout Europe and Asia. ","In the U.S. over the last six months our men\u2019s and woman\u2019s businesses have picked up market share across the department store landscape. Average unit retails continue to be up about 10% year-over-year driven by full price selling of the new product launches. Overall underwear sales are running up high single digits at retail in the first quarter. ","In Europe men\u2019s continues to outperform with the women\u2019s performance driven by elevated fashion components added to the business. Overall sales in the first quarter are running up mid-single digits at retail. ","In Asia we continue to see great performance on the elevated Black Label product across both men\u2019s and women\u2019s. Our women\u2019s bra business in Asia continues to outperform every other region and the Perfectly Fit collection for women is ranked as the number one or number two performing collection in all key Asian regions. Overall sales in the first quarter are running up high single digits at retails.","Moving to our Calvin Klein jeans; in the jeans area new product has been delivered and we are seeing a good reaction from consumers, particularly where we have installed new jeans shops. In North American we have installed 225 shops in 2014, 150 men\u2019s shops and 75 women\u2019s shops. In the newly installed shops we\u2019ve experienced a 40% retail sales increase over the prior year. ","For 2014 AURs were up about 15% and that trend has continued into the first quarter of 2015. We are targeting 150 new shop installations in the North American for fiscal 2015. In Europe we are in early stages of a turnaround in the jeans business. We have sold over 60 new jeans shops throughout Europe. We have significantly improved the quality level of our jeans line with better fabrics, trims and packaging. We are effectively out of all off-price retailers in Europe beginning in the first quarter of 2015. ","We have closed approximately 40 underperforming stores over the last 18 months. We have opened 11 Calvin Klein jeans free standing stores in the second half of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, we are renovating our stores in London, Rome, Venus and Milan to our new jean concept shops and we expect them to open in the second quarter of \u201915.","The jeans business in Europe is seeing improved sell-throughs and higher AURs in the first quarter with growth across all markets with the exception of Russia. At wholesale our 2015 European order books excluding Russia are up about 10% over the prior year.","Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger; on a constant currency basis revenues for the Tommy Hilfiger business increased 9% for the fourth quarter while operating earnings on a constant currency grew 10%. In North American we posted a 1% comparable store sales increase and as we moved into the first quarter comp sales trends have basically continued at this level, running about flat to date primarily driven by lower international lower traffic in those key centers, while domestic permanent population centers are running up low single digits as well. ","At wholesale, our European business continues to outpace the competition. As an indicator, our 2015 European order book ex-Russia is running up about 5% compared to the prior year. Internationally we are seeing growth on a constant currency basis throughout our international business. The growth in the fourth quarter was driven by our strong European business, both at wholesale and retail. The European retail comp stores increased 6% in the fourth quarter. As we moved into the first quarter comps are on plan running up low single digits order-to-date. ","From a brand perspective, for the Tommy Hilfiger brand we continued to focus on driving the brand globally to elevated product development and engaging marketing campaigns. In 2014 we successfully launched our new Tommy Hilfiger e-commerce site, which we believe effectively integrates commerce and brand experience. Since the new site is launched, we have seen a significant increase in traffic and consumer engagement on our site, which has resulted in strong growth in our fourth quarter e-commerce sales. ","We continued to evolve our consumer engagement through increased digital marketing and media spend. As we focus on driving some of our key brand initiatives, including growing our underdeveloped Tommy Tailored business and our Tommy Underwear business we recently announced that Rafael Nadal will be our brand ambassador for the fall marketing campaign. This campaign will focus on those two key product categories, Tailored and Men\u2019s underwear, which we believe we have significant growth opportunities to capture. ","Moving to our Heritage business; our Heritage business has a difficult fourth quarter with revenues down 3%, principally driven by poor performance of our dress shirt business. Operating income declined $12 million in the fourth quarter as clearance mark downs were required to balance inventories and clear excess goods. We believe this dress shirt issue is behind us as we entered 2015 and we begin to see this business turnaround in fiscal 2015. Moving in to the first quarter, our sportswear businesses have continued to perfume with retail comps running up about mid-single digits quarter-to-date. ","Before I turn it over to Mike, I just want to focus on the key initiatives as we move forward. As we move over the next three years, our key objective will be capturing the long term revenue and profit opportunities for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. There are really five key initiatives that we hope to accomplish over the next three years and that you should be monitoring as we go forward. ","The first is to continue to invest in product, presentation and the marketing of the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. Second, we continue to invest in our global operating platforms to support our growth strategies, including key investments in our digital commerce systems and platforms. Third, significantly improving the operating results of the Calvin Klein European business over the next three years, so that it is comparable to the strong operating performance of our Tommy Hilfiger business in Europe. ","Fourth, continue to invest in the expansion of our presence in Asia and Latin America for both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein as we see these markets as our greatest growth opportunities for the band. And finally, assuming more direct control over our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger license businesses over the next three years, where we can maximize our core competencies to increase sales and our overall profitability. ","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mike to quantify the fourth quarter results and to put more color on some of the guidance that we gave.","Mike Shaffer ","Thanks Manny. The comments I\u2019m about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I\u2019m going to briefly touch on the fourth quarter of 2014 and move on to 2015. ","Our overall 2014 revenues were close to plan and excluding the impact of foreign currency, the strong growth in Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses was offset by a decline in our Heritage business. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 9% on a constant currency basis in the quarter with strong wholesale performance in North American. In Europe Tommy Hilfiger retail posted 6% comps from buying the square footage expansion, while the wholesale business recorded mid-single digit growth. ","Calvin Klein also had a strong quarter with revenues up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven in large part by North American wholesale, in particular our underwear business. In addition, both Tommy and Calvin experienced increases in the fourth quarter operating margins versus the prior year. ","Heritage revenues were down 3% for the quarter due to poor performance in our Dress Shirt division. Within our Dress Shirt business the short fall in revenue was coupled with the decline in gross margin due to heavy markdowns as a result of excess inventory levels, which significantly lowered our Heritage operating margins. ","Benefiting the fourth quarter versus the prior and our guidance was a decrease in the tax rate driven by discreet items. Overall, we delivered earnings per share growth of 23%, even with the $0.10 per share negative impact from foreign currency exchange. ","As we look to 2015 we need to take a moment to understand the mix of our businesses, revenues and earnings and the impact of the strength in the U.S. dollar. As we called out in our press release, our earnings before unallocated U.S. corporate expenses are about two thirds international, which heavily exposes us to exchange rate fluctuations on both the transaction and translational basis. ","Our exposure at a transactional level was mostly due to our international divisions purchasing their inventory in U.S. dollars. To partially protect against this, we bought forward exchange contracts about 9 to 12 months out for about 80% of our projected inventory purchases made by our international divisions in U.S. dollars. Our exposure at a translation level is due to the converting the revenue and earnings of our international division into U.S. dollars. Like most companies we do not hedge translation and we don\u2019t believe we should be gambling on billing on currency fluctuations. ","In 2015 we are anticipating based on currency exchange rates that we will be impacted negatively by about $1.20 of earnings per share for foreign exchange. The $1.20 impact was approximately two thirds driven by translation and one third driven by transaction. Our largest currency exposures are the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian Real. ","In addition to the impact of the strengthening dollar, the turbulent economic and political issues in Russia projected to reduce earnings in our Russian business by about $0.10. The business remains profitable, but at a much lower level than in the prior year. Going forward we will be discussing these impacts on material and offering the constant currency view of our operations to measure the true health of our business. ","For the full year 2015 we are projecting earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.90. If we exclude the negative impact of FX in Russia of $1.30 we have earnings per share growth of 10% to 12% over the prior year. Overall, we are projecting revenues of approximately $7.9 billion, which includes a negative impact of over $500 million related to foreign currency. On a constant currency basis we are projecting revenues to increase about 3%. ","Overall operating margins are expected to increase about 20 to 30 basis points, excluding the negative impact of about 60 basis points due to FX, driving the growth when excluding foreign currencies continued improvement in the Calvin business, which was projecting revenues to grow 5% on a constant currency basis. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 30 to 50 basis points excluding a negative impact of 20 basis points of FX. ","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 3% on a constant currency basis with operating margins playing relatively flat excluding a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points of FX. Our Heritage business has planned to have a revenue decrease of 4%, due mostly to existing the Izod retail business in 2015. ","Operating margins in the Heritage businesses have planned to increase about 60 to 80 basis points as our wholesale business continues to show gross margin improvements, particularly in Dress Shirts. The impact of foreign currency in our Heritage business is immaterial. ","Interest expense for the year is planned to be between $100 million and $125 million compared to the prior year amount of $139 million due to our average lower debt balances. Also favorably impacting interest for 2015 is the debt refinancing we did in the second half of last year\u2019s first quarter. Our tax rate for the year was planned at about 22%, which is mostly in line with the prior year. ","First quarter earnings per share are planned at $1.35 to $1.40 and includes $0.30 of estimated negative impact for foreign exchange and the decline in our Russian business. Excluding this impact we are expecting earnings per share to increase 12% to 16% for the first quarter. ","Revenue in the first quarter is projected to increase 2% on a constant currency basis. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned at 2% constant currency increase and Calvin Klein is planned at 3% constant currency increase. Heritage Brands revenues are projected to decrease 1%. Interest expense is projected to be $30 million and taxes to be about 25% to 26% in the first quarter and lastly, we currently expect debt pay down to be at least $425 million in 2015. ","With that we\u2019ll open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Bob Drbul with Nomura. ","Bob Drbul","Hi. Good morning Manny, good morning Mike. Hi Dana.","Manny Chirico","Good morning Bob.","Mike Shaffer","Good morning Bob.","Bob Drbul","Manny, on the Calvin Klein jeans business, can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of like the progress that you have seen. What the response has been from both consumers and from the retail partners. And as we sort of go through this year, like the biggest milestones that we should be focused on around pricing, around off price, and just around the product standpoints. ","Manny Chirico","So Bob I think it will be \u2013 I think in North American the real focus for the next twelve months will be improving the profitability of that business as we really focus on selling full priced merchandise here in North American, which heretofore had been a challenge for that business, particularly over the last three of four years. So we really are turning the percentages upside down. We are really trying to drive growing full price selling and at the same time taking market share. ","I believe when you look at the business, where you\u2019ll see that manifest itself in the Calvin Klein North America business is on a constant currency basis seeing operating margins continue to improve in that business as we go forward and we will be reporting at retail with our key department store accounts, the fact that we are seeing strong sell thoughts of that product. ","Hopefully you will also be seeing \u2013 because I know you shop, you will also be seeing in North America a much more elevated presentation at retail with our key accounts Macy's, Lord & Taylor, Dillard\u2019s, both in the jeans and the underwear area and overall you should be seeing higher averaging at retails going out the door. ","In our international business it\u2019s probably even more transparent because a bigger component of that business for us is direct to consumer, where we are in control both the environment and selling space and we report those results on a retail basis. ","So I think there the business particularly in Asia, which is a highly profitable business model, there it should be on top line growth in both of those categories as we go forward and we are starting to see that in the first quarter of this year with a real enhancement of product as we have rebalanced more of our selling into the full price area away from clearance and promotional sales. That comparison in Asia is pretty much behind us now, so we are really getting an apples-to-apples comparison beginning in 2015. So for us that will be the driver. ","In Europe, we continue to focus on the order book, continuing to see our price points increase at retail and our presentation across the broad on the Calvin Klein brands. So I think that profitability will be very transparent when we report results. ","Bob Drbul","And Manny, when you think about like the five year plan that you talked about on the Calvin Klein jeans wear business, where are we in sort of the profitability in the game plane that you\u2019ve laid out. Like where did we end \u201914? How do we think about it for \u201915 from your five year perspective? ","Manny Chirico","Well, I think fundamentally when you look at the business in Asia and in Brazil, that business is running at an optimal level from our operating margin point of view. Mid-teens operating margins are a very healthy business, being impacted obviously by what\u2019s going on with foreign currencies, but when you really get into the fundamentals of the business and what\u2019s really driving it, that\u2019s a very healthy business, both jeans, underwear, all product categories in those two regions as well. ","So I believe the enhancements that you will see will be hopefully on a local currency basis you\u2019ll see some continued operating margin improvement, but what you really should start to see beginning in \u201915 is some top line growth as we\u2019ve eliminated the off price clearance sales that existed in the business. ","In the U.S. and European businesses, both of those businesses are basically a breakeven for jeans business model for us today. So we clearly believe that we have the opportunity there to bring those margins over the next four to five years to approach 10%. Every other Calvin Klein business that we run in Europe and in North America are running at double digit operating margins for us. ","So it\u2019s really cleaning up the problems of the past, getting the brand presented, making those investments the last 18 months and continuing that into this year, but each year proceeding an improvement in the operating margins of our business as we go forward, so that when we get over the next three to four years you will start to approach those double digit operating margins for jeans in New York and North American. ","Bob Drbul","And Manny, just one quick question, on the marketing front, can you just direct. There\u2019s a lot of discussion in social media around Justin Bieber\u2019s campaign. Was there airbrush work there done or not?","Manny Chirico","Could you just say the last part Bob, you broke up on the phone, I\u2019m sorry. ","Bob Drbul","The Justin Bieber marketing campaign, could you just talk about the amount of airbrushing that went on in that campaign. ","Manny Chirico","It was his head on my body Bob. No look that campaign was totally legitimate. Justin Bieber is a controversial figure which we love. It created so much buzz, just that whole controversy around the campaign. It\u2019s right up the heritage of the brand. It\u2019s what we really want to stand for, getting parodied on Saturday Night Live. So all of that I just think created marketing buzz around the brand. He is a terrific young man who is really turning his career around and we are trying to be as supportive as possible as he moves forward. ","Bob Drbul","Great Manny, thanks very much. Good luck this year.","A - Manny Chirico","Thank you. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group. ","David Glick","Great, I get to follow that up. Okay Manny, first question \u2013 a couple of questions. First, the Tommy Hilfiger business obviously has been very strong since you acquired it and the revenue outlook a little bit shy of where Calvin is. I just was wondering if you could give us some color on why the top line in Tommy is planned a little bit below Calvin. Are there any issues or challenges underlying that or maybe just a function of a tougher comparison? ","Manny Chirico","David, it\u2019s a great question. I think from a macro point of view, we are really dealing with some headwinds going forward. The Tommy business, the strength of the Tommy business has been its geographic diversity and the strong brand positioning and the strong operating and financial characteristics that the European business carriers. ","I think fundamentally when you think what\u2019s going on with currencies around the world, in Europe in particular, but Brazil as well two big markets for both Calvin and Tommy, but in particular for Tommy in Europe there\u2019s is a reason those currencies are under so much pressure. The underlying economic statistics there are just feeling the pressure. ","So it\u2019s the fact that our order book is running up mid single digits, 4% to 6% depending on the season, in and of itself is disappointing to us. When we look on a historic basis where we had double digit increases in 2010, \u201911 and \u201912, but clearly from what\u2019s going on from the macro point of view, we feel we are substantially getting market share during the same timeframe. But that doesn\u2019t change the dynamic that\u2019s going on, that we\u2019re only planning our comps to grow low single digit in Europe and we\u2019re planning the wholesale business to also grow in that 2% to 4% range for the second half of the year.","So Tommy has consistently surprised us on the upside with their results and we are in a little bit of a period of now being up against some really tough comparisons last year and prior years and going into the headwinds of just a really challenging market. So I think that\u2019s the biggest issue that\u2019s facing us there. ","I think as things start to improve, there\u2019s no reason why that business doesn\u2019t get back to a blended growth rate of closer to 6% to 7% to 8%, which we think we are very comfortable with and really for that brand there continues to be substantial opportunities for us to really directly controls some of the emerging markets throughout Asia and the Latin America as well. So those are real opportunities for us as we go forward and none of that is really factored into the financial guidance that we\u2019ve given.","David Glick","Yes, great thanks. Second question, obviously premature to talk about how FX has been impacted beyond this year, but can you talk about what strategies that you are contemplating, whether its pricing, average cost, unit cost reduction, expense cuts to offset some of the transactional impact you have going forward?","Manny Chirico","Sure Dave. I think fundamentally we\u2019re dealing with somewhat of an unprecedented situation given the volatility and the speed of some of these declines. The Euro move from parody at one point in 2002 to $1.35 and as in four months has gone from $1.35 to just the bulk parody just a couple of days ago. So it\u2019s been a shockingly fast move which you don\u2019t usually expect to see in currency markets. So we are really trying to pull all the levers as we think about 2016. We\u2019re also trying not to over react to the situation. ","So we\u2019re clearly looking at potentially certain markets for more local production. That would be particularly for Europe. We would like to see 1,000 basis points increase potentially in some of our local production that goes on, so instead of being around 30%, essentially moving to 40%. That does come with higher average costs than we experienced in 2014 and \u201915, but at the same time gives us speed to market and efficiencies that we might be able to take advantage of.","Leveraging our overall purchasing power, we thought the end of days trying to more efficient there. That will clearly be a level we\u2019ll look at. Opportunistically increasing average retail, that\u2019s the one that we\u2019re really focused on, we\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re trying to understand the competitive set there. We\u2019re also trying to understand market by market where we have the potential to raise prices given the fragility of the European market, especially some of the big markets that we\u2019re in. It feels in the short term like we need to move cautiously as we really start to experiment with raising prices, but we will be looking at it very closely. ","And then lastly, looking at expense controls across the board. Everywhere we clearly understand the situation we\u2019re in and we manage against that. So I think we\u2019re really trying to focus on all of those points as we go forward, with a real balance to say we need to continue to invest in our brand, so that we could drive long term growth as this starts and hopefully some of this currency headwind starts to turn around over the next two years.","David Glick","Great. Last question, your Heritage business obviously has been a headwind, which is a bit ironic given the improvement we\u2019ve seen, particularly in the mid tier department store channel. I\u2019m just wondering what are you seeing in that channel in the department store channel overall that might in terms of trends and is that an opportunity for you guys as you start to turn around your Heritage business?","Manny Chirico","Yes. Look, our sportswear businesses, I\u2019ll talk about that specifically which we continue there to see good results, particularly with the Izod business and launch at Coles continues strongly. I think you\u2019ll see operating margin improvement there and some sales increases. The retail trend right now, the first six weeks of the quarter have been very satisfying to see what\u2019s been going on in our own stores and at retail what we\u2019re seeing.","Our Dress Shirt business for us that was just a huge disappointment. That\u2019s just not an area we should be missing. I mean we are the dominant player. It is a tough category, but we got caught within some inventory and some movement of excess goods that we shouldn\u2019t have gotten caught within. That\u2019s been addressed, that\u2019s behind us and I think you\u2019ll start to see that business in \u201915 getting back to its historical levels of profitability. ","The real challenging business in that whole Heritage component has historically been a retail direct-to-consumer business in North America and we\u2019ve addressed that over the last two years with the close down of the Bass business and now the close down of the Izod retail business, both representing a little bit over $300 million in sales at breakeven operating businesses. So the efficiencies that we\u2019re gaining from that will start to manifest itself in \u201915 and in \u201916. So a much more efficient business model. ","Historically our wholesale businesses have been at 10% or 11% operating margins. Even last year in a very challenging market we were over 8% and believe we\u2019ll get closer to 9% this year with the hope to reach that double digit level in the second half of this year. So it\u2019s a focus area for us. ","We clearly managed that business from a cash flow point of view with little investment going into the Heritage businesses besides working capital and some minor support for the brands that\u2019s required and we\u2019re able to take that cash flow from those businesses and reinvest it back into a high margin, higher growth Calvin Kline and Tommy Hilfiger business. So that strategy just continues.","David Glick","Thank you very much for the color. Good luck.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joan Payson with Barclays Capital.","Joan Payson","Hi, good morning everyone. So could you talk a little bit specifically about the Calvin Kline North America in wholesale business? It looks like it was performing very strongly. So maybe if you could just touch on what the growth was for Calvin, North America wholesale in the quarter and also what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the order book right now?","Manny Chirico","Sure. Joan, I\u2019m very cautious whenever I talk about the North American order book, because given the customer composition and the immediate cancellation of orders and margin support. So sufficed to say it\u2019s very strong, it should continue, but I don\u2019t like quoting percentages, because sometime I might \u2013 it\u2019s not unlike the international business where an order is really something that stood behind and moves out. I think here it\u2019s more like a retail business for us, we really have to manage it. So I\u2019ll just focus on how we\u2019re doing at retail and how that\u2019s manifest.","I think the Calvin Kline business overall in North America was up double digits from the sales point of view in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s really been a strong performance for us and its really being driven by outsized performance of the underwear business. The men\u2019s at the bigger business just driving that, but also women\u2019s also coming on very strong and really enhancing the overall brand presentation has been a big winner for us. ","So the underwear business double digit increases in our wholesale business, the jeans business overall and the men\u2019s sportswear business up mid to high single digits for us as we move forward, that trend we hopefully will continue. It\u2019s going to be driven principally out of a lot of reorder replenishment business that the supply chain is set up this way to really activate it today and fulfill at a higher percentage as we go forward. So I think we\u2019re positioned really well.","At retail where we see the shops go in, I think I mentioned we\u2019re looking at between 30% and 40% store on store kind of retail increases. That doesn\u2019t translate fully into wholesale sales increases, but it does higher margin, higher profitability, less markdown in allowance support as we go forward. ","At the same time we\u2019re just seeing when you look at the overall business is that we\u2019re really eliminating both in the off-price channel \u2013 not eliminating, but significantly reducing the amount of off-price in clearance goods that are going through the off-price channel, but also the sell-in of promotional items into the full price strategy as well. So we\u2019re really trying to enhance that overall business and it\u2019s the only way to then drive the profitability of that business. So as we keep our inventories clean and with an ability to react on EDI basis, on core product, I think it\u2019s all very healthy for us as we go forward.","Joan Payson","Great, thanks Manny. And then also just touching on the Tommy license opportunity and taking some of those licenses in-house, could you talk about which region or regions might be the nearest term target and also how those licensed regions have been trending more recently?","Manny Chirico","Sure. I think we can say it\u2019s really the international markets that we were focused on. I don\u2019t want to get into the specificity on the retail market, but I will say the Tommy Asia business has a loyalty percentage increase which is comparable to what the business is growing. That international royalty has been growing in the double digit rate for us throughout Asia, driven particularly by the strength of the China business. The only region that\u2019s been soft in Asia for Tommy as well as Calvin has really been the Korea market, which has had its own economic issues surrounding it. ","So really the opportunity in South East Asia, the opportunity in China and clearly even more long term, the opportunity in Latin America for the Tommy brand, potentially to be writing those businesses more directly either through direct operations or potentially with a strategic partner in a joint venture situation really gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility and we believe the best way to capture the growth in those regions.","Joan Payson","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks. Good morning. Manny I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about kind of your forecast for Calvin Kline over the next three to five years. How should we be thinking about the pace of constant currency revenue growth now that you\u2019re starting to see some more traction both in the jeans and underwear business? And then secondly, as it relates to Calvin within Europe, when do you think it\u2019s kind of the appropriate time to revisit developing the Calvin Kline bridge opportunity in that market?","Manny Chirico","Okay, I think let me take the last part first, because it\u2019s the easier part of the question. On the bridge opportunity, particularly on the women\u2019s side which would be the big sales opportunity potential, I think the strategy in-house has been re-establish the jeans business, re-establish all casual sportswear business throughout Europe. Get that operating on a level that we are comfortable that we can deliver against and then when that is at a level we get to introduce the bridge product. ","We really want to introduce that product when the brand is at full strength at retail, when you have the operating platforms in place to support it and we don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves and start to create short term losses in a business that is very challenging in that market. ","So I believe there is a real opportunity there. I think it\u2019s an easier road on the men\u2019s side than the women\u2019s side. So our focus will be in the next three years underwear, jeans, accessories and then men\u2019s sportswear, along with the tailored component in men\u2019s dress shirts, suiting, comparable to what we do in Tommy. After that business is much more secure and established we\u2019ll look at the bridge opportunity in Europe. ","As far as forecasting the growth, I can\u2019t deal with \u2013 when I say this, is I can\u2019t forecast to you with all the currencies ups and downs, but when you look at the underlying fundamentals of the business, we continue to target high single digit growth, somewhere between 7% and 8% top line growth. Any kind of growth like that on a local currency basis will drive double digits revenue growth.","Have to deal with the vagaries of each of the market, the macro dynamics that are going on, but fundamentally looking at the opportunities for the Calvin Kline brand, there is no reason that the brand giving its growth prospects globally that that brand shouldn\u2019t continue to grow at that kind of a level overall. I think North America will be somewhat smaller just because it isn\u2019t well developed as it is and where the opportunities are and clearly the opportunities in Europe, Asia and Latin America are closer to double digit kind of growth. When you put it together, I think that\u2019s where we get that 7% to 8% target that we talked about that really should drive double digit EBIT growth for the segment.","Erinn Murphy","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a second question. On the strength of the order books that you\u2019re seeing in Europe in the back half, where are you seeing the most traction from a regional perspective with Calvin Kline checking towards that 10% and then also with Tommy Hilfiger checking towards that 4% to 5% range.","Manny Chirico","Sure. For Calvin the strength is really the biggest growth that we\u2019re seeing on a percentage basis is the UK, France and to its strength, the German market, even though the German market is challenging overall as a market, which is significantly under developed there, so the opportunity to take advantage of our infrastructure in Germany where Tommy is by far the largest sportswear business in Germany. We really are able to take advantage of that strength to move Calvin Kline into that market. So I would say those are the three key markets for Calvin. ","Where we\u2019re seeing challenges continues to be Italy and Russia, which for Calvin in particular the Russia market, Moscow, that whole surrounding area, we had a very strong franchisee partner there and which is a very strong business for us. That business in 2015 is under pressure. So its muting some of the growth, but even with that you could see the kind of sales growth that we are talking about for the brand moving forward.","On the Tommy side of the business, the most challenged market is Italy, followed by one of our bigger markets which is Germany, which is flattish right now given its extraordinarily high market share that we have there. I think we\u2019re actually on a market share basis growing. I have seen statistics that talked about German apparel sales overall down about 3% last year in that same period, but the Tommy Hilfiger business was up about 2% to 2.5%. So I think we\u2019re growing and as that economy hopefully improves, we should start to see some results there. So the two brands, that\u2019s how I would describe what\u2019s going on.","Erinn Murphy","Thank you guys and best of luck.","Operator","Our next question is from John Kernan with Cowen & Company.","John Kernan","Hey, good morning everyone. Congrats on the elevated product in marketing Calvin Kline. Clearly we\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits of that.","Manny Chirico","Thank you.","John Kernan","Can you remind us how far below peak you are for Calvin Kline AUR specifically in the jeans business and how big this opportunity is? I know you talked about being at a breakeven rate in terms of profitability in North America and Europe, but really just a matter of getting back a certain level of AUR to get back to that double digit operating margin.","Manny Chirico","Yes. The brand in 2013, 2014 was operating with average unit retails out the door of $23 to $25, which is horrific. Percentage wise I can quote you at 20%, but this reality is in that business we are approaching $30 today, both men\u2019s and women\u2019s, which is very good progress to where we are, but we need to be closer to $40. ","Our AUR in our men\u2019s sportswear business to just put it in comparison is about $45 out the door and that\u2019s a full seasonal AUR, including clearance markdown zeroing out the whole shebang. You would expect the jeans to be slightly less than that, more casual, much more of a T-shirt business driven there, so anywhere between $38 to $40 for Calvin Kline would be a healthy business. So we need to move AURs 30% to 35% over the next three years to get to that level of profitability that we\u2019ve achieved in every other product category that we operate in. ","So I always want to reiterate that the issue that we have in North America is not a brands issue. It\u2019s a product category issue that\u2019s under pressure on a macro basis and has been really mistreated as a product category from a quality level and presentation and we\u2019re just starting to make those investments and seeing \u2013 we\u2019re just starting to see the turnaround in those businesses and where we not to belabor it, but I mean we get the presentation, where we are able to show the product. We\u2019re clearly in Herald Square we have the shop presentation that\u2019s comparable to everything else we have. We are clearly already delivering that $40 to $45 AUR. ","So for us that\u2019s what we\u2019re going back to, our retail partners and demanding more square footage, better doors on really improving our EDI replenishment capabilities with jeans to really have a supply chain that supports our jeans business. So a lot of building blocks that are there and some still getting there, but I believe over the next 12 months we are really making headwind and hopefully as each quarter progresses, I can continue to be optimistic about where we\u2019re heading with that business.","John Kernan","Thanks, that\u2019s really helpful. And then can you just remind us, the size of the licensed Tommy business in Asia and how this would effect \u2013 bringing some of these licenses back in-house, how that would affect your financials over the next few years.","Manny Chirico","Sure. At retail that business is about $1 billion. I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s the international piece, that\u2019s Asia and all Latin American pieces, so we kind of look at those two markets together. So the opportunity for us is to bring that business in-house. It\u2019s not all retail business. It\u2019s probably about 50\/50 retail, wholesale. So I would say the sales base is probably closer to $650 million and we believe that our licensing partners are operating in the range of somewhere around at least a 10% operating margin. ","We believe we probably could enhance that just given the scale and size and the synergies that would exist with the existing Calvin Kline businesses in those territories from clearly a back office synergy point of view, not a front of the house synergy. So that\u2019s the opportunity that we potentially see. We believe those businesses can be bought at attractive prices considering where the market is and considering where currencies are today. ","So we think obviously those would be accretive transactions with two brands that we clearly understand, in markets that we clearly understand as well. So from a risk profile it would be a lower risk kind of acquisition as well. So I think that\u2019s where our focus and the use of our cash over the next three years will really be. ","John Kernan","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is with Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hi, can you hear me okay? Sorry.","Manny Chirico","Yes Mike.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys. So on the Calvin business you spoke into the longer term guidance for that. But I\u2019m curious with the guidance for this year at 5% of the revenue line, I think you\u2019ve spoken about that longer term at 7% or 8% and I guess it\u2019s not intuitive to me why it would be below that in the early phases of the turnaround considering a little momentum you guys have putting assets in the ground to accelerate that business.","And the same I guess point on the margin guidance this year for 2015 at 30 to 50 basis points of an improvement. As you\u2019ve talked about how far below what you think the opportunity is on the jeans side for Calvin Kline. Are there things that hold the margin back or is there an inflection point on the horizon that you look at to say this is what actually starts accelerating it beyond the margin improvement rate for this year?","Manny Chirico","I think Michael you know us well and we try to be prudent when we\u2019re projecting the business and we\u2019re projecting top line growth in particular. I tried to touch on the first quarter trends which are internationally better than what we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s better than what the plans would indicate. ","Before we start projecting that we\u2019d like to see a little bit more time, it\u2019s really six weeks, seven weeks and we\u2019d like to see a little bit more time understanding the Easter shift and what\u2019s going on, understanding\u2026 ","You know in North America one of the biggest challenges we\u2019re dealing with and I think you\u2019ll probably hear more of this as more retailers start to report, is how this international tourism is really impacting our retail sales, particularly if you have big stores in key cities in the United States, be it North East, Florida, Vegas, the West Coast, I think you\u2019re going to probably hear from ever major retailer that attracts the international tourists of North America that that business in those markets would be under the pressure, while it seems at the same time the permanent population centers, the Midwest, the mid Atlantic, the West Coast outside of LA and San Francisco and then the whole Southern tier of the country Texas, those businesses are actually pretty strong indicating that the local consumer there is doing well. ","So its balancing that in North America as well as we go forward, especially with this Easter shift its very hard to read, the weather, everything that\u2019s going on. We\u2019re really trying to just understand more and trying to build a projection for this year that hopefully we could outperform. ","Michael Binetti","And I guess the other part of the question was, is there an inflection point on the horizon where you guys start seeing an accelerating trend in the margin based on maybe some of the headwinds this year as you continue to puts assets in the ground and become less intense over time.","Manny Chirico","Well Michael, it would be a lot easier if we weren\u2019t dealing with so much currency noise, both translation and transaction, it would be a lot easier to be bullish about everything. You know I find myself, before I\u2019m checking retail sales in the morning, I\u2019m checking currency on CNBC. So as crazy as it is that is kind of got everybody\u2019s head spinning. ","Again, we could just get some stability. Nobody is looking for dramatic improvement. With some stability I think it would give us a better sense as we start looking close to product going now for the fourth quarter in a row, 2015 and beyond. That story hasn\u2019t been written yet and we\u2019re in the midst of that as we go forward, particularly since we\u2019re at January year end. So all those things are really stopping us at this point from\u2026 ","Potentially if the world was normal and we were talking instead of talking about currency this way, we\u2019re just talking about $8 plus of earnings per share growth if currencies were level, I think you\u2019d see a different posture from the management team and I don\u2019t think it would just be us. I think it would be a number of people. So that has got everybody really just sitting back trying to evaluate what it normally needs and trying to manage against it as well.","Michael Binetti","Right. So one final question on since you brought up CNBC. On TV last night you mentioned share repurchases and in the past when we\u2019ve spoken, it hasn\u2019t really seemed like a priority for you. You\u2019ve always preferred something strategic like the licenses you mentioned. Maybe just some thoughts on capital deployment this year. ","Do you see yourself saying we might buy back some shares this year or if we look back in your transcripts to pre Warnaco, there is just a lot of velocity around the license that you guys are rolling up back and there do you see the business going back towards that over the next year or two instead as you think about how to deploy cash. Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Look, it\u2019s a great question. I think we\u2019re at a moment in time and 2015 is really that transition year that we really need to look at that as we go forward and where we are in this moment of time is the priority has been given the acquisition of Warnaco pay down debt and we\u2019ve done that for two years, exceeded our expectations of paying down debt and targeted to pay down about $425 million and get debt again this year, which I think is really critically and important to position ourselves to grow, to make those acquisitions that I\u2019ve been talking about this morning.","At the same time, the free cash flow of the business after the investment spending in for systems and platform and our CapEx expenses and our retail growth and even if you couple in debt repayment and a level of licensing acquisitions that was rational year by year as opposed to a major acquisition in one chunk, if we did it that way, we\u2019re generating, once all the integration restructuring is now behind us, we\u2019re probably generating $500 million plus of free cash flow after those investments to pay down debt as we go out. ","So this year I think the number will be $500 million and its really because of the opportunity to look at \u2013 potentially looking at stock buyback end of 2015 going into \u201916, depending what the opportunities that are out there from a strategic point of view. Our first priority will be to invest and invest in licensing acquisitions once the balance sheet is squared away, which I think it will be in \u201915. So I hope that gives a little color on where we are. ","Michael Binetti","Very helpful, thank you. ","Manny Chirico","Okay, this will be our \u2013 operator we\u2019ll take this as our last question please. ","Operator","We will go next to Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric Tracy","Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess if I could turn to the Tommy Hilfiger strategy, you guys seem like you are focused on not getting caught up in the promotional environment, particularly in Europe. That translated really nice, both top and bottom line growth for that business. As we think about maybe the tougher environment generally speaking as evidenced by the sort of 3% growth outlook, how are you going to manage through that business and what is the sort of help of the landscape from a channel perspective that you guys have to deal with. ","Manny Chirico","I think that\u2019s really the balancing act. It\u2019s trying to drive healthy growth, not necessarily just to drive growth at the expense of brand or brand positioning in the market or authenticity with the consumer. ","We want to be a full price, particularly in Europe we want to be a full price retail resource. There is a lot of competitors out there that are trying to grow in that market and you see an overexpansion into the outlet business and over expansion into the off price and promotional business and I think that feels good in the short term, because that could be a really profitable business and we saw what happens with that. ","Warnaco deployed that strategy into 2006 and 2007 and reported great financial results and really just completely damaged the Calvin Klein jeans business in Europe and in North American. And so this short term game is to be gotten by doing that, but that\u2019s not a game we want to play in Europe or internationally at all. We are not really wide [ph]. We understand how to make money, we understand what our responsibilities are, but going overboard in that area just to drive some incremental growth, they will come back to bite us later. It\u2019s not an area where we want to be. ","Eric Tracy","Yes. And so in that same vein, as we think about the domestic jeans wear category and you guys have clearly made great strides, PVH and CK specific. But speak to again the health of that category from a competitive standpoint and the potential restraints you have to continue to migrate those AURs higher.","Manny Chirico","Look, the denim business last three years has been a category that\u2019s been under pressure, particularly in the active performance inspired area. So if you look at Calvin Klein performance business at resale that\u2019s approaching $150 million business in North America. The G3 just does an outstanding job of operating for us and we believe internationally where we, PVH controls that business though that\u2019s a growth area for us as we move forward both in men\u2019s and woman\u2019s. ","I think on the denim side, on the men\u2019s side with denim the business has stabilized from a category point of view and I believe you are starting to see some positive trends in men\u2019s denim. I can\u2019t say that for women\u2019s. We are seeing some growth and we are seeing some positive results, but I think as a category I\u2019d bet the business is flattish overall and we\u2019ve seen most competitors, I think they really continue to talk about negative growth and what\u2019s on. So space is being reallocated in some cases. ","So it\u2019s critical that given our historical position in denim with Calvin Klein jeans, the brand has started to design a jeans craze, we need to really be an authority on department store floors in America and I think we are reestablishing ourselves in that area on the men\u2019s side and on the women\u2019s side and I think the road has got some challenges in North American on the woman\u2019s side because of the category, but I believe on the men\u2019s side we really start to see some overall improvement.","Eric Tracy","Okay, perfect. Thank you guys. That\u2019s all.","Manny Chirico","Okay everyone. I really appreciate the time this morning. Allow us to get back to focusing on the business. We look forward to speaking to you in May on the first quarter press release and updating you on business trends. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations; and Ken Duane, who is the CEO of our Heritage Brands and our North American wholesale businesses.","Let me start off by saying I\u2019m very pleased with the results of our fourth quarter. We beat our fourth quarter earnings guidance. We saw strong outperformance against our projections in both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses despite the overall difficult retail environment that\u2019s been plaguing us, particularly in North America. Let me focus in on the Tommy Hilfiger business first.","The Tommy business continued its strong performance during the quarter, posting a 1% revenue increase and a 15% increase in operating income. Very strong performance in Europe and North America was partially offset by continued weakness in our business in Japan. In the fourth quarter, North American comp store sales were flat while our European business posted a 7% comp store increase. Prudent management of our promotional markdowns and operating expenses resulted in operating margins improving 160 basis points in the quarter to just over 13%.","Moving to our Heritage business, our Heritage businesses came in more or less on plan. Sales increased about 8% and operating income was up about 9% over the prior year. We saw a good performance in our wholesale business, both sportswear, neckwear and dress shirts, and we saw some difficult business in our retail Heritage businesses where comps came in at minus 7% coupled with higher promotional markdowns across the board that negatively impacted the ability for us to significantly drive the growth in our Heritage business\u2019 earnings.","Moving to Calvin Klein, our Calvin Klein business has exceeded our earnings estimates, posting a 17% earnings increase in the fourth quarter. By region, we saw the strongest results in the U.S., Brazil and Asia, while our European business continued to struggle and underperform.","Let me start with South America \u2013 business was very strong, particularly in Brazil where we continue to see sales growth of about 10% driven by the strong performance of the Calvin Klein jeans business. Comp store sales were up about 5% in the fourth quarter. Our order book for spring\/summer is also running up about 10%, so there continues to be good momentum in our South American business.","Moving to Asia, overall comps in our Asia business were up about 3% for the quarter. We saw particularly strong sales in China and Southeast Asia. The fourth quarter did benefit from an earlier Chinese New Year, which fell into January this year versus February last year. This impact positively affected comps by about 1.5 percentage points. Overall, the Asia business outperformed from an earnings point of view where we saw strong gross margin performance as well and strong operating income performance. ","Moving to North America in the Calvin Klein business, we continue to perform well across all product categories, with the exception of men\u2019s and women\u2019s jeans. Comps in our retail stores were flat in North America. In the licensing area, ongoing royalty revenues were up about 14% in the quarter due to the strength in our global handbags and accessories business, as well as our women\u2019s apparel businesses. These businesses are operated by G3 in North America and Club 21 and Swatch throughout Asia.","Moving to Europe, our Calvin Klein European business continued to be under pressure and continued to under-perform. Driving that under-performance was our jeans business. Overall, our comps in Europe were down 7% and margins were hurt by markdowns in order to move through goods and position the business properly for new spring deliveries that were arriving in January and February.","Moving to the first quarter and our expectations, in the first quarter our sales to date are on plan. In North America, we continue to see a challenging retail environment that is being impacted by unseasonably cold weather and a later Easter holiday. As such, we are planning flat comps for Tommy and Calvin, while our Heritage business is expected to post a mid-single digit negative comp. Internationally, our Calvin Klein businesses in Asia and Latin America continue to see strong sales trends, very consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Our Tommy Hilfiger European business continues to post strong sales increases across the board with first quarter comp store sales trends up mid-single digits. Our Tommy Hilfiger European wholesale business is also showing strong growth as our fall order projection book is coming in at plus-5% for the fall season of 2014.","Let me quickly give you an integration update of where we stand on the Warnaco acquisition. We continue to execute our plans and are on track with all our processes and conversions. Over the last three months, we have continued to see strong conversions of a number of systems in North America, Europe, and now starting in Asia. There has been no surprised in this area since the last time we updated you and we are very comfortable with our integration timeline. We are also comfortable that we are on plan for our projected expense synergies.","I\u2019d like to take just a couple of minutes to talk about 2014 overall and to give you a sense of the increased strategic investments we are making in operating expenses in order to build a solid foundation for the Calvin Klein businesses worldwide. The strategic investments really fall into six broad categories. The first is, and we\u2019ve talked about these, is people. We have filled and are in the process of filling key positions across the Calvin Klein jeans and underwear global business. We are making good progress there. Highlighting that is the hiring of our president in Asia that was hired in December of 2013 and the naming of (indiscernible) as the Calvin Klein president for our European operations, so clearly making good progress here and we think we\u2019ll be seeing the fruits of that. Also, continue the investments and the enhancements of the systems, the operating infrastructure and the overall operating platform at jeans and underwear.","We\u2019re also significantly reducing our off-price sales and warehouse club sales in North America and Europe. We need to bring our overall jeans and underwear sales distribution to the same healthy mix of sales that we have in our other highly profitable Calvin Klein businesses. We\u2019ve also invested and are upgrading the quality and the design of the Calvin Klein jeans product. We should begin to see the benefits of this in the second half of 2014. ","We\u2019re making significant investments at point of sale. We\u2019re elevating the presentation and point-of-sale marketing of the Calvin Klein jeans and underwear retail presentations across the board globally, and we continue to invest in ecommerce business at both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in order to support the significant growth that we are experiencing in both of these brands\u2019 ecommerce business.","As you know, 2014 will represent two stories. The first half will be pressured by the increased level of support that we\u2019re giving to these strategic initiatives in order to drive future growth. The second half of 2014 will reflect the first season of new product from our newly established designer sourcing teams as well as starting to see the beginnings of the benefits from our improved marketing presentation and investment and enhanced retail presentations that we have in our stores and at point of sale with our key department store accounts.","We believe the investments we are making today in the Calvin Klein business will allow us to drive ongoing earnings per share growth of 15%-plus in 2015 and beyond. We believe the investments we\u2019re making today will allow us to begin to leverage our SG&A expenses as we move into 2015 and beyond as we start to see top line growth in the Calvin Klein business that will be in the 6 to 8% range as we get into 2015 and beyond.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Mike Shaffer to quantify some of these comments.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I\u2019m about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.","Revenues for the fourth quarter were 2.1 billion, up 25% or $416 million increase over the prior year. Driving our revenue increase over the prior year was the Warnaco acquisition which accounted for $479 million, and our pre-acquisition Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses which posted 2% combined growth while having one less week this fourth quarter versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Negatively impacting our revenue for the quarter was a $75 million decline due to the sale of our Bass Heritage retail division as well as a 7% fourth quarter comp sales decline in our existing Heritage retail divisions. Overall versus our guidance, our revenues were on plan.","Our earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $1.43 as compared to our previous guidance of $1.40. Driving the $0.03 beep was predominantly interest expense savings. We paid down a total of $500 million in debt in 2013, which was $50 million higher than our previous guidance.","Our revenues for 2014 are projected at $8.5 billion or 3% increase over the prior year. Our year-over-year comparisons are negatively impacted by the sale of our Bass division, which excluded would drive our planned revenue increase to 5%. Our growth brands, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, are planned to have revenue increases of 7 and 5% respectively. Our Heritage business will decrease 5% due to the Bass sale. The go-forward Heritage business revenues will increase 4% over the prior year.","Our earnings per share for 2014 is planned at $7.40 to $7.50, an increase of 5 to 7%. Our 2014 earnings will be negatively impacted by the incremental spending in the Calvin Klein jeans and underwear businesses. In 2014, our comparisons will be toughest in the first half as a result of last year\u2019s investment spending being second half weighted, while the 2014 investments will be first half weighted. In addition to investment spending in Calvin Klein, our earnings per share will be negatively impacted by $0.10 in 2014 for the sale of Bass, as well as a $0.15 negative impact from foreign currency.","Our full-year operating margins will be down about 50 basis points, reflecting an increase in gross margin that will be more than offset by an increase in SG&A expense due in large part to the increased investments. For the year, we are projecting our Heritage and Tommy Hilfiger businesses to have operating margins flat to the prior year. Calvin Klein operating margins will be about 14%. ","For the first quarter, we\u2019re projecting earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50 and revenues of about $2 billion, or an increase of 2% over the prior year. Excluding Bass, the revenue increase would be 4%. Quarter one has the largest impact on the Calvin Klein investment spend where comparisons in the prior year are significantly lower as we acquired Warnaco in mid-February, and tax rates, while planned down for the full year, are up in the first quarter by $0.10 due to a discrete item which benefited the prior year. ","With that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","We\u2019ll take our first question from Bob Drbul from Nomura.","Bob Drbul \u2013 Nomura","Good morning.","Emanuel Chirico","","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Drbul \u2013 Nomura","Manny, can you just give us a little bit more color on the jeans business, what you\u2019re seeing sort of out in the fall and some of the order books, perhaps, for North America, Europe, Asia on the denim businesses, and just what you\u2019re seeing around the response to the new design product. Any numbers you could share with us?","Emanuel Chirico","Yeah, I can pull some numbers and maybe some showroom talk as well. The lines have been very well received, big wholesale businesses that we have in Europe and North America, so lines have been well received by all of our retail partners and we are in discussions with most of them about better presentation at retail. It\u2019s expanding the space and investing capital to support those businesses.","In Europe, we\u2019re looking for second half increases overall of about 20% in the jeans business on a like-for-like basis. Just remember that at the same time, we\u2019re going to be reducing some of the off-price business there, so net we\u2019re looking for somewhere in the neighbourhood of high single digits to low double digits increases in wholesale sales of the Calvin Klein business. So we\u2019re starting to see some real good response from our retail partners as we go forward.","In the U.S. on the men\u2019s side, our jeans bottoms business, even today as we position some of the new product in for spring, we\u2019re starting to see better sell-throughs at higher AURs at retail, and seeing some good order increases for third and fourth quarter given the new product receptivity that the retailers have. So we\u2019re looking there for some type of mid-single digit increase in the Calvin Klein jeans business.","For us, it\u2019s really key that we not only drive sales but also drive improved gross margin in the denim business for us overall, so really focusing in on trying to clean up the\u2014the challenge has been to Calvin Klein is\u2014in North America is that there\u2019s been too much promotion of the goods, too much markdown activity around the denim business, and what we really need is to get control of that, get control of our markdowns and our allowance budgets, and I think that could drive improved profitability and the top line will follow with better presentation and stronger product as we go forward. ","So I hope that helps, Bob.","Bob Drbul \u2013 Nomura","Yes, Manny, it does. I guess the second I have is when you look at the first quarter guide and your full-year guide, the increases that you were talking a little bit longer term are 15%-plus, but when you think about the implied growth rate in the second half of the year, what do you think are the biggest deltas or the risks you see to achieving that material increase and the reacceleration on the earnings side?","Emanuel Chirico","Well, let me talk about our internal issues first. I think when we get into the third quarter and into the fourth quarter even more so, that\u2019s when we have lacked the expense increases that we have put into the business. So I think what you\u2019ll start to see\u2014you will start to see in the business is SG&A leverage on the Calvin side in the business as we go into the third and particularly the fourth quarter, and start to see operating margin expansion as we go forward. That should accelerate in 2015 because I\u2019m very comfortable that the expense levels, the increased levels that we\u2019ve built in will only have to grow on a percentage basis with the top line, so we should clearly get SG&A leverage into the future in \u201915 and beyond.","I\u2019ve got to be honest, Bob \u2013 when I look at the risks to delivering our guidance, I\u2019m getting more and more comfortable with our internal ability to deliver everything we\u2019ve talked about, and I can\u2019t help but just be more and more concerned about the overall retail environment, particularly in North America. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m telling anybody anything that they don\u2019t already know, but on a macro basis traffic is down and it\u2019s being pressured, I truly believe, by unseasonably cold weather, a later Easter, and unseasonably warm weather last year in the early spring season. ","So those comparisons have been tougher and you really can see it geographically in the business. Our own stores that we operate here in North America, if you were to look at our map, you would see strong business in Florida, Texas, the west coast, and as you would expect very difficult business in the Midwest and the northeast, and early on in the first quarter difficult business in the southeast \u2013 Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville where we were hit with ice storms and all of this. So that business has somewhat come back in the southeast now. Every time we see weather somewhat improve and get to more seasonable levels, we see a pop in our business. ","So when you think about our outlet, the outlet channel where a majority of our retail direct sales are done, 95% of those centers are outdoor centers by their nature, and I think they do get impacted maybe more significantly from the weather impact. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good, and we\u2019re really expecting a very strong April given the late Easter and how that fits into the mix. So the biggest risk I see to the business is the external environment right now.","Bob Drbul \u2013 Nomura","Thanks, Manny. Good luck.","Emanuel Chirico","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","Thank you, good morning Manny. Just a quick question. Obviously your guidance beyond Q1 suggests earnings growth that has been more typical historically for PVH. When you look at the guidance, however, it seems to be largely driven by interest and taxes, but obviously as you refer to Q4 you\u2019re starting to see more accelerated growth.","I think as we take a step back and look at your guidance, I think maybe the biggest surprise is that EBIT is relatively flat. It sounds like you\u2019re going to exit the year with EBIT growth, but it\u2019s healthy to see revenues and gross margins heading up in line with expectations. But if you could help us understand what\u2019s driving that SG&A increase and what is going to enable you to start leveraging that going forward. And within that discussion, if you could touch on ecommerce because that\u2019s a question we get a lot about in terms of the incremental investments you all need to make to develop that business.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, that was a 15-part question so I\u2019ll try and hit the highlights on it. Let\u2019s talk about the investment. I think I touched on the investment spending, but\u2014so clearly that\u2019s having an impact and that is really clearly impacting the first half of 2014 significantly. I think secondarily what you\u2019re seeing on the business from an SG&A point of view is the sale of Bass and almost $300 million in sales and the corporate overhead absorption associated with that \u2013 that\u2019s worth about $0.10 a share to us. That\u2019s impacting really on the SG&A line is where we\u2019re seeing it. We\u2019re much better off from our perspective to be out of that business. It wasn\u2019t a business that was returning the appropriate returns on investment, and it was really becoming a distraction from our growth. But there is some minor financial impact that works through on that.","Then I think if you look at the business overall and you do the math, and we haven\u2019t given you quarterly breakdowns, but our operating income growth in the second half of the year is up high single digits when you look at it \u2013 7 to 9%. I think that\u2019s clearly more indicative of what you should expect for us as we go on, and I think that would only accelerate as we get into \u201915. That kind of EBIT growth that we should experience in the second half of the year coupled with the continued pay down of our investments, our tax rate continuing to improve each year, that should be\u2014that is the formula that should drive 15% earnings per share growth as we go forward.","So I think it really does hang together very well with the understanding of this incremental spend that we need to have in order to really position ourselves in the Calvin Klein business for outsized growth.","On the ecommerce side of the business, we have a pretty successful Tommy Hilfiger business worldwide, ecommerce. I think when you add up Europe and North America, 2014 will be approaching $100 million in revenues, and it\u2019s a pretty profitable business. We don\u2019t break it out, but it\u2019s pretty profitable at all levels and as it scales up and grows \u2013 and it\u2019s been growing double digits \u2013 you clearly get more and more leverage to that business.","The Calvin Klein business from an ecommerce point of view is behind the Tommy business. It\u2019s about\u2014this year it will be $20 million. It\u2019s a business that is all today North America, and when you consider the fact that we were a licensed model, it\u2019s a very difficult model to bring all of the Calvin Klein product together. Now that we control jeans and underwear, all of men\u2019s sportswear, and with our partnership with G3, we clearly believe we have a formula for a successful, profitable business as we go forward. It will require some investment, but a lot of that investment has already been made from an infrastructure point of view building out the Tommy ecommerce business. So I think we clearly will leverage that as well, and I think as that business scales--today as a business that loses money of $4 million or $5 million, but as that business scales and moves from $20 million to $50 million, that\u2019s the inflection point where the business starts to become profitable and above that starts to become significantly profitable.","So for us, it\u2019s part of the overall strategy. We\u2019ll be rolling out ecommerce platforms in Brazil, China and in Europe in the second half of the year, most of that probably fourth quarter, so really it won\u2019t be of any significant impact to 2014 but clearly paving the way to continue to invest behind the ecommerce platform, and now with control of the Calvin business, really able to make a full brand message there, to really deliver a full assortment of product to our consumers, and I think over a period of time \u2013 the next three years \u2013 turn that business into a profitable enterprise for us.","David Glick \u2013 Buckingham Research Group","Great. Thank you very much for that color. Good luck.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","","Erinn Murphy \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great, thank you. Good morning. I guess I had a couple of questions. Manny, first for you \u2013 if you could just reflect a little bit about some of your strategic initiatives as you think about the people side of it. I mean, that\u2019s been something you guys have highlighted over the last several quarters and have made some good additions there. I guess two parts \u2013 one, are there any key holes still to fill, and then how should we think about the management transition at Calvin Klein with the announcement yesterday of Tom Murry\u2019s intention to retire? Thank you.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. We\u2019ve made significant progress on the hiring, a lot of it done in the fourth quarter and the beginning of this year\u2019s first quarter, so the key positions to fill, I would say we have 80 to 85% of the positions filled today. There\u2019s always some positions open in the merchandise manager level and some design areas, but I think we\u2019ve really crossed the bridge there and we\u2019ll have those other positions filled by the end of the first half of this year.","On Tom Murry\u2019s transition to Steve Shiffman, it\u2019s been\u2014it\u2019s emotion for me. Tom and I have worked together over 10 years. It\u2019s bittersweet that Tom is leaving, but I think Tom has chosen to leave at the absolute right time for Tom and for the business. The business is in very good shape today. Steve Shiffman, who is the President and Chief Commercial Officer, has all of the operating businesses internationally reporting to him. He has got all of our retail businesses today reporting up through him, so it\u2019s a very natural, easy transition to Steve from the commercial side of the business. ","Where Tom really was focused was really on the creative service side, managing the brand, retail relationships; and Tom is going to be here for the next seven to eight months. We have an unbelievably strong team at Calvin Klein, as you well know, both on the marketing, the advertising and the design side that Tom really oversees directly hands on, so I don\u2019t see any drop-off there. We\u2019ve got a very stable workforce of people there, so I don\u2019t see much of a change there as well.","So we are comfortable with the transition. I think it\u2019s been well planned. It\u2019s probably 18 months earlier than was officially planned, but the timing just seemed to be right for now, so that\u2019s where we are on that.","Erinn Murphy \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great, thank you. And then just a quick follow up as it relates to Calvin Klein. How should we think about just the top line cadence over the next couple of years relative to the profitability? If you think about pulling back some of the distribution off-price as well as some of the store closures that you have inked out over the next year or so, and then from a profitability perspective when should we really start to see the margins for both underwear and jeans start to improve? Thank you so much.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, I think on the top line when we get out of 2014, we\u2019d be looking for 8% top line growth overall. That will drive the kind of earnings that I\u2019ve talked about. I\u2019d like to think if we hit this right that it could be better than that, but as we sit here and project out, it\u2019s too early to call that. There\u2019s real opportunities there.","From an operating margin point of view, I just want to be clear \u2013 there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with the operating margins of underwear. Our operating margins in underwear are above 15% globally, so I think we can enhance those from some disciplines on inventory management, assortment management, and better presentation. But that is a very healthy business, number one position in men\u2019s, and a top three position in women\u2019s globally, so we\u2019re very comfortable with how we\u2019re positioned in the underwear business.","The real opportunity is\u2014when you really look at where Calvin is underperforming as a business unit, it\u2019s in jeans in North America and it\u2019s our European business. It\u2019s just about a $500 million business in Europe that is projected to break even this year, so if you compare that to the Tommy Hilfiger business, which is at least three times as large but operates at 17% operating margins, our goal is to move Calvin over the next number of years to a 10% operating margin. That\u2019s the track record. That\u2019s probably on just a pure performance basis the biggest impact that we can have on our overall operating margins at Calvin. The fact that Europe is such a big market for us and the fact that it\u2019s so underperforming, it really creates an opportunity for us as we go forward.","So that\u2019s it, Erinn.","Erinn Murphy \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great. Thanks you guys so much. Best of luck.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Christian Buss from Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, hello. Could you provide some color on the composition of your inventories and how you feel about inventories at retail?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure, Mike Shaffer is going to talk a little bit about that.","Mike Shaffer","So I guess I would say that at this point, we\u2019ve got the PVH process and policies around inventory implemented around the globe. We took some charges last year to clean up and work through some old inventory as a result of the acquisition, and it\u2019s behind us. So as we move into 2014, both in North America and the rest of the globe, we\u2019re feeling real good about our inventories, both in our own stores and the department stores we do business at.","Emanuel Chirico","And Christian, what I would just add to that is in North America, our inventories are\u2014we came out of the\u2014beginning in the month of February, we came out very, very clean. We were really on top of it with our retail partners to make sure permanent markdowns were taken in January, there was no carryover on any of that. But I get this\u2014when I look at the business, I have to take a step back is, my concern is not our inventory levels. My concern is we really need to see the business in North America start to improve, traffic start to improve, hopefully directly involved with the warmer weather that\u2019s soon to come and Easter coming, because at department stores in that retail channel, our wholesale inventories are starting to build. After missing sales in January, February and March across the board in the macro environment, I am starting to look at inventory levels that are starting to build in the sportswear area, men\u2019s and women\u2019s, and some of the other areas at the store, and that\u2019s an area that I think we all have to watch and watch the promotional cadence that starts to happen in April and beyond. That would be the one concern that we see as we go forward \u2013 we need to start to see footsteps improving into stores and weather improving.","Christian Buss \u2013 Credit Suisse","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much, and best of luck.","Operator","We\u2019ll go now to Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group","Hey Manny, thanks. Wanted to follow up \u2013 you\u2019ve seen this weather problem in certain markets, and you\u2019re seeing better business elsewhere. Is your gut telling you that there\u2019s pent-up demand, and as the weather improves you\u2019re going to see the return to traffic? Is that what your gut is telling you, or is there too much negative data out there to really make that call?","Emanuel Chirico","My gut? Okay. I think my gut is telling me that business is definitely being negatively impacted by weather across the board. It\u2019s just a fact. I mean, just think about the kind of weather we\u2019ve experienced here in the northeast and in the Midwest. The catalyst for you as a consumer to go out and find bright colored, short sleeved knit shirts to go golfing in, and most of our courses haven\u2019t opened up up here, that\u2019s the challenge. When I look at the southern business in our department store channel, it\u2019s running up double digits, so there\u2019s really two stories going on geographically around. ","So I think our product is well positioned on the floor. We really transitioned strongly to spring and made that move, which I think will save us markdowns in the future, but trying to sell wear now product in February with temperatures at 10 degrees, I think has been a challenge across the board, so that\u2019s the issue. So my gut is telling me, based on everything that I see, my 20 years experience in this business, that we are being significantly impacted by weather and a late Easter.","Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group","All right, great. And then I wanted to ask a question about Calvin Klein kind of as you think about the brand more broadly. You\u2019ve got the biggest licenses now in-house \u2013 maybe there\u2019s more to come in over time, new leadership coming into place. Are you guys prepared yet, and maybe it is too early as you\u2019re going through a lot of the integration things, but are you prepared to kind of articulate what the long-term financial opportunity and timeline is for the brand, the size of it today, the profitability of it today and where it can go over time? It just seems to a lot of us that the brand is so much stronger and more globally recognized than perhaps the profits it\u2019s generating for the company today. Or maybe there\u2019s an analyst day at some point as you think about this?","Emanuel Chirico","It sounds like a plea for an analyst day. I think it\u2019s a fair call-out. I don\u2019t disagree with anything you said. I think the brand clearly has significant upside and opportunity. I think we will set up an analyst day second half of the year where we can give you a better picture of all that. I think I\u2019ve spoken about the overall kind of growth that I think the business can get to. I think to get to 2016, I think the number we keep talking about is to get to $10 of earnings per share as we go forward, and that would just be the math associated with growing\u2014with the kind of growth I see over 2014 to \u201916. ","So there is clearly that opportunity ahead of us without doing what I would consider anything Herculean, and without talking about us bringing in-house some of these businesses that you reeled off. That opportunity is in front of us. I think that\u2019s 24 months out, but clearly on top of the $10 a share, there\u2019s the ability to take in-house a number of licenses, both internationally both at Tommy and Calvin, and domestically both at Tommy and Calvin that we really would like to manage more directly ourselves, have better control over, and given the short-term nature of most of our license agreements, the ability to bring those businesses in-house on very favorable terms that should be very positive from an earnings point of view.","So again, without going into real specifics, just trying to lay out some of the things that maybe you could think about and how we get to that $10 a share number and how we grow beyond that beyond 2016. So there\u2019s a tremendous amount of growth in the Calvin Klein brand, as well as the Tommy Hilfiger brand with the opportunities that are in front of us. What is critical in order to get to that and unlock that, the Warnaco transaction was critical because of the size and diversity of the business that it controlled, both from a product and a geographic point of view, and now having that effectively integrated onto our business platform in order to take advantage of that geographic diversity in order for us to expand directly into those markets. That\u2019s the key execution point that we need to complete in 2014, and I feel very strong about it.","Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks. One last quick question \u2013 did you guys consider going external in the search to replace Tom, or was Steve just such an obvious choice?","Emanuel Chirico","I think Steve was an obvious choice. We do a lot of talent management here and succession planning. We sat down with each of our divisions, with our teams, and build succession plans. We\u2019ve talked about the Tommy Hilfiger succession plan to Daniel Grieder \u2013 I think that\u2019s been laid out for four years, since we bought Tommy. It was well thought out, the plan is well thought out. That transition is going exceedingly well. Daniel is really taking charge of the business as we go forward, taking that leadership role. Still having Fred here as an advisor is a huge benefit to me in particular and I believe to Daniel as well, but that just does it. And Tom\u2019s transition was also laid out. What it really is is probably an 18-month acceleration from where we thought we would be, and I think Steve was such an obvious choice.","Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks Manny. Good luck.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Emanuel Chirico","Good morning, Lindsay.","Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I had two questions. Number one, I just wanted to clarify \u2013 so we\u2019ve taken a bit of a detour from the original earnings guidance you set when you bought Warnaco, but it sounds as if your view on the overall potential is unchanged. I actually was just curious \u2013 is that a fair statement, and the fact that we\u2019ve had more of a choppy road to get there is just a function of more upfront reinvestment, or are there other areas that you\u2019ve uncovered in Warnaco that are fundamentally broken in ways that you didn\u2019t believe, or value-destructive in ways that you didn\u2019t believe when you were just looking at it from the outside?","Emanuel Chirico","No, Lindsay, I guess the only characterization I would say is that the detour that we laid out, we laid out 12 months ago and we talked about it in pretty stark detail about what needed to be done and how disappointed we were that we had to come back to all of that. I think I would characterize the balance of what you said as absolutely true \u2013 the long-term growth potential, there is nothing that we\u2019ve seen that really would deter us from where we are.","Just to remind everybody, what Warnaco controlled was jeans and underwear. The underwear business is very positive and very strong, and the jeans business is damaged, and damaged in Europe and North America. Asia and Brazil, strong business with strong product. So I think those stumbling blocks that we had to deal with, for us cost us $0.50 a share or whatever in the last two years each, but we\u2019ve had to deal with them. I think those hopefully by the second half of 2014 are behind us, and I see nothing ahead of us from a Calvin Klein brand point of view, positioning point of view, from the global growth opportunities presented by the brand that changed any of my thoughts from 24 months ago to where we are today and how we think we can move this business forward.","Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. And then just a quick two-part follow-up. I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but can you give us an update on the sportswear launch in Europe, and then secondly the tough macro, the tough conditions in the U.S., are you seeing any agitation for pricing concessions or otherwise from your retail customers for the fall product?","Emanuel Chirico","Let me do the first part first. The short answer is no, we\u2019re not seeing any impact at this point on cancellations or pricing pressure or whatever. When you think about the North American wholesale business that we really manage almost as if it was our own retail business, we\u2019re totally focused in on that business on a weekly, daily basis. So we are making the decisions along with our retail partners about the markdown cadence, the need to move certain product categories that start to build up, and I would first say as much as everybody talked how difficult February was as a month, just remember it\u2019s the smallest month in the fiscal year. We\u2019re starting to see business in department stores improving as we move through March. It\u2019s always difficult to read when you have holiday shifts like Easter coming later, but against plan or whatever, the last two or three weeks, business has started to improve and we\u2019re really looking for April to be a significant month for us.","So short answer is no impact on the fall season, no cancellations, no price concessions at this point, and just very carefully managing our markdown cadence and promotional cadence to deal with the macro environment overall.","On the platinum sportswear launch in Calvin Klein, it\u2019s a relatively small launch second half of the year. It will be somewhere in the $10 million range overall with key accounts really focused. We\u2019ve gotten very strong reviews on the product line, how the goods are, and what we really want to do is place it with some key accounts, keep it relatively tight in some key markets, build then off the success and momentum as we go forward, as opposed to widely distributing it and having it more fragmented. We want to build a success story there, keep it very tight.","To remind everyone, the launch is really focused on men\u2019s. I would describe it as a sportswear line, tailored clothing, dress furnishings line with real\u2014what you really would expect from Calvin. The women\u2019s launch will be even smaller and will be second half of 2015. We\u2019re keeping that very tight.","I think the focus for Europe, as we really think that the sportswear could be\u2014the platinum sportswear could be a significant opportunity for us going forward. We also think it needs to be done in a way that\u2019s very brand appropriate and brand building, and it\u2019s important to build it off of a very strong foundation to so move slowly. But where the real opportunity in Calvin Klein Europe for us financially and operationally is jeans and underwear turnaround. We focus on those businesses, almost $500 million in sales just with those two businesses, and take a business that\u2019s losing or slightly profitable and really focus on those opportunities \u2013 jeans, underwear \u2013 along with our accessory businesses and jeans and in Calvin Klein overall.","Those are the opportunities that will really drive performance and better financial results.","Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from John Kernan from Cowen & Company.","John Kernan \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Emanuel Chirico","Thanks John.","John Kernan \u2013 Cowen & Co.","So this is a bit of a follow-up just on the commentary around the jeans and underwear operating margins for Calvin Klein. As we look at your segment operating margins, where does the normalized operating margin for the Calvin Klein international business reside? I know Warnaco had lost over 1,000 basis points in its European business by the time you\u2019d bought it. I think their Asian and Latin American margins were also coming down. So as we model that segment out over the next several years, what type of operating margin do you think that business can get to?","Emanuel Chirico","Okay, let me take the overall\u2014let me do it in my way. I think the Calvin Klein operating margins should be north\u2014overall should be north of 15%, and probably 16 to 17% considering the level of licensing revenue that\u2019s in that business. The international margins this year are operating at about 13% this year, the international margins. I think they will take a step back in 2014 and then they should expand 100 basis points a year going forward for at least the next three years. So that business overall, the international operating margins should probably be in the 15 to 16% range by 2016, \u201917.","John Kernan \u2013 Cowen & Co.","All right, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. And then I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself here, but I can\u2019t help but look at the leverage ratios on your balance sheet by the end of 2015 will be back below where they were when you bought Warnaco, so what\u2019s the appetite to maybe re-lever the balance sheet for another acquisition of maybe a lifestyle brand outside of what you currently own in the portfolio?","Emanuel Chirico","John, I think the best use of our capital would be continue to invest in Calvin and Tommy acquisitions, as opposed to another lifestyle brand. I say that for a couple of reasons. I think one, I think there would be significantly less risk as any acquisition would be, since it\u2019s our brand, we know the business, we should understand how it\u2019s impacted. We would be layering on businesses that are not foreign to us from the point of view. If it\u2019s an international business, it should be a business in Asia where we\u2019re already operating Calvin Klein, say in China or Hong Kong, that if we were to work out an arrangement to bring in the Tommy businesses there, that\u2019s a business we understand. We have an infrastructure in place that we can leverage off of, and then finally the kind of multiple that we would have to pay to bring back more of our own businesses, I think would be much lower than a multiple we\u2019d have to pay for a lifestyle brand.","So I think the next three years, that\u2019s what you should think about. Besides paying down debt in 2014, \u201915 and beyond, if we talk about acquisitions, you should be thinking about more Calvin Klein, more Tommy Hilfiger. That doesn\u2019t mean that as we get out there that a third leg to the stool that might be a global brand for us that we could take advantage of our infrastructure and who we are, I think that\u2019s clear; but I think really trying to stay focused to maximize the growth at Tommy and Calvin over the next five years, I think is where we can get the best return for our shareholders.","John Kernan \u2013 Cowen & Co.","That\u2019s very helpful, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go now to Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson \u2013 Barclays","Hi, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about the plan for 5% growth in Calvin Klein in 2014, maybe what that includes in terms of each region or where you think there could be room for upside?","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think we\u2019re planning North America to grow in that 5% range, comps in the 3 to 4% range overall. We are looking at Europe to grow the top line mid-single digits, and remember that includes also eliminating some of the secondary sales that were pretty profitable but were brand damaging as we go forward. And in Asia, Latin America, we\u2019re looking for high single-digit kind of growth overall.","So when you blend that together, coupled with the fact that we\u2019ve taken our Australia business from an operating business to now a joint venture where we\u2019re enjoying the earnings but we\u2019ve taken it off of our books, in South America the non-Brazil, Mexico business and central South America is now converted to a license model as opposed to an operating model that was losing money. So I think when you bring it all together, that\u2019s why the 5% number is maybe not as high as we would expect in 2015 where I think it would be closer to 7 to 8%. I hope that gives you some color.","The opportunities would be\u2014the biggest opportunity would be to outperform the retail estimates in North America, Asia and Latin America. That\u2019s really where I see the big opportunities for top line growth opportunity going forward.","Joan Payson \u2013 Barclays","Okay, great. And then just to turn to Tommy Hilfiger quickly, what progress have you made in Japan so far, and when do think we could expect to see a turnaround in that business?","Emanuel Chirico","I think we\u2019re seeing that business clearly has not turned around. I think we\u2019re seeing that business in the first quarter stabilize and level off. I think it will now become not a negative when we talk about our earnings growth. It\u2019s becoming a push for \u201914. We\u2019re planning the earnings flat and really trying to manage the business. That\u2019s clearly an area of focus for Daniel and our team in Japan, and we\u2019re really looking at it not as a top line opportunity. We\u2019re looking at it as a profit opportunity to clean the business up, to really be more efficient there, and to position the brand appropriately for the rest of Asia. So I think that\u2019s the mission there. ","Keep in mind it\u2019s a relatively small business, about $200 million, and I think we have it under control. It will be a slow turnaround as we go forward to get it back to normalized earnings at 10%. That is a three to four-year goal as we go forward, so I think that\u2019s how you have to think about that business.","Joan Payson \u2013 Barclays","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Howard Tubin from RBC Capital Markets.","Courtney Wilson \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, this is Courtney Wilson in for Howard. We\u2019re just wondering if you can speak a bit more on marketing plans in the U.S. this year. Thanks.","Emanuel Chirico","Sure. I think on the Tommy Hilfiger side of the business, we\u2019re increasing our overall marketing spend globally, somewhere in the 8 to $10 million range. It\u2019s tied into the growth of the business overall and growing our advertising accordingly, so I think you\u2019ll see a continuation of the effective marketing that we\u2019ve had. We\u2019re putting more and more of our marketing not just in media but going online, but also really at point of sale to really impact in that area as well.","On the Calvin Klein side, we\u2019ve always spent a significant amount of money. We\u2019ve got a huge promotional campaign going on now, My Calvins, which is an underwear-based campaign. It\u2019s 360 at point of sale, it\u2019s on the web, it\u2019s in social media as well, and we are really connecting, I think, directly with the millennium customer, the younger customer that we\u2019re really targeting there. We\u2019ve gotten tremendous press on that, coverage, a significant amount of traffic, so that\u2019s been a really exciting campaign. It\u2019s gone viral and is really\u2014we\u2019ve had a lot of celebrity endorsements that have just come on board, so that\u2019s exciting as well.","And then lastly in Calvin, as always, fragrance is such a big part of it. We\u2019ve got a major launch going on for the second half of the year, which I\u2019ll talk more about as the year has gone on. Coty will be spending $100 million this year, so I think there will be some really good marketing going on as well. The big increase in spend that you\u2019re really seeing happening, it\u2019s not in media or that, it\u2019s that retail presentation to really connect with the consumer, that\u2019s the store environment and the product that we deliver in that store environment, particularly in the jeans area, is up to the level of what the Calvin Klein brand is globally in all other product categories. So that\u2019s where the investment spend is. I hope that helps. ","Operator, we\u2019re running to an investor conference right after this, so we\u2019re going to take one more question and then close the call.","Operator","Okay, very well. We will take our last question from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley.","Jay Sole \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about your CAPEX plans for 2014? How much do you plan to spend, and what will you be spending it on?","Emanuel Chirico","I guess I\u2019ll let Mike really focus on that.","Mike Shaffer","Okay. Our plan for \u201914 is about $300 million. In there is about $40 million to $50 million of carryover from 2013, some of the initiatives we had thought about for \u201913 we didn\u2019t get to get the spending done in \u201913, so we pushed that into \u201914. CAPEX for us this year will be heavy for warehouse construction as we exit some of the older Warnaco facilities and get our facilities up to capacity to handle that business, office relocations, showroom construction, and of course new stores which we\u2019ll be opening all over the globe, so. ","Emanuel Chirico","New stores and renovated stores, as I talked on retail presentation, really upgrading a number of our stores particularly in Europe, also in Asia, and really focused in on presentation in department stores with our wholesale business \u2013 you know, building shops for jeans and underwear, building fixtures as well to really enhance the presentation. Most of that will come in our back end of the year as we go forward, and really building particularly the presence in the top doors with our key accounts, Macy\u2019s and Belk\u2019s and some of our doors, to really enhance that jeans and presentation as we go. We\u2019re really in the process of negotiating that right now with Macy\u2019s in particular to really expand the space and hopefully improve the profitability.","Jay Sole \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Terrific, thanks so much.","Emanuel Chirico","Okay. I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us and look forward to speaking to you in late May with our first quarter earnings. Have a great day everyone and enjoy. Bye bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call, and we thank you for your participation."],"18374":["PVH Corp.

Good morning everyone. Joining me on the call is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Chief Operating Officer, Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Development and Investor relations.","I am pleased to report that PVH posted strong second quarter results despite a challenging and volatile global backdrop. We reported earnings per share of $2.10, which exceeded the high end of our previous guidance by $0.20. The outperformance was principally driven by our European businesses. ","While we are pleased that our first half results exceeded our expectations, we are taking a conservative approach to how we are planning our second half of the year and our low-end of fiscal year earnings per share guidance to $9.30 to $9.40 per share. ","Our revised guidance reflects a significantly more conservative outlook based on several headwinds that we believe are working against us including the volatility in the macro environment, the weakening global retail landscape and the increased escalation of U.S. China trade tensions including a $0.20 cumulative impact from the proposed tariff. ","Given the uncertainties surrounding the global retail apparel sector, we felt it was prudent to provide earnings guidance that we are confident we will be able to deliver. Before I go into the specific details, I\u2019d like to provide a few key regional themes from the quarter, as well as our thoughts heading into the second half of the year. ","First, beginning with our performance by region. Our European business continued to outperform and gain market share. Despite the macro situation, and the uncertainty around Brexit, we are bucking the retail trend with most markets in Europe continuing to show strong trends with Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Both brands are resonating with the consumer. ","The product is working and our teams have a deep understanding of the European market and consumer landscape. We believe that these favorable trends should continue for the balance of this year. ","Moving onto the U.S., as many of our peers have indicated, the U.S. market was traffic challenged during the second quarter, which led to a highly promotional first half. International tourism continues to be soft as the deceleration versus the first quarter continued. ","As a reminder, international tourist represents 35% to 40% of our outlet store sales in North America. As we look to the second half of the year, we are no longer expecting traffic trends to improve and we are projecting a more promotional environment, which will pressure margins, given the higher industry-wide inventory levels in the face of slower sales demand across channels. ","At the same time, many of our wholesale partners are taking an increasingly cautious view of the full holiday season that\u2019s upcoming. As they look to manage inventory levels, which is leading to tighter open to buy plans later in the year and into spring 2020. ","Finally, in Asia, the traffic trends we experienced in the first quarter further decelerated into the second quarter. This deceleration is totally driven by the Greater China region, which is being impacted by the rising U.S. China trade tensions, the ongoing protest in Hong Kong, and a stronger U.S. dollar. ","While our teams continue to be nimble and react to emerging business trends, we are now projecting the second quarter sales trends will continue for the balance of this year with more pronounced pressure in Hong Kong as the protest continues to cause traffic disruptions. ","Despite the macro picture, we have great confidence in the underlying power of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and believe we are positioning our businesses to succeed in this ever-changing consumer landscape. ","As we evaluate the ongoing environment around us, we are increasingly making targeted purposeful investments. We have completed two strategic acquisitions in the second quarter. The first was our acquisition of the Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and Van Heusen businesses in Australia; and the second was our acquisition of the Tommy Hilfiger businesses in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Singapore and in Malaysia. ","We believe taking direct operating control of our brands will drive long-term growth in these strategically important markets. During the quarter, we also announced that we will take on more direct control of our global hosiery business. We will form a joint venture with the best-in-class hosiery partners to design and produce goods across all of our brands, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and our Heritage brands.","The JV will be responsible for the sales and distribution of our brands in North America and we will be responsible with sales and distribution of our brands internationally. We also continue to invest in our company-wide data and digital innovation agenda, which over the long-term will drive stronger brand loyalty, and more sustainable sales and profitability. ","To recap a few of these areas, first, we continue to invest in digital, from our e-commerce sites to mobile platforms and incorporating digital elements in our stores. Today, digital sales continue to track at slightly over 10% of our total revenues and we continue to see robust growth online with sales growth exceeding 20% in our owned, operated businesses during the second quarter. ","Additionally, the consumer data journey is a major focus area for us. As we learn more about our consumers and use this insight to power our marketing and product decisions, we believe that we can drive unique consumer shopping experiences with the goal of improving our sales and margins and providing a more seamless consumer experience. ","We are also focusing on efficiencies across the business, from our supply chain to our warehousing and distribution, and to optimizing our global retail footprints and operating model. ","I am now going to move onto our brand results and I will begin with Tommy Hilfiger. Our Tommy Hilfiger business posted very favorable results despite the challenging global consumer environment. The brand continues to see outstanding traction globally and we are pleased to see considerations, advocacy, and relevance metrics among 18 to 35 year old consumers continuing to grow in 2019. ","We continue to focus on the next generation of consumers, while deepening connections with our core consumers. We embraced our global and local ambassadors with exciting customer activations to drive brand heat. ","For example, we celebrated our partnership with Shawn Yue with our opening event of the first ever Tommy Hilfiger Store of the Future in Asia located in Beijing, China, which generated significant social visibility on WeChat, and Weibo upon launch. ","Additionally, our collaborative collection with Louis Hamilton before 2019 has proven to be the strongest season yet with sell-in values doubling versus spring 2019. Category expansion was another focus area and we continued to grow and expand our local \u2013 global categories of Tommy jeans, footwear and accessories. ","Looking ahead, we are excited that our Tommy Now Fashion Show is returning to New York City before 2019. The show will feature the second Tommy by Zendaya collection. Looking to full holiday and into next year, stay tuned for exciting events and activations that will leverage our local influences in key markets to drive more unique engagements, as well as differentiated Tommy experiences for our consumers. ","Moving to the business, Tommy\u2019s business increased 10% on a constant currency basis with earnings up 12% driven primarily by outperformance in Europe. Internationally, revenues rose 22% on a constant currency basis with retail comparable store sales rising 9%. ","International revenue growth was primarily driven by outperformance experienced in Europe, as well as the addition of revenue resulting from the Australia acquisition. EBIT margins to Tommy International rose 350 basis points. ","We continue to be extremely pleased with Tommy Europe\u2019s business, which posted double-digit revenue growth. These results especially offer such a strong baseline of results, highlights the market share gains that we have been able to deliver. ","We are seeing significant growth across all channels of distribution as we believe that our formula of the right product assortments offered at the right price value proposition, combined with engaging customer experiences are winning over our consumers. ","As a reminder, our fall 2009 order books are plus 15% and our spring summer 2020 order books are up about 12%. In Asia, we saw healthy performance with favorable consumer backdrop in Japan as the Tommy Hilfiger brand continues to resonate in this region. ","During the quarter, while our international business saw healthy growth, we did experienced pressure in the Greater China region, as consumers are being impacted by the trade tensions with the U.S. and the protest in Hong Kong, which has continued into the third quarter. ","Moving to North America, revenues decline 5% and margins were also under pressure down 350 basis points. While our wholesale trends were solid, we experienced significant under performance at retail as comparable store sales declined 8%, especially considering the challenging compares from last year with comp store up high double-digits. ","As many retailers have commented over the last few weeks, there were weak traffic trends across retail during the quarter and in the outlet malls in particular, which largely was driven by lower levels of international tourism coming to the United States. These factors led to higher promotional activity at retailers including us trying to move through inventories and drive traffic. ","Let me end with our licensing business. This continues to be a very positive story for us across the majority of our businesses demonstrating that the Tommy Hilfiger brand is extremely healthy. In particular, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our North America Women\u2019s business under G-III, which has experienced strong growth and excellent sell-throughs at retail. ","Let me move to the Calvin Klein businesses. We are making key connections with our core Calvin Klein consumers and we are really starting to see progress against getting the brand back to its core DNA. So the good news is that the brand is extremely healthy. ","Overall, Calvin Klein\u2019s momentum continued into the second quarter as the number two most engaged brand on Instagram in the second quarter. During the quarter, Calvin launched its Nothing But Pride in MyCalvin campaign featuring the Calvin Klein Pride capsule. Engagement rates were up over a 170% compared to Pride 2018 and we saw great sell-throughs across North America, Europe and Asia. ","Overall, our teams are delivering targeted consumer experiences to not only drive better engagement, but also drive sales conversion. We believe that this will result in improved brand performance as Calvin\u2019s product assortments improve going into fall and create a better 360 degree consumer experience. ","We are excited to launch the fall 2019 Underwear Campaign #MYCALVINS in real life which features a social and digital first rollout including notable talents, Odell Beckham Jr., Bella Hadid, Jacob Elordi and Naomi Campbell among others. ","Conversations drove more than 100 million unique consumer impressions within the first 36 hours of the campaign with an earned media value totaling over $4.5 million. ","Looking ahead in October, we will be launching our Calvin Klein 50, a highly commercial capsule collection celebrating the brand\u2019s 50th anniversary. The collection will be supported by a global campaign starring some of the brand\u2019s most famous and iconic faces. More to come on this a little later in the quarter. ","Lastly, improved product continues to be a key area of strategic focus as we approach 2020. Specifically, I wanted to give you an update on Calvin Klein Jeans. We continue to see a positive reaction to our core and basic denim styles within Calvin Klein Jeans and for fall, we believe that the mix of basics to fashion will be much more appropriate year-over-year. ","We are also looking forward to the fourth quarter relaunch of the Calvin Klein women\u2019s jeans business in North America, which will be launched by G-III. The retailers\u2019 reaction to the women\u2019s jeans product has been very enthusiastic and G-III\u2019s initial product placement at retail is running well ahead of our initial plans. ","Moving to the business, Calvin Klein\u2019s revenues declined 4% on a constant currency basis, while earnings declined 4% to $101 million. As a reminder, the transition of the Calvin Klein women\u2019s business to G-III for North America combined with the closure of the Calvin Klein Collection business pressured revenues by about 300 basis points in the quarter. ","By region, Calvin Klein revenues increased 5% on a constant currency basis and international comp store sales were flat for the quarter. Beginning with Calvin Klein, Europe, the business performed well in the second quarter. We saw strong second quarter growth across all channels and across the majority of our product offerings. ","The lifestyle is increasingly resonating with the consumer and we believe in the long-term growth opportunities in Europe, which is largely being driven by the expansion of women\u2019s, men\u2019s and performance apparels. As a reminder, our fall 2000 order books are up 15% and for spring 2020, we are up 12%. ","Moving on to Asia, results were below our plans from a sales and EBIT perspective with notable weakness in the Greater China region, slightly offset by favorable results across the digital businesses and our other markets in Asia. ","In China, we experienced weak traffic trends, particularly in brick and mortar, in part due to the Chinese consumer and partly due to the softer-than planned sales in our jeans business as we cleared through fashion styles for spring from the prior design aesthetic. We took faster and deeper markdowns than originally expected to keep inventory levels on plan. ","Additional due to our sizable presence in Hong Kong, our business was pressured by the protest, which consists \u2013 which significantly impacted our consumer spending and hurt tourist traffic in the region. ","Moving to North America, revenues declined 13%, largely driven by our decision to license the women\u2019s jeans business to G-III. At wholesale, we continue to see positive results from the digital businesses. In our retail businesses, comps were down 3%, which was a sequential improvement versus the first quarter sales trends despite continued pressure in international tourist markets and with the international tourist traffic. ","We believe that our efforts to enhance store productivity, as well as our merchandize efforts are showing early positive signs in fall. Additionally, our own digital sites for CK.com performed quite well during the quarter. ","Finally, in our Heritage business, revenues for the quarter were flat with comparable store sales down 2%. EBIT margins were under substantial pressure, down 400 basis points as the wholesale and retail businesses experienced gross margin pressure attributable to the more promotional U.S. retail environment, especially in U.S. retail department stores. ","As we look ahead, we plan to focus on our product innovation and continue to leverage our supply chain to produce further efficiencies. We are looking at many ways to optimize the Heritage business to generate enhanced returns. ","Before I turn it over to Mike to discuss second quarter results, and our full year guidance, I wanted to reiterate our confidence that our revised guidance reflects a significantly more conservative approach for the second half of the year as we believe it is prudent to provide earnings guidance that we are highly confident that we will be able to deliver. ","Now I will turn it over to Mike to provide more color on our second quarter results and our conservative approach to the second half outlook. ","Mike Shaffer","Thanks Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. ","Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.10, and was $0.20 better than the top-end of our previous guidance. The beat was driven by strong Tommy Hilfiger revenues in Europe along with expense reductions as we reacted to soft trends in Asia and North America. ","The actual beat from the business was $0.21 with interest from share count also better than guided by $0.01 each, partially offset by tax expenses, which were higher than guided for $0.03. ","Moving on to guidance. Our previous full year guidance had planned for our business trends to improve in the second half of the year. Now, with the summer are bit behind us we are taking a more conservative approach for the balance of the year. As we look at the state of the North America retail, we are seeing heavier industry-wide inventories in the channel than last year along with a decrease in traffic.","Our international consumers who shop in our tourist outlet stores not in the USA at the same levels as last year. In Asia, our businesses have also been impacted by the Hong Kong protest, along with overall weaker traffic trends across China. ","Europe continues to be a bright spot for us. We continue to operate above plan in both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger in Europe. The lack of improvement in trends in North America and Asia has forced us to relook at the balance of the year and reflect lower sales plans for the second half of 2019. ","We have reflected the second quarter business trends into the second half of the year with CK Asia being the only exception where we also reduced the trend to reflect the disruption caused by the Hong Kong protest. ","We have also anticipated a highly promotional macro retail environment as elevated industry-wide inventory levels in all channels will result in higher markdowns and in turn lower gross margins and operating margins. We have been conservative in how we have projected the second half revenues and the corresponding inventory markdowns and operating margin impacts. ","For the full year 2019, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be $9.30 to $9.40. A total FX headwind on the year is now estimated to be $0.35 of translation, an increase of $0.03 versus our previous guidance. Our guidance now also includes new tariffs including the 500 basis point increase announced last week. ","The total impact on the year due to tariffs is now approximately $0.20 per share on goods manufactured in China and delivered to the USA. This is an additional $0.10 of headwind versus our previous guidance. Overall for the year, we are projecting revenues conservatively and to grow approximately 1% as reported and approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. ","Included in our revenue guidance for the year is an addition of approximately $175 million related to the Australia and Greater China acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $100 million related to the licensing of the Calvin Klein women\u2019s jeans business and the closure of our Calvin Klein Collection business. ","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 5% as reported and 8% on a constant currency basis. We project Calvin Klein revenues to be down 2% as reported and flat to last year on a constant currency basis. Our Heritage business is planned to be down 1% to last year. ","Overall, our operating margins are planned down to 60 basis points for the year with the second half down about a 110 basis points. Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned down about 140 basis points versus the prior year with the second half operating margins down about 300 basis points to last year. The majority of this operating margin decline is in North America. ","Calvin Klein operating margins are planned up 50 basis points for the year. Our Heritage business operating margins are planned down a 110 basis points for the year. ","Lastly, we\u2019ve increased our planned share repurchase to $300 million on the year versus $200 million previously and reduced our long-term debt repayments to $50 million versus the $150 million previously. ","And with that, operator, we will open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Erinn Murphy ","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Manny, I guess, my first question for you is just regarding Europe, it\u2019s obviously been a very strong point within your business. I am curious if you could talk a little bit more about the country trends within the region during the second quarter and then when you look out to spring summer 2020, order books at 12% for both brands. ","Can you just parse out what\u2019s really driving the strength in each of those businesses, if you look out in the next six to nine months? Thank you. ","Manny Chirico","Okay. Focusing on the first, I guess, the order book. The strength on the Calvin Klein order book is pretty much across the board. ","We are seeing growth in the jeans business, our apparel businesses as well and that business is being up about a 12% and to be honest, that doesn\u2019t really, the order book has a very small factor in there relating to the underwear business, since that\u2019s really a more at-once kind of business. So, seeing really strong trends in that business. ","On the Tommy Hilfiger side of the business, the jeans business continues to drive a significant amount of growth. We are seeing continued growth in our footwear business with the trends there continue to grow and that business continues to really surprise us how strong it is and how double-digit kind of growth we continue to see. And our accessory businesses continues to be very strong. ","On a country basis, and I think this is applied to both brands. Our Germany and UK businesses which I am sure is on everybody\u2019s mind continues to be good. Germany in particular, the UK, from a retail point of view, last year we were seeing very strong retail comps in the UK and I think I have lot to do with the currency. As we cycle through that, we are still comping positive but not quite as positive as last year. ","We really haven\u2019t seen a slowdown in any of the key markets throughout Europe as we\u2019ve gone through it. We keep watching it. We are looking at the order books by country as well and we don\u2019t see that slowing down in any meaningful way and with the exception of some bankruptcies that have occurred, we are seeing strong growth throughout all of our accounts and key customers there. ","Erinn Murphy ","Got it. That\u2019s encouraging to hear. And then, I guess, just on tariffs, just bigger picture. I know you talked about the $0.20 hit to your full year guidance. But could you maybe talk more about what your mitigation strategies have been? ","And then, also, what is your view on the possibility of taking price to the consumer just given the tepid backdrop here in North America? Thanks. ","Manny Chirico","Okay. I think two components there. I think the cost mitigation continues and I think our factory vendors and our supplier are partnering with that as we go forward. We are also in discussions with some of our retail partners about some of the margin expectations given some of the tariff opportunities. So, I think, those are two areas in the short-term meaning the balance of 2019 that we have had discussion in. ","I don\u2019t think in the environment that we are at and given the short notice period and reactive time that we really can take prices up in this environment or that we should anticipate that we could be less promotional in this environment. ","We will attempt to do that from a selling point of view, but our guidance assumes none of that is going to be able to be done from mitigating some of these cost increases that will come from tariffs. I just don\u2019t think this is an environment that will withstand price increases in apparel as we move forward. ","Moving into 2020, we have significantly moved a lot of our production where we could out of the China market. Next year, we will be somewhere between 10% to 12% of our U.S. required production coming out of China and just three years ago, that\u2019s down from over 30%. So I think teams have done an outstanding job of moving that forward. ","We are in discussion with our retail partners about trying to move retail prices on some of those goods where it\u2019s necessary, particularly some of the product categories where there just is not an alternative to China. One particular area in apparel happens to be neckwear where 95% of all neckwear in the world is coming out of China. ","So we really need to be focused there. So I think, competitively, given that 10% to 12% range, we are in very good shape to deal with this issue and we will look at the opportunities of sharing the cost with our vendor base, and to be looking at some price increases with our consumer on a targeted basis as we move into spring 2020. ","Erinn Murphy ","Got it. Thank you so much. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. ","Bob Drbul","Hey, good morning. Manny, I was just wondering on, when you look at the inventory situation, I think both at PVH, but also out there in the retail environment, can you just help us mirror what you see from the gross margin opportunities that you guys have in the back half of the year with the guidance that you are giving this morning? ","And then, the second question is, just, I think you said, the Calvin \u2013 the updated Calvin operating margin is up 50. Can you just give us an update in terms of the recovery of Calvin from some of the jeans issues from last year? Just sort of how you see that playing out over the next couple of years now?","Manny Chirico","Okay. I think there is two stories here, Bob. There is the guidance that we\u2019ve given and I think what we are trying to factor is the guidance is a very realistic picture of what we see in the market today. And what we see in the market today is generally speaking, inventory levels are elevating coming out of the spring summer season. ","And I think you see that across the board. Our inventories, when you take out the acquisitions are up about 4%. And I think we are in a reasonably healthy position from a clearance point of view on moving through spring summer, we are in an excellent position. ","I think, we\u2019ve been very aggressive about moving those goods and trying to get in position as we start September and the real back-to-school selling season that we are not dealing with old products in our pipeline, specifically with Tommy and Calvin and specifically in North America and Asia where we see softness. ","So we\u2019ve been aggressive there and I think that that is a potential opportunity as we go forward. But our guidance is to build that we are going to continue to see margin pressure. I don\u2019t want to quote the numbers that Mike gave again, because I don\u2019t have them right in front of me. But clearly, we are looking for margin pressure in the second half. ","The opportunity is, particularly on the Calvin side, that the product resonates earlier than we anticipated with the consumer. And that is particularly on the jeans side that the product is literally hitting stores as we speak, getting ready for that important back-to-school selling season that that core denim product transacts better than we are anticipating in our guidance. ","That\u2019s the opportunity we see in the second half of the year, particularly against our guidance. I got to be honest, I am not optimistic. I was really optimistic about the holiday selling season. You know there is six less days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. I see the trade tensions with all due respect to the illustration seem like they are not really going to calm down. ","And I think that uncertainty is going to continue into the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s the backdrop that we\u2019ve tried to place on our guidance. If we are wrong hopefully, and that is \u2013 it is a better backdrop, we are in a very good position to capture that potential upside. But right now, I wouldn\u2019t count on it given what we are seeing in the business. ","Bob Drbul","Thank you. ","Manny Chirico","Bob, I think the last question, actually about Calvin Klein and the progress we are making.","Bob Drbul","Yes. ","Manny Chirico","I really feel on a number of it. First on the marketing, I think it\u2019s just clearly visible on the marketing first and foremost and that\u2019s probably what you see first primarily out there is, the marketing is back to the core DNA of the brand. We are back to that sensual, sexy, Calvin Klein marketing that connects with our core consumer, and we are tying it back to key product that really is being driven. ","We\u2019ve really significantly moved away from that high-end designer aesthetic and really are focusing on what we think drives our consumer. So, the marketing, I think as we go into the second half of the year is just right and we are connecting and I think you will even see that accelerate into the third and fourth quarter. ","And then I think we all feel that the fall holiday product is just significantly better than what we have we were last year. Again, back to the core DNA of the brand, back to black, grey, tan, core essential items that historically have driven our business and away from some of the fashion that really caused us significantly in markdowns last year. ","So, I think we are really well positioned and I think, as we look at our spring product, and see what\u2019s going on with our retail partners and their enthusiasm in the showroom, I think we are really feeling good as we get positioned for spring 2020 and our execution at retail is a big focus area for us as we go forward both in our stores and how we are presenting products with core essentials and really driving that message home to the consumer. ","And with our wholesale partners to really drive that message forward, tie back to the marketing which I think is much more directly tied to the product that\u2019s going to drive our sales increases. So, I feel good about where the brand is moving and that the brand is really helping. ","Bob Drbul","Thanks, Manny. ","Manny Chirico","Thank you. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Grace Smalley","Hi, good morning. This is Grace Smalley on for Matt. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess, looking out beyond the new prime time headwind, do you see any short promo as the year changes to your fiscal $0.03 to $0.05 revenue growth and double-digit bottom-line growth target?","Manny Chirico","I think is, we are very comfortable with the long-term growth algorithm that we\u2019ve put in place that mid-single-digit kind of growth, 4% to 6% that we believe will drive double-digit earnings per share growth. At the same time, given this backdrop, given the trade tensions, in the shorter term, I have to be more cautious about the macro environment and the retail environment and the backdrop that we are dealing with to determine how that will play out over the next 12 months. ","But from a long-term perspective, we see nothing that\u2019s changed with what will drive that growth. And as we look at the growth areas that we see, we see nothing. We\u2019ve always talked about fundamentally the biggest growth area for us from an opportunity point of view is the Calvin Klein Europe business. We continue to believe that\u2019s a billion dollar sales opportunity. ","Even in this backdrop, we are seeing double-digit sales growth throughout Europe. It gives us great confidence in the Calvin Klein brand and how it resonates. That growth will continue and then, for us, the Asia market has been a huge growth opportunity that\u2019s a bit up until the last six months, we\u2019ve seen high-single-digit growth consistently on a top-line basis from those markets. ","We believe that our brand resonates with those consumers. We believe that we play well, that we are well price positioned in those markets and that we have the strategy and the core health of the brand that can drive growth in that regions of the world. So from that perspective, we don\u2019t see anything that really change our perspective on the long-term algorithm that we\u2019ve discussed over the years. ","Grace Smalley","Great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Michael Binetti ","Hey guys. Thanks for taking our questions here. I guess, Manny, you commented that your wholesale partners are planning more conservatively for the holiday. Would you mind adding a little bit more color there? You see planned inventory receipts down. ","But I also think there has been a tendency over the last few years for the retailers at least in North America to ask the vendors to hold more inventory takes, more that inventory risk to be ready so they can chase as they need to. I mean, does that cause you to rethink how much of the risk you are assuming in that relationship in the margins that you are keeping in that relationship? ","Manny Chirico","Yes. I think, but there are \u2013 given our supply chain improvement, particularly on core replenishment product, we can react, we can react to some of our high margin businesses like underwear, we \u2013 as sales trends improve and as we see what\u2019s actually selling in the channel, we have the ability that we didn\u2019t have probably two or three years ago to react to sales trends both in our stores, but also in our retailers\u2019 stores. ","And again, when it comes to core replenishment items, taking some risk or taking some inventory \u2013 holding some additional inventory of fabric, associated with that kind of a product category is little to no risk for us as we go forward, because we can adjust future production as we move forward. But clearly in fashion and other areas where there is momentum in the business and where there is clearly places to place goods at profitable sales here in North America in particular. ","You are willing to take some risk that today we are clearly not factoring into that equation. So, it would be great, if we saw strong sell-throughs. It would be \u2013 I think we can capture a vast majority of it. It\u2019s really what will materialize and we had some visibility into it, a month or so visibility into it. We could react to it. ","But again, I think the opportunity to outperform, there will be some top-line opportunity, but the real opportunity will be on the margin line since we are planning for a significantly more promotions in that environment and things really would tend to get much more healthy, we would see an opportunity on the gross margins resulting in less marketing that we are planning right now. ","Michael Binetti ","Okay. And then longer term question, I guess, on \u2013 since you are speaking to the long-term algo that I am curious though what you think is a long-term margin potential for the Tommy business and in particular the international business. ","How do you gauge with the healthy talk for the margins in that business before you would say we\u2019d probably need to reinvest in a faster pace to keep chasing these growth opportunities given and keep the needle moving on the top-line, given how big that business is today? ","Manny Chirico","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I think, when you look at our segments the Tommy business last year operated somewhere around 15.5% operating margins and I think that last year, I haven\u2019t spoke about, but I thought that business could be around a 16% operating margin as we level expenses and move forward. ","And but the opportunity, particularly as the Asia market grows, which is our most profitable region in the world on a margin basis that \u2013 as that would grow that opportunity could grow with it. ","But I think, fundamentally, that business internationally is really running at a significantly high margin. On the other hand, the Calvin Klein business which last year, I am trying to find my papers, yes, I would need a second. ","The Calvin Klein business last year was running at about a 12% operating margin. I think there is no reason overtime why Calvin operating margin shouldn\u2019t be approaching the Tommy operating margins internationally. ","And most of it, I think the differential between the two isn\u2019t really a gross margin story, it\u2019s an expense leverage point of view. The Tommy business is twice as large as the Calvin business. And again, just to say, that\u2019s the only region of the world, Europe, where Tommy is larger than Calvin. ","So, the opportunity we really believe is at least in the next four years or so, that Calvin should be able to approach the same size of the Tommy market as we move forward. ","Michael Binetti ","Thank you. That helps. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Jay Sole ","Great. Thank you. Manny, could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the closed rate JV, like what precipitated the change? And what the financial benefit and other strategic benefits might be from that new JV?","Manny Chirico","Sure. I think it is our hosiery business historically has been a licensed business globally around the world. And as we look at the business and the dynamics for the business, it\u2019s a core replenishment business with a lot of the same characteristics as our underwear business. And our underwear business is one of our most profitable business categories that we operate. ","And as we look at that, we felt that we had a real opportunity to grow \u2013 to focus on that business. We have a world-class partner in North America that started with us about a year, a year-and-a-half ago with our Heritage brand and they\u2019ve done an outstanding job and we are very impressed with their supply chain capabilities, with their design capabilities and their abilities to get through product and understand the North America market and sell it. ","And we made a decision as our licenses in our big brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger in North America and Calvin International was coming due in the next 18 months, we made the decision today similar to what we\u2019ve done in, let\u2019s say China initially, with the joint venture in Brazil, with the joint - Mexico with our joint venture. ","We felt this was a product category that we could really do well that had the characteristics of high operating margins. Now, hosiery stock is not the most sexy business in the world from a brand aesthetic point of view, but from a profitability, it\u2019s plenty sexy. ","And we felt the best way to get into that business with a world-class partner that really \u2013 now got a handle, design, sourcing and those capabilities that we could work together with, coupled with our marketing expertise and our customer relationships around the world that we could really take that business going. ","So, we built that partnership. It\u2019s a joint venture, totally here in North America from design, product and distribution. Internationally, we are taking that line and initially starting with Calvin Klein business and the plan will then be to take on the Tommy Hilfiger business when that license comes due in a couple of years and international we control with the sales and distribution of that category as well. ","And we think it will be a nicely profit-enhancing business for us as we go forward with very little risk as we move through the business and relatively speaking, a low investment. ","Jay Sole ","Got it. And then maybe, if I could just ask one more, Mike, is there operating cash flow guidance for the year? And also looking on what the CapEx spend will likely be?","Manny Chirico","Sure. Mike?","Mike Shaffer","So, look, I guess, on the CapEx end, we are looking at about $400 million in expenditures for the year. And in terms of cash flow, we basically said about $500 million in terms of cash flow. And just a reminder, we are looking to \u2013 as we called out in the guidance $300 million on our share buyback this year and about $50 million of debt pay down. ","Jay Sole ","So, $500 million in free cash flow and then, with the share buyback after that and the debt pay down after that?","Mike Shaffer","Yes, sir. Correct. ","Jay Sole ","Correct. Okay, thanks. ","Manny Chirico","Yes, also just to say, and we are funding the acquisitions that I touched on the three \u2013 the two acquisitions and the funding of the joint venture partnership that will be in the fourth quarter. ","Mike Shaffer","With termination rights, correct.","Jay Sole ","Okay. Thank you so much. ","Mike Shaffer","Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Dana, please check your mute function. ","Dana Telsey ","Yes, sorry, I was on mute. Hi, good morning. Hi Manny. As you think \u2013 and Dana and Mike. As you think about the promotional environment of the wholesale accounts, how do you see additional digital business in both for Tommy and for Calvin, certainly the reset at Calvin with the enhancements, what do you see is the opportunity there on the top-line as you go into next year? And also, any thoughts on the margins going forward. Thank you. ","Manny Chirico","Sure. It\u2019s a good question. Look, I \u2013 we don\u2019t see the digital growth for both of those brands going down and when I say digital growth, it\u2019s the growth of our own directly operated online businesses around the world, coupled with our business model with some of our key partners from Amazon, to Tmall, to Zalando, which has been great business partners for us. ","Those partners continue to focus on our brands and continue to look to drive the brands. What\u2019s interesting as we look at those businesses is, in the third-party businesses, Amazon, Zalando, Tmall, those business models are as profitable or slightly more profitable than some of our existing wholesale channel partners\u2019 profitability. So, it\u2019s not as if those businesses are margin negative. ","They are actually margin neutral or margin enhancing. So \u2013 and when we sell ourselves obviously, that\u2019s a retail margin versus the wholesale margin. ","So, that will continue to improve. I think our gross margins and our margins overall going forward and we don\u2019t see that changing over this year and most of next year as we go forward. So, and we are making those investments in order to continue to enhance that business as we go forward. ","Dana Telsey ","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Tiffany Kanaga with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Tiffany Kanaga ","Hi, thanks for taking our questions. I understand that you are taking a very conservative approach and not baking any improving trends into your overall second half guidance. But with the number of your retail partners discussing some better momentum into August, can you highlight for us any bright spots or signs of sequentially better trends as we kick off the third quarter? ","Manny Chirico","Well, look, I think, okay. So, I am not going to call anybody out. They did that themselves. But I do think that what people have been saying about the second quarter, specifically in North America and probably more specifically in our wholesale customer with our key wholesale customers is, sequentially, the second quarter improved as the quarter moved on. ","And that their initial view of what was happening and all I guess was consistent to what was happening in July. So I think, and now they\u2019ve talked about their sales guidance and what they are seeing. What they are seeing in their business, we are seeing in our business as well. ","So it\u2019s probably correlated and we\u2019ll see how that all plays out, I think fundamentally, when you look at what their guidance is for the second half of the year, we are more conservative on those trends continuing and improving, because I think there is an element of not only that it will continue as an element that as we get into September and beyond, that the sales trends will actually continue, we hope so. ","But we are not planning for that in our guidance. And obviously, if the sales trends improve, it will take pressure off of the margins that we are also anticipating in our guidance. So, I think that\u2019s how you have to think about what we are doing somewhat differently than our competitors and some of our key customers at this point. We hope they are right. ","Tiffany Kanaga ","Thanks so much. ","Manny Chirico","With that operator, we\u2019ll make this our last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Kimberly Greenberger ","Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to just ask about the Tommy Hilfiger expectations in the back half of the year. I think you said, a 300 basis point decline. I am wondering if the big driver there is just a normalization of markdowns, so that\u2019s coming out of merchandize margin. Are there any other sort of significant drivers that are bringing that down? ","And then, secondarily, Manny, you guys have made great progress in reducing your reliance on China as a country of origin. I think you said you are down to about 10% to 12% at this point. As you look out over the next 12 to 18 months, do you have aspirations to bring that down any further? Thanks. ","Manny Chirico","Okay. Let me take the last one first, because it\u2019s just top of mind, right now. What we would hope as opposed to how many it takes China to completely down is what we would hope is that we would actually get a resolution to the tariff and a resolution to the situation. And go back to a level playing field, and go back to sourcing that will be driven by global economic realities and not artificial elements like tariffs just being placed on goods coming into the United States. ","We think that would be a much healthier place to be. We have always believed that as China\u2019s economy continues to improve as they continue to advance their economy, that apparel in general would become a smaller portion of their manufacturing base and there would be a natural evolution out of China over a longer period of time. ","The tariffs have accelerated that movement. And I think as we\u2019ve tried \u2013 I think we have been well positioned, because we recognize what was ahead of us over the next three to four years in a normal trading environment and we opened up Africa. We moved to some other locations throughout Asia and we tried to position ourselves with key fabric suppliers throughout the world that would enhance our supply chain. ","So I think we were fortunate that we were ahead of the curve on a number of those movements and has positioned us well. We would like to think that we would get to a more normal world when we could just make economic decisions about where it\u2019s most appropriate to make goods and that China could continue to be a key resource for the U.S. market, even though we would continue to probably trend down over the long-term, just not as dramatically as it\u2019s been occurring. ","The first part of the question was, the Tommy Hilfiger margins, I think where we are planning for the margins to be under pressure are basically in North America. And I think the North America margins are up against really historically high margins last year, that\u2019s one challenge that we faced, that we tried to anniversary at the beginning of the year. ","And we were also dealing with a sales trend as we came out of the fourth quarter last year. Just to remind everyone, our Tommy Hilfiger retail comps are up mid-single-digits. We were feeling strong growth in the wholesale channel distribution and as you would have expected, we bought into that sales trend. So inventory in our Tommy Hilfiger, particularly our retail business is higher than we would like. ","It\u2019s part of the inventory and that is not aged as we have moving through, but it\u2019s still heavier than we would have wanted to have in that channel of distribution today and given the sales trends that we\u2019ve built into our model, those margins are under more and more pressure. ","We would expect in a more normal environment, in North America, that off of the 2019 projected margins for this year, that we should see an improvement in gross margins going forward if nothing else getting the inventories rebalanced for the full year as we enter 2020. ","So I think that\u2019s an opportunity that we really need to focus on and that we are really going to hold our businesses too as we work through those businesses and that\u2019s one of the opportunities that would be ahead of us. ","Kimberly Greenberger ","Great. Thanks. ","Manny Chirico","And operator, with that we\u2019d like to close the call. We want to thank everyone for joining us. We also want to wish you a happy holiday weekend and we look forward to speaking to you in \u2013 I guess, early late November, right after the Thanksgiving holidays with our third quarter earnings release and guidance.

Please go ahead, sir.","Manny Chirico","Thank you, Dana. Joining me on the call today is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of Investor Relationships; and Ken Duane, who runs, CEO and runs all of our Wholesale businesses in the United -- in North America.","In general, we\u2019re very pleased with the results for the quarter. Just to summarize, we beat our top end of the second quarter earnings guidance by about $0.05 and given the momentum we\u2019ve seen in our business, we\u2019ve also increased the top end of our 2012 earnings guidance by $0.07 for the year to $6.25 to $6.32.","Getting into our major businesses, I\u2019m going to start with the Tommy Hilfiger business. The Tommy Hilfiger business continued its strong performance during the quarter, posting a 4% revenue increase and a 28% increase in operating income.","When you take out the foreign currency headwinds, our operating performance was outstanding on a constant currency basis. Revenues were up 10% and operating income was up over 34% for the quarter.","Let me focus on the International business of Tommy. Revenues internationally were 9% local currency. Our retail comps in Europe posted a 15% increase for the quarter, while wholesale revenues were up 9%.","Geographically, we continue to see strong growth in Central and Northern Europe, with particular strength in France, Germany and Turkey, partially offset by softness in Southern European market with particular focus on Spain and Italy.","Moving to North American where we posted 11% revenue increase for the quarter, that was driven by 11% comp store increase in our retail businesses and high single-digit growth in our wholesale businesses. We continue to see momentum in North America and strongly believe that the significant investments we are making in product and in our marketing programs are paying dividends for us.","We have seen average unit retails increase about 10% over the last 12 months at both wholesale and retail. We continue to elevate product and gain additional four space at top doors in Macy\u2019s, which is helping fuel the brand exposure.","We strongly feel that our in-store presentations and product initiatives will be fully in place in the second half of this year. And we believe we\u2019re well positioned to continue to exceed our plans in North America for the balance of the year.","For 2012, we are planning our overall Tommy revenues to grow 7% to 8% on a constant currency basis. Given the uncertain economic environment, we are planning our revenue growth for the balance of the year more conservatively than current trends would indicate.","Moving to Calvin Klein, the Calvin Klein business continues to exceed our financial guidance and post strong results. Total revenues in the second quarter for our combined Calvin Klein businesses were up 5% despite overall softness in the global jeans and women\u2019s underwear businesses.","This increase was driven by our Calvin Klein North American retail business, which posted a 5% comp store increase. For the year, we are planning our total North American Calvin Klein wholesale and retail businesses to grow about 10%. This will be driven by a mid-single digit comp store increase and growth in square footage at both wholesale and retail.","Moving to our licensing segment, royalty revenues were up 6% on a constant currency basis. This increase was driven by strong performance globally in fragrance, women\u2019s sportswear, dresses, men\u2019s and women\u2019s footwear and handbags and accessories, all of which posted double-digit sales increases.","This positive performance was negatively impacted by 10% decline in Warnaco\u2019s global Calvin Klein sales. The licensing business posted strong revenue increases across all geographic regions with the exception of Europe. Specifically by region, North America sales were up 5% with all product categories posting strong results with the exception of jeans and women\u2019s underwear.","In Asia, sales were up 6% driven by double-digit growth in China, Hong Kong and India and partially offset by weak sales in Korea. Latin and South America sales were up 25% driven by the Brazilian market, which continue to post above 30% increases.","In Europe, sales overall were down 12% principally related to the poor performance of the Warnaco apparel and underwear businesses.","Let me put some color on some of our biggest licensed businesses, starting with jeans and underwear. As I mentioned, the overall business is down about 10% on a constant currency basis in the second quarter. Continued -- that\u2019s being driven by continued weak performance in jeans and women\u2019s underwear.","On a regional basis, looking at those business we saw strong sales in Asia and South America, which were more than offset by the poor sales with jeans and underwear in North America and Europe.","Moving to fragrance, our fragrance business continued its strong performance across all regions. For the current year, our new fragrance launch schedule is all second-half weighted, compared to last year\u2019s launch of CK ONE in spring.","Despite that timing issue, fragrance sales were up 11% for the quarter and well ahead of projections. We continue to see strong performance from our Euphoria, CK ONE and Sheer Beauty franchises.","For the second half of the year, we have two new product initiatives planned. The first is a new men\u2019s fragrance called Encounter, which is just beginning to ship to key accounts throughout North America and the rest of the world.","And the second is a new global marketing and advertising campaign for Euphoria, our largest fragrance franchise. The Euphoria marketing campaign will begin in October and intensify in the all-important holiday selling season.","Both of these initiatives will be supported by significant marketing and advertising spends, as well as new celebrity talent, which should fuel significant growth in the second half of the year.","Moving to women\u2019s apparel, our North American U.S. women\u2019s apparel and footwear businesses were very strong this quarter. Our royalty revenues with our licensees, G3 and Jimlar were up about 15% for the quarter.","On the apparel side, the growth is being fueled by strong selling of women\u2019s sportswear, women\u2019s performance, dresses and suits. In addition, on the footwear side of the house, we\u2019re seeing strong performance in men\u2019s, as well as in women\u2019s.","Moving to handbag and accessories, that business continues its strong performance. G3 has seen excellent sell-through at department store accounts. We are targeting a 25% growth for these product categories in 2012 and\/or on track to exceed that.","Our CK Bridge business in Asia continues to grow, posting a 10% increase in revenues for the quarter. We expect this business to grow 20% for the balance of the year. The growth is being driven by China, Hong Kong and Indian market, where we experienced significant door expansion and comp store sales growth.","For 2012 as we previously discussed with you, we are planning our Calvin Klein royalty revenue growth more conservatively than in prior years, due to the uncertainty in Europe and the weakness we see in our global jeans business.","In order to take the financial risk out of our finance -- out of our guidance, we have -- we are currently projected all of the European jeans wear and apparel businesses that Warnaco operates a contractual minimums for fiscal 2012.","As such, our CK European royalties are being planned down about 10% for the balance of 2012. Overall, we continue to plan royalty revenues on a consolidated basis -- on a constant currency basis to grow about 3% to 4% for the year.","Moving on to our Heritage business, excluding the impact of the exited businesses IZOD women\u2019s and Timberland, ongoing revenues for the Heritage business decreased 6%. Comp store sales in the Heritage business -- retail businesses were relatively flat, while our ongoing wholesale businesses experienced 10% sales declined due entirely to a reduction in dress furnishings sales to J. C. Penney.","Given the overall weak second quarter performance at J. C. Penney and a significant decline in customer traffic, our replenishment EVI businesses, particularly dress shirts and ties which are driven by customer traffic have been negatively impacted. We have right sized all the inventories levels at J. C. Penney and readjusted our sales estimates for the balance of the year. All of this is factored into our plans in our guidance.","Clearly, the Heritage business is in the midst of a major turnaround. We are very confident and we feel we are very well-positioned in this business for the balance of the year.","Our four orders are on plan. Inventory levels are in line with retail sales plans. Our average unit retails are currently up 5% to 7%, second half product course are decreasing 5% to 7% and our in-shop store presentations are being enhanced and expanded with key customers.","The IZOD\u2019s J. C. Penney shop openings are on target to open the first week of September. All of this gives us a high degree of confidence that we will see a dramatic improvement in this business beginning in the third quarter of 2012.","To give you a sense of some of the third quarter trends that we are seeing in the first month of August. Again, the Calvin Klein and Tommy businesses are off to a very strong performance and continued to outperform our guidance.","Comps in our Calvin and Tommy Hilfiger business are running up 8% to 9% against the mid single-digit comp planned. Comps for our Heritage business are running up low single digits in line with plan.","At wholesale in the United States both Calvin Klein and Tommy continued to perform ahead of sales plans and we continue to see increases in our out the door retails. Our Heritage business is well-positioned for its financial turnaround and we feel we are well on target with J. C. Penney to implement all the shops at first week of September.","Moving to Europe, our Tommy retail business in Europe, we are seeing comps in Europe to continue to post low teens increases against the 5% comp store plan, so very strong performance continues at retail in Europe. Our Tommy wholesale business, which represents about 70% of the total Tommy business in Europe, continues its strong momentum.","For the fall holiday 2012 season, our order book is up 4% to 5% and our fall shipments are running on time. We are seeing no indication of slowdown or cancellation with any major European customers and feel very good about our current European sell-throughs. The fall selling season is off to a strong start.","Given our strong European sales trends, we clearly are continuing to grow market share in all key countries. Looking at the spring 2013, our order book is not complete but we\u2019d indicate our wholesale sales increase for the first half of the year of 4% to 5%.","Looking at our -- finally, looking at our guidance, we have been very prudent with our estimates. We believe we have taken a significant portion of the risk out of the Calvin Klein European royalties by planning the Warnaco jeans and apparel royalties a contractual guaranteed minimum royalty levels. We feel we have put together sales and operating margin projections that we cannot only meet but if business trends continue we can exceed as we go forward.","We believe that the momentum we see in our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses will continue to drive our growth and should allow us to continue to outperform our current projections.","With that, I will turn it over to Mike to quantify some of these results.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks Manny. The comments I\u2019m going to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our earnings release. We are very happy with the second quarter results.","For the second quarter, we met our revenue guidance and delivered earnings per share of $1.25, which was $0.05 above the top end of our guidance and 17% greater than the prior year. Our $0.05 earnings per share guidance is reflected in EBIT improvement of $0.03, and taxes and interest improvement of $0.02.","Our total revenues while relatively flat to the prior year, when negatively impacted by currency translation and discontinued businesses. Excluding these items our revenues were up 4% to last year.","Our Tommy Hilfiger revenues, which were ahead of guidance was strong in both Europe and North America. On a constant currency basis, Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 10%. Our Calvin Klein revenues for the quarter were plus 5% to last year, slightly better than our guidance.","Moving to our guidance for 2012, we\u2019ve raised our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $6.25 to $6.32, or an increase of 16% to 17% over the prior year. We raise the top end of our full year earnings per share guidance for $0.05 second quarter a bit, plus an additional $0.02 for the second half.","Revenues for the year are planned to be up 5% to 6%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and our discontinued businesses. Including the impact of foreign exchange and discontinued businesses we are expecting revenues to be up 1% and 2%.","Total Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to be up 7% to 8% on a constant currency basis, with Tommy Hilfiger North America increase 7% to 8% and Tommy Hilfiger international increasing 7% to 8% on a constant currency basis.","Including the negative impact of foreign exchange, we are expecting total Tommy Hilfiger revenues to be up 2% to 3%. Calvin Klein revenues are planned to increase 6% to 7%, while our ongoing Heritage businesses our planning revenues up 1% to 2%, excluding the impact of our exiting IZOD and -- our Timberland and IZOD women\u2019s businesses. Our total Heritage revenues are planned to decline 4% to 5%, including the negative impact of 6% related exited businesses.","Gross margin for the year is planned up about 150 basis points with expenses for the year planned up about 80 basis points, due in large part to an increase in pension expense. Impacting our gross margin and expense in 2012 is our mix of business, as a result of faster growth in our higher gross margin and higher expense Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses. Operating margins for 2012 are planned to increase about 70 basis points over 2011.","Our tax rate for the year is planned to 23.5% to 24% and reflects the continued benefit of additional foreign earnings, which are taxed at a lower rate than domestic earnings. Interest expense is planned between $115 million to $117 million reflecting a reduction to the prior year as a result of debt repayments.","For the third quarter of 2012, earnings per share is planned to $2.20 to $2.25 or an increase of 16% to 19% over the prior year. We are planning our revenues to increase about 3% to 4% to the prior year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and exited businesses. Including the impact of foreign exchange and exited businesses, we\u2019re planning our revenues down about 2% to 3%.","Our gross margins for the third quarter will be up about 250 to 275 basis points, all businesses are plan to show gross margin improvement as we sell four product to showing cost decreases of about 5% to 7%.","Overall, operating margins for the third quarter are planned up about 150 basis points influence by mix of business and gross margin improvement. Tax rate for the third quarter is planned to 23% to 23.5%.","And lastly, we\u2019re continuing to project term loan repayments for full year 2012 of about $300 million. This will bring our total term loan repayments since the date of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition to about $1 billion.","And with that, we\u2019ll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Bob Drbul with Barclays Capital.","Jess Schoen - Barclays Capital","[Jess Schoen] for Bob today. So, I guess, starting off, when you look at the European business for Tommy, in this very sort of strong comp trend quarter to date and last quarter also? What do you think drove that lift in that comp acceleration throughout the quarter?","Manny Chirico","Well, I think, I guess, what I would say is, compared to this time last year we\u2019re in significantly better inventory position. Last year we were chasing business constant throughout the year. There was very little spring\/summer to clear it all last year. So we had more spring\/summer goods as we positioned ourselves based on the strong sales trends that have being going on in Europe for the last 15 to 18 months. So we\u2019ve really bought into that sales plan. So we take advantage of that. And we\u2019ve also seen just very strong initial sellings of fall product as we\u2019ve come out of the gate. So we are really seeing come together.","Like everything else product is key. I think from all indications from the market, the fall product assortment has been very well received, consumers are really reacting strongly to it and we are seeing strong sell-throughs both at department store accounts and their own retail stores. So, I think, clearly, it\u2019s the product that\u2019s driving the business.","Jess Schoen - Barclays Capital","Okay. Great. And then in terms of the China business and the China JV, what have you seen over there in terms of performance and the brand positioning specifically and then, are there any sort of updated plans around taking direct control of that business?","Manny Chirico","Well, I think, we are few years away from that. Clearly, China is a big opportunity for Tommy. Sales this year will be somewhere in the neighbor to $75 million, which is well ahead where we projected it to be.","We are seeing strong double-digit sales growth there, continued improvement and profitability there, and we are running well ahead of our projection there, but we are still very early and any thoughts of bringing it in-house at this point are pre-mature and I think we are still looking at somewhere between two to four years from that, as that business matures and develops.","Jess Schoen - Barclays Capital","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Thank you. Manny, just wanted to touch a little bit on Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Clearly, the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition has created significant value for your shareholders. I was wondering if you could kind of walk us through what you guys did right and maybe somethings you did wrong in terms of how you manage that acquisition and the transition, which is obviously reflecting the results you are seeing?","And secondly, can you sustain this double-digit growth in Tommy going forward and can you get Calvin Klein back to double-digit growth. I\u2019m not asking you to pre-view your Investor Day, but if you can kind of give us some outlines here that would be helpful?","Manny Chirico","Okay. Dave, I\u2019ll try to put a little bit of color on. From the acquisition point of view, I think is the best thing we did is we allowed the Tommy management teams in Europe and North America to really operate their businesses and run their businesses.","We saw the growth potential of the Tommy business and we saw the operating platform that existed, and we\u2019re able to really get behind it and invest in the marketing of the brand which was under invested in the, I think, under its ownership, under with private equity ownership.","So clearly, we\u2019ve added about 100 to 120 basis points of additional marketing which we think is really helped us gain more market share, increase our AURs. And in North America raise the perception of the brand as we continue to get better shelf space at Macy\u2019s shop-- shop exposure at Macy\u2019s and lift the marketing of the overall -- perception of the overall brand.","What you\u2019ve done, so you know, on net -- on the flip side of that, look, there\u2019s always things you can do better, but I think, on balance, I\u2019m really happy the way we\u2019ve come together, the way we\u2019ve integrated the back office. So if we could execute at this level all of our acquisitions in future, I\u2019d be very happy with that kind of performance.","Look, I think, the Calvin business is really hitting on just about every cylinder and the key for us is really to get the Calvin jeans business back on track, both in North America and in Europe in particular.","To get back to double-digit growth, when you have that bigger business that\u2019s been under such pressure and I think, Warnaco has talked about all of their initiatives. Clearly, I think the topline growth will come, but I think, it\u2019s really a second half of next issue with some of the great design talent that they brought in.","The investments they are making in their infrastructure and merchandising, but given pipelines and replenishment, and I\u2019m sure they are making some changes for spring of this year and get some positive reads on some business. But really I think the benefits will really start to see beginning next year.","So we continue to be, we look at our business model, we look at how we would continue to see the three businesses moving forward. We notice no reason that we feel that we would be able to continue to grow, grow something in the range on long-term basis next three to four years at a 15% compounded annual growth rate our earnings per share, so no reason to back off for that now and more to come at our Analyst Day in October in Europe.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you, Manny. Congratulations on another great quarter. I\u2019m just wondering, you touch the customer at a lot of different distribution points across retail, wholesale, outlet, a lot of geographies and also demographic? I\u2019m just wondering, perhaps give us your assessment of what you are seeing in terms of consumer spending, appetite for this back-to-school season and as you think about the holiday season?","Manny Chirico","Well, look, again, my crystal ball is a little foggy, but I think overall, the North America, I feel pretty confident about trends right now, not just from our business, but I think the back-to-school season from everyday, I could see with our major retail partners who are off to a strong start.","I can\u2019t speak for any one else but clearly our biggest accounts continue to perform. The one area that\u2019s under pressure I talked about is the J. C. Penney business. And I\u2019m there going through a major transformation repositioning and we\u2019ll start to see how the new shops there begin to perform and hopefully we\u2019ll benefit their business as they go forward.","That\u2019s clearly just a business in transition. Absent that, the department store channel is very healthy that I can see. The outlet channel, I notice been some talk, maybe brand specific or couple of specific points but we\u2019ve really not seen any real blip in output at all. It just continue to perform and as we timed into August and back-to-school selling season, as I said, just continued to intensify and the kind of trends we\u2019re seeing are very positive.","Moving to Europe, we continue to see more of the same. North and Central Europe consumer continue to react, the Tommy business continuing to perform. Southern Europe, tremendous amount of pressure, cautiousness about selling into accounts, particularly in Italy, real concerned about how we take the exposure there from a credit point of view.","In Spain also, the El Corte Ingles business, very healthy retails that has historically performed but that business given the economy is under pressure. So those two markets are clearly pulling down the overall market in Europe. Asia, China, India continues very strong.","Latin America, Brazil are just, besides the currency headwinds, we haven\u2019t seen any real pressure there on a local currency basis with the business. So that\u2019s an overall assessment that\u2019s going on.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs","Great. And then just two other questions, you\u2019re very helpful last year when we talked about rising commodity cost and you are incredibly pressing and talking about how retailers have pulled back on unit. Now, as we\u2019re seeing those commodity cost for a loss and you\u2019re seeing some benefits in terms of margin obviously, you\u2019ve provided in the back half. How do you see people flowing through the opportunity on commodity cost? Would you expect much more aggressive investment in price or should we see healthier margins across the board?","Manny Chirico","I think is -- I think we\u2019ll see pressure on price. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll see back-to-school which may see as holiday more so. It\u2019s going to be more like the opening price point on the main floor. I think the collection brands clearly are able -- there is no reason that there should be a movement in price. We haven\u2019t seen any pressure there to move price in the Calvin\/Tommy business and some of our competitors haven\u2019t moved price at all. So I don\u2019t see it there.","But I think when you get into some of the opening price point businesses, I think there you might see some price pressure there more so. Inventories -- right now, inventories are in a terrific shape. It really helped that it would come out of spring summers so clean. So we\u2019re getting an early read on poor selling which has been very positive. I think we\u2019ve done -- I give the merchandising teams in all of our businesses high marks for transitioning summer to fall with appropriate product wear now but fall appropriate. So I think we\u2019re really benefiting from all of that in our product mix and see how it goes forward.","So I think price pressure will be on the opening price point brands and that\u2019s the area where you could see some pull back 2% to 3% in AUR.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs","Great. And then lastly, just on the guidance, obviously you\u2019re going to beat by $0.05, you raise your guidance by $0.07 speaks to your excitement, enthusiasm in the back half and since the beginning of the year, you\u2019ve always talked about the back half being better than the first half.","So I\u2019m wondering in light of the fact that it sounds like you\u2019ve taken lot of the risk out assuming slowing in Europe that you\u2019re not really seeing and CK at contractual minimum. So I\u2019m just wondering if and fact trends maintain the outperformance we\u2019ve seen, should we see a better flow through to the bottom line in the back half versus what we saw in the first half?","Manny Chirico","I don\u2019t know if it will be better. I mean, the first half was pretty strong, just a reminder, we started this year out, we\u2019re talking about flat first half of the year. And I think if you add first and second quarter, we\u2019re up -- I\u2019m doing math in my head right now about 12%, 13%. So I think is we\u2019ve really outperformed and put that through on the bottom line.","I think you could potentially see similar type of performance if the business trends continue because of the same time that we are increasing our bottom line. We\u2019ll probably be also increasing our marketing spend as we go forward appropriate with the sales increases that we\u2019ll be coming through. So I think hopefully it\u2019s just more of the same that continues.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs","Great. Best of luck.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Christian Buss with Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Credit Suisse","Thank you. Congratulations on the nice quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your inventory planning and your ability, the chases we had into the back half of the year. How are you thinking about the overall level of inventories that you want to see at retail?","Manny Chirico","I think the risk reward on Calvin inventory right now is more risk than reward. And I think if you look at the way the second half comes together, given the course decline that are in the product offering particularly for holiday. It\u2019s much more important than inventories are controlled and we maximize every potential sales opportunity.","So the gross margin benefits for us and our retail partners are so significant. I think in the third and fourth quarters, we\u2019ll all be better off managing inventories. So we\u2019ll chase, we\u2019re chasing though. We\u2019re able to chase very easily in replenishment businesses both dress shirts and neckwear given our back up stocks and our raw material positioning. Obviously in sportswear and in fashion, we can but we\u2019ve always been able to advance deliveries 30 to 45 days, catch some transits that go and drop that to the bottom line.","So I think, similar to what\u2019s happened in the first half of this year and all of the last two years, I think we\u2019ll able to capture portion of it. But I think the risk-reward function is against you this year to really get too far ahead of it.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Kate McShane with Citi Investment Research.","Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research","Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if you had any detail or further detail on Europe and can discuss how much of your wholesale business is to major customers versus specialty customers and how that might change going forward?","Manny Chirico","I think 25% to 30% is what I would call major customers. So the top 20 accounts in Europe represent, probably 25% of the business wherein North America, the top 20 accounts represents about 99% of the business, so just to put in perspective. So by its nature, Europe is a very decentralized business. There is no pan-European retailer anywhere.","It usually goes country by country and then a number of major countries are really driven by more of a specialty store than a department store business like Italy and especially when you move into the Middle East and Turkey, it\u2019s more of a retail model. So the long answer is I think it\u2019s about 25% to 30% is what we would classify as major account and 75% of the business is done with specialty store accounts.","Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research","Okay. And then with regards to the specialty store counts, obviously, the outlook and the backlog that you have stated today is very strong. Are you seeing any credit restrictions on some of the maybe the smaller specialty accounts that could be a longer term threat.","Manny Chirico","I think Mike will talk about that?","Mike Shaffer","Kate, we do -- we have a credit monitoring procedure in Europe, just internationally just as we do in the U.S. We also do ensure a good portion of our receivables in Europe. So right now, we\u2019re on top of it and we delivering up to credit limits that we\u2019ve approved internally and that we feel adequately covered by insurance. So we feel very comfortable.","Manny Chirico","But yeah -- but I would say, Kate, is just to amplify what Mike said, if we wanted to chase business, we could book another 2% or 3% but we\u2019ve definitely made the judgment is that the risk reward is not there particularly in Southern Europe where in lot of cases, it is much more specialty store driven.","We made judgments based on long-term relationships with key customers to go above credit limits that are there with the insurance but clearly all right on annual basis have been minimal. So we think we\u2019ve got very strong controls in place but it has dampened some of the growth potential that two years ago we would have been having no problem, selling some of these key accounts. We really backed off on some of the sales there.","Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, my only other question again the back-to-school commentary has been very positive but you have any incremental color on the Tommy Hilfiger children\u2019s introduction for fall?","Manny Chirico","Well, I guess is -- I would say the Tommy business has been there in kids for a long time both at Macy\u2019s and our own stores. So it\u2019s really I wouldn\u2019t classify as introduction. We have a strong business that continues to grow. We\u2019re seeing significantly strong business at Macy\u2019s that they\u2019ve intensified the Tommy presentation on the boy\u2019s side and we\u2019re talking about future grow in the girls business there as well.","In our own stores, kids have been a key driver of some of our growth and is comping for last three months, well over double-digit growth pattern in the stores. So kids continues to be a great performer. We thinks it a great time of the year to be well positioned in kids and is an advantage for Tommy in those stores to drive the mom in, who buys for the kids and then we hopefully will convert her to customer as well.","Kate McShane - Citi Investment Research","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Thanks. Good morning. Great job, guys.","Manny Chirico","Thanks.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks Omar.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Wanted to ask about some of your prepared remarks, Manny, on the Heritage business. You sounded very confident about the inflection point coming. I know it sounds like its more on the margin side and our inventories are clean but our situation is getting a little bit easier. How are you thinking about that business from a revenue growth standpoint? Are we nearing a point where you could see a reacceleration of business? How do you think about the consumer with the Heritage brands or is that consumer still a pretty tough player?","Manny Chirico","I think that the story there is -- I think as we get through the third quarter into the fourth quarter and we have behind us more or less the IZOD and Timberland businesses that we\u2019re anniversarying. I think you\u2019ll start to see sales increases there based on some of the new initiatives with some of the key programs we have in place.","But I think overall when you think about that business, I think 2013 and beyond, I think it\u2019s still going to be single digit, low-single digit, 2% to 4%, kind of, growth business. But ahead of us, I think right now, we\u2019re projecting annual 2013 -- 2012 operating margins in the Heritage business to be up slightly from last year but -- and then last year, it was about a little bit over 7% margins.","Historically, that business has operated at 10% margin. We really think over the next 18 to 24 months. We bring that business back to something close to 10% and if that would happen, when you consider it $1.8 billion to $2 billion business, that\u2019s a significant recovery of profitability and earnings per share growth in this market.","So that\u2019s what I think you really have to look at that business to perform and I think it\u2019s really going to be -- it\u2019s really going to start to become in the third quarter of this year into all of \u201813 a significant driver of our profitability improvement year-over-year for the next 18 months.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Got you. Thanks. And then on the Tommy business, I mean, the performance in Europe, it\u2019s really amazing. I have been able to manage through this environment. What\u2019s the key -- what is some of the key elements that replicate even a fraction of the performance for that brand in Europe, here in the States. Is it elevating the product quality? Do you have to think about the channels of distribution, I think you\u2019re agreeing with Macy\u2019s and the outlet business but maybe you\u2019re layering in some full priced retail. I know it\u2019s been lot more marketing which is important.","What do you see as the key element, really kind of replicating the way you balance that brand in Europe and what the team had done with the brand Europe here in the states?","Manny Chirico","Look, I think is, when you look at the Tommy business this year, operating margins in North America will be north of 12%. Operating margins internationally overall are about 30%. Europe is probably 100 basis -- 100, 150 basis points higher than that, so somewhere around 14% operating margins in Europe.","I think is the Tommy business in North America has just continued to really show extraordinary growth. So in the first and second quarter of this year, I think the business is up 11% to 12% top line. I think there is -- we have a plan in the second half for mid single digit. I think there is an opportunity to outperform that projection and be more in line with that type of growth.","And I think if that would happen, it clearly would enhance the overall profitability of the business. So I think in fairness, I think like most brands businesses North America given the nature of the business, the department store environment there, North America was always going to be well executed -- even if its well executed against the well executed European business will be 100 to 150 basis points lower than the European model. I think that\u2019s nature of its gross margin profitability and to be honest, some of the margin support, structure that we have in the United States that doesn\u2019t really exist in many European countries.","So that piece I think is one piece. Well, what could be exciting in the United States more is the continued growth, you really have focus on growing our retail footprints in the United States and that\u2019s where our focus really will continue both regular price and in the outlet channel where we\u2019ve seen tremendous growth there.","So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a wholesale story in North America. It will continue to be a retail story. We\u2019re clearly meeting the consumer demand. There\u2019s geographic areas like the south east portion of the United States. We know we\u2019re not fully meeting all of our consumers\u2019 demands there given some of the markets in where we see opportunities and we\u2019re clearly starting to fill that back in, extending our footprints in existing stores where we -- the store is just comping so strongly. We just need more square footage to really continue to grow.","So those investments are being made behind the brand. And I think our continuation as we go forward. So I think when you look at Tommy North America business, I don\u2019t think really has to take second place position against any one so. I think the growth there could continue in the mid to high single digit range for the next 24 months.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Manny Chirico","Hello. I think we lost Evren. Operator?","Operator","Sir, please check your mute button. Your line is open.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Can you hear me now?","Manny Chirico","Yeah.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","All right. So, I wanted to ask about if you have an updated thoughts on the timeline of an acquisition as you\u2019re paying down the debt nicely on the balance sheet and again any thoughts on whether more likely it\u2019s a new brand or an acquisition of a licensee?","Manny Chirico","Well, look -- I think it still depends on what market conditions are. I think clearly, we haven\u2019t been shy about talking that acquisitions will continue to be a part of our growth story. But I think clearly for next 18 months in order to meet our financial targets, we don\u2019t need an acquisition and I think if one doesn\u2019t come, it doesn\u2019t come. We\u2019ve got a lot of Calvin and Tommy initiatives going on with take back of licenses in Europe on with Calvin Klein, our furnishings and suit business in Europe, some of our license business by geographic areas that we\u2019re investing and joint venture relationship in.","So I think we\u2019ll talk about more of those things in the future as we go forward. So I think it will be a combination of both. It will be terrific to get a new brand. And a real focus of us from an acquisition point of view. It\u2019s been a focus on the new brand. Given the operating platform, we have in Europe that could really take advantage of potentially taking a brand and expanding it in that market.","I think so looking for a brand that would both work in North America and Europe and to do what we\u2019ve done with Calvin and Tommy again would be very exciting for us.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Thanks. And then on Tommy, some of the comp growth has been driven by price. When do you begin to lap some of the price increases and the benefit from the average unit retail and at that point, how are you planning the business and the inventory? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Okay. We\u2019re planning in Tommy and in Calvin since last year\u2019s second half. We saw significant AUR increase last year second half, this year\u2019s first half. We\u2019re really planning AURs to grow less significantly in the second half of this year into next year and our retail price points are actually flat to slightly up in Tommy and in Calvin.","We believe we can raise AURs because we\u2019re selling good so much quicker that we\u2019re getting more regular price good at regular price in first mark down that the average unit retail buy out the door will actually increase. But our price points, our ticket prices, really we\u2019re not planning much increases in North America at all and slightly in Europe some AUR increase based on ticket price.","So that\u2019s how it\u2019s planned. I think units will be in line with sales increases and not skewed one way or another because of retail price points at the department stores here in North America or in Europe. So I think there is less chance for confusion about how units are being planned versus sales plans. And I think that\u2019s much more inline than it was say 12 to 18 months ago.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","And lastly, do you have any thoughts or any contingency plans on this potential East Coast port strike? To what percent of your goods, I don\u2019t know, comes from the East Coast port?","Manny Chirico","I\u2019m going to turn that over to Mike to talk about. He is on top of all of our logistics.","Mike Shaffer","We are monitoring this -- we\u2019re monitoring what\u2019s going on with this strike. We do have contingency plans. We do have ports on the -- we have different ports of entry and different warehouses we can utilize if there is a strike. So, we are absolutely looking and monitoring closely.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Kernan with Cowen & Company.","John Kernan - Cowen & Company","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk about some of the things you are going to be doing next year particularly with Tommy Hilfiger European men\u2019s tailored apparel, the CK Calvin Klein European apparel on the accessories business that you are going to bring in-house. Can you quantify what those businesses may do next year? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Well, I guess -- look I will do it this way. I\u2019ll say that the tailored business is about \u20ac50 million business today. To remind everyone, we will lose probably about $5 million -- $4 million to $5 million of royalty income revenue from the tailored business and replace that with a full operating margin business. Next year, we start shipping late fourth quarter of this year into next year.","So we think that will be a nice additive business for us that we can control better in-house and incrementally be more profitable for us as we go forward. The Calvin business is just too early. It\u2019s a total repositioning of where the product was. It\u2019s really -- we\u2019re not going to be using the ck logo. So it\u2019s not going to be ck Calvin Klein, it\u2019s going to be Calvin Klein products and from sportswear point of view, it will be going into the market. So it\u2019s a total repositioning. Sitting now with the retails, a lot of enthusiasm we are going to start with men\u2019s next year and -- fall of next year and then go into women\u2019s in fall of 2014.","As I said, this is a real investment in the brand. We are leaving behind $10 million of royalty income associated with that business that contractual minimums that we have been collecting from Warnaco. So we\u2019re giving that up and we will have start-up course next year that will have to deal with us well.","All of that will be factored into the guidance we give next year but it\u2019s something we have to consider. But when you think about it, if we are going out to buy a $500 million business opportunity in a business that we know very well and we really believe we can execute again.","We will be paying hundreds of millions of dollars for that opportunity. This is the brand that we know we got it back at no cost. We\u2019re taking it in, where we build at the way we think it\u2019s appropriate within operating platform and management team we have -- that we have tremendous confidence in. That\u2019s clearly delivered on the Tommy side that we are setting up a Calvin on with that business than to leverage off of their infrastructure.","So, there is no guarantees in life in anything but this seems like one that is something that we really could deliver against and get to 2014 and beyond and really start to put up some significant sales and operating profits as we go out two to three years.","John Kernan - Cowen & Company","Excellent. That\u2019s very helpful. I guess, the one region where Tommy Hilfiger might not be living up to your expectations right now is Japan. What -- how big is that Japanese business and what are you doing there to kind of turn that around? Thanks.","Mike Shaffer","The business in Japan is about $250 million. It\u2019s a business that historically is operated at 8% to 10% operating margin. It\u2019s about half that today and it\u2019s clearly hurting us on a comparative basis. It\u2019s hurting as a comparative basis last two years. So, we believe it\u2019s at a low point now.","One of the challenges, when you talk about the Tommy brand globally, two markets that have had their challenges from the positioning point of view have been North America. And we\u2019ve talked about the progress we\u2019ve made there, but also Japan. The Japan positioning was not -- we took a license business and brought it in-house about four years ago. It was not positioned the way rest of the international Tommy business is positioned.","And for us to grow our Asian platform of Tommy, so it\u2019s full potential, we recognized early on. We had to reposition the brand in Japan. So, that\u2019s really been the focal point. We\u2019ve opened two flagship stores beginning at this year, made those investments, that\u2019s factored all into the guidance. And we\u2019re really starting to move to consumer in Japan up trying to raise the brand perception in Japan.","And since so many Chinese stores in particular travel to Tokyo. In a lot of ways, Japan is the fashion capital of Asia. It\u2019s really critical with Tommy looks as strong as it needs to look there. So this was a year for us to make investments in Japan to really reposition and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on there.","I think that\u2019s the positioning story. The good news there is I think we are at the profitability level that we are projecting the numbers that is at such a low point that the only way to go from this point is up. And I think over the next two to three years, we can bring this business back to at 8% to 10% operating margin business from now that it\u2019s at a probably 3% to 4% operating margin business, all included in our international business. So hope that helped.","John Kernan - Cowen & Company","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Howard Tubin with RBC Capital Markets.","Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks a lot. Manny, give me your commentary on acquisition, if you -- let\u2019s say you were to find one in the next year, year and half, would you continue to pay down debt, would you consider maybe starting to repurchase stock?","Manny Chirico","I think that\u2019s clearly not an issue for this year because we are committed to pay down about -- as you said about $300 million in debt this year. Probably next year if there was really nothing on the horizon, we\u2019d start to look at a combination of debt pay down and potentially we\u2019re buying back some stock and looking at it from that perspective.","So, I think we will cross that bridge when we will get there. Clearly, our first priority would be to do an acquisition, continue to invest in the Tommy and Calvin businesses and then potentially look at our capital structure and where we are.","By the end of this year, I think our debt-to-EBITDA kind of leverage will be -- about two times. So we\u2019re in a very strong financial position. So again, that combination of paying down debt and buying back stocks is something we start to think about to fiscal 2013 and beyond.","Howard Tubin - RBC Capital Markets","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Joseph Parkhill with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning. So Tommy continues to be really strong in Germany despite being your largest region, I was hoping maybe you could give us little more details on what\u2019s driving the growth there, and how long you think you can have healthy growth within the region. You are frequently good at sizing opportunities. I thought if you could put some context around that, that would be helpful? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Sure. For the German market, the Tommy brands one is very strong there. We are well-positioned in all key accounts. Retail continues to be a significant driver of growth there. We are -- if you were to -- just as a benchmark, if you will look at Hugo Boss tailored business, it\u2019s probably 10 times our size.","We don\u2019t believe -- given the dynamics of the two brands. We don\u2019t believe we will be as large as Hugo Boss overtime. But we think we should be 50% of their size in tailored and dress furnishing.","So, clearly, that\u2019s a huge opportunity for us and when we look at the Germany and surrounding markets all in, we really continue to think we could over the next five years continue to double the size of that German surrounding markets and dramatic countries there.","Probably more focused on the retail expansion than just wholesale, and continue to look at the potential store performance there and by far our most profitable current country in Europe is Germany.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just quickly as far as the acceleration in retail in Europe. Did you see that both broad based between outlets and full price?","Manny Chirico","Look, both are comping positively. But the outlet store environment is stronger than the full price environment. Just given the economic condition where the consumer is really continues as everywhere looking from value. So there could be a 500 basis points difference between the two or more, but both continuing to comp positively as we go forward.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. Thanks. Good luck.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Diana Katz with Lazard Capital Markets.","Diana Katz - Lazard Capital Markets","Hi. Congratulations on another great quarter. Manny, you commented you haven\u2019t seen any blip in the North American outlet business. But I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the business? Perhaps you can talk about the components of the domestic comp, its sounds like AURs is driving it, but maybe you could talk about traffic and conversion there in the channel and what you\u2019re seeing in August?","And then if you could also, sorry, talk about the tourist customer and then finally, with Calvin as you look?","Manny Chirico","Well, let me answer the question, we seem to have lost. The first part of question, the component, I guess, traffic for us in general in second quarter was up 1% to 2%. So really was AUR and conversion is really will drove business overall. Traffic patterns have actually improved in August and we\u2019re seeing traffic up slightly higher than that.","And I think part of that might be what you alluded to was the international consumer. I think the combination of the Olympics, the Soccer Championships and whatever. I think, there was some softness during that period of time from an international point of view, particularly European consumer in the United States.","But, clearly, that\u2019s back -- it\u2019s bounced back dramatically in August -- in the second half of August in particular. So all of that put into your mix master, the outlet channel is very robust, traffic patterns up 1% to 2%, conversion in AUR really driving. I think operator we will take one more call it\u2019s after 10 o\u2019clock.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan.","Manny Chirico","Hello?","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan","Yeah. Yeah. Given your early comments, it seems like you\u2019re seeing an improving level of underlying strength in women\u2019s apparel. What do you think driving the change and can you speak to some initiatives to -- for us to follow in the fall?","Manny Chirico","Well, it\u2019s a good callout, though, I think, if you think about both of our lead brands Calvin and Tommy. The women\u2019s business is always one that we\u2019ve looked at that we felt should be bigger and have bigger opportunities. If you look at the women\u2019s potential in the market, the women\u2019s business is much bigger than the men\u2019s business.","And when you look at all breakout in business, a Calvin, its 45% women, 55% men and a Tommy, it\u2019s probably 40%, 60% men\u2019s to women\u2019s, some both having bigger men\u2019s components.","So we\u2019ve always view that the women\u2019s component had big opportunities for us. We\u2019re starting to really see that click in a significant way. Both brands I think have strong following with women and I think both are, I think if we falling down anywhere brand level, our execution has just been stronger on men\u2019s product than it has been on the women side of it.","I think some of the initiatives both with our licensing partners on Calvin and internally with our Tommy product both in North America and Europe being -- we believe is significantly been improved and the positioning there is significant improved. The women\u2019s component on the apparel side is clearly been driven.","Calvin, the accessories business on women has just been outstanding, handbags, footwear even women -- even when you look at some of the other women\u2019s categories, as I said dresses and suits, just off to start strong, the performance component, G3 is just executing at a very high level, so those categories are really being fulling growth.","I think when you look at the brand there and when we look at the growth we think that two-thirds of the growth in the future should come from women\u2019s versus one-third from men\u2019s. Even though the business is more balance the other way. And that just because the opportunity exist for those businesses just outperform and I think its going to be a continual story that you\u2019ll hear over the next three years.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan","That\u2019s great. And then last question on the promotional front. You think what you\u2019ve seen during back-to-school as a gauge particularly at wholesale. How are you thinking about holiday from a margin perspective?","Manny Chirico","I really think, well, look, I think, when I -- when we look at the promotions -- what\u2019s going out promotionally right now, it doesn\u2019t feel heavy at all. In fact, I -- again, there will be some study that will show, I mean, I\u2019m wrong, but based on intuitively. I don\u2019t have thought backs to support this, but based on what I have seen, what we are feeling, we just don\u2019t feel that the promotional agenda as significant as it was time last year or if you go back.","I think the key there or but when you cut through it all as we get into October and beyond, is going to inventory position. If you watch the inventories, the inventories are under control. If we get any kind of break on weather compared to last year. I mean, we -- everybody suffered through, probably one of the warmest winters on record and it really hurt late third quarter into fourth quarter sales performance.","If we get any kind of break there on just the normal pattern to winter weather, I think it could bode very well for fourth quarter and holiday selling. So, again, a lot to do, but I think, inventories is going to be the critical focal point there and if they are under control, the gross margin should really just flow to the bottom line.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan","That\u2019s great. Thanks guys.","Manny Chirico","Okay. With that, we thank you all for your attention. We thank you for your time and we look forward to updating you on our next call, which will be our third quarter sometime in November. Have a great day and speak to you soon.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead.","Manny Chirico","Thank you, Ashley. Good morning. Joining me on the call this morning is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relationship; and Ken Duane, our CEO for PVH Heritage brands.","I'm very pleased with the report in the first quarter that we posted a real strong start to the year. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations with broad-based strength across all our businesses globally. Our EPS increased 43% to $2.36 which was $0.11 above our previous guidance. Our revenues grew 16% which was also above our plans and reflected momentum across all of our businesses globally. There are few highlights that I'd like to share with you before going into our brand specific performance.","First, our international businesses continue to experience great momentum and we are enthusiastic about the growth ahead of us in our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. Additionally, our increasing use of global and regional ambassadors and influencers are -- is allowing us to reach new consumers and build our share of ways globally resulting in global market share gains. I'm also pleased to report that our North America businesses performed very well during the first quarter, both at wholesale and retail. We saw growth in our international tourist business in the United States, and saw a healthy demand from our domestic consumer during the first quarter resulting in strong sell-through's across all of our North America businesses. Broad-based strength was also seen across all distribution channels; wholesale, retail and digital. And digital remained our fastest growing channel with revenues growing over 20% across our third-party, and owned and operated sites.","We raised our earnings guidance by $0.05 for the year, this is despite the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. Dollar and its significant impact on foreign currency translation which negatively impacted our earnings forecast for the year. We more than offset this negative hit by significantly raising our underlying business forecast for the second quarter only based on the momentum we are seeing in the business. Our new earnings per share guidance range implies earnings per share growth year-over-year of 14% to 15% and we continue to conservatively forecast our second half sales and earnings trends versus the current business trends we're seeing in the business. Mike will fully quantify these amounts in his comments.","Now moving onto the brand results; I'll begin with Tommy Hilfiger. Our Tommy Hilfiger business posted robust results and notably beat our first quarter plan across all regions. We attribute the strength to our consumer centric focus which has shaped the way we engage with our consumers, develop our marketing plans and connect with consumer's in-store and online. As a reminder, we announced a few new exciting partnerships for spring. Tommy announced a multi-year strategic partnership with Formula One World Champions, Mercedes AMZ, Petronas Motor Sports, and Tommy Hilfiger is now the official sponsor partner of Mercedes. Building on the sports sponsorship heritage that Tommy has embraced since it's founding as a brand. We also announced that Formula One World Champion, Lewis Hamilton, is now the Tommy Hilfiger global men's ambassador.","As we continue to focus on our women's business, we just announced that model, Hailey Baldwin and model and activist, Winnie Harlow are the new global brand ambassadors for Tommy Hilfiger Women's for the fall 2018 season. Following our successful multi-season relationship with Gigi Hadid; they will appear as the face of it's fall 2018 Tommy Icon's capsule collections for women.","Moving to the business, Tommy's revenue increased 21% in the quarter with earnings up 37%, driven by the strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion that we've seen across all businesses. Internationally, revenues increased 25% in the first quarter, and retail comp store sales rose 9% with continued strength in Europe and Asia. Tommy Europe had another stellar quarter of outperformance, we continue to be quite pleased with the brand health and positioning of the Tommy Hilfiger brand in Europe which is allowing us to connect with new consumers and enabling us to gain more market share. Our wholesale business continues to experience strong sell-through's and overall stellar results. As we look further into 2018, as we've previously announced, our fall holiday 2018 order book is up over 10% and our retail business comps were extremely healthy across all major markets in Europe with strong sell-through's at retail and lower year-over-year promotions.","Tommy Asia also continues to perform very well and we see great strength in our Tommy Hilfiger Japan business, particularly at retail and in digital ecommerce. Following our efforts to successful reposition the brand, we are seeing strong results across Japan. Additionally, Tommy China continues to see a strong trajectory of growth as we continue to buildout our operations and invest in the business, including leveraging our local brand ambassador, Shawn Ye [ph].","Moving to North America; our overall revenues were up 10% in North America. As we move through the quarter, we saw great performance in our retail business where comps rose 9%, due in part to improving international tourist traffic, as well as healthy sales from our domestic shopper. We saw strength across all categories which we attribute to our assortments and the impact of our consumer engagement activities. And we continue to see strong sell-through's on the wholesale side of the business with a very strong Macy's business in the first quarter across all major products categories. On the licenses side, we continue to be extremely happy with the performance of our women's [indiscernible] business under G3 which is experiencing strong growth and excellent sell-through's and higher average unit retails. The brand continues to gain market share in North America across all channels.","Moving to Calvin Klein, the momentum around the CK brand has intensified with it's cultural relevancy resignating and consumer interest in our evolving campaigns and engagement efforts to connect with a younger and wider audience. From Kardashian genners to ASAP Rocky, Paris Jackson, Miley, Bobby Brown and other influences including our local brand ambassadors in key markets, our voice continues to be heard and our hash tag MyCalvin's continues to perform well. From a business perspective, revenues increased 18% for the first quarter, reflecting strong brand global trends with the 25% increase coming from our international business in the first quarter. Total earnings were up 16% during the quarter. We continue to see strong top line growth out of Europe and China with North America experience improving trends across all channels. North America comps were up 5% in the first quarter, and our international comp store sales increased 9% in the quarter.","On a regional basis in Asia, Calvin Klein continues to perform well with improving trends across the region, as well as the benefit of Chinese New Year in the first quarter. This trend builds upon the approved strength we saw in our Central and South Asia markets, as well as our China business. China which represents over half of the business continues to outperform our other markets across all product categories. The Korea business posted another quarter of stabilization which we are pleased with given the geopolitical and economic issues that have impacted that region for some time now. Overall, this broad-based strength gives us confidence in the long-term trajectory of this business in the Asia market.","Calvin Klein Europe continues to build upon the momentum delivered in 2017. As we previously mentioned, our fall 2018 order book is projected to be up again over 25%. Main year-to-date, we are pleased with the strength across the business. As we continue to see healthy sell-through's at retail. Moving to North America, revenues were up 10% in North America. Calvin Klein North America had a strong quarter overall with outperformance at both wholesale and retail and our owned and operated retail business, we are pleased to see the continued progression in our comp trajectory and so our international tours, shopping off stores and nice performance at a ball [ph] categories.","At wholesale, we were pleased with the performance across our businesses including underwear, sportswear and our men's jeans business. Average unit retail rose across most of the key categories of Calvin Klein. Additionally, digital was the healthiest channel, both with our department store customers and the pureplay digital retailers. Looking ahead, we are excited about the upcoming brand initiatives for Calvin Klein including our denim relaunch for the fall season.","Finally, in our heritage business revenues for the quarter rose 5%, well above our plan and included a positive impact from a wholesale timing shift as a result of certain shipments falling in the first quarter versus the second quarter as previously planned. In general, we saw a nice performance across our wholesale business with continued share gains and our retail business posted a 1% comp store sale increase. We are pleased with the performance of this business with earnings up over 30% over the prior year, particularly given some of the challenges that the U.S. department store landscape has faced and felt including the Bon-Ton bankruptcy. Lastly, in an effort to further adapt this business to the changing consumer landscape, we are excited to launch our Heritage digital ecommerce site this summer which will offer customers the option of buying our heritage on one site.","Looking to our outlook for the second quarter, overall, we're very pleased with the first quarter performance and I'm proud of the progress that our teams are executing against our strategic plan in the face of the changing dynamics in the industry. Looking at the second quarter to-date trends, we were off to a strong start in the quarter. From a regional basis perspective, our international businesses continue to see great momentum with quarter-to-date comps at Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein up high single-digits. In North America, we continue to see healthy trends despite the unseasonably cool spring weather in May with our own North America comps up low single-digits with very healthy margins as we are significantly less promotional than compared to last year.","In our wholesale businesses, we are seeing very strong sell-through's across all of our North America customers. We believe that the incredible brand power behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger continues to position us well in the marketplace against our competition and will drive continued momentum for the full year.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to quantify some of our results.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks, Manny. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. In addition, due to the 53rd week in 2017, comp store sales for 2018 are more appropriately compared on a one week shifted basis. Comp store sales discussed with the first quarter are compared with the 13 weeks ended May 7, 2017 instead of the 13 weeks ended April 30, 2017 which was the end of the prior year's first quarter.","Our reported revenues for the first quarter were up 16%, which exceeded our guidance and was inclusive of a 6% benefit from FX. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were very strong, up 21% inclusive of the 10% benefit from FX. The Tommy Hilfiger revenue increase was driven by strong performance in all regions and channels. Both our Tommy Hilfiger International and North American comps were up 9%, our Calvin Klein revenues were up 18% inclusive of the 6% benefit from FX in the quarter. Calvin Klein international revenues increased 25% inclusive of an 11% benefit from FX driven by outstanding Europe and Asia performance. Our international comp store sales were up 9%. Calvin Klein North America revenues increased 10%, strong wholesale performance across all categories and retail comps of 5% drove the increase.","Heritage revenues were up 5% to the prior year as a result of the timing of shipments which moved from quarter two to quarter one, our Heritage retail business comp store sales were up 1%.","Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.36 was 43% higher than the previous year and $0.11 better than the top-end of our previous guidance. The EPS beat versus the previous guidance was driven by strong business across all of our brands and regions. Interest expense was favorable by $0.01 but offset by an unfavorable tax expense due to timing for $0.01. We ended the quarter with inventories of 22% versus the prior year due to a shift in the timing of inventory receipts as a result of the 53rd week in 2017 and our projected sales increase for the second quarter. We've also made a decision to invest -- continue to invest in our basic and core products and to hopefully continue to capitalize on opportunities that we see for the balance of the year.","For the full year 2018 we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be $9.05 to $9.15, 14% to 15% growth over the prior year, and a $0.05 increase compared to our previous guidance despite a significantly reduced foreign currency benefit for the full year. Now included in our earnings per share guidance is the reduced positive impact of foreign currency translation of $0.12 which is a $0.23 benefit reduction compared to our previous guidance of $0.35. Our new guidance when compared to our prior guidance reflects $0.28 of business improvement offset in part by $0.23 of unfavorable currency.","Overall, we are projecting revenues to grow approximately 6% including the positive impact of 1% related to foreign currency. Our updated revenue guidance includes a 1% increase related to underlying stronger business in local currency offset by a 2% reduction related to foreign currency translation. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 30 basis points for the Company. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increase 7% inclusive of the positive impact to 1% related to foreign currency. Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned to increase about 70 basis points.","We project Calvin Klein revenues to grow 8% including the positive impact of 1% of foreign currency. We are also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to be down about 20 basis points due to our highest operating margin business licensing which will be down as a result of the impact of the Bon-Ton bankruptcy. Inspite of the headwind created by the Bon-Ton bankruptcy filing, in our licensing business we are still planning Calvin Klein earnings growth to be in the high-single digits. Our Heritage business is planned to have relatively flat revenues and flat operating margins, and is negatively impacted as well by the Bon-Ton bankruptcy.","Interest expense for the year is planned to be about $120 million compared to the prior year at $122 million. This decrease is the result of a lower interest \u20ac600 million bonds issued in December of 2017, partially offset by higher interest rates on some of our variable debt. In 2018, we are planning to pay down at least $250 million of our debt, stock repurchases in 2018 are planned to be between $200 million and $250 million. Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 14% to 15%. As IRS regulations are expected to be issued later in 2018, related to the recent tax reform act of current estimates could be subject to change if the regulations differ from our current interpretation.","Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned to $2.05 to $2.10 and includes approximately $0.03 of estimated positive impact for foreign currency translation. Revenue in the second quarter is projected to increase 10% including the positive impact of 1% related to foreign exchange. Tommy Hilfiger revenues have planned a 13% increase including the positive impact of 1% on foreign currency. Calvin Klein revenues are planned at 15% increase including the positive impact of 1% related to foreign currency. And Heritage brands are projected down 4% as shipments move from quarter one -- into quarter one from quarter two.","Interest expense is projected to be about $30 million and taxes to be in 19% to 20% in the second quarter. And with that operator, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will start with our first question from Erin Murphy from Piper Jaffray.","Erin Murphy","I guess my first question was just on the Tommy Hilfiger brand; what was unprecedented your fastest growing brand in Europe. So we'd love to hear a little bit more about how you're thinking about the sustainability of this growth? And then perhaps relatedly, if you could just speak to your current appetite of bringing in some of the indirectly operated regions for these brands? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","I think on the first part, the momentum seems to be really strong for the brand as we look at the second half. We've continued to -- given the strength that we've seen in that business, we've continued to project conservatively but given the trends in the business it would seem like this potential in the second half is significantly more upside, both in Europe and in Asia, as well as the momentum we're seeing here in North America given the comp store performance that's been high single-digits and much higher operating margin. So that strength just continues, we don't see that really a baiting as we move into the second half of the year or beyond. In addition, the possibility for bringing in other licensed business, I think the one that makes the most sense to us is our Central Southeast Asia business which includes Hong Kong, Macau; you know, what might be described as Greater China and then beyond that.","So from that perspective, that's a healthy business that I think given licensing terms in where we are within next 12 months is something we'd like to see brought into the business. The other area we'd like to see brought into the business from a regional perspective is Brazil. There we have a longer term license but I've constantly discussed the opportunity with our joint venture partner there. So that's an opportunity we look at given the strength of the Calvin brand in that region, even though the region there is under pressure, we think as you look out 6 to 18 months, that region I think will start to see some -- hopefully, some positive growth.","Erin Murphy","And then just on Calvin, would love if you could speak to more about the performance of the newer categories in Europe like men's sportswear? And then how should we think about the rollout further categories for this brand across Europe over the next 12 to 24 months?","Manny Chirico","In Europe, the brand continues to be from our volume point of view really focused on jeans, underwear and to some degree, accessories; and seeing very strong growth in those categories. Men's sportswear is still a relatively small business growing at a significantly higher percentage but on a relatively small business it really gives us opportunity for growth there. The big opportunity obviously is the whole women's category, both sportswear, the performance area, both the men's and women's as we look out and growing that accessory component of the business to a greater extent including footwear as we look at it. So that's really how we see the brand rounding out. If you think about the sides of the Calvin business, I think I always say this is about 40% the size of the Tommy business, that's the -- that would be our goal to more or less double the business today which we think will cross $1 billion this year or close to it.","So that really gives us that ability as we move forward and those are categories that globally have been very successful for us, men's and women's sportswear, our biggest categories for us here in North America, with very healthy footwear and accessory business here in North America, taking those to Europe seemed like clearly, the breadth of both categories are brand appropriate and give us the ability to really enhance the growth as we move out. So that wide space opportunity seems like it's all in front of us.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim.","Bob Drbul","I was wondering on both, in the U.S. and I guess on the international side, can you just talk about what you're seeing from a tourism perspective and how that's impacting your business? And the second question I have is, can you just talk to your decision, just in terms of mark-to-market on the foreign exchange, really how you're approaching it as you think about investments in the business and sort of the ongoing earnings power of the company?","Manny Chirico","On the first part of the question, international tourism; here in North America we've clearly seen a path there. I would say the key regions where we're seeing growth are China, first and foremost, that consumer have both in Calvin and Tommy; and we're seeing the Brazilian consumer come back to the United States in a more meaningful way and that's a big driver of our retail businesses in particular. The European consumer is healthy and we see that happening in our business as well. In Europe, the biggest driver from an international point of view is China, that's where -- that part of the business is very healthy and we see these are doing very well in our European business with the tourism component.","And then even in Asia when you look at the Chinese consumer shopping outside of China is becoming more and more meaningful, clearly, our business in Japan is benefitting from that, we believe as the situation in Korea start to stabilize, we'll really see a pop-up business there and we're really hoping for that to see that in the second half of this fiscal year as the -- hopefully, the relationships there settle down, that could be very meaningful to that business has been under pressure. So I think that answers it.","On the currency side, I'm going to turn it over to Mike as to talk about it.","Mike Shaffer","Look, in terms of investment we look at the long-term, so short-term blips on currency, we just wouldn't pull back or maneuver; we do look at our hedging policies, we operate in ranges there, so if we feel there is a tremendous amount of volatility we may go more towards the high end of our range and if they feel the world is a more stable place, we could be more towards the low end but for the most part, we tend to not place bets and tend to be more consistent in our approach in hedging and like I've said, investments is really about looking at the long-term.","Manny Chirico","Bob, I think it's -- obviously, given the strengthening dollars, buying international assets like taking back licensing businesses internationally or taking back our -- or looking at potential brand acquisitions outside the United States; it becomes -- given the strengthening dollar compared to where it was two or three years ago, it becomes more attractive on that level. So we look at all those things and we try to factor in but we don't try to play the currency game.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go to our next question from Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Grace [ph] on for Matt. Can you just comment on whether do you expect gross margins up 90 basis points for the full year? And if so, or you expect to drive that and then, how do you see the gross margin opportunity as you look forever out beyond this year? Thank you.","Manny Chirico","Mike?","Mike Shaffer","We do see the gross margin opportunity for this year remaining at about 90 basis points. First quarter we were up about 150 basis points, a lot of that was driven by mix but we also had a significant amount as performance as well. The Chinese New Year falling into the first quarter this year moved some of that business to a very high gross margin, high operating margin business, and the currencies, the FXPs, the higher exchanges in the first quarter also played a component on the mix. As we look to the second, third and fourth quarter, we will see gross margin improvement but it will be at a more moderated pace and a lot of that improvement will come from both the Calvin and Tommy opportunities as those businesses just continue to outperform.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Can I just ask about CK; the -- for Calvin, the order books continue to point to big growth rates in the parts of the business that you do comment on that people in RCO [ph] has look different indicators, those have been really strong for some time and as you get stepper and stepper into the multi-year compares here, lapping here on successes there. Can you just comment on the longer term how you think about what we're going to hear about order books as we roll forward through the back half of this year and into next year how much that brand can keep putting up those growth rates in places like Europe with 20% numbers in front of it? How durable are those rates to you, any comment on why?","Manny Chirico","It's a great question, it's like anything else, you become a victim of your own success as you continue to grow, the numbers get bigger. But I think as I really mentioned is, the ability to continue to put up double-digit growth in Europe seems to be right ahead of us given just the mocking opportunity that's available to us as we expand into some of these newer categories. So I think we'd be disappointed if in the foreseeable future, the next 24 months we didn't continue to see high double-digit kind of topline growth in Europe and continue to feel that as we go forward; that seems to be there for us to really capture and grow as we move forward.","Michael Binetti","And then if I could just continue that on the margins; you've commented on the margins being a little lower this year, Bon-Ton seems to be the big call out, the licensing business there which we know is a high flow-through. But excluding that it seemed like you're headed towards a positive margin expansion for CK for the first time in several years and I know there is a lot of moving parts that cause that in the mix for CK but can you help us think a little bit longer term about the margin rates for that business? I know for one thing you're very happy with the marketing program over there and that spending is landing on great revenues obviously, but is there a leverage point?","Manny Chirico","We've made a conscious effort to invest behind the brand and to build from a long-term perspective, the faster relevancy of that brand, particularly with the investments we've made on the design side, rather bringing [indiscernible] into the business, and their teams that they've brought that we think is really going to enhance the long-term growth of the brand and positioning of the brand as a premium label. [Technical Difficulty] We're targeting minimum margin expansion in that business as we move forward coming off a strong second half of last year. But all indicators are that the opportunity is far greater than that this year given the momentum in the brand overall and momentum in the business that we're seeing.","I think clearly that business was the business that was most impacted by the currency strengthening of the US dollar against the foreign currencies in the major areas and that consumer stocks become that and international consumer and tourists comes back to the United States the brand that benefits the most from that is our Tommy Hilfiger brand. Given the strength of the Tommy Hilfiger brand globally.","So, that really puts a lot of opportunity on the page that's not factored into our numbers and our projections. So, getting back to that peak performance of 300 basis points, I think that would require the euro to move closer back to those $1.30 ranges and where you had that such a significant change. But clearly to get back half of that I think is well within our sight as we move forward and that's the way the team is managing it.","I think you've seen in our inventory position, we've been a little bit more aggressive especially on core categories to go after that inventory and have an arm hand in order to fulfill that and try to satisfy that potential opportunity. Our inventory growth has exceeding our sales expectations that we put on paper. But it gives us the opportunity to really drive that business and we feel there is much more opportunity than in this given that equation and where thoughtfully thinking about that to try to capture that opportunity in the second half of the year.","Michael Binetti","Exciting. Just one more follow-up. You've done some big M&A transactions overtime. You've used your balance sheet very effectively. It sounds like your focus right now bringing licenses back in house, you talked about central and Southeast Asia and Brazil. Just wondering how you are thinking about the balance sheet, the M&A environment, the opportunity to bring another powerhouse type brand into the portfolio of maybe smaller niche brands that we seem to be popping up everywhere?","So just talk about M&A.","Manny Chirico","Sure. So on the first part about bringing licenses back in, it's a lot easier to talk about those because we've been talking about them it's pretty clear given the licensing renewal dates and where things sit, what's ahead of us. So you can talk about those things much more and obviously whatever we might be looking at from an additional brand, be it a global brand or a niche brand. I'm not going to talk about it at all. That's point one.","Point two is the balance sheet has really been very strong. We've just upgraded at the rating agencies to investment grade and really put us in a strong position there from the balance sheet point of view to take advantage of any opportunities that present itself. We love to do it, when it's right. I think we've demonstrated that in the past and we're not going to overpay and we're not going to pay crazy multiples, but we will definitely look to find the right kind of brand that could fit into the portfolio and given the operating platforms we have around the world I think we uniquely qualify to take a brand that has global opportunity and quickly grow it.","So that will be our goal as we move forward.","Michael Binetti","Thanks. Best of luck.","Operator","From Mike Brocho from Fargo. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, everyone this is Nancy [ph] on for Mike. Congratulations on a great quarter. I wanted to just touch on obviously your comps and the performance was outstanding. But can you just talk a little bit about the house of the broader retail market obviously towards these outlets. But can you just talk about your view on that going forward and the health department stores more broadly like after Bon-Ton and everything?","And then just a follow-up on guidance, if you could just touch on the SG&A implications for the rest of the year any planned investments in marketing or otherwise?","Manny Chirico","Sure. I think on the broad retail market I'm not going to speak about specific retails, but I think I would say as every indicating here in North America is that the consumer is very healthy and I don't see everyone's business, I see our business at everyone and couldn't be happier with how we are performing at wholesale here in North America. Calvin, Zami and our heritage brands. The business is just very healthy and what's really nice about the business is inventories in the department store pipeline seems to be lower, very much under control and give the opportunity for a margin expansion for both the department stores and for us as we move forward and that's a real win.","So I really commend the way the industry is really managed their inventory levels and if you walk into a stores, so much cleaner today than it was this time last year all this day starting to set up. You just see a better assortment in merchandise off course the board and that's from Macy's the cold and that we see with our big account.","Mike Shaffer","The marketing point of view I think our plans are pretty clear. We are increased the marketing again for this year. I think as we outperform, we could again increase those budgets, but clearly we'll be looking to increase our earnings by a greater amount but taking that incremental benefits that would come from better business, and investing back into the brands that will be our plan and I think given some of the platforms that we have going forward with our brand ambassadors in Calvin and Tommy and some of the real interesting things we're doing with our heritage brand there is plenty of opportunity for us to make some wise investments going forward. [Technical Difficulty] Wholesale partners and in our own retail stores to bring them assets that really at point of sale in the hot zone where consumer is making decisions to really have an impact at retail with that consumer.","At the same time, I want to make sure that our marketing in-store connects back to what we are doing online outdoor, print, television across the board, and I think the teams have done an amazing job of really making the connection back throughout the marketing cycle, be it in-store or be it in-print or television that whatever we are doing it is seamless and connects back and forth. What we're really trying to do when you cut through at all is bring the consumer into the brand experience, make them part of the brand experience, engage them and what it's really done for us it's opened up a new consumer that's much younger, we're introducing both the Calvin Klein and the Tommy Hilfiger brands to a much younger consumer, engaging with them and transacting with them, both in-store and online. So that's been the focal point and that will continue to be the focal point.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just a follow-up on I guess the wholesale channel, inventory [indiscernible] you spoke about inventories looking good in 2Q. Just curious with trends staring better, comps improving, how is inventory being managed since the back half? Are you expecting to remain lien or could we see -- I guess, inventory start to pick up?","Manny Chirico","Every indicator that I see is that retails continue to be disciplined and are continuing to buy tightly and trying to push more of the burden onto the brands to back up the inventory, particularly in core replenishment and we are doing that where it makes sense for us and for them to try and capture that business. But the best I can tell, you know, again, from everything that I am seeing in the market, talking to our teams is that we opened the dollars have really been strong and we've evolved and us in particular have made significant investments in our product cycle and our speed to market initiatives. So the supply chain has just gotten quicker, we've been able to react much faster, particularly on key core replenishment products that need to get back into quickly, being able to move color faster and be able to react to what's happening with the consumer and doing more testing of styles and colors, ahead of season to really get better insights as we move forward.","So I think there has been a significant benefit that's coming to us from the investments we've made in our supply chain.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tiffany [ph] from Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to circle back to your May commentary where you've talked about some good momentum insurance [ph] quarter-to-date, especially in the international business. Is the low single-digit North America comp that you're seeing so far in line with or different from your initial plan as I compare it to your first quarter performance which was a bit higher but I know comparisons were tougher, I need to talk about targeting low single-digits for the balance of the year. And how would you rank the impacts of cooler weather versus less promotional activity? And additionally, given your statements around promotions and what John asked earlier, would it be accurate to say you might be shifting some focus away from sales growth and towards margin? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","I guess two things I would say is, look, May has been a really funny month here in North America. I mean just look outside the window today it just doesn't feel -- it hasn't really felt like spring and I just feel like that especially, for parts -- as we went into the middle of May, there was a bit of softness in the business which has clearly just turned around. There is significantly less promotions going on in all channels of distribution and with our products, so we are seeing very healthy margin growth. That doesn't mean we're not focused on the top line growth as you could see it from the inventory investments that we're making. But in a two-three week period to just see that time -- to see that kind of weather impact and continuing to meet or exceed our sales plan just gives us great confidence as we go forward.","So it really feels very strong as we're setting up for Father's Day, as the weather starts to get warmer and more seasonal, I think that will just play into our strength as we move forward. So we are very optimistic about the North America retail business and our related wholesale businesses as well. And I don't -- the fact that inventories are tighter and it's creating -- margin is great, and I think that will continue to be a message but I think we're also trying to position ourselves to capture the sales growth that we see in the second quarter and beyond the year given the inventory investments we're making in our core replenishment product. So I think where we feel really enthusiastic about is, I know sequentially that it looks like it dropped off a couple of basis points, couple of 100 basis points from a comp point of view, but I can tell you the margin expansion has just been more than offset that. And I think that was a healthy way to play the whole Memorial Day weekend.","We're going to take one more question as we're approaching 10 o'clock.","Operator","Our last question comes from Omar Saad [ph] from Evercore ISI.","Unidentified Analyst","I wanted to follow-up on the question a little bit earlier, you sounded around social media and digital marketing; it really seemed like you're kind of also toned changed out of your confidence in that marketing strategy, paying dividends. Is there something that's changed in the last couple of quarters giving you that confidence around that digital marketing strategy that you've been deploying for a few years now?","Manny Chirico","No, maybe I wouldn't read too much into the tone of my voice but we are very enthusiastic about -- that we've been enthusiastic, continue to be enthusiastic, I think the results speak for themselves, 16% top line growth. It's happening because there is great product but it's also happening because we're connecting with the consumer and I think from a competitive point of view what I would say is, as I look out to be fair, as a lot of our competitors have had some more challenging times, I've noticed that it seems like the marketing has also pulled back. So I think we're just being gaining a greater share of voice over the last 6 and 9 months as we've gone forward. And the two brands, we're in a cycle right now given the momentum with those two brands, it's bit of a 90s renaissance that's gone on as well, we've been able to really take advantage of that and really drive the business, and I think we'll continue to do that. The confidence you're hearing in my voice has more to do with our performance than just our marketing which I think is part of the performance.","Unidentified Analyst","Maybe, any update on 205 West 39, what's happening with that business and wraps roll in the brand and how you're trying to activate some of those kind of more premium elements globally?","Manny Chirico","Sure. Look, I think we -- it's relatively speaking of small business when you just look at the massive size of the $9 billion# Calvin Klein business but it's so important to the brand and the success that we're seeing with that line at retail and sell into our key retail accounts in getting the kind of positioning in the major doors like Barneys and Neiman's here in North America and if you go overseas, the Harrods and Lane Crawford. To really get that kind of presence and to see that brand positioned so well there I think just creates the halo that we're looking for from that component of the business and it's working exactly as we thought, we couldn't be happier with Raf's contributions to the brand and how it's really benefited not just the 205 business but clearly has benefited what's gone on in our jeans and underwear business in particular, where we've put a real focus on the marketing investment.","And clearly, I think as you go into spring but really into fall 2018, you're going to see that black thread that starts with the 205 collection. You're going to really see that carry through our jeans, sportswear and even our underwear business, you're going to see that really carry through. And I think that just has to be an enhancement for the brand and we'll just -- hopefully, propel us as we move forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Any update on Amazon, the longer you've kind of had that relationship under your belt, what you're learning and maybe how you think about it relative to your other more traditional channels? Thanks.","Manny Chirico","I don't like to speak about one customer, I'll speak about our pureplay and our dotcom, Macy's business, it's -- I think what's really been fascinating is how we've been connecting the business, both in-store and online. How we've been able to really have consistent messages and how we've been able to increase the businesses in both categories but clearly, the percentage growth has been dramatically higher in the online business and our penetration continues to grow there. So I think it's critical because it's very hard to determine where the sale is being generated, it might actually transact in-store but would that be -- so much of that is being driven on the online investigation that the consumer is doing as she explores our brands online, those investments really pay dividends for us in store with our Macy's business which couldn't be healthier, but at the same time I think our online business with pureplay is like Amazon, Alibaba -- continue to grow significantly because we're connecting with that consumer and we're connecting with younger consumer who is more and more comfortable shopping in that channel. So that's really worked exceedingly well for us.","And with that, we're going to close the conference for today. I want to thank everyone for joining us.

Good morning.","Joining me on the call this mooring is Mike Shaffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dana Perlman, our Treasurer and Head of the Investor relationships.","We are pleased to report our first quarter earnings per share, which increased 4% to $2.46 and exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our revenues grew 2% in line with our plans. Our performance particularly against the challenging retail backdrop in the United States and China, truly demonstrated the power of our diversified business model and the ability of our teams to react to emerging business trends. I'd like to highlight a few key themes from the quarter.","First, our European business across both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, continue to experience great brand momentum capturing continued market share gains in a very tough environment. Our investments in digital continue to pay dividends as online again during the quarter was our fastest growing channel with revenues growing over 20% in our owned and operated businesses.","Overall digital sales continue to track at slightly over 10% of our total revenues. We continue to invest in our consumer data journey and with the recent promotion of Marie Gulin-Merle to our newly created Chief Digital Officer position, we are focused on creating and driving unique consumer shopping experiences for our customers, whether online or in-store.","And lastly, we have seen some positive initial signs around the power of the Calvin Klein brand and how connecting incrementally better product and strong marketing translates into positive conversion and sales.","Despite our first quarter performance, the macro retail environment has gotten more challenging, and it remains under pressure and we have entered the second quarter. Notably, the US market was weak, driven by a number of factors from weaker international tourist traffic to the higher tax bills for many US consumers. I would be remiss not to note that while we do not like to call out weather, we certainly have had a cooler wet weather spring this year relative to last year.","Accordingly, we saw a soft traffic and conversion trends across our business, particularly in the outlet retail channel. Tariffs and trade rhetoric and threats weighed on consumers in China and in the US. And we did see a further softness post Chinese New Year in our China business for both brands. While part of this impact is due to the Chinese New Year shift, which benefited fourth quarter 2018 and shifted business out of the first quarter of '19, we certainly saw consumers in China buying less.","As manufacturing shifts out of China, factories are reducing their production or closing facilities, which is impacting not only the middle class, but is also having a spillover effect into the overall economy. Europe continues to see macro pressures including the uncertainty around Brexit but our businesses are significantly outperforming the market and our competition.","Because of the overall macro and geopolitical context, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen. As such, foreign currency translation will further pressure our fiscal year earnings by an incremental $0.10 per share versus our prior fiscal year guidance.","In addition, we've covered approximately $0.05 per share worth of incremental tariffs on existing product categories from the implementation of the 25% tariffs in May on the accessory and handbag categories to which we have a relatively small overall exposure. In light of these headwinds, we believe that it was prudent to lower our fiscal year EPS guidance to $10.20 to $10.30. Our new guidance implies year-over-year earnings per share growth of 6% to 7% on a reported basis and 10% to 11% on a constant currency basis.","We are confident that with our iconic brands and diversified business model that we are well positioned to gain market share. Our teams continue to invest in the strategic areas of the business that are increasingly dynamic and ever changing consumer landscape to position us for long-term success. But we are also will continue to monitor emerging trends and maintain our flexibility to react accordingly, and most importantly deliver against our strategic priorities.","Lastly, I'd like to take a moment before going into the brands and the business update for the quarter to take a moment to discuss our exciting recent announcement that Stefan Larsson will be joining PVH in the newly created role of President. With his start date officially June 3, Stefan will have the responsibility for managing PVH's branded businesses and global regions, with each of the three brand CEOs and each of the regions around the world reporting directly to him. Stefan is a well-rounded seasoned executive who has an appreciation for the changing landscape, consumer centricity and the digital needs of the business as we see it today and what we will need to be successful in the future. His talent and operational record of accomplishment make him a strong addition to PVH and I believe that this go-forward structure positions PVH well to further fuel our growth and capture organic and strategic M&A opportunities out there for us.","As mentioned in the release. I'm committed to PVH. I have signed a new five-year employment agreement with PVH. We take this success in planning very seriously and I plan to work very closely with the Board and Stefan, on the timing of his anticipated promotion to CEO, which is expected to occur over the next three to four years.","I will now move on to the brand results and I'll begin with Tommy Hilfiger. Our Tommy Hilfiger posted a very strong quarter, despite the challenging global consumer backdrop, led by our consumer-centric focus we delivered strong product assortments, exciting new marketing campaigns and immersive brand experiences. There are a few highlights that I'd like to call out from the brand side. The brand continues to see incredible traction in every major market around the world and we are seeing consumer engagement and desire to purchase continue to improve.","Our Tommy now fashion showing powers along with our TommyXZendaya capsule collection was regarded as one of the most successful spring fashion events with 1.7 million audience engagements on our own channels in the first three days following the show, which was up 50% versus last year.","Our tightly curated exclusive collaborations continue to drive hype, brand heat and relevance with the consumers. From Tommy Hilfiger's, Coca-Cola capsule collection in spring which brought heat and hallow to the brand with significantly strong full price sell-throughs to our newly launched Kith capsule which is seeing incredible sell-throughs.","On a regional braces, we have - we drove momentum through our collaboration with Lewis Hamilton in a consumer event in Berlin. A celebrity-studded Tommy Jeans store opening event in Seoul and a highly visible Tommy Hilfiger Store-of-the-Future opening event in Beijing, among a number of local events.","Looking ahead, we plan to further engage consumers by continuing our brand ambassador relationships, especially leveraging our local influences in key markets around the world to drive more unique engagements as well as offering curated local activations with a differentiated Tommy experience for consumers.","Moving to the business, Tommy's revenues increased 4% in the quarter and 9% on a constant currency basis with earnings up 6% driven by outperformance in the international businesses. Internationally, revenues rose 12% on a constant currency basis, with retail comparable store sales rising 9%, driven by robust performance in Europe. The European business continues to be outstanding as we're gaining market share from our peers and delivery excitement across our products, marketing campaigns and capsule collections.","As a reminder, on the wholesale side, our full winter order books are up close to 15%. Asia was a mix story for us. Our Japan businesses, which is about half of the Tommy's revenues in Asia posted very strong results as our product positioning and consumer engagement initiatives are clearly resonating with consumers and the consumer backward drop is relatively healthy.","However, our China business was soft during the quarter. We believe that consumer sentiment is increasingly impacted by the ongoing headlines about trade and tariff awards with consumers' uncertainty resulting in consumers buying less. Our experienced teams in the region are working diligently to cater to domestic and Chinese consumers, with product assortments, marketing campaigns and brand activations that are tailored specifically to the market.","Moving to North America, revenues rose 3%. Performance was led by wholesale, where we saw continued strong response to our sportswear, Denim and accessory assortments. However, our retail businesses experienced a 4% comp store sales decline. This was largely driven by lower traffic, which was driven in large part by weaker traffic from international tourism, which we attributed to a much stronger U.S. dollar, weakening foreign currency purchasing and the impact around trade disputes with China and others.","On the licensing side of the business, we continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of our women's business under G-III which is experiencing strong growth and excellent sell-throughs.","Moving to the Calvin Klein business, we continue to be focused on executing the brand strategic priorities to capture the brand's long-term growth potential. There are many exciting brand moments during the quarter, which I'd like to bring you up to date on, including the brand heat has continued to improve over the past few months and the brand awareness remains strong with an increasing desire to purchase the brand.","Calvin Klein launched two campaigns during this quarter, both of which prioritized video and complemented digital investments with social amplification that encompass, did more impactful storytelling and product conversations. Both campaigns produced record-breaking results for the brand. The cast of talent included Shawn Mendes, Noah Centineo and Kendall Jenner among others. I speak my truth in my hashtag #CALVINS is the latest iteration of our successful campaign of hashtag #MYCALVINS that includes the cast of a diverse group of actors musicians and models, including Shawn Mendes, Korean actor Yoo Ah-in and musician Billie Eilish and model Kendall Jenner among others. To date, the campaign has resulted in $22 million of earned media value and an increase 86% in weekly traffic to our calvinklein.com site.","We also have a strong present at Coachella as their official apparel sponsor. Calvin Klein the Coachella competitive set, earning the highest total of reach at 60.2 million engagements up more than 145% from the average competitor engagements. The influencer marketing strategy alone resulted in over 22,000 click-throughs to the product focused festival headed Landing Page on calvinklein.com. The entire activation generated earned media value of over $18 million.","From a product perspective, let me give you a bit of an update. We continue to be focused on improving product as we repositioned the Jeans assortment. As a reminder, spring 2019 was an improvement from our fall 2018 assortment as our Denim assortments are in much better positions. We have made notable improvements to the balance of basics versus fashion and our core programs are showing a positive response.","We expect to see further progress as we move into the fall holiday season as our fashion assortments solely improves to complement the basic core assortments. Additionally, we believe that our 360 degrees approach to consumer marketing would improve product not only in Jeans will help drive the overall Calvin Klein brand experience.","From a business perspective, revenues were flat at $890 million, up 4% on a constant currency basis for the first quarter. While earnings rose 9% to nearly $120 million and operating margins improved 110 basis points. Calvin Klein's international revenues increased 5% on a constant currency basis.","By region, Calvin Klein Europe continues to build on its fourth quarter performance. We are seeing an improving response to our category offerings, particularly in Jeans, which still has a way to go. As we previously mentioned our fall 2019 order books are projected to be up close to 15%.","Moving onto Asia. Calvin Klein experienced the same pressure in China, that I mentioned earlier. As it was not immune to the softening consumer environment there, namely the combination of Chinese New Year shifting and the macro retail sales weakness, which is a direct result of the uncertainty created by the US-China trade disputes.","Looking ahead, we have excitement plans for the China market, including the launch of several new local brand ambassadors, the introduction of a new CRM program and loyalty programs to shoppers. And the further digital investments in activations. Outside of China, the business continued to gain share in its market despite the soft macro environment.","Moving to North America, revenues were up 2% in North America and earnings were up over 20%, largely attributable to lower expenses and a better management of the overall business. The Calvin Klein North America wholesale business had a strong quarter overall, including very strong results from our digital businesses.","However, our retail businesses saw a pressure as evidenced by the 5% comp store decline. This was largely due to weak traffic, which we experienced due to the toughest comparisons with tourism compared to last year. On our own digital site calvinklein.com performed quite well during the quarter.","Finally, in our heritage businesses, revenues for the quarter rose 1% in line with our guidance and margins declined 60 basis points, driven by gross margin pressure from the more promotional U.S. retail environment. In general, our sportswear business saw a healthy performance and our core intimates business continued to perform well.","However, we did continue to experience pressure in our dress furnishings business, particularly neckwear and also in our retail business. As well as we look ahead, we continue to see weakness in the US retail marketplace where heritage plays and we expect our heritage business to feel significant margin pressure in our second quarter, which is all encompassed in our earnings guidance as we look forward.","In summary, as we look at the overall business, I'm pleased with the company's first quarter performance and I'm proud of the progress that our teams are performing against our strategic plan in the face of this changing dynamic in the industry.","Looking to our outlook for the second quarter, we are certainly seeing a softer macro picture out there overall. Trends in May are under pressure with comps down high single-digits in North America as we experienced the soft Memorial Day weekend in a highly promotional environment and the generally cooler weather, wet weather May versus last year.","As mentioned earlier, international tourist traffic trends have decelerated. And the tax impact on U.S. consumers is manifesting itself. We expect that these trends will significantly improve as we head into June and July with our expectations of continued negative low single-digit comps for the quarter. I'm pleased to say that we are seeing some improving sell-throughs at wholesale as we came out of the Memorial holiday weekend.","Internationally, we are seeing low single-digit positive comps in our Tommy International business and negative low single digits in our Calvin Klein International business. Holiday shifts in Europe and a cooler wet weather May are negatively affecting May month results month-to-date. We believe that the international business will improve significantly as we head into June as evidenced by the performance experienced in the last week of May, which was a significant improvement in trend.","Tommy Hilfiger International business is projected to be up high single digits. And our Calvin Klein international business will be up low single digits for the quarter. Asia really driven by China continues to be relatively soft are as I discussed our trade disputes continue to impact the business overall.","We believe that as we head into the second half of the year, we will be up against significantly easier comp store sales comparisons and that the noise around trade and tariffs will moderate, as such, we expect a much healthier back half of the year for the company. We believe that the incredible brand power behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger continues to position us well in the marketplace against our competition in light of the difficult macro and retail environment.","And with that, I will turn it over to Mike to quantify some of our results.","Mike Shaffer","Thanks Manny.","The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. For the first quarter, our reported revenues were up 2% and 6% on a constant currency basis, in line with guidance. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were very strong, up 4% as reported and up 9% on a constant currency basis.","Tommy Hilfiger International revenues increased 4% as reported and were up 12% on a constant currency basis. The Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increase was driven by strong performance in Europe with international comp store sales up 9%. Tommy Hilfiger North American revenues increased 3%. North America comp sales were down 4%.","Our Calvin Klein revenues were flat to the prior year and up 4% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein international revenues decreased 2% as reported and were up 5% on a constant currency basis, the strong performance in Europe was offset by currency headwinds and weakness in China.","Our international comp store sales were down 4%. Calvin Klein North American revenues increased 2% and were up 3% on a constant currency basis. Strong wholesale business was in part offset by North America comp sales down 5%.","Heritage revenues were up 1% to the prior year. Our Heritage Retail business comp store sales were down 6% to the prior year. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.46, $0.01 better than the top-end of our previous guidance. The EPS beat versus previous guidance was driven by stronger than planned business for approximately $0.01.","Moving on to our guidance. For the full year 2019, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be $10.20 to $10.30, 6% to 7% growth over the prior year. This reflects a $0.10 decrease versus our previous guidance and includes an additional $0.10 negative impact of foreign currency translation.","Our total FX headwind on the year is now estimated to be $0.32 of translation. Earnings per share excluding the negative impact of currency is projected to grow approximately 10% to 11%. In addition, our new guidance reflects interest and tax savings of $0.08 offset by $0.08 of a business take down which includes new tariffs of approximately $0.05 and goods manufactured in China and delivered to the USA. Tranches 1, 2 and 3 of the China tariffs at 25% are now included in our current guidance. However, our guidance does not contemplate any future increase in tariffs on additional goods imported from China into the US.","Overall, we're projecting revenues to grow approximately 3% as reported and 5% on a constant currency basis. Included in our revenue guidance for the year is an addition of approximately $150 million related to the pending Australia and Greater China acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $100 million related to our intent to license the Calvin Klein Women's Jeans business and the closure of our Calvin Klein Collection business.","Overall, operating margins are expected to increase approximately 20 basis points for the year for the company. Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to increased 6% as reported and 9% on a constant currency basis. Tommy Hilfiger operating margins are planned to decrease about 20 basis points including the negative impact from the pending Australia and greater China acquisitions, as these businesses shift from a licensing model to a directly operated model.","We project Calvin Klein revenues to be flat and up 2% on a constant currency basis, we're also planning Calvin Klein operating margins to increase 80 basis points to 90 basis points. Our Heritage business is planned to have flat revenues with operating margins planned to decrease about 30 basis points.","Interest expense for the year is planned to be about $120 million down to our previous guidance and reflects the benefit of our recent refinancing. In 2019, we are planning to pay down at least $150 million of our debt. Stock repurchases in 2019 are planned to be about $200 million. Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 14% to 15%, which at the midpoint is up approximately 110 basis points versus the prior year. The increase in the tax rate is the result of changes in the US tax code.","Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned at a $1.85 to $1.90 and includes $0.06 of estimated negative impact from foreign currency translation. Revenue in the second quarter is projected to be flat to the prior year as reported and up 2% on a constant currency basis.","Tommy Hilfiger revenues are planned to 3% increase as reported and 6% on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein revenues are planned to the 4% decrease as reported and 2% decrease on a constant currency basis. Calvin Klein second quarter revenues reflect the negative impact from the planned transfer the Women's Jeans business and the Calvin Klein Collection closure, which was worth approximately 4%. Heritage brand revenues are projected to decrease 2%.","Interest expense is projected to be about $28 million and taxes to be 21.5% to 22.5% in the second quarter. Our tax rate for the quarter at the midpoint of our guidance reflects an increase of about 320 basis points to the prior year which is worth about $0.08 less of earnings per share in the second quarter.","And with that operator, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Bob Drbul","Manny, I've got two questions for you. I guess the first one is, when you look at the trends, second quarter to date, I just - when I look at what you delivered in the first quarter, second quarter to date, can you just give us an element of your confidence in the guidance going forward in the improvement that you're forecasting in the numbers overall? And the second question is just can you just maybe give us some insight on what you think is really happening in China on your own business there in China as well from the slowdown that you\u2019re seeing. Thanks.","Manny Chirico","Sure, Bob. I guess on the first point, when you really look at last year, and the comp store trends for the business, the first four to five months of fiscal - of last year, our costs were running up high single digits overall in North America when you blend - when you blend it all together.","And May was one of our strongest months overall when you look at it. So Tommy business I think in US focused only was probably up about 10% on a comp store basis and that trend significantly decelerates in the second half of the year.","So our comparisons get much easier in Tommy, get much easier in Calvin and in our heritage businesses side, I think that gives us a level of confidence as we go forward. We're just up against some really dramatic business - strong business last year. And I think as you look at some of the product initiatives we have going forward, we feel very good about the position of our inventory as we move forward.","And I - we feel that the trade tension and talks should start to soften as we get into the second half of the year, as I think it should actually play out hopefully that those things work their way through the overall economy.","So in North America, that's the backdrop. And I think if you look at the stock comp basis, over the two year period in all of our brands, you'd see positive stock comp store performance overall even through May. But the challenge is, we're up against this very strong trend as we go forward. So we think we - we think that will start to change. China, which is really I think in some ways very similar, we had a very, very strong first half last year with positive comps throughout.","And then as you recall, the whole trades discussion and the - and the nervousness around the tariffs and the tension started to come into play around July. And with that, we really saw a drop-off and we reported that in our results in the third and fourth quarter. So I think we start to anniversary that negative trend in business and all start to align as we go forward, so from that perspective.","I think the only other thing I would say about our China business which I think is a little different than some of our competitors is where we've got a significantly larger overall penetration in China, particularly with Calvin Klein. And our brand is much more widely distributed throughout China.","So we don't just sit in Tier 1 cities like Beijing and Shanghai, we are much more broadly distributed throughout China and that has been part of I think, the strength of the brand overall and the recognition of the brand throughout China as we were one of the first movers in China and I think we continue to benefit from that. But with that comes a much more broader geographical spectrum and I think we're being more impacted by some of these trade issues because we are much more developed in some of these Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities throughout China where manufacturing is even a greater portion of the overall economy.","We tend to play more with the middle income consumer versus the Luxury consumer and I think that's where we really sit. And overall when you look at some of our comparisons that people are making, we got the record as we are playing in the apparel space, not necessarily with the accessory space. And I think that's one of the big differentiators for us in China.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Erinn Murphy","I guess I had a follow-up first on the North American market. Manny, if you could just speak to what you're seeing broadly in the wholesale side of the business. And as we get closer to back to school and fall, are you seeing any shifts that how your wholesale partners are planning their orders?","Manny Chirico","Yes, I think is - look at the last few weeks, I think there are a number of our key customers and then retailers in general as reported, and you've seen the results and they've been challenging. And I think also as people have looked at the guidance and looked at the second quarter results, they've also seen the trends softened in May and I think that's the backdrop that we're dealing with today. And that's the reality of what we're dealing with today.","I think is our customers, our key retail partners have tightened inventory and have clearly tightened open to buy, and we've reflected that in the guidance that we've given. So I think we've already planned that into our second half results as we move forward. I think inventories in general are in reasonable position at wholesale.","And I think if sales pick up as we expect in June and moving into the second half, I think inventories will be in reasonably good position as we go into fall. Of course, you always worry about inventories going to back up and that would be the concern if we don't start to see some positive improvement in trends as we move into July and August.","Erinn Murphy","And then maybe just secondarily, on the Tommy Hilfiger brand, it seems like that brand broadly is still seeing some pretty good trends and you've lifted the full-year sales guidance by about 100 basis point constant currency. What are you seeing there that kind of gives you the confidence to raise that revenue guidance for that brand? Thank you.","Manny Chirico","I guess two pieces, where we're really seeing very strong performance, one is Europe in general, overall the performance is just outstanding and continues to be. I know people keep asking me with all the noise coming out of Europe. Why does both Calvin and Tommy continue to do so well? I think the brands are resonating. I think Calvin is gaining white space and market share, based on just the relative size compared with Tommy, the opportunity. The Tommy brand just continues to perform, gain market share against its competitive set.","As I said for branded size to have an order book increase that's close to 15% in the second half and we haven't seen any kind of slowdown down as we look out to early spring results. So that trend continues. We feel really good about how that business is shaping up for us and we're doing so.","Europe a key strength for us as well. And then our wholesale business here in the United States is just having very strong performance both sell-throughs in spring and some of our key retailers like Macy's has been very strong, collection product, sportswear men, our Denim product. I know the G-III business both in Calvin and Tommy, but particularly in Tommy as it's on a growth cycle and gaining more and more shelf space throughout department stores here, that trend just continues.","I think it's a testament to the management team, how well they've managed the brand, the marketing that continues to seem to connect with consumers and the strength of the product assortments, as they move forward, that's given us the confidence on the Tommy side and the numbers are in front of us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","So, maybe first at Calvin. I guess, Manny can you outline the driver behind the slight reduction to the constant currency revenue guide for this year? And maybe what you're seeing from an underlying product and marketing perspective, that gives you the confidence for improvement as we move into the back half of the year and beyond?","Manny Chirico","I think the takedown in Calvin, a slight takedown in Calvin really driven by China and what we've seen there and what we really need to, and what we felt we needed to adjust that number as we move forward. So that 1% drop in sales where we are. At the same time, we continue to see positive reaction to sell-throughs here in North America, the reaction to the Jeans line that's coming out for fall both on the Men's side but particularly also with G-III's launch of Women's here in the United States, we're really seeing strong momentum there.","I think the comparisons on Calvin in particular, as you recall, the challenges that we faced in the second half of last year, the comparisons which is much softer as we get into the third and fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2018. Spring was still strong at Calvin last year, we continue to put those results on.","So, we feel we're really seeing the momentum. We'd be marketing clearly is back to the brand DNA and it's connecting with the consumer, we think the product continues to improve, season by season. And given the strength of the brand and what it historically has delivered and the reaction we've gotten from retailers to the line we have strong confidence in the business.","And with just a little help from the - of the macro environment, I think we're well positioned there. Clearly well positioned from a cost management of the brand with the restructuring initiatives we put in place around the collection business, the reinvestment of marketing dollars back into the brand. In the first quarter, I think when you take the first half overall, you'll continue to see operating margin improved in that 70 basis point, 80 basis point range that we've given from the beginning.","Even though first quarter was ahead of that, I think you have to look at it on a season by season basis, you can't look at just quarterly. And I think that part of the momentum of the business just keeps moving forward. So I think we feel pretty good about how Calvin is shaping up, particularly as we go into the second quarter - second half.","Matthew Boss","And then maybe just a follow on, on the gross margin on the consolidated PVH front. Could you just walk us through the drivers of the 70 basis point decline in the first quarter? Any change to the 70 basis point to 80 basis point expansion guide for the year? And maybe just touch on any embedded gross margin forecast for the second quarter.","Mike Shaffer","So look for the first quarter, we had always talked about gross margins being down. We had a Chinese New Year shift, high margin - high gross margin business and the currency impact was a first quarter event, plus there was a big wholesale quarter in the first quarter, which also impacted the gross margin down 70 basis points.","As we look at the year, we've talked about 90 basis points to 100 basis points for the year and that continues to be our plan and our plan is also to be up in the second, third and fourth quarter. So that there's been no change and we did hit our plan for the first quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti","Thanks for all the detail today, it help us. I guess just to check the box, with Tommy International, I think you mentioned the current quarter-to-date comps had slowed a little bit to low singles. But in most of the rest of your commentary on Tommy, suggests you're still feeling pretty good about the international trends. Any reason that you think that the current quarter-to-date has slowed in Tommy International?","Manny Chirico","I think two key pieces. I think there is a - again - I don't want to again - there's a holiday shift going on in Europe as Easter was later than the number of the holidays, that some of the Christian holidays that follow are also late, are also about three weeks later. So we start to pick the potential calendar shift benefit as we go into this week and into next week and beyond. So we should be able to see an improvement in that.","So that's the big piece of the comp. I guess the other piece is with the strength of the business - with the strength of the business that's been so strong to the first quarter, we've gotten much less carryover merchandise needing to liquidate this year. And getting the promotional button, we've been a little slower this year than last year because of the great position of the inventory and really trying to milk a bit of the gross margin dollars that are available to us.","So in a short period in this window when you get between May and June where promotions really start and clearance really starts in Europe, all of our competitors that are two or three weeks ahead of us on clearance discounts and we are just starting that and we saw a reaction to that just last week when we hit the button to move on that.","So I think that's timing. Yeah, we are confident that as we look at into end of May going into June that Tommy trends continue to improve from where they are.","Michael Binetti","I remember you're commenting on things like that in the past this time of year. And then I'm just - I'm curious, on North America in the guidance rolling forward into 2Q and beyond this, I think you guys were thinking and hoping the trends in the channel will get a little bit better in April, after a slow start when you commented in March, we didn't see it pop on April, you think things will get better in the back half? And it sounds like in first quarter the tourism is still decelerating, the currencies are on the lows here on a - at least on a year-over-year basis. I mean, in the past you've spoken to us in terms of permanent population versus tourism, but can you help just roll us forward a little bit on how you're building to the improvement in North America? If things like tourism continued to decelerate from here or how many levers you have in the P&L to help if you don't get that improvement in tourism or if the trade tensions don't settle going forward?","Manny Chirico","I think is, when you think about the outlet channel and when you think about global brands like Calvin and Tommy in particular. And when we look at our business, somewhere between 35% to 40% of our business in the North America retail outlet channel is driven by international tourism, that's a big component. I think I would go back to what I mentioned before is that trend was very, very strong in the first quarter of last year into the first four, five months of last year, as well.","As we start to move into July and beyond, we really - that's when we start to anniversary the comparisons where we really started to see a tail off of the tourism trends that benefited us so strongly in the first half of 2018.","So I think that in and of itself should be a key driver for us as we go forward just being up against much softer traffic trends from last year in that international component as we move forward, particularly in the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses. So I think that's what we're looking at. And I think as this starts to play itself out, we'll be able to report back on that as we move forward. But that's a key driver that we feel that that will start to level itself off in the second half of the year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tiffany Kanaga from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Tiffany Kanaga","Do you believe we can return to the 13% to 15% constant currency earnings growth algorithm after getting passed this year's challenges? Or are there any fundamental changes to the business that would lead to a lower long-term target range?","Manny Chirico","I think - look, I think the fundamental issue for us is we don't see any reason why that 13% to 15% algorithm would change. The two big drivers for us that have been hard to manage and has been impossible to manage is come at us, it's been foreign currency translation and the strengthening dollar in this environment.","And then obviously this whole tariff issue, how that plays itself out and the levers we can pull there, that will put some pressure on that earnings growth if those kind of tariffs go in effect and if they stay intact for a period of time, that will translate, we'll have to deal with that. But I think it's fundamentally as things level off and we look at our business dynamic, the balance sheet and how we've been utilizing our cash, we think that 13% to 15% algorithm is in place and ones that we hit in '17 and '18 and I think as things level out, we should be back on that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Ike Boruchow","I don't know if this is for Manny or Mike. But on Tommy Hilfiger understanding they have a larger retail business in Calvin, so comps in the outlets are a little bit under pressure right now. But on the wholesale side, the distribution opportunity into next year is still pretty compelling. I guess again Manny or Mike, is there any way you could kind of size that opportunity, now that the Macy's exclusivity is kind of broken and you have the right to distribute to more partners. Just trying to think about North America Tommy Hilfiger growth into next year and what kind of visibility you have maybe in the order book already.","Manny Chirico","We've said - I guess I said over time I think the opportunity is $100 million opportunity in sales as we go forward just to kind of size it, I don't - obviously, I don't think that comes in one year, like 2020, I think that's built over a period of time. But that would be increase - I mean, it comes from three key customers I think it's Belk, Dillard's and Amazon, as we move forward, being able to increase our penetration there. Those are historically very strong pop ins for PVH overall. So I think those opportunities do exist.","And I think there is clearly an appetite for the brand with those both in our Men's product that we run directly ourselves as well as our Women's product with G-III and growing their footprint throughout the US. So I think that pretty well sizes the three.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","As you think about the incremental uplift that you got last year whether it's from wage increases and tax reform that gave strength to Q1 and obviously to May. How do you triangulate the current May performance given the comparison the thoughts on the rest of the quarter? And then I just have two quick other ones.","Manny Chirico","So let me try to triangulate that. I think is - look the May, I think was - May was a challenging month, I think everybody's talked about that. And I think - and I guess given where we are coming out and announcing in this timeframe, I think is we're probably ahead of everyone since we report later than most everyone.","And I think that's the pressure - that's the real pressure we saw. How do I triangulated it? Last year if you look at the comps in May, May was our strongest month overall, we had 11% comp store increase in May, we knew it was going to be our most challenging month. May last year, the weather was perfect, it was summer early and we benefited from all those things.","The momentum coming out of the tax, and you touched on it Dana. The tax refunds and the lower withholding taxes that everyone was seeing in their paycheck, I think really gave a boost to the consumer. And we saw that in the business that we were able to take advantage of that.","And I think the challenge we're facing right now is being up against some of those real positive dynamics from last year and some of the negatives issues that have come up this year around trade and the uncertainty that's being created in the market overall with the consumer, I think has put pressure on the apparel segment.","And I think in outlet retailing which you touched on is the channel we are talking about that has such a big international tourist component that you really see that currencies are down 5% to 7% compared to this time last year and that's putting pressure on international tourism purchasing.","So that's what we're up against. I think those things start to reverse themselves as we move through June into July and get into the second half of the year and the comparisons do get easier but we have to get through the next couple of weeks. And then I think the comparisons starts to get much easier.","Dana Telsey","And then progress on the potential for licensing the CK Women's Jeans North America business, how is that moving along?","Manny Chirico","Morris and I, we - at G-III, Morris, the CEO of - Goldfarb, the CEO of G-III, we keep saying the deal is over, we sign, we should cancel or whatever, the lawyers are still playing around with some wording. I think that'll all be behind us shortly. That deal is - that deal is done, they are showing product. They are actually talking about building spaces in certain key department store doors with new shop-in-shops.","So clearly that's all just moving forward as we go forward and product has started to be sourced and put together and we really feel good about how strong their product presentations to department store channel has been, the reception of the product at retail has been extraordinary. And they're just great partners, the G-III and they've done an amazing job with our Calvin Women's business overall. So obviously giving them Jeans is a bit of a no-brainer at this point. So I think they're going to do a great job with it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jay Sole from UBS. Please go ahead.","Jay Sole","My question is about the operating margin guidance. I think you said it was up 20 bps for the year. I think last quarter was up 20 to 30. So can you just talk about maybe what's driving the change in the operating margin guidance for the year?","Manny Chirico","I think a big piece of it is just the foreign currencies having some impact, the additional pressure on that. I don't think fundamentally anything has really changed dramatically. And then I guess just when you look at our heritage business, it's - with the promotional environment in North America and what we're seeing in the open to buy, we've really moved those operating margins down most of all.","So, no change on Calvin and Tommy fundamentally, but the Heritage business is seeing what's going on in North America. Second half sales we moved down, and that's putting pressure on margin and some of the expense structure, deleveraging there.","Jay Sole","And then maybe during the quarter you announced a new licensing agreement with Nike for the Men's underwear business. Can you give us an idea of what kind of impact that might have on the business, maybe not this year but perhaps next year?","Manny Chirico","Yes, I think that's a fall 2020 launch. We think that the business has a potential of a $100 million business. I'm not sure how quickly it gets there. We're viewing product and talking to key customers. There's huge enthusiasm for the product and giving our expertise in that area on the Men's side. It seems like a huge opportunity.","It opens up really new channels of distribution for us, as well as existing channels. So there is a strong department store distribution. There's also because of the Nike brand strength, it really goes from - it goes from Kohl's, all the way up to Nordstrom and beyond and then it opens up the whole athletic sporting goods market that I think there's a real opportunity to develop a great underwear presence for Men's in particular, that's got - it has an athletic theme to it, it has performance product associated with it. And I think we know how to do that product better than anyone and understand that, and that's why Nike picked us. And I think it's a real opportunity as we go forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kate Fitzsimons from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kate Fitzsimons","I guess going back to Ike's earlier question about the widening North American distribution of Tommy Hilfiger, I guess what is your approach to maintaining and to run in the distribution while maintaining and balancing that strong relationship with Macy's? And then secondly, I noticed you called out the appointment of the Chief Digital Officer. Just what is her priorities for the brands go-forward as she ramps in the new role and maybe some digital focuses are for the remainder of 2019?","Manny Chirico","Sure. I guess on \u2013 the first part was the Tommy distribution and the Macy's. Look, I think if you look at Macy's biggest brands, those brands like Calvin Klein, and I'm not going to talk about all the competitors, but you could do it yourself. Those are their biggest brands within stores. It's not the exclusive brands. And I think Jeff Gennette has been very clear about looking for brands that are desired by the U.S. consumers and the need for exclusive national brands. They've clearly taken a different track as they move forward.","I think performance drives the amount of open to buy dollars you get. And I think if you speak to any one at Macy's, they'll tell you how strong the Tommy Hilfiger performance is and has been. Macy's is a key customer, strategic partner for us along our largest customer in the world overall from a wholesale point of view. So obviously they are always a priority for us.","We make sure that they're first with products, they have the ability to do exclusive product with us for all of our brands and Tommy in particular, and we'll continue to have that opportunity as we move forward. They've got some of the best showcases for brands in the United States with places like Herald Square and Union Square. So clearly there's a marketing advantage, a brand advantage to be in those key spots and we understand that.","So I think the relationship has never been stronger between the two companies. Their preference to buy the brand has never been stronger. And if you look at the growth of the brand with G-III expanding Women's broadly across the floor and us expanding the Men's assortment, really growing the Denim component there as well and looking to expand the athleisure component in that business. I think Macy's will continue to be a growth account for us in total, but also for the Tommy Hilfiger brand. So I think it's a question of balance and I think it's a very good result for us and I'm glad it works for Macy's as well.","And we will take one more question, operator, as we're getting past the 10 o'clock hour.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kimberly Greenberger","Manny, Tommy Hilfiger has put up really strong results now for a number of years, and the May slow down here sounds calendar related or transitory. Is there any reason to think that the Tommy Hilfiger momentum has slowed or skipped a beat and that we won't see that momentum restored in the back half of the year?","Manny Chirico","No, I don't. I mean, look, we have tremendous confidence in that brand. We see it in our orderbooks with wholesalers in Europe, but also here in North America, how we're being planned here in North America. And the opportunities that are open to the brand as we start to discuss new customers.","We're dealing with, let's be fair, we're dealing with a channel issue and the outlet channel that I think is being overly pressured by international tourism. I think that will work itself out over the next couple of months. And then I think the brand is back on the trajectory as we move forward. So I feel highly confident about the Tommy Hilfiger brand. So I think that answers that question.","Before I close the conference, I just realized I didn't answer the second part of the last question, which is really around digital and some of the things we're doing. Marie's charge is to really work closely with the brand and the marketing teams on a regional basis and on a global basis to really focus on marketing.","As we shift more and more on marketing online, we want to continue to make the right relationships throughout the world of digital, be it with Google or other key players. I think, Marie brings that experience from her days at L'Oreal and her experience on the digital side and the platform. She really is helping us leapfrog as we move forward to engage with consumers.","The other thing that's really where we're making tremendous investment and I think Marie is helping us, is the organization of the consumer data, being able to take that consumer data and use it in a way that connects us with the consumer. And we're not only making a connection but we're making an emotional connection that will translate into a sales transaction.","So we're trying to bring our marketing and she's trying to take our marketing and make the connection. Our marketing for so many years has been about build the brand, build the brand strength, which is key, and I think it served us well over the long term. But I think she brings more of the laser focus to the brand where we're connecting directly with consumers on more of an individual basis, tailoring our market message consumer-by-consumer, and try to really resonate with that consumer. Better understanding the relationships would drive sales.","She has really opened our eyes about some of the correlations between what drives consumers and how to get them to make a call of action on the brand. So I think her experience and knowledge will serve us well as we're making these investments, and our brand messages which our brands and our CEOs around the world and their own CMOs drive that component, I think her role will be really helping them align that consumer messaging, making it tighter, more tailored as we move forward. And I think it's the way of the future and we need to be at the forefront and move forward. So I think that's going to help drive our business.","So with that, I'd like to close the conference. Thanks for your attention and we look forward to updating you in August about results going forward. Have a great day.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
