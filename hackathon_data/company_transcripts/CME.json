[Operator Instructions] At this time, I will turn the call over to Mr. John Peschier. You may begin, sir.","John C. Peschier","Thank you for joining us this morning. Gill and John will spend a few minutes outlining the highlights of the first quarter and then we'll open it up for your questions. Bryan, Derek and Sean are on the call as well and will participate in the Q&A session. Terry is traveling today to meet with some clients, so he'll not be on the call this morning. Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language.","Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you, John, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since the beginning of the year in terms of our growth initiatives and our volume relative to market conditions. Also, our efforts on the expense side are clearly evident in our Q1 results and I applaud our team for their efforts.","During the first quarter, our ADV reached almost 15 million contracts, which is the second highest volume quarter in our history. We had record energy volume, up more than 20% and interest rates and FX volume each grew by more than 10%. Some notable quarterly records included overall options ADV of 2.8 million contracts as well as records in WTI and Brent crude, gasoline and heating oil products.","Energy volume has been very robust overall this year. We have had standout results with our WTI crude oil contracts relative to the other primary crude benchmark. Year-to-date, our WTI futures and WTI options are each up more than 60%. And combined, we have averaged 1.1 million contracts per day so far this year.","Turning to FX. Activity has been impressive and FX volumes averaged about 725,000 per day in the first half of last year. That number jumped to about 875,000 in the second half, and we saw almost 1.1 million contracts per day in March of this year. In April, we are trending up about 40% compared to last year. Certainly, you have heard about positive trends in the FX activity on several of the large banks' earnings calls. Open interest in FX continues to run at peak levels. With the upcoming election in the U.K. and the ongoing debate about what the Fed will do, we expect to continue to see some interesting activity in our FX markets.","Moving on to our interest rate quadrant. After a strong first quarter, we have seen a slowdown in activity since the dovish sentiment from the Fed meeting in mid-March, coupled with a normally slow April and Easter holiday period. Weaker economic data tends to push expectations of a Fed rate move further out, as evidenced in our Fed funds futures markets, while making the ebb and flow of the rate decision debate even more dependent on upcoming economic data in the spring and summer months. Volatility in rate products have dropped in April, which you can see in the slides. We are fortunate that we have a very diverse product set, which is important when volume fluctuates like it does every year.","As I've mentioned last quarter, we are focused on 3 primary areas of organic growth: increased penetration of global clients, attractive flow from the swaps business through clearing and exchange-traded alternatives and driving options growth across the platform, which elevates futures volume as well.","Volume from outside the U.S. continues to be impressive as we leverage our investments in global headcount, partnerships and product development. Our Q1 electronic trading volume out of Asia reached a record 570,000 contracts per day, up 22% from Q1 of last year. That was double the 10% growth we saw out of North America during the quarter.","Energy volume led the way in terms of product line growth from Asia, followed by FX and equities, all up more than 40%. Clearly, Asian clients are comfortable trading and clearing directly with a U.S.-based exchange.","Average daily volume from Europe grew by 14% to 2.3 million contracts, led by interest rates and energy products. In addition, I'm pleased to see our European exchange is starting to expand from a small base. On April 10, we traded 10,000 contracts for the first time with contributions from FX, European national gas and cocoa.","Turning to Swaps clearing. Positive momentum continued in Q1 and we are very pleased to have a leadership position here. We continue to push on the innovation front. Relative to the other major global clearing houses in rates, we were first with coupon blending, which offers capital and operational efficiencies in a capital and a resource-constrained world. This significantly reduces the number of transactions and the notional outstanding required to maintain a given portfolio. Already, customers have reduced over 100,000 line items and over $8 trillion in notional using the service.","In addition, we are also working with TriOptima to offer multilateral compression for interest rate swaps for FCM house accounts.","We were also first, logically so, with portfolio margining, facilitating individual client risk reduction by as much as 85%. Since the end of last year, the number of end clients utilizing this solution has more than doubled to 43 firms through 11 live clearing members. In December 2013, we expanded our offering to include clearing for the Mexican peso swaps, making our IRS product scope the broadest available on any platform, with 18 currencies.","We now have 37 clients voluntarily clearing these Mexican peso swaps, including both dealer-to-dealer and dealer-to-client, and it is our fifth largest currency. All of these efforts have helped us to gain market share in plain vanilla fixed versus floating swaps in both dollar and non-dollar currencies.","We continue to market our interest rate futures and options to over 500 DME OTC clearing customers. During the quarter, Greenwich Associates published a total transaction cost analysis comparing the cost of swaps versus futures. Based on the detailed analytics from the 42 clients surveyed, it showed that futures are nearly always the lowest cost alternative. The Greenwich report is available on our website and we continue to educate market participants about this important comparison.","Building on this, in March, we launched a new web tool in conjunction with ICAP and the Beast Apps called RapidRV. This robust offering provides over 15 different analytics that allow customers to explore relative value and comparative pricing of swaps, cash treasury markets and CME Group interest rate futures. With real-time pricing feeds, customers are able to view side-by-side pricing analysis and opportunity assessment across fixed income products.","For some time now, we have provided updates on statistics that we follow very closely that are potential signs of OTC clients using futures. Many of you have asked for additional data points on this transition.","Last quarter, I mentioned our treasury futures business reached the highest proportion ever of the cash treasury business at 75% of the size of the cash market. I'm pleased to say in March that number jumped to 77%. One new piece of data can be found in the slides. We have analyzed the activity of our top users of portfolio margining and we have seen futures trading growth rates almost twice that of the overall marketplace.","The third area of growth I want to touch on is our options business. We eclipsed our prior peak options volume from Q4 to set a new quarterly volume record in Q1. This was driven by continued investment in our options trading functionality and bolstered by specific sales and marketing campaigns to draw new customers to our options markets. We saw double-digit growth in interest rates, approximately 50% of our options business is traded electronically with about 40% traded on the floor, and the remainder via privately negotiated transactions.","In terms of our efforts to electronify options, we have made significant progress within Eurodollar options on Globex over the last year. The percentage of Eurodollar option volume traded on Globex has grown from 11% in 2013 to 13% in 2014, and almost to 20% in March and April of this year. This recent increase in electronic activity has been driven by growth from European participants trading in our overnight hours. In comparison, in our earnings slide deck, you can see how the electronification of treasury options, which are currently around 63%, has created meaningful growth. The referenced slide illustrate the same trend across our other product lines as well.","You can see the power of this transition, most significantly, perhaps in FX options where the average daily volume is up ninefold since 2009, powered by electronic trading. Additionally, we continue to successfully grow our energy options volumes on Globex, with 41% of our total energy options trading in -- on Globex in Q1, up from just 28% in Q1 of last year. The point here is that options growth will drive activity in the futures markets, too, since both these products are on the same platform and combination trades can be executed.","So overall, we have had a nice start to the year. We continue to focus on ways to expand our business while driving productivity improvements throughout the organization.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter with revenue up over 8% and expenses down 2% compared with Q1 last year, driving operating margins above 62% for the quarter, our best result in the last few years. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.98, up 18% for the quarter compared to a strong Q1 last year. We saw a nice performance in our core futures, OTC clearing and market data revenue.","I'll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q1 was $0.753, up from $0.731 last quarter. The main driver of the increase was a shift in product mix, with an increased proportion of total volume coming from higher-priced commodity products. Specifically, we saw an approximate 2% shift from equity to energy products.","Our transaction fee increase went into effect in February, and we have 2 months at the higher level in our first quarter RPC.","OTC swaps revenue totaled $20 million for the quarter, up 53% versus Q1 last year. During the first quarter, we captured $129 per IRS cleared trade, which is consistent with what we've seen in the past, but down from Q4. We cleared approximately 2,370 trades per day in Q1, the highest level we have seen so far.","Market data revenue of $98 million was up 10% versus Q1 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program, which we have discussed the last few quarters. As a reminder, we began charging $42.50 per month for professional traders, who are grandfathered. And we also captured $6 per month on average per screen for nonprofessional traders. In Q1, we accrued for approximately 150,000 new screens, with approximately 1\/3 of those at the higher professional level and 2\/3 came in as nonprofessionals. It will likely take a few quarters to get to a steady state in terms of market data revenue, and we may see a drop from those $98 million level this quarter as customers settle into the new pricing structure.","Adjusted expenses in Q1 were $317 million, down $8 million from Q1 last year. We are very focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization, and eliminating redundancy to improve agility and customer responsiveness.","Virtually every expense category came down with the exception of Technology Services and volume-related license fees. At the same time, we continue to rollout significant number of new offerings, which Gill outlined.","At the end of Q1, we had 2,670 employees, down about 15 people from year-end and down 90 relative to this point last year driven by our October restructuring.","Our compensation ratio for the quarter was 15.9%, down from more than 17% the last 2 years.","Turning to taxes, the effective rate for the quarter was 36.6%. And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $1.8 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. During the quarter, we issued a 10-year bond totaling $750 million at 3%, replacing debt that was going to mature in 2018. We also upsized our revolving credit facility from $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion.","During Q1, our interest expense totaled $31 million, which was higher than Q4 primarily due to the double carry. We paid off the 2018 bond in April, and our quarterly run rate for interest expense will drop to approximately $29 million by the second half of the year.","If we adjust for the bond transaction we completed on April 8, we had approximately $1.1 billion of total cash at the end of Q1. That leaves $400 million above the $700 million we target in terms of a minimum cash level. So far this year, we've paid out over $800 million in total dividends.","During the first quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $27 million.","In summary, the first quarter of 2015 demonstrated the leverage in our business model. The entire management team continues to focus on margin expansion with both top line growth and expense discipline.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue if you have further questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, first just on the RPC improvement quarter-over-quarter, obviously you had the price increase to start. And then, Gill, you mentioned, some of the futurization dynamics. I'm just -- if you could help us think about the improvement and delineate between kind of the member, non-member mix as well as then what was actually just the function of the higher prices?","John W. Pietrowicz","Sure. Dan, this is John. You're correct. We had the price increase impact which began in February and we achieved what we expected, which was approximately 1.5% increase in the RPC. The areas that really impacted us are product shift, where we had a heavier exposure to energy this quarter, which has a higher RPC. And then, as you could tell from RPC results, FX certainly was favorable with a -- again a positive member -- non-member -- I'm sorry, positive non-member proportion as well as the impact of the price increase.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So if I only got one question, I'm going to use it on a regulatory issue. So Gill, I know this equivalence debate has been going on. It appears that there's -- it looks like a compromise or could be coming. I guess, the question, is this whole issue overblown? Are you taking it -- is it that serious that -- or will they just delay it? And then what would be the impact to CME if they -- on the extreme downside, if they didn't come up with some compromise between 1-day gross and 2-day net?","Phupinder S. Gill","Rich, I think there is a lot of hope in both sides that we will get to an agreement. And I think Channing Massey [ph] is going to meet those European counterparts in a few days here. But I think the whole topic of equivalence has been taken very seriously by both sides. And I think the -- that the issue seemed to be centered around margining, customer margining, which is 2-day net versus 1-day gross. And I think when you're talking about the topic of equivalence, there will likely be a compromise. But I think, fundamentally, what Channing Massey [ph] said a few months ago, is the right point, that the U.S. is the gold standard. The U.S. exchange has helped create markets in London and all over the world. And so some of the things that we have in place, if you're looking at equivalence on a line-by-line basis, you have the U.S., for example, running full margin cycle twice a day. That does not happen in Europe. So if you're talking about margin period of risk, there are actually 2 margin periods of risk within a single day in the U.S. every single day, and that doesn't happen in Europe. And you cannot loan money to your clients. That doesn't happen in Europe. You have to collect money from your clients. That doesn't happen in Europe. But that debate seems to be centered on margin itself. And the levels of margin on the client side, which is the important side, on the client side in the U.S. on a gross margining basis, can be anywhere from 2x to 4x as large and then it would be on a net basis. We've heard some noise that it might be roughly equivalent. Roughly equivalent is not true. It's 2x or more. So we expect a compromise because we expect Channing Massey [ph] to make the same point that he made a few months ago, but I think just from of a factual base, there are a lot of differences there. The U.S. has fine-tuned their approach to customer protection far longer than anybody else.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Amanda Yao - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Amanda Yao stepping in for Ken Worthington. So on the energy side, CME continues to recover share in WTI, but has lost a little bit of ground in Brent. Can you talk about the competitive market in oil?","Derek Sammann","Yes, this is Derek here. If you actually look at what's going on globally in the energy market right now, it's an oversupply story. The oversupply story is very much a TI story. But when I actually look at the growth of our complex between ourselves and ICE, the overall story is being played out, an increasing market share of the world price discovery and certainly the question of price discovery taking place being driven by the Brent -- the TI side of the equation. If you look at the results between our energy complex versus their energy complex, I think ICE is up about 9% and we're up about 23%, 24% or so. In addition to kind of what we're seeing in the world focusing in on the TI side of the equation, we're also seeing out-performance of our options business. Our TI options, both in volumes and OI is increasing, not what you're seeing on the Brent side of the equation. So when we're actually seeing its volatile, clients tend to move their main products and we're seeing actually Brent participation down relative to TI. So we think that continues to play out and we think that the participation in our markets as we globalize our customer base has been very positive for us out of the story. And plus, if you look back at the trading, 95% of the days, TI trading is outpacing the volumes. They are trading on the ICE, Brent side. So we think that, that will continue. And we think that's a story that's very positive for our franchise as a whole.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had a question on the volume outlook. I mean, I know it's short term, but if we look at the current trends, things are weak and this is more broadly for the industry even year-over-year. I just wanted to get a sense, when you -- there's some chatter on the FCMs, given the Basel rules that there's some pressure on that part of the business, but there's still a debate going on. So what's the outlook there? And then on the flip side, you guys do a good job in terms of giving us the stats in terms of the new users and the penetration in the OTC market or users coming over to the futures market. But when you think about that opportunity set for CME, like, how far along are you in talking to those customers or bringing them on-board? Because, obviously, like Europe's not on-board, but you're seeing a shift earlier than I think a lot of people would have expected. So just trying to get a sense of what that kind of runway looks like.","Phupinder S. Gill","Sure. This is Gill. I'll start and I'll ask both Sean and Derek to try and chime in here in their respective areas. I think this is one of the principal advantages you'll have when you have an exchange that has 6 asset classes, all of which that have benchmarks. So if one's down, the other one will pick itself up. There are a variety of fundamental reasons for the performance of both the rate side and the energy side. Derek touched on a few of them, but the marketplace that we have allows our clientele to basically hedge their risk and their exposures as they see fit. So you saw a lull in volume over the last week. But yesterday, late in the morning or early in the afternoon, there was more news from the Fed, and that led to a $16 million-odd day for us yesterday. This morning, we're off to good start with $4-plus million on the same lines of uncertainty that leads to hedging activity on our side. So the long-fund payroll numbers that come out tomorrow will be interesting for us to see. But what we're seeing here is exactly what we have talked about over the last few years, where the nature of the business is such that when there is uncertainty around when the Fed would take action and what kind of action they will take, our products will react as -- such as you saw yesterday, and you've seen for many days in the first quarter. Derek or Sean, anything to add?","Sean Tully","Yes. I think -- this is Sean. We continue to see progress on the OTC side, both in terms of increasing number of clients, increasing volumes, increasing market share and as well the futurization. So on the futurization, Gill mentioned earlier, that we had, in the fourth quarter, record penetration of cash treasury market at 75%, and in April we saw 77%. So we continue to see progress on that front. In addition to that, another interesting statistic is we've seen a very big increase in a number of participants taking advantage of portfolio margining. And with the portfolio margining, we saw a doubling actually of the number of clients in Q1 using the portfolio margining versus a year ago, now running 43 clients being facilitated by 11 FCMs. An interesting front is not just having new participants enter our futures and options market with the big growth we've talked about before that we've had over the last couple of years in large, open-interest holders, but in addition to that we see that the participants who are trading both in our futures and swaps and who are taking advantage of portfolio margining, their growth rates in our futures complex runs about double that of other participants. So we're seeing an increasing number of participants in the futures as well as higher trading volumes by those folks taking advantage of our margin and capital efficiency. John?","John W. Pietrowicz","It's worth noting that our ADV is down 8%, which is less than other exchanges. If you recall, there is a Good Friday this month so our actual total volume's only down 4%. And assuming current RPC trends and if you apply that to our volume this quarter -- or this month, I should say, our revenue would be roughly flat.","Phupinder S. Gill","Michael, you used your one question per person quite effectively. I think you asked 3 or 4 things. And one of the questions you had asked was about the FCMs and how they're rationalizing their cost of the business. I think what you're seeing now is they're taking a very hard look across the cleared business and trying to figure out the effect of Basel and other capital charges that are being imposed on them, a rational way to pass these charges through. And I think one of the large banks recently announced a 75-basis-point charge on the collateral, that's being passed through to them as a way to offset some of these capital charges that they have. Now this emphasizes even more what Sean just talked about, which is portfolio margining. The more efficient a portfolio is, the less collateral that is required. The less collateral that we put that as required makes for less expensive proposition for the client base, and by extension, less of a capital charge issue that the banks might have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I could go back to the regulatory issues. They're popping up everywhere with the FCM and their capital and Rich's question earlier. But this is a skin in the game issue because it doesn't seem to going away and now we're starting to hear maybe a few more regulators pop comments into their speeches and whatnot about looking at maybe concentration of risk and whatnot. So if you could maybe give us an update? From what we can see, there's nothing -- no official process right now with respect to changing any of the liquidity or capital requirements on the clearing houses, but if you wouldn't mind updating us on that discussion.","Phupinder S. Gill","Sure, Niamh. I think, the update -- this has been an extremely transparent issue that has been out in the press. So the update is, what you're reading in the press, there is a lot of call for skin in the game. And I think the education process began a few weeks ago, when we issued the white paper on who brings the risk to the table, who manages that risk, who has the skin in the game, where exactly is that skin in the game, what should change, why should it change, and what market conditions are driving the current skin in the game with respect to the guarantee fund. And if those market conditions occur and those eventualities occur, what are the things that regulators should be concerned about? Skin in the game would be one of them, but I would bet you it would be 100 on a long list of things you have to deal with because the whole argument behind the guarantee fund and being a SEDCO, a nearly defined SEDCO, we are systemically important and our requirements changed dramatically a few years ago from a cover 1 standard to a cover 2. So right now, we are talking about additional skin in the game for a smaller amount of skin in the game, when the largest 2 counterparties in the world have failed. That's amazing given some massive moves in the markets across the successive classes that we have. So it's an interesting debate, and we will continue to educate anybody that wants to be educated about this. And I think that the issues will play themselves out throughout the course of the year.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","You don't see anything, therefore, changing with respect to the liquidity or the capital requirements?","Phupinder S. Gill","Very hard to say here, Niamh. I don't anticipate change, but it's very hard to say.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just continuing on the line of the swap to futures trajectory, and thanks very much for the additional analysis on that. But do you have any sense of -- or is there any way to potentially calculate what portion of either the ADV or open interest in your interest rate futures complex is coming from former swap user, so we can sort of get an idea of the trajectory there? And then, just on Slide 20, on the options usage similar type of question in terms of what do you think the multiplier effect is from when options or trading becomes electronified in terms of stimulating futures volumes?","Sean Tully","So in terms of the moving OTC participants over into our futures, we've given a number of metrics. We don't have, on the business side, complete clarity into each and every account, and there is a Chinese wall. So the metrics that we've given, I think we have a very strong indication that we're seeing a number of things. We're seeing an increasing number of participants in our futures market that we believe are driven by our OTC sales activities. In addition to that those folks that are taking advantage of the portfolio margin, which we can't look through to, their growth rates in our futures complex is running around double that of the folks that are otherwise. So we continue to see increasing penetration of that. And the other thing I would say is I think that, that runway continues to be very large. If I can give you an example, the most popular trading strategy in U.S. dollar interest rate swap space is something called a swap spread. While there is no publicly available information on that particular trade, we believe that particular trade probably runs on the order $80 billion a day or on the order of 800,000 contracts a day in our treasury futures equivalent. At the moment, our EFRs in invoice spreads -- so kind of the equivalent in interest rate futures plus cleared interest rate swaps space relative to that swap spread market remains a small fraction of the swap spread market. We're running on the order of 60,000, 65,000 a day in our invoice spreads. So we continue to see a very large runway relative to that opportunity.","Derek Sammann","And this is Derek on the option side. A couple of things: you've heard us point to the areas in which we're making investment to grow participation in our options markets, investing in functionality to accommodate some more complex spreads, increasing our sales, marketing and education and analytics tools, we're putting out there to bring more people to our market. To answer your question, the reason that we feel so strong that the investments and options drives our core is that for every options that trade, we think there is roughly between 2 and 2.5 futures the trade related to that option, traditionally, because there are a number of participants that come in the trade-offs in delta neutral. They will hedge their position in options with our futures and then dynamically reestablish and maintain those hedges and change them as price action goes on. Secondly, we are unique in that -- in every major asset class that Gill referenced. We have a referenced benchmark options business associated with that asset class. So we are bringing both the futures and options together, so we're dynamically bringing key participants to our markets. And finally, the growth in electronification, as you've seen in the futures story, continues to spot an increase of velocity with trading, both in options and our futures. So you've seen these breakdowns in the deck. Despite the fact that we're about 49% to 50% electronic, if you go inside these figures each one, you'll see that the treasury options on the following slide is close to 65% electronic. Inside the energies business, you'll see our Brent options is close to 70% electronic. And nat gas, which is in a different market structure state right now, is probably close to 5% or 10% electronic. So these investments we're making are both bringing new participants to us, creating a unique value proposition for the future and the option to hedge in the same clearing house for significant margin efficiencies, and the electronification trends has been a virtuous cycle of increased participation both on the futures and options side.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's really helpful. And the 2 to 2.5 is for the whole complex or just for the rates of spread?","Derek Sammann","That's across the entire complex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Just wanted to talk a little bit about expenses. If we analyze the first quarter run rate, it comes in at about 3% below last year's levels and you guys have been guiding to flat. And given the strength in the revenue side, I was a little bit surprised on the bonus accrual for the quarter and also curious on marketing and other. So I guess, if you could talk about kind of the expense outlook, maybe what flexibility you have if current volume trends for April, which I know it's only one month, but if they continue, what are the flexibility you may have on the expense side going forward?","John W. Pietrowicz","Sure, Chris, this is John. We are very happy with the Q1 results on expenses. We have really been focused on driving margin expansion and expense discipline in key areas that don't impact growth are a focus of ours. As it relates to kind of the back half of the year just in terms of expenses, we anticipate both depreciation and marketing coming in a little bit heavier towards the back half of the year, and so that's something that we're keeping our eye on. In terms of the impact on volumes and if volumes decrease, what you could do on the expense side, again, we would take a look at being very selective in our hiring. Obviously, the variable cost, both on the bonus side and on the license fee side, would come. And then, we will also take a look at any other kind of discretionary expenses and keep those in check. Just in terms of the guidance, we'll look forward to talking a little bit more about that in the second quarter as we get another quarter under our belt here.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division","And just -- I mean, just quickly on the bonus, I mean the target was $70 million annualized this quarter to $67.6 million even with strong revenues. I mean, any color on that?","John W. Pietrowicz","No. I mean, I think the key thing is the bonus level is based on -- based not only on performance, but also on the number of participants in the bonus pool. And as you saw, we're down 15 people since year-end, and down 90 versus last year. So we are being extremely selective in our go-forward hiring, which will impact the bonus level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I came in late, so hopefully this wasn't asked. I wanted to talk a little bit about structural pressures in the business. It seems like over the last few years, that question has come up off and on, how capital changes and Dodd-Frank and things like that will impact the business? And it seems like we haven't seen much, but more recently, I think the noise has gotten much bigger in terms of the big banks talking about having to raise clearing fees to make RE, prime brokers costs are going up, some FCMs are exiting the business, and some companies are even firing clients because they're not profitable anymore. So I know, to some degree, this probably helps you in terms of futurization and things like that, but I'm wondering to what degree it is actually impacting your business, how and if? Because some of your peers are starting to acknowledge it so we would love to hear your comments?","Phupinder S. Gill","Yes, Alex. This is Gill. I think to your point, a lot of that turmoil that you are seeing in the marketplace is specific to OTC futures -- to OTC swaps and not futures, excuse me. So -- and as you said, it, on the one hand, helps the futures marketplace, but on the other hand, where the futures marketplace is truly complementary. It may have the potential to actually hurt. Our viewpoint, though, as we have developed futures contract with more and more flexibility built into them such as the swap deliverable futures that we rolled out, the differences are becoming less and less. And so the help to futures will continue on. I think that will be a net positive for us. The issue that the banks and the others that are providing services are facing right now is the initial mispricing of the business. It's how I would say it. And I think this is one of the things that no one knew where the pain points were going to be. Capital increases were not taken into account. I think on the net, when you take these things into account, what's emerging now is a rationalization of the true cost of clearing OTC which cannot be ignored. And so those banks that have decided to get out of the business, I think it's specific to the OTC side. And so that's on the one hand, concentrates, which will be a concern that we should have. The concern that we have here, the exchange is a concentration risk where OTC is being cleared in the hands of very few folks. And the regulator should be concerned about that, too, which leads them to higher capital charges, less participation, which was not what Dodd-Frank had intended, which is a broader participation in the marketplace. So on the whole to sum up what I'm saying, and John has a few things to add here is it helps the futures marketplace. It allows us to innovate more and create more flexible futures contract that meet those marketplace needs without the expense associated with it. And the regulators would still have to start to look at the concentration issues that come about, and this leads them to the guarantee fund issues and all those other fun things. John?","John W. Pietrowicz","Thanks, Gill. I'll just -- Alex, a couple of quick points to expand on what Gill is saying. As you're aware, the -- as customers come to the futures markets because they get better capital efficiencies, we have an opportunity to monetize the amount of collateral that they put up into our clearing house because they're able to generate value by putting their positions on in our markets. So as you look at our balance sheet, you'd see that our cash and performance bonds have increased from about $40 billion to about $45 billion. We were able to monetize that in 3 different ways: one, through IEF fees; second, through earning money on the cash float; and we've also implemented a new custody fee. So we were able to charge about $8.6 million net in Q1, which is up from net $7.2 million in Q4 for an increase of about 20%, and that's just another way we're able to help our customers get better capital treatment and then also to CME to benefit as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Another one bigger picture question, I guess. We're starting to hear more and more about this kind of switching from futures to ETFs. BlackRock was pretty adamant about it recently attributing some of the growth in their ETF product to folks switching from futures to ETFs. Do you see that on your end at all? And I know there have been a couple of studies in the past which are somewhat outdated now in terms of the benefits of ETFs versus futures and the other way around. So maybe just kind of updated thoughts on that front and whether any of the capital requirements at the banks are partially the driver for the switch?","Phupinder S. Gill","Alex, this is Gill. I'll start and I'll ask Sean to tell a bit about it. It's very important to stick to the facts here in terms of the total cost of ownership. There was an interesting article, that I alluded to a short while ago that's on our site. And this is actually a continuation of what was done by some Goldman Sachs analysts and JPMorgan analysts, some years back comparing the efficiency of ETFs to -- in [ph] futures, for example. So Sean, do you want to talk about the findings?","Sean Tully","We published the paper now a couple of months ago. It is available on our website, that looks at the costs of ETFs relative to representing a risk versus the cost of using our futures complex. And all of the data is in there, the calculations are very, very clear. Without any question, under nearly every scenario, depending upon the type of user as well as the length of time that the user uses the products. So it's also about the strategy whether you're going long or short. Under nearly every scenario, our futures are the lower-cost alternative relative to ETFs. And we have found that very much resonating with the marketplace. In terms of liquidity, our futures complex is far, far larger, far more liquid than the ETF market. And if you look at our S&P futures for example, we tend to trade on the order of 7x the notional volume of the equivalent ETFs. So we are getting our message out there relative to the lower cost alternative, which is the futures complex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christian Bolu","So just on portfolio margining, you spoke quite a bit about the benefits of that product. I believe LCH recently launched its own version of portfolio margining. So that offering might likely be just part of the course going forward in the industry. Curious as to how you think your offering is superior? And if you think your offering will have any impact at all on your penetration in that business?","Phupinder S. Gill","Sure, Christian, I'll be very happy to answer that. Portfolio margining announcing it, but not having anything to spread against is going to be an issue. So at CME, we've got our swaps portfolio, that is portfolio margined against our Eurodollars and treasuries, that leads to the 85% number that I have. The LCH -- I think they had the LIBOR and they don't have it anymore, it's an ICE. So the swaps that they are taking in has to be offset against something. And I'm not sure what that something is for LCH at this point. So I think that's about it. I hope I answered the question that you have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.","Robert Rutschow - CLSA Limited, Research Division","So in the past, you've provided the breakdown of activity by client type. I'm wondering if you might be willing to provide us with an update on that metric? And specifically, I'm interested in the amount of activity you generate from firms that have a bank charter. And whether the decline that we've seen in the notional amount of derivatives they have on the balance sheet that's mirrored to the client in the futures for that client base?","Phupinder S. Gill","Rob, I don't think we have provided this.","Unknown Executive","Not since Q1 '10.","John W. Pietrowicz","Yes. And the last time we provided it, Rob, was in 2010 and we think it's about the same. And banks are about less than 10% of the revenue.","Sean Tully","This is Sean. I'll jump in for a second as well. For the banks, the supplemental leverage ratio is usually important. So things like our coupon blending service, which allows the banks to represent the same portfolio with a much, much lower notional outstanding, allows them to continue to trade similar volumes to the volumes they have in the past, but it would show up as a much lower balance sheet item helping them with their Basel III concern. So as we said earlier, we've assisted in coupon blending over 100 -- the reduction of over 100,000 line items over $8 trillion in notional, yet you've seen we had enormous growth in our OTC average daily volumes, which drive our fees in the first quarter.","Derek Sammann","And I would just add to the color in terms of where we're seeing the growth across the various client segments. I mean, if you look across the asset classes, the trend for the growth has been positively noted amongst our proprietary firms, our hedge fund, the asset manager community. And something interesting that we were seeing within our international side of the equation is quite an uptake in volume and the activity from the bank sector, both within EMEA as well as Asia Pacific. So we're seeing, again, the penetration across all these clients segments in the investments that we're making from that perspective paying off in terms of the outreach in growth across the various segments and across our diverse asset classes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So my question is with NASDAQ announcing that they're going to be launching an energy exchange, what's your level of concern? Because there already seems to be some pretty robust competition between yourselves and ICE. They seem to think there's a market need for a third party. How do guys view the landscape right now?","John W. Pietrowicz","Yes, thanks. Great question. We've -- we take every one of these competitive threats very seriously. We start with the customers, and our focal point, if you heard from us over many of the last quarters' calls has been servicing our customer base, understanding their pain points and addressing that with product capital efficiencies, upper efficiencies, et cetera. We have had no shortage of exchanges come in and try to look at sort of a me-too approach to copying our list of products and our competitor's list of products. What we have found is that unless you're solving a specific customer problem, unless you're creating a solution for a pain point or bottleneck in the operational margin side of the equation, then there's -- it's a -- you've got tough haul. In addition to that, you're seeing a move into an asset class to your point was 2 very robust competitive dynamic market participants already. So what we have found in the feedback from customers is the only value prop we have heard is we're cheaper. Now we've seen that before. We've seen no product differentiation, no technology differentiations, no margin efficiencies. So we're talking to our customers and saying, \"If we're continuing to serve your needs, we will continue to move into new areas of service for you.\" So we take every one of these competitive threats seriously, but we're in the process of solving customer approaches. There is an analog here relative to a scene where NASDAQ went after a similar market, Anilex in Europe, thinking that there was an opportunity to bring together disconnected parts of the market with 2 already entrenched participants, and I think you've seen them really struggle. And there were a lot of stipends put out there to create a significant amount of volume. When those stipends disappeared, the volume disappeared. So this will keep us on our game, no question. We saw those volumes drop from over 100,000 ADV down to about 6,000 or 7,000 ADV. So we know this game. We understand the competitive threat. We take it as a form of flattery that we've got folks coming in thinking we've got fabulous products that they want as well. So we're focused on moving into servicing our clients in new ways. We're moving into new developing markets with new unique solutions like we're doing with our NBP and TTF products in CME Europe and other ways to serve our customer base. So that's -- we are absolutely acutely concerned about it. We've seen this before for the NYPC and other attacks, so we're taking it seriously.","Operator","Our final question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up -- I wanted to ask you on the outlook for market data, I mean, have you -- anything that you've seen so far in the second quarter in terms of maybe reduced screens? Kind of give some color in terms of potential impact that you kind of alluded to in the slide deck?","Bryan T. Durkin","Chris, it's Bryan. I think the methodical approach that we've taken since we eliminated the waiver over the course of the year is having its intended effect. We're pleased with the results that we've seen thus far while we're early into the stages in the context of those users fully absorbing the impact. The trend has been very positive. There's been some shift in terms of pro versus non-pro, but we're monitoring that very closely. And the next quarter will hopefully validate the good work that we've done across the globe in terms of getting our end-users to adapt to the change.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore ISI, Research Division","So the metrics you gave us before, of the 150,000, 1\/3 professional, 2\/3 non, those have been static through April?","Bryan T. Durkin","We haven't seen April yet. That's coming a little later. So it's been fairly consistent through the first couple of months that we looked at, right.","Operator","We do have another final question that came in from Akhil Bhatia with Rosenblatt Securities.","Akhil Bhatia","Just another follow up on the market data. So I appreciate the additional color on the levels moving down from the $98 million you posted this quarter. But last quarter, you talked about an annual level of about $375 million. Can you address if that's still a good level or if we should be moving off of that as well?","Bryan T. Durkin","Yes. I mean, if you look at a look it, it certainly would move higher than the $375 million. Again, as we indicated, we had 50,000 pro screens and 100,000 non-pro screens. And just as a reminder that the 50,000 screens that are pro will double beginning in next year. And also, another key point is that any new participants are going to be charged at $85.","Operator","This time, I'm showing no further questions.","Phupinder S.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mr. John Peschier. Sir, you may begin.","John C. Peschier","Thank you. And thank you, all, for joining us this afternoon. Gill and Jamie will spend a few minutes outlining the highlights for the fourth quarter, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. Terry, Bryan and Derek are on the call as well and will participate in the Q&A session.","Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language.

Gill","Thank you, John, and thank you, everybody, for joining us this afternoon. I'm going to highlight CME Group's 2012 major efforts, and then share some thoughts about this year. Afterwards, Jamie will review our Q4 financial results.","Despite facing a low volatility and difficult environment in 2012, we made significant progress across several key areas as we are embracing the changing regulatory and global landscape. Looking forward to 2013, we remain cautiously optimistic about the trading environment relative to last year. Based on what we have been working on, we feel we are very well positioned to benefit most when we come out of this challenging cycle. We experienced improved activity in December 2012 and January of this year in comparison to what we saw during much of 2012.","Average daily volume in December was up 1% year-over-year, with an increase in many asset classes. January average daily volume was 11.4 million, a nice jump from the 10.5 million contracts for daily average during the second half of last year. In addition, open interest is up 13% since the end of the year and is currently above 79 million contracts.","Turning to interest rates. The last 2 months were each up versus the prior year. January average daily volume was more than 5.3 million contracts per day, the highest volume levels since June of last year, and up 24% from the 4.3 million average during the second half of last year. The short end of the interest rate curve is still hindered by the 0 interest rate policy, which has negatively impacted Eurodollar activity.","On a positive note, our Fed Funds Futures product is currently indicating a rate increase during Q4 of 2014, which has moved up from mid-2015. At the long end of the curve, our treasury products are performing well, with January 2013 average daily volume up 30% versus the same period last year.","On February 1, we traded a record number of treasury options approaching 1.2 million contracts, with more than half of that volume on CME Globex. Clearly, market participants are watching economic data very closely with the yield on the 10-year rising above 2% recently.","Longer-term catalysts for our interest rate products include the OTC mandate beginning in March, driving more revenue in swap clearing, as well as increased activity in our futures products, the continued resolution of regulatory uncertainty and improved confidence about the economy. In light of these catalysts, we are building our interest rate product suite and our focus remains on driving activity out the curve, examining new interest rate products and building our OTC swap business, which could potentially drive greater use of our core futures and options product.","Moving on to OTC. We have seen a ramp-up in activity leading to the CFTC clearing mandate, with Phase 1 step to begin in March. So far, over 60 institutions have cleared trades at CME, comprising a wide array of market participants, including asset managers, hedge funds, insurance companies, GSEs and proprietary trading firms. Since the launch, we have cleared $1.6 trillion, and open interest is above $850 billion. 2013 is off to a good start, with many new customers on-boarding and clearing their first trades and many existing customers increasing their activity.","January 2013 average daily notional was over $12 billion, and this compares to $6 billion in the fourth quarter and $4 billion in the third quarter of last year. We also added 8 additional clearing members in 2012, bringing our total to 23.","Overall, there are 3 ways for us to help customers navigate the regulatory changes: cleared swaps; existing rate futures contracts; and the new innovative products that we are currently developing and have developed. And we're executing on all these fronts.","We now clear the 7 major interest rate swap currencies that account for 95% of the market, 51 CDS indices and the 12 most active emerging markets' NDS. In addition, we received regulatory approval to implement portfolio margining for all market participants. Initial results are promising as these participants have seen significant risk offsets that account for margin savings of over $1 billion.","Looking forward, we expect to grow the list of cleared OTC products, as well as launch interest rate swap clearing out of our European clearing house in Q1, well ahead of the mandate there. We also had a successful deliverable swap futures product launch in December with very strong buy and sell side support. There is significant interest in this innovative product and it's off to a great start with approximately 65,000 contracts traded to date, representing $6.5 billion in notional value, and the current open interest lies above 12,000 contracts, which represents about $1.1 billion in notional value.","Although we have had nice volume following the launch, many potential clients are focused on the first roll in March and the upcoming clearing mandates in March and June, which will focus more attention on the benefits of this product compared to the alternatives.","In addition, we received CFTC approval for our swaps. They are a repository for credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, commodities and FX asset classes. Our SDR will offer customers the ability to optimize their existing connections to CME Clearing for automated SDR reporting, which will facilitate straight-through processing, providing further value to our clients. We are excited about this as a natural extension of the clearing and processing services we offer to both sell and buy side clients, providing a compliant, efficient and low cost way for market participants to access an SDR.","Turning to FX. January 2013 average daily volume was up 21% versus the prior year. We are seeing particular strength in the yen and British pound contracts, up 160% and 41%, respectively. FX options continue to be particularly strong, with quarter 4 ADV up 17% versus the prior year and up 56% in January compared to last year. We also hit multiple open interest records for the Japanese yen last week.","In terms of open interest, we experienced record levels of FX open interest ending 2012, up 15% compared to the end of 2011. In addition, FX products hit a new all-time high of large open interest holders in December of 890, which is up from 860 in September, indicating that more customers are holding increasing amounts of FX risk at CME Group.","Average daily volume in our FX business in December 2012 surpassed the volumes of all the OTC FX platforms for the second time in 6 months. This speaks to both success in building and diversifying our participant base, as well as the FX markets, increasing adoption of exchange-traded and cleared products in the form of CME FX futures and options. We also continue to see improvements and new opportunities within our energy complex.","On January 11, the Seaway pipeline increased capacity to 400,000 barrels per day from 150,000 barrels per day, and we saw a tightening of the WTI-Brent spread and look forward to further tightening in the future as more WTI reaches market. In addition, since the 11th, we have seen more volume traded in CME's WTI futures than our competitors' Brent contract.","Looking forward, the significant increases projected in U.S. production could lead to more hedging based on TI and lower imports, which are typically linked to Brent. We believe there will be 3 global crude benchmarks going forward: our WTI, Brent, and the DME Oman contracts. We intend to be successful in all 3. Although it is still early in development, we have recently hit record volume levels in our Brent and DME contracts, and open interest in Brent continues to grow.","Also, DME Oman is going to be included in a new U.S.-based commodities fund, the United States Asian Commodities Basket Fund, which will give investors exposure to Asia's rapidly growing demand for raw materials. This inclusion recognizes the critical benchmarking role DME is playing in the expansion of the East of Suez markets, providing transparent price discovery and reflecting the economics of the Asian region like no other crude oil futures contract. We are making a very concerted effort to meet the hedging needs of our global client base and expand our market share in 2013 and beyond.","Shifting to our globalization efforts. We accomplished a lot in 2012 and look to build on that momentum this year. In 2012, we continued to ramp up our sales and marketing efforts on a global basis, and we have launched a number of regionally specific products, including Black Sea Wheat and Chinese steel rebar swap futures, which are directed towards meeting unique risk management needs in particular geographies.","We also continued to expand our global footprint and applied to the Financial Services Authority, or FSA, to register a London-based derivative exchange, CME Europe, which we anticipate launching in mid-2013. In addition, during 2012, we strengthened our international partnerships, including implementing our cross-listing and cross-licensing arrangement with BM&FBOVESPA and increasing our stake in the Dubai Mercantile Exchange to help build the new benchmark for crude oil in the East of Suez that I referenced a short while ago.","Lastly, we advanced our efforts in India and China, including helping to facilitate operational readiness of several Chinese FCMs to trade our products and recently launching Indian rupee futures.","In addition to our globalization efforts, we continue to enhance and further diversify our core. We completed the acquisition of the Kansas City Board of Trade, and our integration is progressing well since closing the transaction at the end of November.","The hard red winter wheat ADV was up 25% in December versus a year ago and the implied inter-exchange wheat futures spread become available on CME Globex on December 10.","Our customers will realize further efficiencies as we complete the largest 2 milestones of the integration in the coming year.","In mid-April, we will consolidate clearing services under CME Clearing, and we plan to transition all floor trading to Chicago beginning on July 1, subject to the review of the CFTC. Additionally, in 2012, we launched the next generation of CME Globex, reducing order entry and market data latency variability, along with increasing capacity and cost efficiency. We also launched CME Direct technology for online trading at both exchange-traded and the OTC markets.","In addition, we closed our joint venture with McGraw-Hill, securing the long-term exclusive license on S&P futures and OTC swaps. And finally, we launched our co-location business to create a valuable new revenue stream and had a successful first year.","In summary, we remain extremely focused on future opportunities while investing in the right places and maintaining financial discipline to reward our shareholders. We have a lot to be proud of as a company but a lot of important work still needs to be done. 2013 is going to be a busy year for us, given all that we have planned as we position the firm for future growth. We have prepared for what lies ahead of us, and we look forward to continuing to build upon our world-class businesses.","Now I will turn the call over to Jamie to discuss the financials.","James E. Parisi","Thank you, Gill, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'm going to review the results of the quarter and provide you with details around how we are positioning ourselves for 2013 and beyond. So jumping right in, excluding the tax entries mentioned in the release, our earnings per share would have been $0.63.","Turning to revenue. The rate per contract for the fourth quarter was $0.831, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2011 and up 1% sequentially. Compared to last quarter, a larger percentage of the business was from nonmembers, and we saw lower volume discounts and incentives, which are correlated with volume. Within the market data line, we saw a sequential drop of $3.5 million related to a reduction in screen counts due to an intensified focus on headcount and cost reduction in the financial services industry as we closed the year.","Total fourth quarter operating expense was $285 million. It's important to note that in the fourth quarter, we reclassified 2012 clearing house bank facility fees of $8.6 million from other operating expense to interest expense in the nonoperating section of the income statement. Otherwise, expenses would have been $294 million. Breaking down operating expenses in more detail, starting with compensation and benefits, this line item was $113 million, down from $118 million last quarter. This was due to a $1.4 million sequential benefit from lower deferred compensation expense and favorable vacation accruals and severance costs.","Our bonus was $12 million for the quarter, similar to the prior quarter. Our annual bonus in 2012 was down approximately 25% versus 2011.","Our headcount ended the year at 2,566, basically flat for the year, with small net hiring at our technology center in North Ireland -- Northern Ireland, which results in lower overall expense due to less reliance on outside consultants.","Turning to non-compensation expense. The main items that increased sequentially were marketing as we projected last quarter and technology support services, driven by greater annual maintenance costs. Many of the other items came in favorably relative to our expectation from last quarter's call.","Turning to nonoperating income. We received $6 million in dividends from our various investments, down from $10 million last quarter. Interest expense jumped to $44 million, driven by the re-class of the credit facilities cost I already mentioned and by a full quarter of interest expense related to the $750 million note issued in September 2012.","Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $42 million in the fourth quarter and $140 million for the full year, down over 10% from the prior year. The pro forma tax rate was 40.1% in the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet. We had $1.7 billion of cash and marketable securities at the end of December. Despite the headwinds throughout the year, we continued to generate significant cash, returning more than $1.2 billion to our shareholders in 2012. Our dividend yields for 2012 approached 7%, or 4.5%, if you exclude the accelerated variable fifth dividend paid in December. We have received positive feedback on our novel dividend policy and will continue to consider and payout a fifth dividend for each year.","Let me now turn to guidance for 2013. First, on revenue, starting with the access and communication fees line, at the end of 2012, our co-location customers had an opportunity to modify their infrastructure footprint upon renewal of their contracts. As this was their first opportunity to do so since the initial commitments they made in late 2010, many customers took the opportunity to adjust, reflecting current business needs. While the number of customers has remained fairly consistent, we expect a reduction of about $3 million per quarter in 2013 within this expense line, driven by both co-location and other access fees.","Turning to expense. For 2013, we expect approximately $1.25 billion of expenses for the year based on our assumption of top line growth. In addition to normal inflation, there are 3 primary areas to point to, including bonus expense, investment in growth initiatives leading to higher staffing and a new marketing campaign.","In 2013, as we do every year, we are resetting our bonus estimate to the target level of approximately $68 million. Remember, bonus expense had seen a significant pullback in 2012 based on lower-than-expected cash earnings. Each year, we reset the cash earnings target to reflect current and projected market conditions and business goals.","After remaining relatively flat over the last 12 to 18 months in terms of headcount, we expect to resume hiring in 2013, including additional technology employees in Northern Ireland, additional staffing of our European exchange and clearing house and some new positions related to regulatory compliance efforts in clearing and market regulation.","The other driver of the expense increase is a branding in advertising campaign to rebuild confidence in the derivatives market. The incremental marketing cost for this campaign is approximately $10 million in 2013. Our expense projection assumes cash earnings growth in 2013. Should 2013 cash earnings come in flat versus 2012, we would project expenses to be approximately $1.23 billion.","For interest expense, we are projecting $39 million per quarter, which includes the costs associated with the increase and the size of both our corporate and clearing house credit facilities. Interest expense will decrease once our debt maturing in August is retired but may go back up temporarily if we decide to prefund the debt maturing in February of 2014.","In terms of tax rate, we expect between 38% and 39% in 2013, down from the prior year due to the full year impact of the Illinois State apportionment change and other tax efficiencies.","Lastly, in terms of capital expenditures, in 2013, we expect CapEx to be approximately $140 million to $150 million, the same guidance we had going into this year.","In summary, we continue to focus on investing for the future. In particular, we want to position ourselves to fully take advantage of the changing regulatory and competitive landscape. As always, we remain intensely focused on generating and returning excess capital to our shareholders while also investing in our future.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","[Technical Difficulty]","We'll go ahead with the next question, and that's from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So there's this contentious issue, I guess, being debated currently on how the SDRs are going to handle swaps data. And you've applied to the CFTC to allow you basically to automatically report all the CME cleared swaps automatically to your SDR, but I guess competitors are kind of fighting hard against that. So maybe you can just run through exactly what you're hoping to achieve with respect to the swap data, how you might potentially monetize that data and kind how you think the CFTC is looking at the issue?","Phupinder S. Gill","Ms. Miller, this is Gill. I'll take a shot at it. I'm sure there will be a lot of folks who want to talk. But I think, ultimately, the idea behind us applying for approval of this rule was to make it as efficient as possible for our clients if they're going to clear a swap at CME, to not do any more work than they have to, and we report it directly to our own SDR. And like I said a short while ago, it's straight-through processing at its best. And in terms of monetizing the venture, that was not a priority for us. When we launched, operational efficiency was the main goal behind what we were doing.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So is that data something that you would charge for? Or is it something that you would just be collecting, reporting to a central facility and you wouldn't be directly keeping the market data from it?","Phupinder S. Gill","No, we are going to keep the official record of the swap that we clear and we have announced that we will not charge, at least for a while.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, got it. And then I guess moving on to another topic that's also kind of regulatory. It sounds like some of the commissioners are considering whether the block levels that you guys have set for energy futures might be too low. And I know that like virtually 100% of the ClearPort business is transacted off exchange in block transactions? So I just wanted to get an idea for what type of impact a larger block size would have on that business. Like if you could tell us what portion of your trades are coming from the smaller end of the block spectrum, anything that could help us kind of quantify the potential revenue that would be at risk if block thresholds were moved higher?","Terrence A. Duffy","It's Terry Duffy. I'll start for a second. As you know, we transitioned our ESF business on ClearPort to the smaller blocks in a very short period of time at the end of last year because of the CFTC mandate. While we did that, we had a few issues with CFTC because they were supposed to address the swaps -- the SEF rules before they were even supposed to get to these ESF rules, which they didn't. They went out in reverse order and kind of caught us a little off the curve, and our customers. So at the same time, now that we've transitioned to these smaller blocks, we have been working with the commission on a day-to-day basis to say that we need -- the market needs time to adjust and adapt to these new smaller block thresholds versus an ESF system. And for them to go and adjust block thresholds in the very near future could cause just as much harm as if they were not to give us the extents at the end of last year. So I do believe that the commission understands that and they don't want to be disruptive to the overall marketplace, and they will give us more time for -- to evaluate what the appropriate thresholds are for these block -- for these products. Again, I think we're talking about a handful of these products that are the majority of the revenue, so I don't think we're going to have any impact as it relates to that even if the blocks were changed.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Yes, I'll try again. Anyway, my question is, Gill, you mentioned that the OTC clearing is doubled literally quarter-over-quarter. But really, it jumped December from -- to January, double. So can you give us color, is there any certain clients or what's -- I'm sure in anticipation of March, but the reason that it just doubled from December to January -- in December, it was pretty much even that whole quarter.","Phupinder S. Gill","Rich, I'll start, and I'll ask Bryan and Derek to join in here. This is one of the major focus areas for us. And what we have been seeing in the last quarter that has continued on through this last month has been an on-boarding of both clearing members, as well as accounts, as more and more accounts are testing and more and more accounts are putting positions on live for us. And so I think the mandate, the March 11 mandate, has been taken very seriously by everyone. And they are preparing for not just the March mandate, but the bigger push of clients coming into us will occur in June, and we are seeing a healthy mix of both of those sets of clients that are coming into us now.","Bryan T. Durkin","Yes, I was just going to add -- it's Bryan. I was going to add to that point that as the March time line comes up, it affects more so hedge funds. But we are seeing a nice mix across asset managers, hedge funds, insurance companies, GSEs, proprietary trading firms, that have either come in clear trades or are well into the testing module. And so that adds to, I think, the significant pickup that we've seen this past month.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And just one follow-up on OTC as well. I guess, initially, I think at least, Terry, you were more conservative about the clearing opportunity. But as we get closer to the mandate, the March mandate, and the phase-in period. I guess, are we -- can you give us any view on what you think the revenue opportunity is, especially with futurization and especially without the SEF rules and the clearing mandate still looking like it's going to go through?","Terrence A. Duffy","I'll start, and I'll let Jamie take over more on the revenue side. But I think from -- when we first put together our clearing offering for OTC, we did it for a whole host of different reasons. So obviously, to offer services that needed to be offered because of the new law, but also to help bolster and continually build on our existing core model, which is our futures trading, Rich. So I do think when we put this into place, it wasn't just for the revenue that we could derive from it, it was more to enhance our core business and offer the services that our clients would need. So I could let Jamie address the revenue, but I think we've addressed that in prior calls, what the cost of it is going to be to clear per million.","Phupinder S. Gill","If I can just add before Jamie talks about the financial. I think we are the only exchange that has the value proposition for the capital efficiencies across all these asset classes that we have. I mentioned a short while ago that the cross margin savings that we have seen this very early stage has exceeded $1 billion up to this point in time. And so I think some of our client base is taking advantage of those capital efficiencies. It is the most capital-efficient solution anywhere out there among any of the exchanges or clearing houses that are providing this service.","James E. Parisi","Rich, it's Jamie. Just from the financial perspective, remember that a good chunk of the expenses associated with us being able to perform this OTC clearing are already embedded in our expense base. So going forward, the revenue coming in is on the margin -- high margin revenue. And then the other thing to remember is it's very early in the game. Obviously, it's hard to pick out any trends as yet. If you look this past quarter, we generated about $2 million of OTC revenue from the straight swaps and CDS. And that came in at a lower rate than the past quarters because of that incentive program that we've got in place to attract some of those high turnover customers that we weren't necessarily targeting previously, so that's new business as well. So it's too early to give you any other information.","Operator","Your next question comes from Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just on the client side portfolio margining, so is this fully rolled out from your end? Or is it just larger customers? And is that kind of what we're seeing driving that, the volume increase in January?","Phupinder S. Gill","The service itself across margining has been rolled out. The issue at hand that we have is the preparation on the part of the firms that are offering it. So customers want it, customers want to receive it, and they've got several firms in the pipeline that will be in a position to offer full cross margining for their client base in less than a month.","Derek Sammann","Yes, and I think -- this is Derek. Adding to that, I mean, the bulk of the focus right now for the FCMs is just getting the firms connected, getting these guys in place, making sure the flows work across the board. We've had some impact and some uptake so far on the house margin side that Gill mentioned before. We expect that will be coming over the coming months, so we're prepping for it. The FCMs had a lot of work just to onboard the core clients, and then the next focus from thereon will be the cross margining.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And Jamie, when you're talking through the put and takes on the interest expense, I mean, one of the pieces in there is entire credit facility costs tied to the clearing houses. Can you just expand on that and like how much is that and what's being required, just higher credit lines to back...","James E. Parisi","It's actually -- yes, Roger, it's no problem. It's actually -- what we did is we renewed our corporate facility this year and extended that out, and we also renewed the clearing house facility, which is a 364-day facility. In terms of the clearing house facility, we increased the amount of it from a $3 billion facility to a $5 billion facility. That was really to enable us to accommodate the potential for more and more collateral coming in, in the OTC -- in our OTC offering so we can provide liquidity in those cases where there's an issue in the clearing house, although we've never had to tap into these lines. And on the corporate side, we increased our line from roughly $1 billion to roughly $1.750 billion. Again, that was driven a lot by regulatory requirements and making sure that we had the requisite liquidity available to meet those requirements. So it was the increases in the amounts of the line that's really driving the increase year-over-year.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I mean, did the CFTC push for the higher limit on the clearing house?","James E. Parisi","No. It's just a -- it's just, it's a risk management decision made by our clearing house.","Phupinder S. Gill","Driven by needs, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just I guess coming back to the guidance. Jamie, maybe you can flesh out the comment on the co-location a little bit more. And I think you said the users are basically unchanged in terms of the magnitude of the users, but they're revisiting their footprints. So is this more guys looking at this and saying, \"Okay, we thought this business will be bigger and maybe we don't as much capacity because there's just not enough volume?\" Or is that people exiting the business altogether, new players coming in? Maybe just a little bit more color.","James E. Parisi","Yes, it's really driven by the existing footprint of participant's shrinking, in some cases, their individual footprints. Because remember, co-location was new for them, new for us a year ago. So I think people were being probably a little bit conservative in terms of the amount of space they wanted to take to make sure that they were covered for the coming year. And then obviously, last year wasn't the best of all years in terms of volumes and whatnot so I'm as people have pulled back a little bit. But in general, I would say that it's the same customer base. And going forward, we're going to look to drive more new customers there obviously. And as the markets recover, we would expect existing customers to grow their footprints back.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, good. And then just maybe ...","James E. Parisi","I just want to clarify that we're not seeing a drop-off in the client base in co-lo.","Phupinder S. Gill","There's a net increase slightly, some small increase in clients.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe just going to the OTC side, too, for a second here. I mean, obviously, pretty early when it comes to the deliverable swap future. But I'm just curious if -- when you talk to clients, like how is the marketing effort actually organized, like given that you -- I think, Gill, you said it yourself, you have 3 different offerings, you got the clearing, you got the existing product and you got the deliverable swap futures. So are you actively educating your clients? Are you working together with the FCMs? Are you saying, \"Hey, this is really the best thing to do?\" Or maybe you should use existing products? Maybe you could just differentiate just a little bit like what fits for whom and what is actually the best thing for you to push, I guess, if you could put it this way?","Phupinder S. Gill","What we do a good job at is to articulate the features of the products that we have, and it's up to the clients themselves to pick the products that they want. And there was an interesting survey conducted by your bank, not too long ago, that actually articulated some of the needs that some of these folks had. So the very large guys who are being serviced by the banks and would probably be able to clear on day 1, they would be focusing on on-boarding their swaps. For some of the client base that may be left out of the first wave of clearing and still have risk management needs, they would probably be the ones that will be attracted to the deliverable swap futures in the first instance. Or there may be clients on both sides that would find an interesting need to cover some of their sub-risk and the deliverable swap futures might actually help, too. So for a variety of reasons, the product appeals to almost the entire client base.","Derek Sammann","And Alex, I'll jumped in there. It's Derek again. To the extent that you asked how we're engaging our clients, we're engaging them from multiple levels. As we walk into clients talking about solutions and customer choice, to Gill's point, we can provide clearing solutions for them. We can offer them our existing deep pools of liquidity, our treasuries and Eurodollar complex. We can offer them now these hybrid solutions with deliverable swap future, and as we find often times that we rarely have a conversation about any one of those things in isolation. As soon as you talk about clearing, we say, \"Well, if that doesn't suit you because that's a complex set of events that need to happen in relatively short order, let us tell you about the operational or capital efficiencies of our futures pool and let us tell you about this new product out there that maybe you've heard something about.\" So we're engaging them directly from our clearing house sales level, our clearing solutions level. We're engaging the clearing firms and their sales forces to educate their clients on the impact of their business, and we're also engaging some of the research folks at some of the banks to provide trading opportunities and just a level of education that get people comfortable with this pretty significant market structure shift that kicks off in March.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jamie, on the expense guidance, I was hoping to better understand your comment that if 2013 cash earnings come in closer to last year, your expenses would be, I think, $1.23 billion. As, I guess, I view your expenses as a component of cash earnings. So could you expand on that or perhaps frame that guidance in a different way in maybe volumes or revenue growth?","James E. Parisi","It's really -- it's very much tied to cash earnings. I'm not going -- I can't put any volume growth on it or revenue. I won't provide that sort of guidance. But the main driver that would push it down from the $1.25 billion to $1.23 billion would be bonus, and license fees, likely, with -- that are very much tied to our volumes.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned a few times that the guidance is predicated upon some recovery in revenue. So I was just hoping you all could maybe walk us through some high-level thoughts on where you're relatively more or less constructive across all the major product complexes you trade and the major customer types who trade all with you.","Derek Sammann","Sure, it's Derek. I'll give you a quick highlight from the financial side. I mean, from the rates perspective, I think you probably saw all the action in our rates markets over the last week, with the pretty significant volumes that we saw going into last week and through nonfarm payrolls on Friday. We saw a couple of records hit, particularly in the treasury options. We saw an overall record in treasury options, which is a record that stood since 2007, just a shade under 1.2 million contracts. And interesting to note there, that about 70% of those -- of that option record was actually in puts, indicating that are starting to be building positions for what might likely be a change in the rates environment there. So very healthy growth over the course of last week. On the Eurodollar side, we've talked about the challenge in the front end of the curve. In the store complex, we've seen a nice build in our open interest since the December expiration in Eurodollar. That's up about 43% through yesterday at about 12.5 million, 13 million contracts, so we're seeing that build nicely. And that really was coming through last week, and that's built relatively quickly. On the FX side, you've heard Gill talk about some pretty significant moves in the FX market. The one area I'd point to there is probably in the yen. I think as folks are probably aware that dollar-yen has been pegged around that JPY 78 to JPY 80 level for about 2 years now with the Central Bank intervening. We've seen that reverse dramatically with some moves by the Japanese government, and the dollar-yen level has gone up to about JPY 90 to the dollar. That is directly linked to our 160% increase in yen volumes and the record level in yen options. So on the financial side, we're seeing sort of global recovery story and some rates expectations moves built into some of the volumes we've seen. Good healthy growth across our client segments, and we've seen open interest in large open interest holders impacted positively as well. So from the financial side, those are some of some the things we're seeing in these last couple of weeks, first few weeks of 2013.","James E. Parisi","And then on the energy side, we're seeing good trends as well in the context of both our crude -- particularly our crude oil complex, and a lot of that is driven by the increasing production that we're seeing in North America. As you're well aware, we talked quite a bit over the past year or so about the infrastructure changes and the investments that are being made in North America. And with the activities of the reversal of the Seaway pipeline and other infrastructure investments that are underway and extending pipelines to the Gulf in addition to the expansion of rail transport to the East Coast, this is increasing the production capabilities, opening up the flows of business and making it waterborne for our crude complex. We are seeing positive trends in the context of the narrowing of the spread and uptake in volume. And if you look at that, over the last course of the last several days, it's weighing in positive for that marketplace. In the context of equities, we feel that the volume and participation trends will get better when the VIX picks up off of its 5-year lows. And we're seeing indicators to that direction, as well as unemployment improving will be good for our rates complex and products overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess on the M&A front, just thinking about what's going on in the industry and the pending ICE NYX transaction, does that change your outlook for M&A? And if -- even if you think about the competitive dynamic, how you might think that might impact you on a longer-term basis?","Phupinder S. Gill","Dan, this is Gill. It doesn't change anything that we have shared with you in the prior months. Our strategy remains the same. The only caveat which I will repeat is that we will, as always, remain opportunistic. But for now, we do not see any large M&A opportunities.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just expanding upon some of the OTC commentary. I guess, how prepared do you think the end customers are for this transition coming? I mean, it seems like you've seen a pickup in volume. Conversations are picking up. I mean, do you expect that ramp to continue into the March date? Or are people, you think, are kind of behind the 8-ball a bit here? Just any color there would be helpful.","Phupinder S. Gill","I'll ask Derek to comment. But because these dates have been widely known and the FCMs have been scrambling, I think they have resorted to choice where they are selecting their clients by waves. And for those clients that do believe that they may not get there in the first wave, there are alternatives that they look for, and that's one of the main drivers behind the development of the deliverable swap future contracts that we put out there. So I think, by and large, the awareness factor among the client base is extremely high. We have never seen a client base as prepared as they are now. Having said both of those things, there's going to be some lag, and how that lag is going to be treated by the clients themselves remains to be seen. They may shift firms. They may shift the product that they trade or they might just get on board.","Derek Sammann","Yes, and this is Derek. I'd echo that. I mean, to the extent that these dates really were kicked off in August last year when we knew that, that started the clock for this March deadline, remembering that the clients are coming into the mandate in category 1, 2, 3 and 4, each of through Q1, Q4 of 2013, what we see is, depending on what numbers you would believe, 15%, 20% of clients right now are already actively clearing, but a significant chunk outside of that are in active preparations based on where they believe they fall into which category. What we have heard definitively is that many of the customers are really following the lead from their dealers, knowing the dealers are the category 1 clearing entities caught on the mandate. So therefore, they're looking for a lot of guidance from not only their dealers and their clearing firms, but from us as well. So we've put a lot of effort into not only supporting the end-user client directly connecting, but also working with our clearing firms to provide the extra resource to them. So we're seeing a significant increase in engagement. We've talked about the pipeline of client clearing firms that have been connected to us, so we're seeing a lot of focus and, I think, a lot of core focus by the clearing firms to cater to all of these firms.","Terrence A. Duffy","Can I just put a little exclamation point -- and it's Terry Duffy. Over the last couple of years, as Dodd-Frank has evolved and working with the -- especially the big banks, they talked about how their operational readiness would take them years to get in -- to be in compliance. As they start to get put out, as Derek put forth, and we have a future meeting with these guys, they say how they can be operationally ready by tomorrow. So the point being is I think that no matter what you're hearing on the street, I think the readiness is a lot higher than what's being advertised.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So first question on your interest rate complex. So we know you guys should get some volume benefit assuming we get higher volatility on the interest rate side. But I guess what we don't know at this point is how much the decline in volumes you've had in this complex are simply due to users really not hedging their risks anymore. I'm wondering if you guys have a sense of that magnitude because really I want to ask you because it might help us visualize maybe what kind of upside there is in the complex, assuming we really start getting interest rates going higher here.","Derek Sammann","Yes, it's a little difficult to answer that one. I wish I had a crystal ball in front of me. I mean, what you've heard us tell you before and the actions you've seen us take have been to invest in products across our curve to build into the parts of the curve where there is volatility and where there is uncertainty. That was our big push into the Ultra Bond to give a very far end of the curve solutions when you found that the long bond was not tracking to its true 30-year risk. And you saw through that, the weekly treasury options, short-term volatility and then the mid-curves and the Eurodollar curve. What we don't know -- and I can't answer the question: How many folks are no longer hedging? What we do know is that issuance and the plans for what we think growth in underlying cash markets are going to be driving a very significant increase in demand for the products we have now. The breadth of our product scope now versus what we had 3 years ago, significantly larger and more diverse. And you add to that the fact that 300,000 of our rates ADV last year came from products we've launched in the last 2 years. More importantly, 12% of our interest rate open interest emanates from those products. It tells you kind of how we're positioned for return of volatility, I think.","Phupinder S. Gill","Hey, Chris, if I could add to what Derek just said. If you look at the products that we offer, right from the short end of the yield curve to the long end, it's safe to assume that many of our clients actually trade along that entire spectrum. And so to the extent that the volatility is very low in the short end, the product development effort that Mr. Sammann talks about that yielded us 300,000 contracts a day last year, and the actual client base itself hasn't shrunk, the things that they trade have shifted around. So they are trading along different parts of the yield curve and as the fundamentals that the fed has pegged -- like the unemployment rate that Bryan talked about a short while ago, should it drop below 7%, you'll start seeing activity across the entire spectrum of the yield curve. So the customers haven't gone away. They have moved on along the curve itself.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then I guess my follow-up question would be on the swaps opportunity. Correct my figures here if they're inaccurate guys, but it seems like LCH is doing a bit more buy side volume than CME at this point. And I know -- look, I know, it's really early days, but I would think your margin offsets might give you an edge here. So can you maybe help to explain this dynamic a little bit?","Phupinder S. Gill","I think I'll ask Derek to talk about it. I don't 100% visibility into what LCH is doing, but I can tell you a couple of things here. We are not sure how LCH would count what is a pure dealer-to-client volume versus what we might traditionally call D to D, when 2 banks deal with each other. On the other hand, I think more than 1\/2 of the volume that they have put in there has been in the so-called OIS swaps, and we'll have that capability in a few short weeks here. And so that would put us back to par. The final point I will make there is the volume that's going through LCH is not translating into a substantial amount of open interest, which tells you there's a lot of high-frequency shops that are doing trading there or trying to offset their longs and shorts there. I think that would be at least a partial explanation as to why you might see some deferring numbers.","Derek Sammann","Yes, I think you are kind of comparing apples to oranges to the extent that you've got different definitions of what constitutes a client, and then the D to C equation there. But I think to the extent that the parity of portfolio clearing service capabilities between LCH and CME is, as Gill mentioned, one thing that we're working on, on those short-dated OIS swaps is a big chunk of that turnover, by definition, very short term. So when we think about what the opportunities, what the value proposition is, the first point of order for most of these guys is getting a curve solution in place and then looking at the capital margin efficiencies. And that's, as you've heard us say and the point of your question, a significant driver of choice over time. So as we look at and are able to grow and expand our open interest and our pools of offsetting liquidity and where customers can clear all 3 of those choices of products, we think we've got a compelling long-term solution for our global client base. Also worth noting that we will be bringing out our interest rate swaps clearing capabilities in Europe this year, and we're very close to doing that as well. So we're talking about globalizing our footprint in the clearing solutions side as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","One more on the OTC clearing business, if I can beat that one to death. So as you're talking to customers and they're deciding where they want to send their volume to be cleared, who is making that decision at the customers? I think I might have asked this last quarter as well, but is it the buy-side guys saying, \"You know what, I get the capital efficiencies that seem eager, but I want to send it there.\" How much of a role is the clearing firm playing and where do you see that going?","Phupinder S. Gill","Mr. Duffy can confirm this, but I think the law requires that the buy side picks where the trade clears.","Terrence A. Duffy","Yes, right.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Are you seeing the sell side exert much influence over that or are they pretty much just kind of leaving it completely up to the buy side?","Phupinder S. Gill","As you might imagine, the sell side, like any other good business, would share their opinions with their clients and it's up to the clients to decide what's in his or her best interest. And at the end of the day, ultimately, the client has, at least now, 23 FCMs to choose from and that number is growing. So it used to be a small number, like 10 or so, and that number has gone up a lot.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, so the CEO of the Japan Exchange Group was talking today about M&A and kind of threw out a few potential partners that he'd be interested in teaming up with or talking with in the future. I guess kind of big picture, how far away do you think we are from consolidation with Asia? I know that, historically, there's been regulatory roadblocks and maybe some other issues have got in the way. Do you think we're getting close to a point where North America and Europe are going to start to team up with Asian exchanges?","Phupinder S. Gill","That's not clear. I think up at the end of the day, Asia, as you know, is made up of a bunch of nationalistic societies, so different countries have different policies that are in place. And so it really depends and kind of really speak to what Saito-san was saying in the -- that you read about in the press. But I think that the -- CME's approach to doing business in Asia since 1984 has been an approach that has worked for us with the link that we put in with the Singapore Exchange. Having extended the relationships that the Korean Exchange, the Bursa Malaysia and, in time to come, others, many of the exchanges in China and the FCM in China entities that CME has a close relationship with. And I think for now, as many of these exchanges are trying to find their feet, it's the best approach for us at this time. And it allows us access to a client base and it allows these exchanges access to our technology, as well as some of the expertise that we may have, that they may need.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, really on the equity business. And you mentioned volatility being down, but cash volumes are up and interest in domestic equity products is up. So how does the positives kind of work its way through either E-mini volumes or standard volumes? And can either of those products work if volatility remains at kind of low current levels?","Phupinder S. Gill","Ken, this is Gill. I think the positive news on the cash side when you saw the net inflow of $3 billion or so that came into the equity market early this year is actually slightly an offset against the amount of money that left last year or, in fact, the last 1.5 years or 2. We are very enthusiastic about the prospects of the products that we have. But the extremely key indicator for volume pickup there is going to be volatility, both on the derivative side, as well as on the cash side. I would call a lot of the activity that has occurred in the last month more positioning than anything else at this time.","Derek Sammann","Yes, the VIX is still close to 5-year lows right now. And if you actually track a little the correlation between volumes and volatility, it's pretty closely knit. It is interesting, we have heard over the last couple of weeks some more calls for potential sector rotation at a fixed income into equities. Certainly, that would be something that we would welcome. We think that would indicate a shift in positive trends for each of us. But we have been following the flows back into equity funds, but we'll see if that has any impact on the volatility. That will be an additional driver to look at.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then I wanted to just probe into the enthusiasm for cross margining. To what extent can you cross margin nondollar swaps with your dollar-based futures products. Like is that something that resonates with investors? Or is it really the dollar-based swaps that you cross margin with the dollar-based futures?","Phupinder S. Gill","No. Actually, it's exposure to exposure. So to the extent that you have nondollar exposure, as you're trying to offset against dollar exposure, you find the common currency give a haircut to that currency for risk management purposes and understanding the characteristic of the instrument that you're trying to cross margin, cross margining dollar versus nondollar exposure's equivalent to cross margining dollar versus dollar exposure. It's simply exposure on your books, you have to take different things into account.","Derek Sammann","Yes. And if there's going to be -- to that point, as from our energy's complex, even between our, say, metals and foreign exchange, we actually do have some margin reductions for people who want to trade that as a spread, say, Aussie dollar against gold. There's a correlation on the clearing [ph] the clearing house allows for some margin reduction there. It's all risk-based. So to the extent that they run correlations and back test and make sure they've got an ability to risk manage that appropriately, that's the basis upon which cross margining happens.","Phupinder S. Gill","There's a minimum correlation threshold, that anything that is proposed to be cross margined has to cross, and that threshold is very high. Once you cross that threshold, the currency of denomination is actually irrelevant.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","The futurization of swaps, it's just a growing den of industry participants outside of the exchanges kind of appealing to regulators to maybe better harmonize correlation or margin requirements for swaps versus future. It just seems like there's a lot of people seem to be quite concerned that even just the margining requirements are going to be enough to maybe encourage people to trade some futures instead of swaps. So help me understand your perspective on this. I mean, clearly, you'd benefit if you did see more futurized swaps or even in your swap deliverable futures did well. But is there an opportunity for them to kind of replace a lot of the swap sell volume? And if not, why not?","Phupinder S. Gill","The reason our perspective is very straightforward and very clear that the 5-day requirement on swaps or the 1-day requirement or the 2-day requirement on the futures is a function of what I'll call visibility. If you can -- if you have a default on your hand and you're trying to get rid of a portfolio, if you have visibility, which the futures markets have, it is that much simpler to exit a portfolio from your books. During the Lehman crisis, we sold a multibillion dollar book within half an hour. And within 3 hours of announcing the sale, it was taken off the books in an auction. In the same crisis, it took several days for the Lehman swap book to get transferred out from LCH. So the margin requirement is a reflection of that one phenomena. No visibility is going to be more difficult. You'll need 4 or 5 banks, maybe more, to basically bid. With visibility your options for getting rid of a portfolio are immensely improved. So ultimately, take for example LCH, when they margined their swap book and have been doing this for the last 20-some years, they have margined it on either 5-day, or even more, basis. By the same token, LCH was margining Euribor, which they still do, and that's always done on a 1-day basis. The comfort level there is no different than the comfort level they should have when you're talking about a futures contract against a swap. It's a question of the function of visibility. And so take the swap futures for example, to the extent they're brand-new contract and there are some parts of the contract that are still not clear to folks and there's some concern that our risk guys have, they may, at their option, look to margin it on a 2-day basis, which I believe for the historic -- for the deliverable swap futures, we have done. What the deliverable swap futures have and the clear swaps don't have yet is the trading platform where buyers and sellers can come on by and actually you can get a price. And even if there was a block trade done, within minutes of that block trade occurring, the price is known to everybody. That level of transparency and visibility is the only thing that drives the margin requirements difference between a swap and a future. Does that make sense?","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It does, Gill. But I guess if this doesn't change, then I guess it makes the argument stronger that maybe people should trade these futurized swaps or the deliverable swap futures. It's a stronger argument for these things to almost replace the swaps. And I was just trying to understand what's the counterargument to that, that you don't actually see. Rather than cleared swaps growing as we've been talking about, maybe just more of these deliverable swap futures or futurized swaps growing instead because the collateral requirements are going to be lower.","Phupinder S. Gill","They will be, I think, at least, initially I think I  can't talk about -- or no one knows how the market might evolve with respect to execution facilities down the road. But the one thing that swaps have that deliverable swap futures by their design don't have is an extremely high level of customization and...","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And the hedge accounting benefit then, I guess.","Phupinder S. Gill","And that's what you'll find the very sophisticated swap uses are going to continue to use. Right?","Terrence A. Duffy","Yes, I was just going to emphasize, about your point, Gill. I think that's really what it's at, Niamh. But to say that we can just transition the entire OTC market into a listed futures market, I don't see that to be a possibility because of some of the customization that are with some of these products, the opaque nature that they trade. They're just going to have to trade as a swap and they're going to have to fall under the requirements of the 5-day, or if they're unclear, the 10-day requirements. And that's just the way it's going to have to be. So you will get some people that can get enough correlation between a swap and the future transitioning into futures because of the economic efficiencies associated with it. And I think that's what we're seeing today, and we'll continue to see more of that. But I don't see the overall market going away completely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just, I guess, follow up on the last question one more time. When you think about the 3 options that you're offering clients right now, whether it's clearing swaps, swap futures or your interest rate futures product, can you give us a sense on how the economics are different or the net economics are different to you and whether or not you sort of care in which way clients will start to shift their business?","James E. Parisi","Yes, this is Jamie. I'd say, if you look at our -- obviously, the futures contracts, we have the stated rate card out there. On the deliverable swap futures, the rate is very similar to our treasury contracts. And then on the interest rate swaps, for most customers, the average is going to be in the $5 to $6 per million range. Now you can normalize all of that, when you think about having to do strips of our base futures contracts, for example, to equal a swaps contract or a swap OTC contract, so we try to take all that into consideration, as well as rolls and that sort of thing.","Derek Sammann","Yes, and I was going to jump on that. I mean, what you see a large percentage of our contracts get rolled. So not only is there the execution at the outset, but then there's a roll process. And then some of the cleared swaps price, we had accounted for that with different upfront fees. So you need to think about how long these are going to stay on their books. The standard rate swap is a 5 to 7 year, so just that is the difference in the terms of having an economics hit.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just my follow-up, I guess, and I know it's still early in the year. But when you guys think about a return of capital for this year, I know last year, you obviously provided a little bit of color on how much cash you see yourself having by the end of the year and how much you need to have. But I guess capital requirements at the clearing house, you obviously increased the size of your credit facility recently. How do you guys think about, I guess, the minimum for -- that you feel comfortable with in terms of cash for this year?","James E. Parisi","Sure. Our minimum cash target for the balance sheet hasn't changed. It's $700 million is what we're looking to hold. Now over time, as capital requirements evolve, that may be impacted somewhat but I don't see it being impacted in a very significant way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question. On the market data revenue line, I just wonder if you could maybe give us some color in terms of how much the screens have declined year-over-year. And thinking about next year and further out, one of the themes that people have been talking about as the over-the-counter markets transition more towards an electronically traded market is reducing the human capital element with the technological trading in these markets, so that would -- might argue for fewer screen counts moving forward. I just wonder if you could provide any color on that.","James E. Parisi","I can start, and then maybe some of my colleagues can jump in. But if you look over the longer term, I'd say over -- if you look at our peak terminals in -- back in 2008, we're down over 20% versus that peak. So in that, I do really feel that the key driver there is you just keep seeing the headlines every quarter about more and more layoffs on the street and certainly they are very large users of that service. You do hit on another area that we're thinking hard about is that we do today provide fee waiver on our Globex terminals for market data.","Phupinder S. Gill","I think the fee waiver portion of this has been in place for at least the past 12 years, Chris, so that is not going to be a driver of whether market data revenue goes up and down. I think Jamie hit the nail on the head with respect to what's going on there. It's just a normal and ordinary business cycle for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Ditmire with Macquarie.","Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research","You guys make a significant amount of money, maybe about 1\/10 of your transaction revenue from clearing over-the-counter energy swaps, which Slide 8 shows as a extremely small portion of your over-the-counter swap market and it's a market where you split the opportunity with other firms. What kind of hurdles are out there over the next couple of years in the medium-term to take your progress and all the business you're doing in interest rate swaps and turn that into a new significant profit driver like that ClearPort energy swap facility?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill, Ed. I think it's too early to say how the market might evolve. I think if you look at the asset classes on the futures side that we had and you look at the potential opportunity that exists for us not just in the rate side and the energy side, but potentially across all the asset classes and the significant need for capital efficiencies among our client base, I think I'm fairly optimistic about how the OTC swap marketplace might grow in either 1 of the 3 forums. But it's too early to tell when and it's too early to tell how.","Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research","Got you. And one follow-up question. With the incentive programs you have around this over-the-counter clearing product, how long term are these incentives and can you envision a time where critical mass has reached that? Do you think the network effects takeover as a real compelling reason and incentives become less important?","James E. Parisi","Ed, this is Jamie. It's just -- for us, it's just too early to tell. It's way too early in the game to judge when -- to judge how that will play out. And it may be that we need those incentives for a particular type of customer for a very long period of time because that's -- it's reflective of the type of business that they do. They're not -- the incentives that are in place today in the interest swaps arena are for high turnover customers, so they're not putting on positions and holding in the clearing house for a very long period of time. So  it's not real taxing to the clearing house for each particular trade.","Phupinder S. Gill","Ed, if I can add, these incentives are not extraordinary in any way, shape or form. They're just part and parcel of incentives that we would put out there for any kind of new product or service that we would put out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just one more on the OTC and interest rate, maybe for Derek. What's your sense of your ability to convert customers over from the swap to futures in a sense of the timing? Obviously, you don't need to convert a large part of this market to contribute significantly to the revenue stream. But what's your sense of -- to what extent a lot of the education that you've done and conversations with the clients will have an inflection point around the March 11 time frame or at one of the other points doing this year? Or do you think it's a really -- a much multiyear effort before we see traction in the traditional interest rate futures complex as a result of that effort?","Derek Sammann","Well, I think it's a couple of things and remembering that March 11 is not a big thing. We're going to phase-in clients every quarter from March all the way through to December of this year. And the Phase Is, for the most part of it, are the biggest, largest entities out there, some of the dealers and maybe some of the biggest hedge funds. And then you'd be phasing clients behind that. So there have been a lot of folks that, once the news came down in August, said all right I've got a date to work towards but they're looking to their clearing firm to give them guidance as to where and how they should expedite their process for readiness. And as Gill has mentioned before, a lot of work is being done right now by us, by our clearing house folks, by our sales folks, engaging both the clients, as well as the clearing firms for readiness on both sides. There are reports out there indicating different levels of readiness across the client base. A year ago, you would have seen a very, very low level of preparation. But now that we're really looking at the kick-off date in March, we're seeing probably close to 75% of the folks that are at least working towards readiness over the course of this year. In terms of what products they end up in, all I can tell you is the time we spend with customers talking about futures, these hybrid deliverable swap futures and clearing services is about equal, and that tells us there's an appetite understand what suits their book and what products would be the best product of choice for them.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So there's an appetite out there. We'll just have to really watch for progress over the course of the year.","Derek Sammann","Yes, and I think you'll see that process happen, and the more that we see firms take up our offer of cross margin, and I think that will be a compelling value proposition. And as Gill mentioned, we've got clearing services across every major asset class.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Just a very quick follow-up for Jamie. The build-out or the second wave of the build-out of the co-location, I know you didn't really give a time frame initially when you'd do that. But given your guidance on that, is it safe to say that, that's not going to be an effort this year?","James E. Parisi","Yes, that's -- we did some preparing last year in terms of infrastructure. And as the demand pulls, we'll revisit it.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer session for today's call. I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you, all, very much, and we look forward to speaking with you in the next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call to Mr. John Peschier. You may begin, sir.","John C. Peschier","Thank you, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Jamie and Gill will spend a few minutes outlining the highlights of the third quarter, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. Terry, Brian and Kim and John Pietrowicz are also here today. Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language.","Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC and they're also available on the Investor Relations portion of our site.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you, John. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I will start by talking about the highlights of the third quarter, then I'll provide an overview of the recent leadership reorganization and staff changes. And lastly, I will provide an observation on what we are seeing so far in the fourth quarter before turning the call over to Jamie.","Our core business performed well during the third quarter, with average daily volume of 13.5 million contracts, up 12% compared with third quarter last year.","In September, with a slight pickup in volatility across capital asset classes, our average daily volume grew 17%, and 5 of our 6 product areas grew on a year-over-year basis.","During most of the year, our growth has been driven primarily by our interest rate business, so it is nice to see a broadening of the growth across the board.","Our options business was outstanding during the month of September with a record 3.1 million contracts traded per day, up 29% from last year. This is bolstered by a record level of options open interest in September of 52 million, up 14% from 2013.","Also, during the quarter, we achieved volume records in our weekly FX options, weekly E-mini S&P options, soybean options and 5-year treasury options. Electronic options in September were up 46% versus the prior year.","Specifically, electronic WTI options hit a record 71%. We are driving this outsized options growth by innovating new products, focusing on our options technology and executing on our distribution initiatives to expand our global customer base.","Our September volume record was short-lived, and this growth trend has continued into October with average daily volume of 3.6 million contracts per day to date, up 68%.","Two other important points about Q3, which illustrates some progress in our 2 primary growth initiatives. First, our volume from clients based outside the U.S. was impressive and has been consistently performing well the last 4 months.","Q3 electronic ADV from European clients was 2.1 million contracts, up 22% on a year-over-year basis, outperforming North America, which rose 13%.","In Europe, we saw growth of 28% year-over-year in our interest rates business and 33% growth in equities during the quarter.","For comparison purposes, our 2 largest European-based competitors each saw a drop in their total volumes relative to Q3 last year. One driver of the outperformance is a more dynamic environment in terms of our product set, which has drawn more hedging and speculation from European-based firms.","Also, we have invested in a greater presence in London with customer-facing employees. They have a lot to talk to clients about and are making some real progress for CME Group.","Along the same lines, in Asia, our volumes rose 12% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Our interest rates were up 23% and equities rose 36% in Q3 from Asia, offsetting a challenging global FX and metals trading volumes.","Volume in Q3 approached 500,000 contracts per day, and that amount of volume is equivalent to what leading Asian exchanges trade on a daily basis.","Second, our OTC efforts continue to progress during the third quarter. We maintained our leadership position in open interest on the rate side at 20 trillion notional outstanding. We hit a record of almost 180 billion ADV cleared in September and our trade count of almost 2,500 during September was more than 50% higher than any month to date. This translated into stronger revenue in Q3.","Within our rates franchise, we recently relaunched bundled futures as well as options on bundled futures, and we are encouraged by our progress. We plan to launch clearing for swaptions during the first quarter of 2015 pending regulatory approval.","Finally, CME Group is committed to expanding our CDS offering in order to be the #1 multi-asset class clearing house for buy side clients. We have invested in the development of a new risk framework, which provides a more holistic model of CDS portfolio risk.","This new risk framework, coupled with our plan to launch iTraxx indices, will give us the opportunity to increase our market share in CDS clearing during 2015.","Now I would like to spend a few minutes describing our efforts on the expense side, an area where our team was particularly active during the last few months.","First, we announced a new executive team and leadership structure in mid-September. I'll walk you through the main changes.","Fundamentally and essentially, we reorganized the company around our clients' needs and focused on the best way to meet those needs. The new organization structure also brings the individual business portfolio closer to the office of the CEO and enhances customer responsiveness.","First, we created a Chief Commercial Officer role, filled by Bryan Durkin. He is responsible for driving short-term and long-term revenue by harnessing our product sales team, research group, product marketing, business development and our global offices.","From a product perspective, Sean Tully, heads up our financial products and OTC areas, along with Derek Sammann, who's in charge of commodities and options overall.","These 3 guys and their teams will be intensely focused on providing world-class customer service, expanding on an industry-leading innovation and enabling clients to navigate in a changed environment.","To summarize these changes, this is all about driving increased multi-year revenue growth across each of our 6 ecosystems.","Our second goal in the reorganization was to drive more efficiency throughout the company. That is to improve execution, agility and speed to market in terms of our significant operational backbone.","With this goal in mind, we combined technology, clearing and global operations under Kim Taylor, and we believe with this structure, we will be able to streamline how we operate and reap the benefits of greater efficiency.","In addition, Bob Zagotta will head up strategy and execution and will be responsible for the development and execution of the company's corporate strategy.","And finally, John Pietrowicz, when he takes over for Jamie, will work side-by-side with this team and all the others to ensure that we are appropriately focused on delivering shareholder value as we execute our plans. And of course, both Kathleen Cronin and Hilda Harris Piell will continue in their current roles as General Council and Head of Human Resources.","We expect to improve our agility, prioritization and efficiency, and the end results will be decreased cost and improved profitability as well as earnings growth.","Following the reorganization announcement, our teams went through a thorough process of streamlining the organizations, so we could be better positioned for growth. We reduced our workforce by approximately 150 people, primarily in technology, along with the elimination of mainly administrative functions.","Going forward, our leadership team is very focused on an ongoing review of how we can be even more efficient throughout our business.","Lastly, let me make a few comments with regard to October. Within the month, we have had 2 of our top 3 trading days in our history. It is an exceptional month even if we remove the 2 highest volume days, we have averaged more than 16 million contracts per day so far.","A couple of observations. During October, we have seen strong activity across the board with our fixed product lines up and the financial products each up more than 50% compared to October last year. It's a reminder that markets tend to be interconnected in terms of volumes and volatility, particularly through interest rates. That appeared to be evident on Wednesday, October 15.","On that day, I was very pleased with our ability to handle such a large increase in activity from a technology and clearing prospective. Our teams worked hard to prepare for heightened activity, and this is an excellent time to assess our readiness for volumes, which were about 3x the norm.","","If you have listened to our media campaigns over the years, you know we referred to CME Group as the place where the world comes to manage risk. You might be curious about where our volume came from on October 15, and Slide 16 on our presentation illustrates that.","A higher percentage of our business came from outside North America than we see in a normal day. We traded 26 million contracts electronically from North America. We had near 9 million contracts traded from outside of the U.S., which is pretty large compared to what our largest peer\u2019s trade on a normal day.","We traded 7.4 million contracts from Europe, which is 3.5x the size of normal activity and $1.1 million from Asia, more than twice as much as a normal CME day in Asia.","There's a lot of discussion within the industry about innovation, much of which we have driven throughout the history of CME Group.","In recent years, we have referenced a number of new interest rates products we have launched since 2010. These contracts amounted for almost 700,000 contracts of ADV on October 15. Our innovation is unparalleled, and we are in a better position to innovate now more than ever before with the intersection of OTC and exchange traded markets.","And one final point. We traded more than 25 million interest rate contracts on October 15, the highest day ever by far and 3.5x our 7.2 million average daily volume in the third quarter.","Additionally, the interest rate swap market that they -- as measured by the aggregate dealer to customer cleared swaps business at CME Group and LCH, were below the recent run rate. This could suggest participants saw the value in turning to our liquid markets with the heightened volatility. This was referenced in the few news articles, which basically referred to CME Group as the most cost-efficient way to trade you to liquidity and capital efficiency. We wholeheartedly agree.","Our open interest remains elevated, and as of yesterday, it's 104 million contracts, up from where we were on October 14. This suggests that there is heightened engagement as participants prepare for the future.","In summary, we have worked hard to position ourselves to create significant value for shareholders when this challenging cycle turns. While the concept of a Goldilocks environment can be debated, whether markets will vary from being too hot or too cold or just right, we intend to provide the more responsive customer service possible with as efficient a delivery structure as we possibly can. No matter what happens, we continue to work to be the place where the world comes to manage risk.","And finally, let me turn the call over to the man who has served us with distinction over the past 26 years, my business partner, Jamie Parisi, who is participating in his last earnings call here before turning the reigns over to the man that trained him.","Let me turn the call over to Jamie.","James E. Parisi","Thanks, partner, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter. It's nice to see some signs of strength as I prepare to pass the torch to John.","One of the things I've talked a lot about over the last 10 years is the significant operating leverage in our business model and how that leverage cuts both ways, depending on the tailwinds and the headwinds we're facing.","Looking at the adjusted results, our revenue increased by $48 million or 7% compared to Q3 last year, while our expenses were down 1% to $318 million.","The intensified expense focus I mentioned last quarter, coupled with a favorable trading environment, resulted in an incremental margin above 100%, and I expect it to be above 100% next quarter.","In a normal period, we are dropping roughly $0.80 to $0.90 of each new revenue dollar to the operating income line.","Now I'll turn to some revenue details. The rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.725, down from $0.749 last quarter. The main driver of the change was the 7% growth in total volume from Q2 to Q3, driven mostly by lower price financial products.","I was very pleased to see the September rolling 3-month interest rate RPC remained unchanged, compared with August, despite volume being up 8% from the prior month.","The FX average rate dipped down 5% from August to September, but you should take note of the 19% increase in the rolling 3-month FX volume over the same period.","We saw the same thing in equities, with the rolling 3-month volumes up 8% from August to September, while the associated rate drop only 1%.","I was also pleased to see the volume and revenue growth from outside the U.S. with the highest proportion ever of non-U.S. electronic volume and revenue in Q3. For the first time, the percentage of electronic trading revenue from outside the U.S. was above 30%.","OTC swaps revenue totaled $50 million, up 17% versus last quarter. In Q3, we captured about $132 per IRS OTC trade, and we cleared approximately 1,750 trades per day in the quarter, up significantly from prior quarters.","Our adjusted expenses were down $10 million sequentially and about $4 million compared to Q3 last year. The main driver was reduced professional fees and other expense.","We brought some development projects to completion, saw a waning at contingent consideration expense from prior acquisitions and reduced discretionary expenses like travel as promised last quarter.","Our compensation was relatively flat sequentially despite higher stock-based compensation resulting from our annual grant in September. We should see improvement in the compensation expense line in Q4 and beyond as a result of our recent restructuring.","Two points on the nonoperating income line. Our dividend income was approximately $5 million, down from about $9.6 million in the prior quarter when we received and recorded both the Q1 and Q2 dividends from our partner in Brazil.","We also recorded a dividend from our investment in the Mexican exchange in Q2 with no dividend from them in Q3. We had a slight uptick in interest expense from the prior quarter due to clearing line of credit cost.","Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate for the year has dropped to 37.3% on a pro forma basis from the prior 37.5%. The effective pro forma tax rate for this quarter was approximately 37%, including a catch-up adjustment for Q1 and Q2, and I expect Q4 to be approximately 37.3%.","And now the balance sheet. We had approximately $1.16 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.","In Q3, we had a significant cash outflows associated with an estimated tax payment, our regular quarterly dividend and the semiannual interest payment due on our debt securities maturing in 2023 and 2043.","Lastly, during the third quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $29 million, bringing us to $95 million through 3 quarters.","I want to provide a couple of points on guidance for Q4. I expect expenses to be approximately $332 million, driven by higher marketing-related expense, which we talked about before and sequentially higher license fee and bonus expenses based on a significant increase in revenue so far to start the fourth quarter, offset a bit by lower base compensation.","Based on that guidance, 2014 expenses should come in at about $1.3 billion at the low end of the range I previously provided.","Also, my expectation for CapEx this year dropped to $155 million, down from our prior estimate of $175 million, primarily based on timing and reconfiguring our New York space stretching into 2015.","Lastly, on expenses. 2 weeks ago we reduced our workers by 15%, which Gill mentioned.","Phupinder S. Gill","5%.","James E. Parisi","5% by which Gill mentioned. As a point of reference, we ended the third quarter with headcount at 2,825. We have been working on plans for several months, and we basically took a blank sheet approach to determine the best way to drive revenue higher while reducing expense.","I personally appreciate the efforts of my colleagues to make the tough decision to better position our company for the long-term and wish our colleagues who left the best of luck in the next phase of their careers.","One last piece of guidance I want to provide is related to 2015 expenses. With pro forma expenses for 2014 expected to be $1.3 billion based on the compensation changes and other expense initiatives, our current estimate is that 2015 pro forma expenses will likely come in basically flat compared to 2014 at approximately $1.3 billion.","And there is some variability around that based on license fees and employee bonus. That excludes the impact of adding expense related to our pending transaction with GFI Group or other potential tuck-in acquisitions.","We will continue to refine this estimate as we finalize our 2015 budget, and John will provide you an update on the next earnings call.","Since I mentioned our pending transaction, let me briefly comment that we are carefully assessing the current situation and filed our S-4 on October 16.","Beyond that, we will not address any questions about the transaction as we covered thoroughly last quarter.","As I step away, I'm highly confident in my successor, John Pietrowicz. I expect all of you to really enjoy working with him as I have over the last 11 years.","I wish you, all, well, and I have to say I've enjoyed getting to know and to work with many of you who are listening today. I believe my interactions with you over the years definitely made me a better CFO.","Even though I'm moving on to the next phase of my life by year end, I will continue on here as a shareholder, and I am highly confident in our teams and still believe this is truly a one-of-a-kind franchise to own. And I'm excited about the future of CME Group. Thank you, all.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just help me think about the expenses as well as for the guidance for next year, and thanks so much for giving it ahead of time, a great finish for Jamie too. But if -- there are some variables on that, I guess, licensing is one of them, but is there -- what can you share in terms of the volume assumptions implicit in that? Or what should we think about if volumes comes out to be much higher than we all think or you all think? Is it the bonus incentive? What else might vary with that expense guidance?","James E. Parisi","Niamh, this is Jamie. We don't give out volume guidance, but you're right, there's a couple of items that do vary with volume, particularly our license and fee sharing line. So there, I would look to whatever your assumptions are next year for growth around equity and our energy products in particular and our OTC businesses as we do have some fee sharing there as well fall into that line. And likewise, on the bonus, we typically have a target that's probably in the $60 million to $70 million range overall with a max that goes out to -- it maxes out at about $100 million-or-so, so it's capped. So there's some variability there, but not huge variability. So more to come there, but John will keep you guys apprised of any updated guidance on the next call.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess, since I'm limited to one. On the annual variable dividend, is it going to be simply formulaic where it's the excess cash by year end, and you subtract the $700 million because we're coming up with something a little bit over $2? Is there any other uses of cash or things that we should think about as we're sort of trying to project that number?","James E. Parisi","Yes. Rich, this is Jamie again. So the way we look at it each year is to assess the cash that's sitting on our balance sheet relative to that minimum that we want to hold of $700 million. If we look back over the last couple of years, we didn't go all the way down to $700 million, we went to $900 million. I would say in the first few years of doing this, we wanted to be very careful and not take it all the way down to $700 million. Over the coming years, as we get more comfortable with it, there is potential to tighten that up a little bit. But yes, I think you have the general idea right. And with respect to any other cash outflows, nothing at this point that we've talked about. And even with as far as GFI goes, we don't see that impacting the dividend either.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So if we had to put a range, it would be the cash, then minus $700 million to $900 million to remain and then rest would be -- is that a fair sort of range?","James E. Parisi","Yes.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And then we do expect you to report on your handicap every quarter as it comes down as well.","James E. Parisi","It can take a while to get that one down, but yes.","Operator","And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First off, also, to Jamie, thanks for everything over the years and all the best going forward.","James E. Parisi","Thank you.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I came on a little bit late so I don't know if Terry is on, but otherwise, it will be for Gill. But over the last few months, we've seen a lot more noise out there in terms of white papers and asset manager comments around clearing houses and the risk that's getting put in there and the capital requirements that clearing houses should have, stress tests, the living wills, a lot more noise recently. So maybe just an update of what we're hearing in DC and from other regulators around the world when it comes to maybe having to put up or have more cost around the clearing house or maybe more capital, because obviously, that could drive some impact on the annual dividend over time as well.","Terrence A. Duffy","I am in the room. I'll let Kim probably comment, but I will say that I have not heard anything coming from the regulator as it pertains to us coming up with more capital to put in to it. I think today, we put in roughly $370 million between U.S. and Europe of CME's capital towards a guaranteed fund. Pardon me?","Phupinder S. Gill","A little bit more than that.","Terrence A. Duffy","Yes. I talked to [indiscernible] he said it was $370 so that's what I've heard. Regardless, I have not heard anything there that should be coming from a legislative standpoint or regulative standpoint. Kim may want to talk a little bit more on the living will stuff, as it pertains to that. But I have not heard whether they're looking in for us to put additional capital outside of a couple articles, one being written by PIMCO, one being written by JPMorgan.","Phupinder S. Gill","Alex, this is Gill. Let me just add to what the Chairman has to say, and then I'll ask him to also add a few more points here. I think if you're looking at some of these comments that the banks and some of the buy-side guys have put out over the last few months, there's a central theme that the concern is that the CCP's would be, in general, the next too large to fail. And I think there's some important distinctions and we are going to put up a short paper on our own to point out what these distinctions are. A few things to remember, unlike other counterparties that have been tagged with this too large to fail, we run a matchbook, in other words, all the buy equals to all sales we run flat every day, we mark that match book to the market at least twice a day. None of the parties that have been described as too large to fail or too important to fail have similar characteristics. So there's a little bit of concern about what have happens when so-called risk is concentrated. I think you should take -- make the distinction between the concentration of positions versus the concentration of risks. And those are 2 important distinctions. So I think some of the noise that's been out there is a little bit misguided. And some of the work that came in our folks are doing have the record straight there. Kim, if you want to add a bit.","Kimberly S. Taylor","I think Gill outlined it very well, that clearing houses are very disciplined at managing risk and run a flat book. And there are no exceptions made for margin policies or payment of daily mark-to-market based on the credit worthiness or the customer relationship status of the various clients. So it is a very rigorous disciplined approach. And the way that CME looks at it, risk management is what we sell, and protection of the market is the only business that we have. So this is something that the firm has a very strong risk management culture. One of the things that I have noticed about some of the papers that are out is they kind of try to talk about concentration of risk, and they kind of say the clearing houses need to put more of their own funds at risk, for example. More skin in the game for clearing houses is one of the key topics that's being talked about. And actually, we have a lot of skin in the game. Not every clearing house does. So I mean, the point could have some resonance around some of the other clearing houses that don't belong to a well-capitalized entities and don't have the ability to put significant amount of skin in the game. So I put that to the side. But the other thing to remember is that clearing houses are only going to be affected ever by the default of a clearing member and the more significant and concentrated the exposure of the clearing member. So the bigger the bank is, that failed, the bigger the exposure that the clearing house needs to manage. All of our risk tools are sized to cover that. But one thing we are looking at is that all of our risk tools, the mutualization process is right now sized so that the market insures the entire market. And I think, one of the things that some of these papers are leading us to look at is whether or not there should be a more concentrated focus on the bigger the defaults are, the bigger the cost sharing that they put into the process. So strengthening the defaulters paid element of the process for the very biggest defaulters is an area that we are looking at.","James E. Parisi","And just to sum all that up, we really don't expect any of this to impact our dividend that we would normally pay in early 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Jamie, the best to you also. Great working with you over the years.","James E. Parisi","Thank you. And likewise.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question is on the organic traction of the interest rate complex, particularly in the notion of the swap users. Gill, you had -- you mentioned on October 15, you saw a much better usage of interest rate futures versus swaps. So maybe if you can talk a little bit more as we move into 2015, the growth trajectory that you envision of getting the swap users to convert to listed features. What is your force sales saying? Are they seeing evidence of some of the sales efforts they have? And then also if you can comment on that same dynamic. Outside the U.S., you mentioned obviously a very good traction, for example, on October 15, in that regard with the sales, the new customer penetration outside the U.S. as we look into 2015.","Bryan T. Durkin","It's Bryan, and I'll take that one. First of all, I think if you take a look over the last quarter or so, we've seen very nice uptake from, particularly, our asset manager community as well as our hedge fund community. One of the parameters that we look at in terms of conversion into the future's complex is our assessment of large open interest holders. And during the past few months, if you take a look at that, we've increased the number of large open interest holders from 415 to 1,702. We also measure our overall penetration of cash market itself and our treasury cash market penetration has reached the size 74% year-to-date. And that's an all-time high for us. We also monitor closely the activity for our block transactions. And so reviewing blocks and EFR transactions, we've seen significant growth in both of those areas. Our Eurodollar futures open interest has hit a record high of 13.5 million contracts. And we're seeing similar uptakes in our treasury open interest. Looking at it from the international basis, again, we're seeing considerable positive trends similar to what I've just outlined.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so your view into coming into 2015 on that, a lot more to go? Or do you feel you have made great strides so far and that pace of pickup will slow down?","Bryan T. Durkin","Well, I can't give any projections in that regard. There continues to be positive, I'd say, fundamentals in terms of the convergence of interest rate uncertainty, the convergence of OTC, the futures, we're continuing to aggressively sell to the various client segments, the opportunities that we present and the context of the full portfolio, a clearing, OTC interest rate swaps, portfolio margining, the liquidity of our interest rate complex and the capital benefits that are associated with that. In addition, we keep introducing innovative products, and our emphasis is on building our global growth. So we see opportunities all the way around.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to start on market data. It looked like you guys saw a couple of million dollar decline sequentially there. I'm just wondering if you could give us an update on how demand is and how subscriber counts are, particularly on the back of some of the fee hikes you did earlier this year and the elimination of the fee waiver? And how we should think about that into next year as you start to put some of that -- those guys you were receiving fee waivers, start to chart the 50% rate there?","James E. Parisi","Great question. So basically, what we saw in the quarter was a small decline in terminal usage. We are going to see variation from quarter-to-quarter as desks -- trading desks open and shut and try to become more efficient, that sort of thing. But when I look at the decline in terminal so far this year, it's really -- the decline is really starting to taper off. We're down 2% to 3% in terminals this year. If I look back over the last several years, we're down on average about 7% each of those years. And as you know, we put some policies in place this year that I think are having a positive impact in helping to mitigate that loss and eventually, hopefully will turn the corner. We implemented the fee increase earlier this year, which is a 15% fee increase, which is also helping us out in positive relative to the small decrease in terminals. The other thing that we did is that we are starting to eliminate waivers of fees on trading terminals. And we stopped new waivers starting in March. So we think that's helping to mitigate that decline in terminals. And then next year, we'll begin to charge for those who have been grandfathered in on the waivers, we're going to charging half of our normal rack rate per month per terminal. We don't know what the impacts of that are going to be exactly, because the number of wave terminals may not be indicative of the end demand when people have to start paying. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But I do think these are all positive going forward for this particular income line.","Bryan T. Durkin","I just like to add to that with the waived terminals. Once that policy took effect in March. We've had several dozen firms actually register with us and that indicates either several users in the past that have not been paying market data.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a quick question on FX. If you look at kind of the first half of the year, your FX is pretty muted in terms of volumes and then you obviously is going to pick up for a lot of reasons. But the things that were weighing on FX in the first half of the year, whether its investigations and stuff like that versus the pickup that we've seen, do you see more like sustainability, meaning when you look at the users that were in the market and you look at where the open interest stands, do you feel like we're going to be getting into an environment, like some of the stats that you've given on interest rates, meaning the user base increases, because it obviously fluctuated quite a bit?","Phupinder S. Gill","Again, this is Gill. I'll start first, Mike, and then I'll pass it on to Bryan. But with the activity in the FX that you saw until October or until the third quarter when we saw a significant pickup in FX, both futures as well as options has been largely tied to the increased volatility, the elections in Brazil, and then there has been some activity in the Mexican peso too. And so a lot of these things had to do with that. The options pickup in particular has been encouraging for us, particularly as you saw volatilities start to pick up. And all of it has been done on the Globex platform.","Bryan T. Durkin","Which is -- we're seeing a nice trajectory if you look at Q1, Q2, and then more recently, the trend that's been occurring these last few months has been in a positive direction. One of the barometers, as Gill alluded to, is the levels of open interest, particularly in our options contract. And we've hit records in that OI. And we think that, that's indicative of a positive trend in terms of a regrouping of interest in new participants coming into the market and participants that have pulled away from the markets coming back in.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","This is Cory on for Patrick. My question is, so you guys have been picking up market share and energy versus your closest competitor in recent months across crude, natural gas and refined oil products as well. To what do you attribute these market share gains? And do you think you're at the point now where you can maybe start charging for Brent trading?","Bryan T. Durkin","This is Bryan again. We're pleased with the progress that we've been making in terms of the broad complex. Our position is both medium- and long-term trends are good within the product set that we offer. We're looking to provide a holistic complement of products, both in the crude and refined area. As you've alluded to, we picked up some nice market share across each of those asset classes. We're particularly pleased with the performance on our WTI and our Brent efforts. There's a great deal of debate that's out there regarding changes to export restrictions that could help us in the longer term. But overall, our CME energy products are up 7% in October, excluding Brent futures, and our competitor is flat. Also in Q3, we've outperformed in energy versus our competition. So we feel really good about the strength of the complement of the product base.","Terrence A. Duffy","This is Terry Duffy. Let me just add a little something here. I think what's important here is we are getting paid. We're not getting paid on the Brent, we're getting paid on the return of our share of the West Texas Intermediate has gone from 25% or 30% when we acquired NYMEX in 2008, down along 14% or 15% whereas it's at today. So if you look at that, we may be given Brent away for free or creating an arbitrage for Brent against TI, but we're building our TI business and getting paid for that. So I think there is a lot of pluses to what we're doing with the Brent complex today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller from BMO Capital.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And Jamie, congrats on the retirement. You'll definitely be missed. So on the expenses, I just want to go back there. I know you're hoping to keep expenses flat given your efficiency program in 2015. But I'm just trying to get a gauge for whether the efficiency measures are more like a onetime thing or a signal that you might be shifting your longer-term thought process around cost? Like after the program, after 2015, then do we go back to your prior long-term expense growth guidance of about 5% annually? Or are we entering new efficiency mode where maybe in 2016, 2017, we should be thinking about 3%?","James E. Parisi","Yes, I really -- the way I look at this is when we talk about restructuring, it's not just a look at our human capital and how to best deploy that, it's also looking across the business and how best to deploy the remainder of our capital. And really we did take a white sheet approach. And I think that there's still some opportunity there, we'll continue to look for ways to improve the business, we're looking at things like data center consolidation, for example, where we're becoming more tight on some of the marketing expenditures that we'll have in the coming years. So I would -- we can't decrease expenses forever, we have to get back to a normal kind of growth rate at some point in time. That's going to be in the low to mid-single digit I think, going forward. But I do believe going forward, we still have this very strong focus on expense discipline, but more importantly, a very strong focus on the margin, the operating margin and net income margin of the exchange to ensure that we're growing that as best we can.","Phupinder S. Gill","Jillian, this is Gill. When we very seriously contemplated the reorganization a few months ago, it was with respect to changing the way that the company thinks. It was with respect to shifting the mindset of the organization into exactly the lines that Jamie just talked about, significantly increasing or pushing the operating margin philosophy down into the firm, understanding what each of the cost drivers of the firm was -- is. And then also, understanding where the innovation was going to take us to the point that, Terry just made a shot a while ago, giving away something for free doesn't mean you\u2019re giving away everything for free. It forms part of the portfolio that brings in higher income across the board for us. So that change in philosophy occurred a few months ago. That change in mindset occurred a few months ago. And that change is what we will bring forward on a going-forward basis here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Stratton with Citi.","Neil Stratton - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question on OTC clearing, and that continues to exhibit quite strong growth. Just what inning do you think we're in, and how should we think about that for 2015?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. I think when the mandate to clear became mandatory here in the U.S., it has not kicked in Europe yet, and the mandate to execute has not been fully implemented here nor even contemplated across the pond yet. So you decide what inning we are in. I don't play baseball, but I think it's still very early days. And I think a lot of conversation has gone on about the futurization of the marketplace, although we are seeing that along the lines of what Bryan talked about. Please bear one thing in mind that these markets are very complementary. On October 15, people turn to the futures, because the liquidity that was there, the liquidity that could be seen was a source going forward. And so I think the market evolves on both sides as was intended by the regulation, and you would start to see a change that occurred. And the important point for us at the very least is that we are positioned well for the change. On the one hand, we're very happy that we started in the U.S. I think we have built through the clearing and the IT mechanisms a bunch of credibility that we carry to Europe.","Terrence A. Duffy","Just to add, and I know Kim is probably more equipped to say this than I, but in 2013, we have basically nothing in OTC interest swaps clearing. And now we have 22 trillion roughly in our clearing house today, so we've been able to grow. I think what's really interesting about how you put a marker on what inning you're in, it goes back to what Kim said earlier. There's been white papers out there, there's been a bit of misinformation out there, it's both in the buy-side and the sell-side. We're going to continue to educate why we're doing things differently. People are looking at should we put skin in the game, we have skin in the game, do they know that? These are all educational things that we've been doing since we've launched our OTC initiative, and we'll continue to do so, so that will help give us a ballpark of the innings that we're in. But you got to look at where we started, it's just a very short while ago and where we've come to today.","Bryan T. Durkin","And if I could add one additional point. From a client perspective, we're really heartened to be garnering more business into our services that had chosen other facilities in the past, and that's largely attributable to Kim and her team's efforts to listen to the client and be able to deliver tools such as coupon blending, compression services, portfolio margining. All of those complements are really bearing fruit and taking traction with the client base for them to see our offering as a differentiator and providing them on significant savings using our OTC facilities and complementing that with the derivatives portfolio as well.","Kimberly S. Taylor","I think Bryan hit the nail on the head of the driver for growth for the next phase of OTC is going to be capital efficiency. It started out as a mandate compliance type of activity, at least with the U.S. participants and the people who trade with them. And now it has become a quest for most a capital efficient way to obtain this protection. And clearly, we stand out as the most capital efficient place for people to obtain their protection.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Rutschow of CLSA.","Robert Rutschow - CLSA Limited, Research Division","In terms of the expenses, it appears the guidance is for flat expense growth despite the cost cuts that you're doing in terms of headcount reduction. So the question is, do you feel like you're going far enough with the expense reduction, particularly considering that the expenses are up about $100 million in the last 2 years?","James E. Parisi","I think that we are doing a really very good job. I will say, over the past several years, we do view ourselves as having run fairly lean, we took a new approach and are trying to be ever more efficient. So I think that we have done a nice job. As Gill was saying earlier and I was saying earlier, we're going to continue to really keep a focus on that area amongst -- in addition to the top line obviously and try to drive as much margin as we can going forward. When you look at the impacts on the coming year, if I look at what the analyst estimates for our expenses were prior to our announcement of restructuring, they're probably at about $1.360 billion, and we're seeing the $1.3 billion now. So that's a pretty large decrease, I would say, in the years\u2019 time. And don't forget, we do have a decent sized expense base, so there's inflationary pressure on that just as there is with anyone.","Phupinder S. Gill","Rob, this is Gill. Let me just add to what Jamie said in the context of the $100 million over the last 2-year comment that you made. Keep in mind where growth has come from for us and where we have spent the funds in growing the expenses come from outside of the U.S. We talked about what Europe did a few weeks ago, we talked about the growth rate in Asia, that's a direct result of the expenses that we put on the ground there. And we've gone from essentially a futures and options exchange to a financial services company, running 6 ecosystems. In other words, we spent a lot to build an ecosystem that is able to not just clear futures and options, but also list and clear OTC products and the innovation that comes with that. So we've built a lot of infrastructure over the last few years, and a lot of our growth has been based upon that, that we have built, that you have seen come to life in the last few weeks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gaston Ceron with Morningstar Equity Research.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just -- I'm sorry, I just want to go back over the expense issue again. So I mean, I hear what you're saying about how we analysts were viewing kind of the 2015 expenses before the staff actions that you're taking. But I guess, if I just look at the guidance, I mean, so you're projecting, it just seems like you adjust on an adjusted level, operating expenses are going to be flat year-to-year, right? So I'm just curious, what is the offset to the lower compensation expenses that you'll have from cutting 5% of the staff? Where else are expenses ticking up that -- so that the ultimate number will be flat?","James E. Parisi","Gaston, this is Jamie. Remember, as I was saying, we -- for the expense base, there's going to be inflation on that every year, right? So, for example, we pay merit increases to our staff each year. In some of the tough years, we decided not to do that, you can't do that every year, because you have to reward the people who are really doing the hard work to get us to where we've gotten to. And that's probably about 3% to 4% on our -- on those expenses. And because we're consuming a lot of professional services, we're subject to increases there and the increases that they have to pay their people as well. And we are growing our international footprint a bit, so our occupancy expense, for example, around the globe will be a bit higher in the coming year. So those are kind of the key areas. Also, to the extent that we see strong volumes or stronger volumes than we see currently or that we saw in this year, you can see some increase in license fees and fee sharing. So there's just natural areas of expense increase that you're going to -- that we're going to get hit with from year-to-year-to-year and really we're trying not to mitigate that with what I believe is a very meaningful reduction in expenses.","Operator","Our final question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A quick question for you guys on the interest rate complex in light of some of the changes that have taken place on the buy-side over the last couple of months, with the departure both Bill Gross and the flow pressure I think that PIMCO has seen. I mean, I guess, PIMCO has been obviously very vocal around using futures as a substitute for some of the other product, and I'm just wondering whether or not do you think this could potentially have an impact on the complex. Or do you think this activity could kind of just transfer out other institutions?","Bryan T. Durkin","Looking at our interest rate complex overall, the indicators have actually been positive in terms of the overall performance of the complex, both within the Eurodollars and the interest rates alone. And I think that's been complemented by additional new products that we've introduced. And we're seeing, again, a very positive trajectory. If you look at our Ultra Bond, now Deliverable Swap Futures performing extremely well. This is where the marketplace comes to manage and hedge their risk. And affirmation of that effect was what occurred on October 15, where we've executed more than 3x our average volume in those complexes. We're seeing a very nice pickup as well on the international side of the equation. So both within Europe as well as in Asia, our interest rate complex is up 28% in Europe and by comparable levels within Asia. I think that, that goes to the intensified sales effort and focus. People come to these products because of the diverse customer base as well as the deep liquidity that we offer. So we're not reliant on any particular segment within these markets. And again, I think it's attributable largely to the investments we've made in our sales efforts to broadly develop our hedge fund complement, our asset management complement as well as the other clients' segments. No major customer, I think, is a very important point to note, no major customer brings concentration into any of these products.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I'm going to turn the call over to Jamie Parisi.","James E. Parisi","All right. Before we sign off, I just wanted to say, thanks, again, for all the great memories, having spent a lot of time with many of you over the years. I count this as some of the highlights of my professional career. It's been really wonderful, and I hope to stay in touch with many of you. If I don't see you before the year ends, so long, and I wish you the best.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Peschier. Please begin.","John Peschier","Thank you for joining us this morning. Gill and John will spend a few minutes discussing the third quarter and then we will open up the call for your questions. Terry, Bryan, Derek and Sean are on the call as well, will participate in the Q&A session.","Before they begin I will read the Safe Harbor language. Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC which are available on our website.","With that I would like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder Gill","Thank you, Mr. Peschier and thank you all for joining us today. We had an outstanding third quarter across the board. We delivered significant top-line growth in transaction fees and market data revenue which coupled with solid expense control, resulted in a 21% increase in adjusted earnings per share.","We continue to benefit from revenue strength that is fairly balanced. Total transaction fee revenue growth for the third quarter was 12%. Commodity products were 14% higher and financial products were up 10%. I will go through the highlights of these two segments for the quarter and then I\u2019ll touch our growth initiatives.","Starting with commodities, all three product areas were up double-digit in terms of volume. Within energy, average daily volume was up 26%, driven by more than 30% growth in our crude business, while natural gas and refine products have done well, up 9% in total. Our WTI futures and options volume was up 39% in Q3, while the other major crude offering traded at a competitor was up 7%.","Recently the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index preliminary re-ratings were released. The WTI futures are now the largest component and represent 23% of the total index, which clearly reflects our clients\u2019 choice in risk management tools among our crude oil liquidity pools. Additionally, our WTI options increased by 50% for the quarter.","Turning to ags, we are tracking for a record volume year. During the third quarter, our ag volume was up 20% with continued strength after a record quarter in Q2. Some highlights include corn, which was up 40% year-over-year and wheat which was up 29%. Within metals, precious metals rose 12%, while the smaller base metals grew by 26%.","During the quarter, we continued to rollout innovative new commodities products. We announced at South American Short-Dated Soybean options contract offering South American producers a flexible and cost effective tool manage new crop price risk. And on the back of our success in the copper business, which was up 26% in Q3, we continue to expand our base metals products suite. In addition to launching zinc futures, we are also launching a global physically delivered led contract with U.S. and European delivery points as well as new aluminum European premium futures following success with our U.S. Midwest premium futures.","On a European energy side, we launch a suite of European power contracts to complement the European gas futures that we launch in January, which will be further enhanced by European emissions futures that we plan to launch in the next month. I will touch on some interesting new partnerships in a few minutes.","Moving onto our financial products, we had an impressive quarter in our equity business with volume up 27%, driven by increased volatility. Equity options growth during the quarter was 32%. During the month of August, we had the two higher days ever in our equities options products with both days above 1.9 million contracts. Within interest rates and FX, we have seen some slowdown in activity as a result of the expectations over Fed move being pushed out several months. We have seen that before and the opportunity remains in front of us. We continue to innovate and believe we are well-positioned in those products.","CME Fed Funds futures are tripled and open interest has doubled this year as the market has used the Fed Funds futures contracts to manage risk in relation to uncertainty of Fed rate hikes. The CME\u2019s FedWatch too that translates Fed Funds futures prices into probability of rate moves by the FOMC, gives more than 30% chance of a rate move in December and over 50% chance of a rate move by March of 2016.","From a growth perspective, a couple of important points, in early August, we were pleased to announce the licensing deal with FTSE Russell Indexes and we look forward to driving growth in these products. We have already launched futures on the Russell 1000, Russell 1000 Growth and Value, FTSE 100 Emerging Markets, and FTSE China 50 Indexes and other products. We will be rolling out the FTSE Emerging Markets, the FTSE Developed Europe in 2016 and most importantly, the Russell 2000 in 2017.","In addition, on November 16, we plan to launch S&P Dividend Index Futures as well as introducing the so-called Basis Trade Index at Close or BTIC functionality to the S&P 500, NASDAQ and Dow Jones Index futures. Within interest rates, lastly we announced plans to launch the Ultra 10-year treasury note futures and options contract, which I alluded to last quarter. This contract provides hedging and spreading opportunities at the true 10-year point of the treasury yield curve. Market participants approached us in the first half of this year and suggested that we look at a futures contract that can provide deep liquidity and capital and margin efficiencies of the treasury futures complex to the highly traded 10-year point on the treasury yield curve.","CME conducted an extensive market validation process of three potential contract designs. We found great enthusiasm, interest and deep held views on the design and usefulness from market participants. The design announcement for the new Ultra 10-year futures has received a significant positive feedback from our customers.","Looking at our global business, we had the best quarter ever in terms of volume and percentage of total volume from outside the U.S. The total electronic average daily volume for the quarter of 3.2 million contracts was up 15% from the prior year. In addition, the total electronic volume traded from outside of the U.S. exceeded 25% for the first time and revenue from outside of the U.S. represented 32% of the total. Our interest rate business has been particularly strong outside the U.S. as electronic revenue has grown from 31% in Q3 last year to 37% this quarter.","We continued to establish global partnerships, particularly in Asia over the last few months. We announced an exclusive license arrangement with Rim Intelligence, a leading provider of pricing data in Japan, to develop and clear energy derivatives based on their LNG data. Secondly, we signed an MOU with MCX, India\u2019s leading commodity exchange related to product development, market allegation and the licensing agreement for rupee denominated oil and gas contracts based on NYMEX prices.","We have made three noteworthy announcements with Chinese entities. We announced an index development and product licensing agreement with China Securities Index Company for commodity index development. We\u2019ve signed an agreement with CFETS, China\u2019s largest marketplace for interest rate and foreign exchange products related to joint development and innovation of offshore, renminbi and related products. As part of the agreement, CFETS will help facilitate China interbank market participants to trade CME Group\u2019s products. And finally, last week, we signed an MOU with China Construction Bank to offer offshore Chinese RMB futures contracts with physical delivery in London for the first time, which will be offered by CME Europe.","We believe our cooperative efforts will continue to unlock opportunities for our shareholders as we continue to grow our customer base and volume around the world.","Turning to our options business, as you know, we have invested in system enhancements, new products, and investor education, which are driving a significant usage of our diverse suite of options products.","Q3 options volume reached a record level of 2.9 million contracts per day. We also saw the highest percentage of this business trading electronically which reached 55% electronic during the quarter. One of the key drivers of our continued electronic options success is on investment in enabling more complex options spread to trade on Globex.","In Q3, we saw a record 45% of all option spreads trade electronically versus just 10% in 2010. And volume in the world\u2019s largest major options contracts, our Eurodollar options traded on Globex jumped by more than 60% to a record 200,000 contracts per day in Q3 and reached 21% electronic versus 14% a year ago.","In summary, we continue to deliver strong results but more importantly, we are intensely focus on running the business as efficiently as we can while laying the foundation for future growth in the years to come.","I\u2019m going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Thank you, Gill; and good morning, everyone. CME had a strong quarter, another great job by the team on both the revenue and expense side, with revenue up 12% and expenses basically flat. Our adjusted operating margin of 62.7% was the highest level we\u2019ve seen since 2011. Finally, our adjusted EPS grew 21% during the quarter, compared to the prior year, driven by organic growth.","I\u2019ll start with some revenue details. The rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.759, down from $0.777 last quarter, driven primarily by a product shift from ags to equities, volume discounts, and a drop in the energy RPC as a result of the contract mix. In September, within energy, we saw a significant increase in our small size power contracts, which accounted for 8% of the energy volume for that month, or 161,000 contracts per day. During the second quarter, the power contracts accounted for less than one-half of 1% of the volume, and for Q3 that jumped up to 5% at an average of $0.06 for contract.","Cleared swaps revenue totaled $16.3 million for the quarter. We captured a $166 per IRS-cleared trade, higher than we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters due to our customer mix. We cleared approximately 1,370 trades per day in Q3.","Market data revenue of $99.5 million was up 13% versus Q3 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program which we have discussed the last few quarters. This came in slightly below our guidance and we would expect it to dip slightly in Q4.","Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter were $317 million, down from last year. We remain extremely focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization and eliminating redundancy to continue to improve agility, and customer and market responsiveness.","At the end of quarter, we had 2,525 employees, down 5% from three months ago, driven by our futures pit closures in July and staff reductions in August. Our headcount is down 11% from the same quarter last year. Stock-based compensation cost came in below our normal run-rate primarily due to higher forfeiture on expenses we previously recognized.","After some variability in our stock-based compensation last two quarters, we expect to revert to a run-rate of approximately $50 million per quarter. Modest fluctuations may result in future periods due to some changes in expectations regarding achievement of performance share targets.","Our composition ratio year-to-date is running at an industry leading 16.1%, down from 17.1% 2014 and 17.4% in 2013. During the quarter, it came in at 15.4%.","Looking at the non-operating income and expense line, our ownership in the S&P, Dow Jones joint venture drove the $26.6 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was up 33% from the prior year. We remain pleased with the investment we made in the index business, while also assuring, we continue to offer the world\u2019s leading index futures products on CME.","Turning taxes, the effective rate for the quarter was 36.3%. I expect the fourth quarter to be approximately 37% or a full year tax rate of 36.6%.","And now to the balance sheet: At the end of the third quarter, we had $1.61 billion in cash, restricted cash, and marketable securities. That is approximately $910 million above our $700 million minimum cash target. During the third quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances was $30 million. And year-to-date CapEx has totaled $85 million. We expect full year 2015 CapEx to be backend loaded in Q4 and should come in lower than we expected at approximately $125 million.","For the full year expenses, we initially guided to $1.31 billion which we reduced by $10 million last quarter, and I am going to reduce that by another $5 million to $1.295 billion. This includes absorbing a $12 million increase in license fees so far this year, based on volume growth. The guidance would result in a 2% expense reduction in Q4 compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis.","As we mention at this time every year, we have a large amount of marketing and customer related spend in the fourth quarter that will drive the sequential increase from Q3.","Finally, we communicated and adjusted 2016 transaction fee schedule across all six product areas to our customers last week. We expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 2%, assuming the same volume levels and product mix next year.","In summary, the third quarter of 2015 once again demonstrated the power of CME Group\u2019s business model. Broad-based volume growth from our divers product set and our disciplined expense management drove adjusted EPS up more than 20%, continuing our growth in the first half of the year. We also continue to generate a significant amount of excess cash which we plan to return to our shareholders.","With that, we would like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question, so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue if you have any further questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead sir.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. John, maybe just on some of the guidance, just on the market data, you mentioned in the fourth quarter, a little moderation. Just wanted to get a sense, given what you guys have done on like the waivers, what we should be expecting as you head into 2016? And then same thing on the expenses, obviously this year expenses have been well-controlled. Just wanted to think, next year what\u2019s the expense outlook, particularly what you mentioned just on like the equity compensation normalized?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks Mike, again this is John. In terms of the market data, as you can imagine, forecasting attrition is not an exact science. And revenue came in slightly lower than we had guided to. And we would anticipate it being slightly lower again in the fourth quarter. We are keeping a strong eye on it as we go into next year. As you know those that were grandfathered will now be paying the full freight amount which is approximately double what they are paying today.","We don\u2019t have any guidance on that as yet. We are working with our clients to make sure that we keep that -- any attrition down to as low as possible.","In terms of expenses, we are going through the budgeting process now. As you can imagine, we are focused strongly on expenses and will be giving guidance in the -- during the first quarter or -- I am sorry, end of the year conference call in January.","In terms of expenses we are down about 2% based on our guidance in the fourth quarter. Again, we are focused on expenses going into next year. And we will be making sure that we\u2019re optimizing the entire expense base during the budgeting process.","As it relates to stock-based compensation, what you saw this quarter was an adjustment because the grant date and the vesting date for the stock awards occurs annually in September and that the forfeiture rates are updated at this time, and because of the actions we\u2019ve taken over the last few years, we had adjusted to reflect the reduced number of employees.","We are anticipating going back to approximately a $15 million run-rate on stock-based compensation but there will be some variability in it going into next year because of the proportion of performance related stock awards will cause some fluctuation because they adjust, both based on our performance as well as performance of the S&P 500 or a group of peer companies.","Michael Carrier","And just the stock base is 11 and you\u2019re saying it\u2019s just going to 15. So, I just want to make sure I had that number right.","John Pietrowicz","Yes, it\u2019s been trending about 15. We had an adjustment last quarter because performance and in this year because of the reduced number of employees. So, it will go back to approximately $15 million run rate.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Rich Repetto","I guess my question is going to be broader; it\u2019s going to be on the topic of market data. And I\u2019m just trying to get your views as you see your peer or your competitor make a sizeable acquisition and with the strategy -- that there is going to be a lot more value placed on market data going forward. So I guess, I was just trying to see what your view on that was. Your market data has been performing nicely because of price increases, but just trying to see whether there is an expansion opportunity or what you think about that?","Phupinder Gill","Hi Rich, this is Gill. I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Bryan to address some of the specifics of our market data businesses. If you look at the market data business with CME, I think we pioneered the acquisition of IP, which we had the opportunity then to actually grow with respect to new products and indexes that the S&P, Down Jones joint venture has. And as part of the business of CME it\u2019s 25% before taxes and growing, as John pointed out in his remarks. I\u2019ll ask Bryan to add a little bit here.","Bryan Durkin","We\u2019ve really worked it consolidating our efforts in terms of our sales effectiveness with market data. And it\u2019s enabled us to position ourselves well on a global basis as part of our new client acquisitions or our core products across CME Group; market data is a big part of that element. So as we get new clients coming in, certainly part of that is recognized in terms of our market data. So, you can expect focus on direct new client, direct sales efforts from that perspective, development and commercialization of data analytics initiatives that we have underway, further growth in terms of our benchmarking services, and then further development of our S&P joint venture. So as Gill alluded to, we\u2019re intensifying our efforts from that strong relationship.","Phupinder Gill","Rich, you may also have seen that over the course of the last few years, as a result of CME Group\u2019s beginning to credit swaps, we have introduced a lot of analytical tools for our clients with respect to understanding what the impact of margin really; requirements are going to be as they combine their futures and their swaps portfolios. And so this all requires a lot of tool kits that we have passed onto our client base. And so that forms part and parcel, even though we don\u2019t charge for it. It\u2019s becoming a very important element of what our clients need and this has been a trend that has been the case for over the past several years.","Rich Repetto","Operator","Thank you. Your next question, Ken Hill of Barclays. Your line is open.","Ken Hill","So, I\u2019ve noticed in some of your marketing a lot more pointed advertising around the Eurodollar, particularly as it compares to products like Euribor futures, like deeper liquidities and good forward visibility and trading hours as someone overlap with London there. Has that generated much interest there from participants in the market? It\u2019s historically traded products like your Euribor. And are there any changes you guys might look to make to the sales force there to potentially I guess flush out that opportunity a little bit more and maybe use Eurodollar as a substitute product?","Sean Tully","So, this is Sean jumping in. So, in terms of our Eurodollar futures and Eurodollar options, absolutely, we\u2019ve seen an increased interest. We\u2019ve actually seen a very nice jump in the open interest in our Eurodollar options and particularly this year. The big thing to point that is 4 of our 10 largest market makers in 2015, are new. So they were not market makers in our Eurodollar options last year, number one; and number two, they are large market makers in the Euribor complex. So, we are definitely penetrating European marketplace in a very substantial way this year in way. In addition to that one thing I might update folks on in terms of Fed Funds. We did see as of yesterday that meeting, the probability of Fed tightening in December well over 40% and the probability according to our Fed Funds futures of tightening by March now well over 65%.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Dan Fannon","My question is for Gill and it\u2019s around kind of your views on M&A and how that might evolve if -- you just stay with some of the Fed Funds futures outlook. But is that if we\u2019re kind of in a scenario where things don\u2019t move that much next year, does that make you think about M&A more aggressively or just more tactically? And just kind of update us on your thoughts at this point?","Phupinder Gill","We are always looking at all opportunities as they exist there. And anything that will drive shareholder value for us or makes sense to our business, we will always explore. So, it doesn\u2019t have to be an exchange necessarily, it has to be a service or a growth initiative around what the client base needs. And so a lot of the analytical tools that we have been providing the marketplace over the last few years as a result of swap clearing, you can expect us to continue to work in that direction as we start seeing our market and the products that we are rolling out, grow. I talked a little bit about the 10year contract a short while ago. I think if there are any opportunities surrounding those types of things, either in the commodity space or in the financial space, we will explore them. Currently as you might know, we have CME venture group that has placed small bets on what I call, emerging trends in the marketplace that might lead to commercial arrangement that we might find with these firms, such as the one that we introduced with DOLAT [ph] couple of days ago. So, these types of things are always on our radar with a very clear view to what the future might hold for CME Group in this space.","Operator","Thank you our next question is Chris Allen of Evercore. Your line is open.","Chris Allen","You guys have done a very good job in the expense side, reducing the headcount. I am just wondering, do you see further opportunities moving forward? I mean potentially closing the pits option and for electronic [ph] is the obvious one but the other areas that you guys are focused on improving efficiencies? Where you think margins could get to in a very choppy environment over the course of the year?","John Peschier","Thanks Chris, this John. We\u2019re going through the budging and planning process now, and I think the entire team has a focus on running the engine as efficiently as possible. So, we are looking at -- or constantly looking at how we can optimize our expense base without impacting future growth. And you\u2019ve hit on one of them which is as we go electronic and if the market takes the option complex electronic, that has a potential to offer some cost savings. We also are looking at things like consolidating our data centers and continuing that process, optimizing our real estate footprints to make sure that we have the optimal space for our employees. We are also looking at utilizing contract services from outside the United States where we can provision them more cost effectively. As you take look at our headcount, I would imagine over time, you will see more headcount growing internationally because as Gill still indicated, that\u2019s where our growth is -- there is a large amount of our growth coming from overseas.","So, in terms of our overall margins, we\u2019ve got the highest margin right row since 2011 with incremental margins above 90%. So, I think there is no artificial limit in terms of how higher margin can go. In fact we\u2019ve hit a high of over 65% in the not so distant pat. So I think we don\u2019t look at it from the perspective of how high we can grow our margin, we look at it in terms of how efficiently we\u2019re running our expenses, what levers we have to pull to grow the top line and investing for growth. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. And as I mentioned, we are going to be reviewing with our board, our 2016 plan in the coming weeks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","So, I was hoping you could help me kind of characterize the competitive landscape right now in energy trading. Certainly you guys have very robust competition with ICE for a number of years and now you have NASDAQ coming into the market. Just how do you see things playing out at this point?","Derek Sammann","Yes, this is Derek. I think that you have seen us do I think a really nice job, focusing on what are the natural tailwinds in the energies market right. The energy market has certainly started oversupply on the TI side. That said, we are absolutely focused on making sure that we\u2019ve got a liquid set of poles of cross each of the benchmark products. We have been focused on making sure presence in TI in the future in the options. Brent is an area that we continue to have about 12% to 13% of. And certainly the trends we are seeing in the natural gas market, while we don\u2019t see necessary huge change in macro trends over the next 12 months, we are continuing to build on our market share that we solidified over the last probably 12 to 15 months there.","As it relates to the options business specifically in TI, we\u2019ve got 72% of our options in TI trading electronically, now that business is up 50%. And options is a real differentiator for us, because you look at the magnitude of our business, I think we\u2019ve got about 165,000 contracts ADV in our TI options. We compare that to your points on the competitive landscape with the ICE, they got 50,000 or 60,000 contracts. And we know that options volume perpetuates and strengthens the futures franchise but as an area of focus for us. And probably the last thing I\u2019d talk about, may be two other small pieces, there has been increasing movements on the potential lift in the export ban. It went through one side. We think there is a broader dialogue that we think is happening. So despite the fact that there is an election next year, the fact that is part of the dialogue in Washington right now, we think is very positive; we think it\u2019s a good story there. The Chairman actually testified to that couple of months ago in D.C. And then finally, if you look at the GSCI re-ratings preliminary announced a couple of weeks ago, we just think that speaks to really what the natural footprint of TI is in the global landscape. But as I said before, if we can\u2019t provide a full suite of products to our customers whether it\u2019s Brent, TI, even the Omani crude and DME that\u2019s -- it\u2019s what our customers need, what the customers choose if they want to trade.","Operator","Thank you. And next question is Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell","A follow-up on energy, for the power contracts in the third quarter, John, I don\u2019t know if you could outline a pro forma RPC for the energy complex, given the power contracts and so the run-rate going forward on that. And then also just if you can also talk about some of the new products, especially the Ultra 10-year in the financials, BTIC in terms of have promising and how quickly you think that can ramp up in the near term? Thanks.","John Pietrowicz","Sure, thanks Brain. I\u2019ll take the first one and then maybe Sean can comment on Ultra 10-year; that\u2019s a definitely product we\u2019re excited about. Just with regard to the energy RPC with the small sized, smaller priced power contracts, I can understand the disconnects, energy; RPC fell about $0.08 compared to last quarter. The lower RPC again was driven by those smaller sized lower priced contracts and the bulk of that all occurred in the month of September. I think when you take a look at the quarter, the ADV for power contracts this quarter was about 91,000, up from the ADV of about 5,000, last quarter. So if you normalize out the RPC for those power contracts, it\u2019s about $1.25 on everything else. So that\u2019s the impact. I think what we\u2019ll do in the future is we\u2019ll make sure on our monthly volume release that any unusual spikes in the power contract we\u2019ll make sure to call that out. I think the important thing is even with these lower sized, lower price contracts, our energy revenue was up 17% this quarter. So, really pleased with how energy has been performing. And I\u2019ll turn over to Sean to talk about the TN.","Sean Tully","Yes. So, in terms of TN, we\u2019re obviously very excited about that. There was an opportunity, participant came to us relative to earlier this year; the bond future jumped what we call the five-year gap in terms of the maturity spectrum of U.S. treasury bonds. So with that the TY future now has achieved to deliver seven years and the bond future has achieved to deliver 21-year, leaving a very wide gap for additional products.","So with customer feedback, we -- extensive customer feedback and excitement, we did decide to -- that we will launch TN or a 10-year future we\u2019ll achieve to deliver basket of 9.5 to 10 years. So, it has very positive feedback. We think it\u2019s a product that the marketplace has high demand for. Now obviously, very uncertain as to what the uptake will be, will we see significant opportunity for basis trading between that and other products.","As you mentioned also and as was mentioned during the script, several new equity products, right, so Russell 1000, Russell 1000 Growth and Value, the FTSE 100, FTSE Emerging Markets, FTSE China 50 have already done launch relative to our agreement with FTSE Russell to be their partner in terms of these products. And then we\u2019re very excited in 2017 to launch the Russell 2000. In terms of BTIC or Basis Trade Index Close, we are excited about this. This is the first time we\u2019re going to be offering that on Globex. Previously it has been a product that has been available in terms of block trading. What this does is it allows index driven asset managers to trade at exactly or a basis to index close every day, making it extremely efficient for matching their index. So, we are very excited about it; we\u2019ve had very positive feedback. Obviously there is uncertainty as to how much update you are going to get in the new product.","Brian Bedell","Great, and the 10-year note, is that launched later this quarter?","Sean Tully","We look at launching that in Q1 of next year.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is open.","Kyle Voigt","I guess just on the RPC guidance of 2% increase year-on-year for 2016 with the pricing changes go into effect, John, can you just give us some more guidance as to where we should expect the most significant impact; is it right to think about the ags rates of products to be most significantly impacted or what line should we expect to come through? Thanks.","John Pietrowicz","Sure, Kyle. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we announced an overall 2% price increase. I mean we looked at -- we looked comprehensively at our price levels, volume tiers and incentive plans and then strategically adjusted them. And as we mentioned, we took action across all of our asset classes. So, rates and energies were the highest impacted and FX and metals were the least impacted.","Operator","Next question is Amanda Yao of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Amanda Yao","This is Amanda; I\u2019m filling in for Ken Worthington. In terms of open interest, futures open interest is flat and options open interest is down year-over-year. Given the volatility is on a rise and we seem to be right on top of rate hike, why isn\u2019t open interest growing faster than it is?","Sean Tully","So in terms of -- this is Sean jumping in. The open interest down a little bit; we had a huge -- if you look at last year, October of last year was an absolutely phenomenal period of time. Let\u2019s recall for example in rates what happened. Last year, our rates complex was up 19% in terms of the ADV and if you look at October of last year, we had a number of events; we had a surprise easing by the ECB, we had potential for Greek exit, and we had the all-time record on October 15th of last year in terms of the exchange volumes. And that was in part due to the huge open interest at that time. If you recall, interest rate futures on day alone, we did over 25 million contracts.","So, we\u2019ve got some very tough comps right now. But in addition to that, the helpfulness of our business continues to grow without question. So looking at that in terms of large open interest holders and our industry complex, we\u2019ve reached an all time record in August. In terms of our FX complex, we also reached an all time record in large open interest holders in August. And the trend in large open interest holders continues to increase and penetration of alternative markets continues to increase.","So if you look for example at our treasury complex, one thing that we do talk about pretty often is the percentage of treasury futures that trade relative to the cash bond market. Just as a recollection, in 2013 that was 60%; in 2014 it was 65%; in 2015, we\u2019re running at 78%. So, all the indications are that it\u2019s a very healthy marketplace. So, I\u2019m focused on the financials. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Derek to talk a bit about commodities.","Derek Sammann","I think I\u2019d probably just add to that. In your decks for the presentation material, if you look at the slides 23, 24 and 25, we\u2019ve now provided clarity and a view into the large open interest holder on the commodity side of fence as well. And to the point that Sean made, we focused not just on the volume, but the quality of participation on our markets as well. So while we\u2019re seeing some short-term gyrations largely in the options side, which is fairly typical actually, it\u2019s much more volatile in the options OI, than the futures OI, we\u2019re appointing new guys to some clarity on the commodities open interest holding picture here as well. Particularly on page 23, on the energy side, if you look year-on-year, our large open interest holding is up almost 7.5% year-on-year. So the quality and the number of participants holding significant positions with us is equally important to us as the short-term gyrations in the options side.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is Rich Repetto of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Rich Repetto","I just want to have quick follow-up on the marketing. So John, you\u2019ve guided to 10 million down for the year, it looks like will be down even more than that. And just trying to see what\u2019s coming out of marketing this year and is there any bigger impacts as you cut the spend, looks dramatically year-to-year?","John Pietrowicz","Like I mentioned, we\u2019re expecting this quarter to be down about 2%, you\u2019re going to see the largest increase going from -- in our marketing line, going from Q3 to Q4; it\u2019s down about 2% from last year. The bulk of that is coming out of marketing. If you recall, we had some marketing spends and prior years that were really around the MF Global issues as well as some of the kind of the industry issues that were happening. And we reduced that down. We\u2019d always anticipated on reducing those costs and you\u2019re seeing them reflected now. So, I think we\u2019ll continue to see an uptick in terms of spend in marketing in the fourth quarter going into next year, but it will be down year-over-year. And it\u2019s not necessarily impacting growth at all because these are more kind of overall industry\u2026","Phupinder Gill","Campaign based.","John Pietrowicz","Campaign based.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, we have no additional questions in queue. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to the management for some closing comments.","Phupinder Gill","Thank you all for joining us this morning.

I would like to turn the conference over to John Peschier. Please go ahead, sir.","John Peschier","Thank you for joining us this morning. Gill and John will spend a few minutes discussing the results and then we will open up the call for your questions. Terry, Bryan, Derek, Sean, and Kim are on the call as well and will participate in the Q&A session.","Before they begin, I will read the Safe Harbor language. Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder Gill","Thank you, Mr. Peschier, and thank you all for joining us. It was an exceptional start to the year, with record quarterly average daily volume, which was up 13% compared with an already strong first quarter last year. We had very balanced growth in both financial and commodity products, each up double-digits. We track customer segment activity closely, and in Q1 we had more than 10% growth from asset managers, hedge funds, corporates, proprietary trading firms and retail clients during the quarter. Volume from banks was up 1%, which is strong relative to their decrease in their overall trading businesses over each of the last few years.","More recently, April activity has been fairly strong compared to last year, and is up more than 20% in total. It is encouraging to see relatively good volumes, as April has been our slowest month over the last two years. Open interest remains elevated and is up significantly since the beginning of the year.","This morning, I will start with our secular drivers and then I will shift to a few product highlights. We have consistently expanded our global participation in spite of the challenging macro environment. We are very pleased with the tremendous results from outside of the U.S. during the first quarter. We had record quarterly non-U.S. volume by far, as well as the highest proportion of the business from outside of the U.S. since we started tracking the information, with more than 25% in first quarter, compared to 23% in the first quarter of last year.","In Europe, we had a very strong first quarter activity, with volume increasing 28% form 2.3 million contracts per day last year to more than 2.9 million per day this year. The increase was led by equities, which jumped 70% and energy was up almost 50%. In Asia, energy was up 75% and equities grew by about 70%, with metals rising more than 30%.","Focusing on Asia for a moment. We have been discussing the opportunity to expand our user base to include Chinese firms and entities for many years. Our focus started primarily with intermediaries and we are now engaging directly with asset managers, hedge funds and other entities there. We generally look at our trading data in terms of what we see through mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In Q1, we reached approximately 200,000 contracts per day combined, which is up from 100,000 contracts per day in Q1 of 2014 and 125,000 contracts last year.","Our most notable recent success is in our energy franchise where we have seen mainland China average daily volume increase from less than 10,000 contracts in the middle of last year to more than 30,000 contracts in Q1. A highlight from Hong Kong activity is in our equity business, with average daily volume there more than doubling to almost 25,000 contracts per day in Q1. The surge in volume is great to see and we are very fortunate to have highly appealing products to offer these clients.","Based on the challenges in China over the last year, we believe many of these firms are comfortable trading in our regulated markets and benefitting from the significant liquidity we have around the clock. Speaking of that, in addition to the country of origin information we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q1, volume during Asian hours grew by almost 30%, while activity during European hours rose 60%. Liquidity begets liquidity, and we are displaying deeper electronic markets in both futures and more recently options around the clock.","Turing to our efforts in options, we remain a strong leader compared to other global exchanges, with Q1 Options volume hitting a record 3.5 million contracts per day, which is up 22% with electronic options average daily volume rising 26% to a record 1.8 million contracts. The continued electronification of our options franchise has enabled us to further globalize participation in our Options markets, with our European Options volume up 36% and Asian Options volume up 25% in Q1. Our continued investment in systems enhancement, new products, and client education are driving significantly increased usage of our Options products from end-users, with volumes from hedge funds and asset managers up 34% and up 29%, respectively.","A couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products, starting with interest rates. Volume rose 9% to more than 8 million contracts a day, and revenue increased by 14%, with Eurodollars leading the way. We hit record levels of open interest in Q1 in our rates business, driven by Eurodollar options and Treasury futures, which hit all-time highs. We also had very strong options activity with the highest quarterly volume ever, and reached a record percentage of the options trading on Globex in March, with 71% electronic in treasuries and 25% electronic in Eurodollars. So far in April, the electronic percentage in Eurodollar options has grown to 27%.","On the product development front, we mentioned our launch of the Ultra 10-year contract on our last earnings call. This product has continued to gain momentum, and has attracted attention with several articles written over the last month related to this innovative new product. In addition, we are pleased that we cleared our first Swaptions trade earlier this month, and we think this is yet another example of innovating and the interest of market with a customer-led solution.","We held a Swaptions Customer Webinar that attracted over 500 participants with significant follow-up discussions and we had a number of productive client events related to the product. Our dollar rate swaps market share reached the highest level in March that we have seen over the last six months, and we had a 15% pickup in revenue capture in swaps clearing versus Q4 last year.","Lastly, we are actively involved with a working group of intermediaries and customers on a potential Repo clearing offering. As that develops over the next quarters, we will share additional information.","Turing to equities. We are pleased with the start of the year, with Q1 volume up 28% and April up more than 30%. We have had solid activity in equity options, which grew 20% during the quarter. In Q1, our S&P 500 Options market share versus CBOE expanded to 29.4% from 27.8% last year. Open interest in equity options rose 13% compared to the prior year and our new BTIC order type continues to perform well and traded 20,000 contracts for the first time on March 31st.","Moving on to our commodities portfolio. These business lines, overall, were up 13%. Energy has been particularly strong, with record Q1 average daily volume of 2.5 million contracts. And April has continued to be robust, with volumes up almost 40%. WTI futures had a record quarter, averaging about 1.2 million contracts per day and gasoline futures activity was also at a record level. I mentioned the options earlier. And within energy, we had record WTI Options volume over 200,000 contracts per day and more than 145,000 contracts per day on Globex.","Our natural gas options were up 38% during the quarter, and we had a record percentage of volume traded electronically there. Additionally, we set a record number of large open interest holders in our energy futures in Q1. Our metals business was also a standout in the first quarter, with volumes up 23%. Our precious metals average daily volume was up 26%, led by options, which rose 36% in Q1.","As many of you know, we have made significant inroads into base and ferrous metals businesses, and we continue to expand our presence in these key growth areas. Our copper business is up 11% and we hit a new open interest record during Q1. We continue to outperform our primary competitor in this market, where we have posted faster growth in copper in each of the last five quarters.","In aluminum, we continue to expand our suite of aluminum offerings, achieving record volumes and increasing our open interest five-fold in the last 12 months. And in iron ore, leveraging our customer value proposition of global electronic trading of futures and options and customer anonymity, we have had growing open interest and a record trading day of almost 13,000 contracts. We have now achieved iron ore market share of 10% in Q1, up from just 3% in 2015, as we continue to successfully expand and diversify our global suite of metals products.","Finally, agricultural products have been particularly strong in April and are tracking toward a monthly average daily volume record for the month after a slow start to there. Trading has taken off based on production uncertainty in South America, where wet conditions in Argentina and dry conditions in Brazil are causing concerns. We had two consecutive record trading days last week in the overall complex, with almost 3 million contracts, including record soybean product volume above 1.5 million contracts on one of those days.","Electronic ag options are surging up from near 130,000 in April last year to more than 250,000 daily so far this April. Importantly, open interest in soybean and corn futures are up 16% and 8%, respectively, from last year. Finally, last week, we reached an all-time high in a large open interest holders in agricultural products.","In summary, we continue to work with our customers on bringing innovative risk management solutions through the market place and our product diversity is unparalleled. John will touch on our progress to continue to streamline our infrastructure costs, to reallocate our expenses to growth initiatives and to further innovate in our businesses.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Thank you, Gill, and good morning everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on three things: driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as we can, and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent way.","As Gill mentioned, we had a tremendous start to the year, with strong and balanced revenue growth. Total revenue was up 11% compared to a very strong quarter last year, while total adjusted expense rose just 3%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded to 65% and adjusted EPS of $1.15 was up 17%. Our rate per contract for the first quarter was $0.756, down 4% from $0.789 in Q4, as our overall ADV rose 29% sequentially. The biggest impacts were members versus non-member mix and volume discount tiers this quarter due to the large increase in activity.","Compared to the fourth quarter, our members\u2019 volume grew 30% and non-members jumped 23%. In addition, we had higher volume discounts in Q1 relative to Q4, as a result of significant growth in certain products. Market data revenue was up 4.5% compared to Q1 last year, and in line with our guidance. We continue to monitor this line carefully as we are seeing some rationalization as we bring all customers in line with the full priced offering, and we are seeing some screen declines due to recent bank staff reductions.","Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter totaled $327 million, up 3%, driven primarily by an $8 million increase in licensing and other fee agreements. Excluding license fees, our total expense year-over-year was approximately flat. And as a reminder, our annual guidance was a 1% increase on that basis. We ended the quarter with approximately 2,600 employees, with the majority of the hiring done in India and Belfast, which is part of our plan to reduce technology expense while improving service by staffing in those lower cost locations and reducing contractors.","Our compensation ratio for Q1 came in at 14.1%, compared to 16.1% for the full-year of 2015. Looking at the non-operating income and expense line; our ownership in the S&P-Dow Jones joint venture drove more than $26 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was up 13% from the prior year. We are pleased with the investment we made in the index business, while also assuring we continue to offer the world\u2019s leading index futures products on CME.","Now, turning to investment income. We had a meaningful increase in investment income, driven almost entirely by the returns generated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions. The rise in short-term rates at the end of the year resulted in an increase in investment income of $17 million. During Q1, we had returned approximately $10 million of that to clearing firms, which is displayed on the income statement under other non-operating expense. This amount is anticipated to increase as our investment returns grow.","We recently received approval to establish an account directly at the fed. At this point, the account will only be for clearing firm house positions held in cash. We are currently in the process of operationalizing the accounts with the fed. When effective, we expect to pass a higher rate to clearing members for their house positions than we do today. Cash held in segregated customer accounts will continue to be invested through commercial banks and the U.S. treasury securities as they are now. We expect that the house accounts will be operational in the next month or so. As in the past, we plan to continue to pass through the majority of the earnings back to the clearing members.","Turning to taxes. For the quarter, we ended at 36.3%, slightly below our guidance. And now to the balance sheet. During Q1, we paid almost $1.2 billion in dividends to shareholders, including our variable dividend and the first regular dividend. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.33 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. We added $130 million during the quarter, driven by the sale leaseback transaction of our data center with Cyrus One.","During the first quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $16 million, as we continue to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service, which is included in expense. We continue our intense focus on efficiency with the sale of our office buildings over the last few years, and more recently our data center. We are taking an asset-light approach, which will allow us to focus on running our core business. In 2015, we delayered the management structure, closed futures pits, reduced marketing costs, and focused on data center consolidation. So far this year, we have completed the sale of our data center, sublet excess office space in Chicago, announced the closure of our trading floors in New York at year-end, and have begun to offshore some positions, reducing compensation and consulting costs.","With the sale and leaseback of our data center, we will continue to operate our trading and clearing functions, as well as our co-location business, and we will continue to receive the corresponding co-location revenue. From an earnings perspective, this transaction is approximately neutral. In terms of expenses, we will see a net reduction in total quarterly expense of about $1 million primarily in depreciation and we expect a corresponding increase under interest expense.","Turning to the New York floor. We will save approximately $5 million of expense annually beginning in 2017, and possibly another $3 million per year if we can successfully sublease the space.","In summary, I\u2019m very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business. As you know, operating leverage in our business is significant, and this was clearly evidenced by the margin on incremental revenue of approximately 90%. We have outlined many positives going forward, including building liquidity around the clock and from around the world, innovating new products, getting access to the fed accounts which should benefit both our intermediaries and our shareholders, and continuing to focus on our efficiency strategy.","With that, we\u2019d like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question, so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue if you have any further questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning.","Phupinder Gill","Hi, Dan.","John Pietrowicz","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Fannon","Since your last call, there\u2019s been a lot of headlines around M&A, your potential M&A in your industry. And I guess, Gill, if you could update us on your thoughts around - your views around M&A like both large scale, as well as strategic; and then John, also maybe talk about the financial aspects as you guys think about returning thresholds around potential acquisitions?","Phupinder Gill","Yeah. Dan, I think the story is consistent in what we have spoken to you about in the past, we will continue our focus on our globalization, on the options growth, and I talked a little bit about a short while ago, and as well as what we are now calling capital efficiencies which is a combination of a bunch of things, which is essentially the - whether we are talking about clearing a OTC trade, the futurization of the market place with brand - brand new clients are the cross-margining in the compression and services that we offer And with that focus that we have, we continue to remain opportunistic with respect to any kind of opportunities that we might see that makes sense, for both ourselves, our shareholders, as well as our clients.","John Pietrowicz","Hi, Dan. This is John jumping in. We look at both organic and inorganic growth opportunities all the time. And really it\u2019s about creating shareholder value in the best way possible. So we look at acquisitions in particular, we look at it from obviously multiple valuation metrics, as accretive over time to earnings, does it create a value by looking at cash flow models. So, we look at kind of return thresholds. We usually use about 9% to 10% is kind of the threshold that we look at.","But I think for us it\u2019s, are we creating shareholder value, how is the best way to get from a strategic perspective to where we want to be, is it growing the business organically, investing the business organically, or is it purchasing good services or another company from somebody else. So, that\u2019s what we look at.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard Repetto","Yeah, good morning, guys.","Phupinder Gill","Hey.","Richard Repetto","So my question - good morning, Gill. Good morning, John. My question is on expenses. You\u2019re running significantly below the full-year guidance like we can come out with 1.15 and the guidance, I believe, is 1.18. And this is post - this was a high revenue quarter, and you get high payroll taxes. The other thing that go along with that, you\u2019re running significantly below on CapEx as well, the full-year run rate. So I\u2019m just trying to see what the expense, guys, whether it\u2019s\u2019 maintained, and if it is maintained, what could we be spend the stuff on, in the back three quarters?","John Pietrowicz","Sure. Thanks, Rich. Our expense control and running our business as efficiently as possible is a very big focus of the entire management team and it\u2019s really become part of our DNA. When we look at the expenses, the first quarter tends to be a slower quarter in terms of expenses as we build up and projects get launched in the second and third quarters. But if you look at slide 14, you can see the results of our focus on expenses. You can see that over time, we\u2019ve had expanding operating margins and we\u2019ve got incremental margins last year of 112% and 90% incremental margins this quarter, and operating margins around 65%. So it\u2019s been a large focus of ours.","In terms of the guidance, we are - we have guided to a very modest 1% increase in expenses ex license fees, that\u2019s - and we\u2019re not adjusting guidance at this time. But we are intensely focused on the business and running the business as efficiently as efficiently as possible. And what this does is, this allows us to free up cost for growth initiatives and some of the growth initiatives Gill outlined in his prepared remarks. And, for example, Swaptions is something that we\u2019ll be launching that maybe - Derek or Sean can comment on, as an example of what we\u2019re working on.","Sean Tully","Yeah, sure. In terms of our OTC clearing, which Gill talked about in terms of offering capital and margin efficiencies to the market place, we actually - we recently launched a BRL, interest rate swap clearing, which is a unique value proposition relative to our largest competitor. Mexican peso we launched a little over a year ago is doing extremely well. We did our first Swaptions trade very recently and we\u2019re very excited about how that will develop over the coming two quarters. And in addition to that, we\u2019re working very closely with the market place on Repo clearing, as Gill mentioned in his remarks. So we\u2019re talking to and working closely with the same set of folks that we worked with in order to launch our successful interest rate swap clearing initiative, and we\u2019re looking at replicating that with solving lot of the market places issues in the Repo, in particular in the treasury Repo market similarly.","John Pietrowicz","So, Rich, I mean, we are focused on expense management, we are focused on reducing infrastructure cost and freeing up those costs, invest in new initiatives like Sean just mentioned.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning.","John Pietrowicz","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Worthington","In terms of your use of the fed for house positions, how money can get placed with the fed under kind of the existing structure that you just got set up with the approval? And to what extent can you move beyond this for just house positions in the future? And then you mentioned the passing of the majority income back to clients. To what extend this just gives CME an opportunity to keep more as well? And I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t answer, but I\u2019ll ask it anyway. If so, how much?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Ken. We\u2019ve been very focused on driving our investment income line. In fact, if you take a look, since 2012, in the first quarter of 2012, we actually had an $18 million expense in non-operating income and now we\u2019ve driven that to a $5 million income on that line. So overall, when you look at how the earnings that we got from managing collateral, we earned approximately $7 million this quarter through investing that collateral, which is about double last quarter. It was driven primarily by the increase in interest rates. Access to the fed accounts will be for house positions held in cash, to the extent that that cash balance increase, with an opportunity for us to earn more, and we\u2019ll be able to provide more color on how much is about that impact next quarter when the fed accounts become operational. But to give you an idea about 20% of our $138 billion in collateral is house account related. Maybe Kim could comment on the fed account.","Phupinder Gill","The cash component of the 20% is lower and that\u2019s the part that we can - I think, Kim, it\u2019s $3 billion?","Kim Taylor","Currently the cash balances on the house positions is $3 billion. That\u2019s not a number that we control, it\u2019s a number that the clearing members control with the decisions that they make about what they post for margin. But obviously the return that they get and the funds that they post with us is part of that decision.","Phupinder Gill","And it\u2019s a higher return for our client base, one of the exciting things of having this fed account for us.","Kim Taylor","And then you asked about the customer accounts. Those are authorized. Our VAT process is underway between the regulators, that\u2019s\u2019 not something that we can really comment on the timing up, but we know that it is still being worked on.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sameer Murukutla","Hey, good morning. This is actually Sameer Murukutla on for Mike Carrier. Thanks for taking my question.","Phupinder Gill","Good morning.","John Pietrowicz","Good morning.","Sameer Murukutla","Good morning. I\u2019m going to just leverage off of Dan's question a bit. Can you provide an update on your thoughts into the level of your stake in BM&F given their current M&A that they are involved in? And any comments on the possible interest in the Indian Commodity Exchange? Thanks.","John Pietrowicz","Sure. This is John. BVM&F is one of our most important international strategic relationships, regardless of any ownership stakes. We continue to hold about 4% stake in BVM&F, the value of which has increased over $150 million since the end of 2015, and we\u2019ll continue to work with them as we have, historically. In terms of the India Exchange, we\u2019re not going to comment on any of the -","Phupinder Gill","Rumors.","John Pietrowicz","Rumors or our M&A activity there.","Sameer Murukutla","Okay. Thanks for taking my question.","John Pietrowicz","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Yeah. Hey, good morning.","John Pietrowicz","Good morning, Alex.","Alex Kramm","Good morning. Wanted to just touch on the energy business for a second here. Clearly one of the more impressive areas in terms of growth, but one of the things that always span or that has been spanning out, is that you are outperforming at least in terms of ADV, your primary competitor. So would love you to talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on there. And obviously, you all have different product mix. So maybe if you can drill a little bit deeper, not just about brands, but also about WTI, natural gas, gas oil, other areas where you are competing more or less directly, where you\u2019re winning and why you\u2019re winning, if you\u2019re winning? Thanks.","Derek Sammann","Yeah. Derek here. I want to say we\u2019re absolutely pleased but not fully satisfied with the growth that we continue to impact here on the energies business. I mean, we have - not only have we grown sort of record levels in Q1, we\u2019ve increased our large open interest orders, and it\u2019s been pretty strong for us. We talked last quarter about the benefits of the overall broad market adoption increasingly towards WTI, with the result of the lifting of the export ban in the U.S., and that\u2019s actually significantly increased participation in our markets on the futures, as well as the options side, but in terms of where we\u2019re going outside of that options, it has been a significant area of growth for us inside the energies business and I\u2019d actually also direct you to some of the comments that Gill made in his prepared remarks around where and how we\u2019re globalizing our footprint right now. If you look at where the growth of our business is coming from, our EMEA business for energy business up about 40%, that\u2019s outperforming the business as a whole.","What\u2019s really exciting is the investments that we\u2019ve made in boots on the ground sales campaigns and product sales in Asia for us is bearing significant fruit. Our Asian energy business is up 82% year-on-year and that is significant growth in almost every major trading center. I was in Shanghai and Singapore last week, meeting with a lot of our clients and we continue to be able to attract them with our functionality, both on the futures as well as the options side and the broad base of participation in our markets. So we tell a lot of the WTI story. There is a nat gas story. There is a gasoline story. We set an all-time record in our gasoline futures as well. So it\u2019s broad based growth, it\u2019s global growth and it\u2019s across our asset class in the presence of building OI and large open interest holders.","John Pietrowicz","I would just add to that specifically on the international side within Asia for example, we\u2019re seeing growth coming from each of our client segments in the energy quadrant. Props are up 31%. Banks interestingly enough were up 104%, hedge funds 96%. Corporate firms coming in 88%, retail 85%. We\u2019re seeing similar activities coming out of Europe. So for example, on the hedge fund and in the asset management community, 26% growth specifically in the energy quadrant. So it goes to our sales penetration and efforts in that regard in terms of how we\u2019re targeting our focus and our campaigns in these areas.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on market data, I don't think it was asked yet, but the 4% to 5% guidance for the year that you guys provided on the last earnings call, does that still hold or just kind of given some of the headwinds that you highlighted on the headcount reductions, should we think about a slower number, a lower number for the year?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Alex. When we provided guidance last year, we provided a range because it\u2019s very difficult to predict. We had given guidance at 4% to 5% growth rates. We came in this quarter, up 4.5% from Q1 last year, which is in line with our guidance. We are seeing pressure as customers move to our full priced offering as well as the decline in screen counts, as banks lay off staff as you\u2019ve probably heard from the bank\u2019s earnings calls. So we\u2019re very focused and working hard on our data business, but we\u2019re seeing some headwinds as you indicated.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Hi. Good morning, folks. Just to pile on the Asia question, thanks for all the disclosure on that. That was a good discussion you just had about some of the progress there. But I guess if you can think about or try to highlight how big you think this market can eventually be for CME in terms of penetration rates? Obviously the growth recently has been especially strong. But do you see this as just from an, say, ADV perspective being able to become as large as Europe let's say in the next two or three years? Can you talk about some of that penetration opportunity? And then also related to, John, I think you cited more projects in growth initiative spend later in the year. Is part of that included in that spending plan?","Phupinder Gill","Sure. Brian, this is Gill. I\u2019m going to start and I\u2019m going to ask Brian to basically expand more as to where he\u2019s seen growth specifically. If you look at the product opportunity set, if you look at the opportunity in terms of the products that we have, across all the asset classes that we have, we have highly relevant products for all of our clients in all places around the world. Within Asia specifically, we\u2019ve been focused over the last few years on China, but what we\u2019ve not talked about is the sales effort that Brian will go a little bit into other parts of Asia which I would say have more developed in terms of the education side of things, Korea comes to mind.","China, we have given you some numbers this quarter, specific to China, these are based on China, but they might be trading, they probably will be trading from outside of China. As China continues to expand its policies for access, you would see that number grow. The timing behind that remains to be seen, but as we sit here now, China is allowing and has allowed their intermediaries as well as their direct accounts such as the hedge funds, the prop shops and the commercial entities to establish operations outside of China and that\u2019s the flow that we\u2019re seeing. India is an uncapped opportunity at this time. There are very significant changes afoot in India that will also lend themselves and translate into opportunities for us. So with that broad view about China, and I am only talking about areas in which you will see the highest impact. I am going to turn it over to Brian to talk about some of the volume flows that we are seeing that are driving the high rate of growth there.","Bryan Durkin","With the respect to the efforts in Greater China and Hong Kong, and specifically, we are seeing revenues that are up about 51%, 56% growth in our volume that\u2019s been driven by energy, equities as well as some of our interest rate products. Within the segments, the growth is really coming crops, a growing number of private hedge funds and asset managers have also evolved. We are working very closely with our intermediaries to help bring that business into our markets. We are seeing some good traction in terms of liberalization of central state owned enterprises. For example, SOEs were permissioned up until about two years ago, 31, now it\u2019s about 112 or in that areas, so we are seeing that as additional opportunity. Sovereign wealth funds and asset managers are increasingly growing their business with us and again, we are focusing in that area and really building on opportunities to work with corporates, particularly insurance companies. We see more Chinese banks that are enquiring about trading our products and also looking to build their efforts enquiring about OTC clearing with us, which is a very good sign.","Within Taiwan, year-to-date volume and revenue was up about 40% and 36% respectively. The main drivers in those areas were equities, FX energy and interest rates. The main participants are banks, asset managers and again, we are seeing good opportunities with insurance companies. There has been some progress within Taiwan in terms of allowing securities firms to offer global futures that we are working very closely with our intermediaries to bring that business into our group.","Within Japan, we have seen a consistent growth of about 7%, revenues are up about 32%. You got to keep in mind, Japan is the second biggest holder of US debt, so there is great opportunities there. Main drivers have been from banks and we are seeing some nice growth coming from asset managers.","Gill alluded to Korea, we continue to see very nice growth coming out of Korea. It was two years ago that there were no Korean FCMs that had an average monthly volume of about 100,000 contracts. Today, we are happy to say that we have eight firms that are providing at least 100,000 sites per month which is great progress. And the drivers in that area are equities, rates, foreign currency and energy.","Singapore is up about 18%. Coming out of that region, we are seeing some nice growth coming from the banks in particular as well as proprietary firms and corporates and commercials.","Another area that we are very excited about is Australia, we really haven\u2019t mentioned. Our volume this year in Australia was up 12% and our revenues are up I think approximately 50% if I my memory serves me correctly. The top three products are interest rates, ags, equities. Ags are up about 27%, foreign currencies are up about 39%. Our main focus in working with Australia again is within the asset management community, hedge funds and the banks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Hey guys. A question on your margins. I mean a great margin quarter, 65%, I mean I think that\u2019s one of the best results you guys have ever had. If we think kind of bigger picture and you guys keep delivering double-digit volume growth and 90% incremental margin, your margin is going to move up fast in a hurry. So just wondering is there a limit where you guys are really comfortable about taking the margin to before we start seeing a fairly sizable increase in the expenses or is that really nothing for us to be focused on at this point in time?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks. This is John. Yes, we are limited by 100% is our limit. But in all seriousness, we are - we continue to run the business as efficiently as possible. As you can see from the amount of volume we have been able to handle without any issues, we have been able to handle that this quarter without any incidents. So I think for us we do have natural increases to our cost and over time and that will be inflationary things, salaries, wages and the like. But we are - we provide a tremendous amount of value to our clients and so as more liquidity comes into the marketplace, there is more trading that occurs, which is tremendous benefit to our business and the amount of volume that we are able to handle, we have been proven out to be able to handle that.","Other things that kind of impact the margin is also license we pay on equity contracts primarily. So there is some share that impacts kind of our margin level. But there is nothing artificial out there that prevents that from going higher.","Phupinder Gill","Chris, this is Gill, I\u2019d like to just add to what John said, John is spot on with respect to the current operating structure that we have and product as we continue to innovate across the asset classes. But as we roll out new and innovative products or services in response to what our client needs are and in conjunction with the capital efficiency goal that we have for our clients, the repo clearing service is one such thing and that\u2019s a separate infrastructure from what we currently have. John has fine-tuned the current infrastructure to hum like you're seeing it now and within that construct the operating margin can absolutely grow. But as we introduced more things for our client base you may see a slight reduction depending upon the success of the products and services that we rollout.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Ken Hill","Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up on the market data specifically those customers who are rationalizing their behavior and I guess choosing to turn that service off. Are those guys who may be didn't need it to begin with and just realized that were paying for it or did this actually just get to be too high a price for them to pay? And I guess if it is that latter part, is there any flexibility within the service to really tailor market data for what a customer needs over time? Potentially could you be rolling out new products that might meet some of these people's need to have gone away recently?","Phupinder Gill","This is Gill, I think as John alluded to in his remark and in response to one of the questions, a large chunk of that is coming from the layout at that we see the banks are undergoing with respect to pricing pressure being too high. If you compare our market data fees to the exchanges that we compete against, you\u2019ll see that we are lacking behind them in terms of price but terminal and price, so we don't think that the issue we think is firms rationalizing their needs all the time. Bryan, you might want to add?","Bryan Durkin","No, I mean you certainly hit it, as the full fair came into play we did expect that there might be some drop off from individuals that may be using a particular screen and not really utilize for trading quite frankly but observing the markets. Those level of users have been pretty small, I mean the biggest impact as Gill had referenced is the rationalization that we\u2019re seeing from firms that have been consolidating their operations and making those decisions with the respect of reduction in staffing and layoffs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Kyle Voigt","Thanks for taking my question. So I was just wondering if you could comment on competitor energy platform, NFX. It looks like they will begin charging for some fee for trading with the phase in period starting next month. Do you believe the momentum that they have had in building open interest to market share is sustainable after they begin to charge for trading? Are you hearing any feedback or pressure from your clients regarding them being unhappy with trading fees or other services? Thanks.","Derek Sammann","Hey this is Derek. Thanks for your question. Now I think you see when we look at the status of where our natural gas business is, if you look at the six months prior to FX launches, or we were averaging in natural gas options where they\u2019re making the hard push right now. That 70,000 contract today, if you look at the last six months, our ADV is close to 100,000 contracts. So we\u2019ve grown that business 40% over the course of time that NFX has come into the market and to the extent that we\u2019ve got the fastest growing part of the natural gas options business for us is electronic nature of that business, a record 25% of our natural business is trading electronically, they\u2019re driving that 40% growth. If you look at what NFX is putting up, it\u2019s a block business it\u2019s not electronic and is only on the financially settled side. So, given the fact that we\u2019ve added 30,000 contracts ADV since pre-launch of NFX, the post-launch and they are doing 12,000 to 15,000. We\u2019re not seeing any real feedback from customers asking us to do anything different other than continue to scale infrastructure electronically and grow the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA. Please go ahead your line is open.","Rob Rutschow","Good morning. Just one more follow-up on the market data question. Are you able to size the bank industry in terms of the overall screen count? Does it look similar to the contribution to trading volumes? And then separately, does opening an account at the Fed give you any sort of long-term growth opportunities aside from just picking up the extra spread that that provides? Thanks.","Bryan Durkin","It's Bryan, on the market data side, yes we are able to size across the user base, the profile of user and while we saw a down trend this past quarter with specifically within the bank sector, I can't comment whether or not we're going to see it continue trend going in that direction. What I can say is that we are closely monitoring our performance and have every expectation to continue making a good progress we have with market data.","Phupinder Gill","The opening of the Fed account also give both our customers as well as us additional opportunity.","John Pietrowicz","On the Fed counts in particular for our customers it does allow us to offer them a significantly increased return on their cash. So it should make us a more valuable proposition for them.","Operator","And your next question comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard Repetto","Yeah, thanks for the follow-up. Gill, on the presentation you talked about these - and this is page 16, the secular drivers of growth and it being the potential for more futures and options volumes due to capital efficiencies. And I was wondering can you give us an update on cross margining? I figure it was $3 billion or so? And I guess what your expectations here and not having the dealer volume in over the counter interest-rate swaps, what do you think about the potential there of cross margining?","Phupinder Gill","I will start and ask Kim to add here. The capital efficiency title has at least two or three things beneath that that might be helpful for your think about I would say in terms of the opportunities being efficient for client base futurization at the top of that list, so developing products in-house that our customers can use on the more capital efficient basis is one of the things that we have been doing and we will continue to actually do. If you look at the compressions services that we implemented not too long ago up to this point in time we\u2019ve had $21 trillion in notional value that have been compressed over time and then if you look at the performance of the OTC market itself, it has taken an uptick from the fourth quarter of last year. Now this value proposition, this group of value propositions that I just described no one else can provide that. The compression in conjunction with the cross margining and in conjunction with the futurization are opportunity. So I think from that perspective we are quite excited as the interest rate environment continues to shift.","Kim Taylor","And then I would just add I think this is not something that is exclusive to CME, but CME is working with the industry to try and get better recognition for customer margin in the treatment of capital at the bank level, that will be a very significant element in reducing the cost of doing business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Hey, hello, again for a follow up I guess. Want to go to your equities business for a minute on that slide that you had on equities I think it is page 10. You mentioned that on the S&P 500 options I guess options on futures you now have - your market share increased relative to CBOE. I don't think you have talked about that business on a competitive basis in the past or in those terms. So just wondering if this is an active focus of yours to kind of look at that market and compete more aggressively and maybe quote away the user base from the securities based options to the futures market. So any color there will be interesting. Thanks.","John Pietrowicz","So we are always focused on the clients and the value that we add to clients and therefore we are also always focused on market share. So in each and every one of our businesses, we are continuously focused on our direct competitors, but also substitute products and making sure that we add the most value. So while we may not have talked about this as actively before, this is certainly something that we look at very closely. In particular, if you look at that business, we are very focused on the ability to cross margin obviously the underlying futures against the options as most efficient platform possible.","We are continuously focused on TCA or total cost analysis. We've talked about this across each of our different business lines. If you recall at the beginning of last year, Greenwich Associates did a big study that looked at our interest rate futures as always being the lowest cost relative to the interest rate swaps industry in terms of representing risk. Similarly we have come out last year with something called the big picture and then we did an update this year again with the big picture. But we are showing that as an example, our equity futures far more efficient for investors for giving exposure to the equity market than ETFs. So we are continuing to look at the substitute products both from a customer client value proposition, but also from a market share perspective.","Operator","And our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","So speaking of portfolio margining, wondering if you can comment on the LSE Deutsche Boerse planned merger and whether some of the capital efficiencies that they are proposing would impact you guys competitively I think specifically with regard to your rate clearing business, your rate swap clearing business?","Phupinder Gill","Patrick, this is Gill. I think on the first part of your question you should ask them, willing to talk about the opportunities. On the second part of the question I had to go back to what Sean had said before. The whole focus on the competitive dynamics of what we all do to here and so we believe and as I said we are the best value proposition for our client base and we intend to grow upon that.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the program back to management for closing remarks.","Phupinder Gill","Thank you so much for joining us this morning and we look forward to talking to you in the next quarter.

Gill and Jamie will spend a few minutes outlining the highlights of the quarter, and then we'll open up the call for your questions.","Terry, Bryan, Kim and Bob Zagotta, Head of Products and Services, are on the call; while Sean Tully, our Head of Rates and OTC; and Derek Sammann, who is in charge of Options, FX and Metals.","Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language.","Statements made on the call and in the slides on the website are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.","These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.","Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill","Good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'm going to highlight CME Group's third quarter, and then turn it over to Jamie to review our financials. Our focus this morning is about what's new and relevant during the quarter.","We've made some good traction since our last earnings call in terms of the core business and expanding our OTC clearing activity. Within our core futures complex, third quarter average daily volume was up 11% compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by continued strong growth in interest rate and mad metals.","We drove strong growth in electronic trading volumes outside the U.S. in our entire business.","For the third quarter, Latin America volumes are up 23%; Asia volumes are up 22%; and in Europe, activity rose 15% compared to the third quarter 2012.","We have been investing considerable time and effort in these areas, and I'm glad to see it driving volume and revenue growth.","In addition, we are making a concerted effort to drive growth in our options business globally. This business increased by 31% in third quarter 2013 versus last year.","Both interest rate and equity options were up 54%, and FX options rose 32%. In September, our treasury options reached an all-time high of 57% electronically traded on CME Globex.","Overall, in October, approximately 48% of our total options volume traded electronically compared to 35% in all of 2012.","Additionally, options trading from European clients jumped by more than 100% in Q3 to more than 100,000 contracts per day.","Asia and Latin America were each up over 70%. Lastly, within the natural gas options, our market share jumped above 70% in September compared to a range of 50% to 60% for much of the year.","As I mentioned, one of the main drivers of the top line growth this quarter was interest rates. Average daily volume was 5.8 million contracts per day in Q3, up 27 -- up, I'm sorry, 29% versus Q3 2012, and open interest to-date through October was -- is up more than 60% since the beginning of the year.","All 4 of the major components of our rates business, Eurodollar futures and options, and treasury futures and options, were up more than 20% in Q3.","Eurodollar options volume had particular strength, up 56%, with volume rebounding in the front month of the curve during September, which we haven't seen in a long time. That is illustrated on Slide 10 in our earnings deck.","Turning to interest rate OTC clearing. We continue to see a dramatic increase in our credit swaps business. Our market share in the dealer-to-client business has grown from 5% in Q1 to 14% in Q2, 31% in Q3 and 33% so far in Q4.","We averaged $81 billion per day in the third quarter, doubling the activity from the second quarter 2013.","So far, the fourth quarter is up 26% sequentially to $102 billion.","Now that the 3 waves from the Dodd-Frank clearing mandate are behind us, the market is shifting from a compliance phase to an optimization phase. This is a common scene we hear from market participants in our meetings.","With increasing client demand for greater capital efficiencies, we now have 6 clearing members live with portfolio margining of cleared OTC interest rate swaps and interest rate futures, including a few who started offering their solutions to customers within the last month.","In addition, product expansion has also played a key role in market share gains. During the third quarter 2013, we launched the Singapore dollar, which is our 17th interest rate swap currency and puts us in line with our competitor. Open interest within OTC is something we and market participants are monitoring closely as we move closer to 50% market share.","Interest rate swap open interest is currently north of $7.4 trillion and has increased by more than $3.2 trillion since our last earnings call.","During this time, our main competitor has added about $500 billion.","Clearly, we have done extremely well attracting Phase 2 clients, made up primarily of asset managers, insurance companies and GSEs, and we are pulling in more high turnover customers as well.","The bottom line is winning the dealer-to-customer OTC business strengthens our overall franchise and opens up avenues for core revenue growth.","Although it is very difficult to quantify and is still in early stages, we are seeing evidence that our interest rate complex is benefiting from a migration of activity from OTC into futures.","Since May, we have seen more than 20% growth in our interest rate complex each month when compared to the same month of the prior year.","This year, we have seen a significant shift in the use of treasury futures versus cash treasuries as evidenced by cash market penetration, which you can see on Slide 13.","Our interest rate nonmetals percentage, which tends to be driven by the so-called real money clients, rose nicely from Q2 to Q3, which helped the rate per contract.","In addition, if you look at the CFTC commitment of traders who bought on our website, it shows a noticeable increase in asset management participation within Eurodollars increasing from 11% of the open interest to more than 15%.","Lastly, our Deliverable Swap Futures activity continues to grow. We had the strongest roll month in September. And building on that, in October, we had the strongest non-roll month to-date.","During the turbulence of October, we performed relatively well despite market uncertainty related to the debt ceiling and the government shutdown.","During several weeks, economic data was not readily available, and in some cases, the market adopted a wait-and-see approach as the situation developed.","Nonetheless, we did what we do best, which is to continue to provide an avenue for our clients to manage risk and express their views.","In October, our total average daily volume was up 12%, with rates up, as well as equities, which benefited from heightened volatility during an interesting month.","I'm very excited about the growth trajectory of the company, and our entire employee base had done a tremendous job focusing on execution in the midst of a challenging macro backdrop with low interest rate environment.","Now I will turn the call over to Jamie to discuss the financials.","James E. Parisi","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was a solid quarter in many respects. Average daily volume was up 11% compared to the third quarter last year, outperforming our major peers.","Adjusted EPS came in at $0.75, excluding FX-related benefits and several tax impacts.","We have seen a drop in our overall tax rate this quarter, and the benefit will be ongoing, which I'll touch on later.","Now let's get into some of the details, starting with revenue. The rate per contract for the third quarter was $0.762, up from $0.748 last quarter. The main driver was strong nonmember participation during Q3 relative to Q2, particularly in interest rates and energy.","OTC swaps revenue for the quarter was up almost $5 million sequentially to $11.5 million, driven by a 100% jump in interest rate swap clearing activity.","In addition to our success in attracting real money clients, we have also been successful in executing our strategy to attract high turnover clients, primarily large hedge funds, which on a sequential basis, led to a contraction in the average rate per million.","I want to clarify that although the rate we capture has decline due to an increase in the mix of high turnover participants, we have been able to substantially grow the higher-paying customer base as well, which includes asset managers and insurance companies.","During the third quarter, the total notional amount cleared by this customer segment was up 115% sequentially, with revenue up 94%.","In comparison, during the same time frame, the total notional amount cleared by the high turnover participant base was up 138%, and revenue was up 125%.","Overall, as Gill noted, we are pleased to see IRS in dealer-to-client market share jump from 5% in Q1 to 33% so far in Q4.","Our Q3 interest rate product line revenue was up 32% to $181 million. And if you add the incremental interest rate swap revenue, the total rates related revenue was up 40%. That's our thinking about this business.","The OTC clearing business is strengthening our overall interest rate franchise.","Moving on. Total third quarter operating expense was $314 million, which included a foreign exchange benefit of $12 million, reversing the Q1 FX expense of the same amount.","Excluding the FX benefit, as well as other items noted in the reconciliation, expenses would have been $325 million. As you'll recall, I guided to a higher expense level for the second half, and that is playing out.","A couple of different areas that impacted us this quarter. The primary contributor to the sequential increase was in professional fees, which tends to have more variability than other expense lines from quarter-to-quarter. This was up $7.7 million versus prior quarter, due to an increase in IT and legal consulting fees, higher market studies expense and higher public relations and brand consulting fees.","Within the compensation line, we had $3.2 million of deferred comp expense based on the strength of the equity market during the quarter. Keep in mind that this expense is offset 100% in the interest income line.","Lastly, in Q3, license fees did not fall as much as would be expected from the seasonal decrease in equity volumes, as we are now recording our OTC revenue share expense in this line item.","Turning to nonoperating income. The main thing to point out is interest expense dropped from $39 million to $35 million based on the pay-down of $750 million of debt in August. We expect that to increase back to $40 million in Q4 based on full quarter impact of the debt we took on in early September and an increase in our clearing house credit facility.","The total interest expense and borrowing cost line is expected to drop by $30 million in 2014 to approximately $123 million from $153 million this year.","We had put in place an interest rate lock in August of 2012, which generated $128 million, which is included in our current cash balance, and which also reduces the all-in accounting effective rate on our recent 30-year bond issuance by about 50 basis points to 4.8% per year.","With respect to taxes, excluding the FX impact and noncash deferred tax items, as well as other prior year tax benefits, the effective tax rate was 35.6% this quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet. We had almost $1.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, along with an additional $750 million held in cash for the February 2014 debt pay-down.","During the third quarter, capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $36 million, bringing us to $91 million so far this year.","In terms of guidance, I said last quarter we expected 2013 expenses to range from $1.25 billion to $1.26 billion, and I anticipate that expenses in Q4 will be close to $325 million, which means we expect to be nearer $1.26 billion, including $6 million of deferred compensation expense year-to-date.","In terms of CapEx, I expect between $130 million and $140 million for the year, which is down from my prior estimate.","Within market data, we recently announced to clients we are expanding our fees for professional screen from $70 per month to $85 per month beginning in January 2014.","We are making very good progress in the sale of our building in New York City. Contrary to some media reports, we have not yet closed the transaction, although we are working diligently to complete it by year end. Assuming we close it, we plan to include the net proceeds in our annual variable dividend.","For modeling purposes, you should know our cost basis for tax purposes is fairly low, so apply our tax rate to whatever you assume we will sell the building for to arrive at estimated cash flow.","In contrast, there will likely be a loss for GAAP purposes as the building had been revalued on our balance sheet at the time we merged with NYMEX.","Lastly, we've made some great progress on the tax front. We had previously guided in the 38% to 39% range. At this point, we expect 37% to 38% going forward in Q4 and beyond.","In summary, we continue to focus on investing for the future. In particular, we have positioned ourselves to fully take advantage of the changing regulatory and competitive landscape, as well as the medium-term favorable cyclical trends.","As always, while investing in our future, we also remain intensely focused on generating excess capital and returning it to our shareholders.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions.","[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","My question is on the OTC, Jamie. So it looks like in the quarter was really the tail of whatever 1 month -- or it was improved overall, but you're doing roughly $60 billion in the first 2 months and then $120 billion average in September. So I guess, the question is on the rate, what was the rate exiting when you really did -- when you jumped the average clearing level up to $120 billion? Was it above the $2.15 rate per million we calculate right now for the quarter?","James E. Parisi","Rich, if you look at the interest rate swap rate for the quarter, excluding CDS, we're around $2.70 per million for the quarter. And as we said in the -- as I said in my remarks, there was an increase -- bigger increase in the high turnover players than there were -- than there was in the real money players, resulting in kind of that decrement versus the prior quarter. Also in the quarter, we saw some of the shorter-dated products like FRAs and OIS grow as a percentage of the volumes. So there were about 22% of volume in Q1. They've grown to about 33% in Q3, and we're continuing to see that mix grow somewhat. And in September, it did grow versus August, and we did see a growth in the higher turnover relative to the real money in September as well. So likely, you would see a decrease in the September rate going coming out of the quarter.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And would that continue into -- October's running at about $100 billion. So similar trend, is that fair to say?","James E. Parisi","I haven't dived down into the October numbers yet. So it's hard for me to say exactly. But you'd think that those trends look like they were moving in that direction, so perhaps. Just overall, we're very pleased with the business, pleased to see the growth that we're getting there. And as Gill mentioned, it's really, I think, helping us in our core.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question for Jamie as well, this one on the variable dividend. Jamie, cash continues to build up nicely. Can you just update us on how much cash and working capital you'd like to hold for the business and tuck in acquisitions? And should we think of the $128 million of proceeds from that August interest rate swap lock as eligible for this year's variable dividend something you also want to pay back to shareholders?","James E. Parisi","Yes. Thanks, Howard. Yes, on the proceeds from the interest rate lock. That would just go into the cash balance that we would consider for a return. We haven't changed our guidance on the amount of cash we want to hold. Minimally, we want to have $700 million on the balance sheet to cover our skin in the game in the various financial safeguards package -- packages, as well as to have a little bit of cushion there. So that hasn't changed at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, a little bit more big picture. I think one of the things Gill highlighted was the excitement about the options and the really strong growth there. So maybe you can give us a little bit more detail what really this is driving? I mean, is this just the macro-environment? Because you had talked about the low volatility environment little bit. But how much are you actually driving this to? I think a few years ago, there was a huge drive to get options a little bit more electronic. Are you educating your customer base more? So I guess, what I'm getting is, is this more macro? Or is this -- do you think this growth is sustainable and will continue even in a better, more volatile environment?","Phupinder S. Gill","Alex, this is Gill. I'm going to start, and I'm going to ask Mr. Sean Tully and Derek Sammann to add in their particular asset classes. I think, on both of those notes that you mentioned, there is a big macro affect, where the direction is clear, but the timing of the direction is not clear. So in times of uncertainties, such as those options become a very valuable tool. Regarding the electronification of options, it has been an effort of ours, particularly, I would say, in the last 9 months or so. And if you -- the results there across all the asset classes. Sean or Derek, would you like to add?","Derek Sammann","Sean, you're on the rates side?","Sean Tully","Sure. If I could jump in on the rate side, I think the question was in terms of the macro pictures, as well as driving the volumes. In terms of driving the volumes, over the last few years, we bid in a number of new interest rate options products. We added the weekly treasury options, the long green Eurodollar options, the blue mid-curve options, the gold mid-curve options, the purple mid-curve options. So we have been driving with increased product relative to the macro-environment. There's no question, the macro-environment has been very helpful, while the Eurodollar options in Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year was up 54%. We had red mid-curves, for example, up 265%, and green mid-curves -- these are, again, mid-curves on the Eurodollar options, up 262%. But in addition to that, if we look at new products on the interest rate side, mostly options based over the last 3 years, they've contributed 315,000 ADV in Q3.","Derek Sammann","And just adding to that, I think, taking a step back in terms of the broader options business, we transacted a little over 2.2 million contracts in our options across-the-board across asset classes, and what we're recognizing is the scale and the scope of our cross-asset options is unique to this business. It's also unique in that volumes on the options side drives income from volumes for the delta hedgers into our futures business as well. So that incremental increase of electronification from 43% from 35% last year is significant and very intentional on the part of our sales teams in our effort to approach the market with a broader options sales pitch and the core capabilities that CME Group has across asset classes. You'll see here more from us on our overall options business going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So you guys, from what I recall, haven't changed your pricing tiers and rates, products since -- I want to say, since 2008. And more recently, you've had some really strong volume periods. And particularly on the long and the mid-curve, I think you're tracking above precrisis volume levels for 2013. So I just wanted to kind of see what your thoughts are on the potential opportunities for raising volume tiers, especially in the treasury products, just given the more positive volume outlook?","James E. Parisi","Yes. This is Jamie, Jillian. I think you're absolutely right. Before the crisis hit roughly every 18 months or so, because of the way the volumes are growing, we were adjusting our tiers, particularly on the interest rate products. We pulled back from that, obviously, during the crisis as our customers were suffering as well. But as we come out and as we see sustained growth in those volumes, we'll certainly be taking a look at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, Jamie, just thinking about expenses, maybe into -- even into next year when you're budgeting, if we look at kind of the last few years and the revenue environment, assume that continues into next year, is there any either step-up, step-down or movement in expenses that you would highlight, given kind of the investments you guys have been making and potentially need to make going forward?","James E. Parisi","I think what you've heard us say before is over the long run, we would anticipate our expenses to grow in the mid-single digits. I don't anticipate it being too different than that in the coming year. Certainly, we've been making investments over the last several years in growth opportunities, so those -- many of those are already built into our base, although there are, obviously, incremental expenses as we grow those offerings further. So I don't see any giant moves. I mean, one of the things I highlighted in my comments was the -- while overall interest expense is lower, there is a higher expense next year because we have a significant increase in our clearing house credit facility. Going into next year, that will be one thing that we'll add, as an example, but will look for other ways to control expenses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neve Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","The residual interest -- I guess, the CFTC just passed last week, say, various consumer protections. But one of the issues that's been kind of a discussion topic among all the FCMs has been the residual interest requirement and how that's going to significantly increase the capital they'd be required to keep. And we think it's going to be really tough for some of the smaller FCMs to stay in the business to that effect. How do you think about how these impact your business? Because I've heard how your chairman's presented to regulators their thoughts on it, and it didn't seem very positive. So help me think about, okay, it's been passed, so what's next and how to think about potential impacts?","Phupinder S. Gill","Neve, Terry Duffy is on the line. Terry, are you there?","Terrence A. Duffy","Yes, I'm here, Gill. Do you want me to start, Gill, or no?","Phupinder S. Gill","Sure.","Terrence A. Duffy","Neve, on that residual interest, and as you know, we felt that was a very flawed proposal from the beginning. We worked very closely with the smaller FCMs and with the agricultural community. I testified just as well as 2 weeks ago with the agricultural community and other participants, and it was the first time in my 20-year history that I've seen all sides -- both sides of the aisle agree that this rule was not -- it was fought with all kinds of dangers, and it was, obviously, the CFTC took notice, and they switched to the rule, which was originally an FIA proposal, which has nothing for the first -- next year, so it will stay as the same as it is. And then it'll go to the T1 at 6:00 p.m. the following day, and then 5 years from now, it could go to 9:00 a.m. So that's 5 years away that could happen. We're going to continually work with ag groups and with the CFTC and with the folks on the Hill to make sure that we get the 5-year piece removed from this. It makes no sense. If it made any sense at all, they would have been posted on day 1, not 5 years down the road. So we feel fairly confident that this residual interest rule is basically dead.","Phupinder S. Gill","Neve, if I can add, I think the CFTC, to the Chairman's point, has also committed to complete an analysis in the next 2.5 years or so. And I think the experience that the FCM community shares in the next 2.5 years is going to be important with respect to what the CFTC would decide. So the compromised solution that they came up with was to extend the time. I think the next few years is going to be very important here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMC.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on the interest rate swap volume. It still seems pretty tepid versus original investor and also market participant expectations. I guess, first, do you share this view? Second, is there an explanation? I guess this could just be early days, and there's more volume to come, or maybe there's something that we've all just been missing. And then third, given the size of the OTC market, there would still seem to be the potential for meaningful upside like orders of magnitude, better volumes than we're seeing today. Is that potential still realistic? Or based on what we have seen and maybe now know, is that really off the table?","Phupinder S. Gill","Ken, I'll ask Sean to chime in on this.","Sean Tully","Sure. I think we've seen very good growth. If you look at our market share this year, it went from 5% in Q1 to 14% in Q2 to 31% in Q3 and 33% so far in Q4. So we have seen a very good growth. That 33% market share is of the dealer-to-customer business, and obviously, that's being driven out of the Dodd-Frank regulations where we've seen a Category 1, Category 2, Category 3 phases this year. We do expect further growth. We do expect increased -- hope for an increased market share. But in addition to that, we will see increasing products. As Mr. Gill have mentioned earlier, we're now clearing 17 different currencies, but we'll be -- we will continue to increase our product scope with increases -- we will be adding emerging -- some additional emerging marked currencies in the near future. And there will be other OTC products that we'll be adding. In addition to that, you have to look for Europe. The mandate to clear has not yet hit Europe, and we expect the mandate to hit Europe, probably, the end of 2014 or sometime in 2015. So with the increased product scope, increased market share, as well as increased requirements to clear, we think there's a lot of runway.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But Europe is about 1\/2 the market though, and we're clearing $100 billion a day. That doesn't -- still doesn't get to the orders of magnitude that the size of the market might have originally suggested. Any thoughts there?","Sean Tully","Yes. We've been focused on the dealer-to-customer business. Obviously, the dealer-to-dealer business is quite large as well. And we believe that with our portfolio margining, we have a unique value proposition, where people can portfolio margin between CME's interest rate futures and our -- the swaps cleared at CME Group. We believe that we'll be able to penetrate other parts of the market as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a numbers question here. The fee increase you're going to be expecting in market data beginning next year, what kind of impact do you expect that to have on revenue?","James E. Parisi","If you were just to hold terminals constant, which you have to make your own estimates about that, but if you held terminals constant, I want to say it's roughly a $50 million impact on revenues next year, again, assuming that you don't see a decrement in terminals as a result.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Actually, if I could just follow-up on that question a little bit. The fee increase per screen, it's about 21% this time versus roughly about 12% increase for the last 2x you increased it. I'm just wondering: a, what's driven the magnitude of the increase here? And also if could you give us any sense in terms of what's been the usual screen decline when you see in your revenue -- I'm sorry, the rate increases before?","James E. Parisi","Sure. When you look at the rate that we're putting in -- the new rate that we're putting in place, it's, I'd say, very competitive. In fact, I want to say it's below what some of the key competitors have out there now or what they've announced. So we feel very comfortable around that. If we look at what's happened in the past around terminals, it very much depends on the environment that we're in. If you went back several rate increases ago, you wouldn't really have seen much of an impact on the number of terminals. The last one, you probably did see more of an impact, but it's also coupled with some legacy -- issues around some legacy incentives that we have in place, and we're taking a look at those as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just broad regulatory question. We've seen some stops and starts for the CFTC SEF mandate. With, I think, the expiration of the no action in the last week, I was just hoping you could talk about what you're seeing in the market and what you're hearing from customers.","Phupinder S. Gill","Howard, this is Gill. I'll stop, and I'll ask Kim to add as she's been working with a lot of the firms. I think on the SEF front, they're still in the very early stage -- stages, a lot of FCM, in particular, are a little bit concerned about the lack of consistent rules and a lot of these so-called SEFs have. The SEFs are working very closely with both their clients, as well as the FCMs to try and get these trades done. There's some confusion when trades coming from a SEF versus from some other venue. It doesn't give the FCMs, particularly the large FCMs, enough time to accept the trades. That's one example. So there's a lot of what I'll call early stage pains that both FCMs, as well as client and SEFs are going through, and those things will shake themselves out in the coming weeks.","Kimberly S. Taylor","The only thing that I would add as another example of the way that the SEF mandate is changing the way business is done. And actually, we're very well positioned to benefit from this change in this particular respect and with regard to bunched orders. The execution of very large orders, and then the allocation of those orders out to multiple accounts, the way that the workflow for that occurred prior to the SEF mandate is very different from the way that the customers want it to occur going forward, and we've already been able to accommodate the ability to do what I'll call post-clearing allocations of bunched orders, which was a new service, and being very well received.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And my second follow-up, Gill, you highlighted the global expansion. I was hoping you could just dig a little bit deeper into Brazil, specifically in your various partnerships with BM&FBOVESPA and give us a deeper update there.","Phupinder S. Gill","Sure, Howard. The growth rate for Latin America is very high. The base volume that we are working off is still low. It's about $60 million, I think, we're going to get in for the year. The Brazilian environment, as you know, continues to be a challenging one, and we are working with both the exchange, as well as the various regulators there to talk about the timing of the change -- changes of some tax laws that have to take place before the Brazilians can take advantage of what we are offering. I'm also going to ask Bryan to chat a little bit on what he's seeing there.","Bryan T. Durkin","In anticipation of change occurring from the macro-environment, we've really intensified our efforts in developing central bank programs. So we're -- we've got boots on the ground where we're intensifying the educational efforts and the draw of business into our panoply of products. So we're very pleased to see the growth trends, given the fairly muted environment that we're working under and just positioning ourselves for that change.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups for me, too. First of all, Jamie, from -- on the licensing fees, you talked about, I think, the OTC revenue sharing there. But in general, can you just maybe remind us what's in there and maybe the magnitude of the differences just in terms of the equity, fees with S&P and the ClearPort OTC fees and then also, I guess, on the clearing side, or whatever else is in there and how that's been trending?","James E. Parisi","Sure. On the -- you hit all the main components. It's the equity license fees from S&P, NASDAQ, Dow, et cetera, are in there. You've got the ClearPort fee sharing, and you've got this, now, the OTC revenue sharing. So generally, I'd say the equity license fees are the largest component, followed by the energy component and then followed by the OTC share. Just to be clear, in this quarter, the OTC revenue share amount that we booked in there included some catch-up for prior quarters as well.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But you can't give us exact numbers or anything close in terms of percentages?","James E. Parisi","No.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then secondly, just coming back to, I think, Howard's original question on the dividend and the appetite there. I mean, it looks like you have, I mean, significant cash buildup, and there will be more by the time you want to pay this dividend. So if you think about the variable dividend, do you really still see or does the board when you talk to them still view this as a true variable onetime? Or could you make an argument where you should bring it up in nice amounts from last quarter, and then maybe over from last year, and then maybe start thinking about repurchases a little bit more again? Or is this really just, this is what it's going to be and expect most of us to be paid out?","James E. Parisi","I would say that the philosophical bend is absolutely towards the dividends, so I wouldn't expect any buybacks of any significant nature going forward, at least in the near term. And it's the -- you called -- you said onetime around that dividend, but it is really an annual variable recurring dividend. So I think it's a bit of a unique structure, as we've discussed before. And I'd say both the board and the management is very comfortable with the way that's been working out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Broader finance question. How should we expect your capital needs to change as your swaps business gets larger?","James E. Parisi","The amount -- you mean, our capital requirements on the organization?","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Exactly.","James E. Parisi","I don't see them changing all that significantly. The capital requirements tend to be, for the most part, tied to the size of the annual expense for the business. So I don't see large increases there. And then we also size our contribution to the financial safeguards package in a very conservative fashion, so we feel very comfortable with the amount that we've got there as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","On portfolio margining, I know you said 6 clearing members are live, but I just want to get an idea for what percentage of your business that represents. Like, are we talking about 10% or 15% of your cleared interest rates swaps that's benefiting from that now? Or is it 50% or more?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. That 6 clearing members and their participation is yielding about $1 billion worth of margin savings, and it's currently a small percentage of the overall business. So firms are still coming up to speed there.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Does that -- does the rollout of that, I guess, to a larger percentage of your business, does that mean that you're going to gain more share? Is that your expectation? Or do you think that everybody's kind of already baking that eventuality into where they're doing their business right now?","Phupinder S. Gill","I think from an anticipation point of view, a lot of firms have started to test how this would actually work because it can be -- unless you have automated the process, it can be very manually intensive. So what a lot of firms have been doing over the last 6 months or so is making sure they have the process to automate those spreads. The opportunity beyond the existing open interest on the rate side against the OTC open interest is on a going-forward basis, as firms can put on or clients can put on positions that are risk-minimizing or risk-neutral on a going-forward basis and eventually get to an optimized state, where they can use some portion of their business will be in futures and options, and some portion would be in swaps. So there are 2 ways to look at this opportunity: one, with respect to the existing open interest in the futures side; and secondly, on a going-forward basis, with the deliverable swap futures, the clearing of the swaps, and more development on the futures side would be the opportunity that our firms would have.","James E. Parisi","And just to add on to that. I mean, I think, we have to keep in mind that we're just off the heels of the mandate states themselves. And so in our interaction through our sales calls, the firms are saying, \"Look, first and foremost, we need to make sure that we just got compliant.\" Now we're really spending our time on how to most effectively utilize our capital and any opportunities that you have. Specifically from a margin savings perspective, we're very keen to be able to test and see how that benefits our firm. So we're going through that optimization phase now.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then just -- can you update us on the London exchange? I think it's been delayed a couple of times. I'm not sure exactly why and what the expectation is for that.","Phupinder S. Gill","Yes. This is Gill. The delay has to do with a technical issues surrounding the delivery of foreign exchange. So we are working very hard with the Bank of England and the FCA, and we hope to have an announcement very soon there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just to follow up, I guess, on regulation for Terry. And it looks like the EUREX has put in some curves or very, what do you call it, far-out curves on high-frequency trading on order trade ratios and usage fees. And I guess, the question, Terry, do you think this is just their response to pressure that was just geographical in Germany? Or do you think that this is a trend that you guys might look at? And I know the equity exchanges didn't really follow up through, but you do got the concept release. So I guess, what do you think of what EUREX is doing in that area?","Terrence A. Duffy","Rich, I don't have the detailed information on what EUREX did. I can only go off what I've said publicly and what others have said publicly. We think that HFT trading as deposal liquidity, which benefits the participants and duly risk transfer at the lowest cost price. So we focus on the regulatory issues around HFT, and then make sure that we can show confidence in the marketplace that nothing nefarious is going on, and we've done a really good job doing that, and we're going to continue to support that model. There's no reason for us to change our structure right now as it relates to HFTs -- because again, we think they had deposal liquidity to the marketplace. So again, I'm not up to speed. Others in the room might have a better idea of what EUREX did.","James E. Parisi","I would just add to what the chairman just stated that the main focus of what we're looking at in the context of this whole topic is ensuring that you have the appropriate risk management mechanisms in place, many of which we're -- we've been an industry leader in dealing with credit controls, dealing with a appropriate level of order-to-trade ratios in terms of messaging policies, to maintain the efficiency of the experience for all users on a platform. So from our perspective, I think, as the chairman indicated, we've held a pretty firm line in that respect in terms of the benefits of this type of user base, but ensuring that we have the appropriate protocols in place to ensure a consistent experience for all market users.","Terrence A. Duffy","Let me just follow-on real quick because what I will say is, as you know, we've dealt a lot with over speculations in the energy markets over the last several years. We're in Washington quite a bit as you know. I do think that you will see a lot of headlines as relates to the HFTs that we have over the last several months. That won't go away. That doesn't mean anything's going to change, but the headlines will still remain to be there.","Operator","And our final question comes from Neve Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess, maybe, if you could pick which one you want to answer then or maybe I'll get both, but the access fees and collocations, things like that. And that had been something that you had been guiding to grow as you build out the data center, and that was something kind of you have been investing in for some years. So can you help me there, Jamie, and think about the growth potential in that revenue line? And then you've mentioned it in your prepared remarks as well, and I'm wondering if Sean might or Derek might address it, it's just some anecdotal evidence of futures instead of swaps. I mean, what data points are you looking at for evidence of this? I mean, you're closest to it. We're watching open interest as well. But what are the areas could you point to us to kind of look at, maybe some futures credit instead of swaps, instead of just clearing swaps as the way of your kind of revenue growth?","James E. Parisi","On that first one, Neve, I'll just say we're not prepared to give any updated guidance around collo. Certainly, we saw kind of people rationalizing the space that they were taking the facility. We have seen some customer growth there. And you just keep in mind that it is still a very profitable business for us. I want to say the margins this last quarter were well -- were over 50% in that business. So as you know, very -- it's a very good addition for us, and it's going to be market driven. So we'll continue to wait to see where the demand comes from and look for new ways to leverage that facility. Yes, Sean. Sean, you want to add a little -- talk on that second point?","Sean Tully","Sure. In terms of the move of people into our futures complex, we're seeing it in a couple of different ways. We look at a cash penetration -- or cash market penetration of our treasury futures. That is a metric that we've been following for a number of years. We recently reached a new peak in that. And although that's fallen off a bit in the last couple of months, we do remain around the peak level. So we did exceed the 2007 peak. Another way, anecdotally, that we look at this is we can look at EFRs, or exchange for risk transactions, which are spread trades between CME treasury futures and interest rate swaps. In the kind of traditional interest rate swap world, a very popular trade is in interest rate spread or a transaction which is an interest rate swap traded as a spread to a cash treasury instrument. In the new world, it's far more efficient to represent that trade as a CME cleared interest rate swap against the CME interest rate future. So our way of representing it now represents nearly the same risk, but you can get up to 85% margin savings relative to the portfolio margining that we talked about earlier. In terms of EFRs, if you look at volumes in 2013, overall year-to-date volumes in 2013 versus 2012, average daily volume in 2012 was about 19,000 a day. 2013 was about 48,000 a day so far. So we're seeing a very large increase in people beginning to look at ways to use our unique value proposition, I think, for the portfolio margining with interest rate swaps, plus our futures complex, to represent strategies that have been in place for a long time, but in a much more efficient manner.","James E. Parisi","Just a couple of things to add to that. The member, nonmember mix has trended positively over the last few months. In interest rates, you've seen a pickup of about a 1% nonmember mix there in this quarter versus last year. And then finally, as we noted in the prepared remarks, the interest rate revenue is up 40% in total versus last year. So I think all those are supportive of what Sean was pointing out.","Operator","I think, at this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.","Phupinder S. Gill","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, and this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your line."],"5423":["CME Group, Inc.

Peschier - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thank you for joining us this morning. Gill and John will spend a few minutes discussing the results and then we will open up the call for your questions. Terry, Bryan, Derek, Sean and Kim are on the call as well and will participate in the Q&A session.","Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language. Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC which are available on our website.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mr. Peschier, and thank you all for joining us. I'm proud of our colleagues' hard work and the resulting performance during a challenging year for the financial services space. In 2015, we delivered product and technology innovation in multiple ways, and we also reduced costs by driving efficiency throughout the organization, while improving our agility.","We set multiple volume and revenue records last year, with particular strength in Energy and Agricultural Products. In terms of volumes, we captured market share during the year across multiple products. In our non-transaction-related business, we had double-digit growth within both market data and our portion of the S&P Dow Index business. Those two line items make up approximately 25% of our pre-tax income. We have consistently expanded our global participation and we had a record level of non-U.S. volume and revenue during the year.","During Q4, non-U.S. trading volume growth outperformed the U.S., which has been a consistent trend. Electronic trading volume from outside the U.S. increased by 7% in 2015. The electronification of our options has been an important part of our success as well. In 2015, our electronic options volume jumped by 15%, to more than 1.4 million contracts a day. Our revenue from electronic options has grown by more than 90% from 2012 to $223 million this past year. During this time, we have invested in system enhancements, new products, and client education, which are driving significant usage of our diverse suite of option products.","A couple of quick points on our financial and commodity products, starting with rates. I'm pleased to say that we were able to expand our total Interest Rate futures, options and swaps revenue to more than $900 million this year, up slightly from the past year. That compares to approximately $600 million in 2012, prior to the swaps clearing mandate. Within fixed income markets, I would be surprised to find others that saw that same upward trend. For example, as many of you know, FICC activity is down fairly significantly during the last three years. We remain actively engaged with our customers, discussing the advantages of liquidity and capital efficiency that we are uniquely positioned to provide.","One recent area of significant success is the launch of our Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures and options contract this past month. This contract provides hedging and spreading opportunities at the true 10-year point of the Treasury yield curve. This is the exact sweet spot where a lot of activity is clustered. I'm happy to say that this launch has been the most successful start of a new contract in our long history of innovation despite an uncertain and volatile trading environment, which is usually a difficult time for a new product to garner any attention.","With more than 140 market participants providing consistent liquidity across all regions, the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note futures has been trading more than 20,000 contracts a day over the last few weeks. Open interest has increased steadily since the launch and stands at more than 50,000 contracts, demonstrating this contract's relevance to our client base.","Open interest in our actively traded 10-year Treasury Note futures has grown by more than 10% since the Ultra 10-year Treasury Note launch, to almost 3 million contracts, thereby expanding the entire Interest Rate complex.","The world's largest and most complex options market is our Eurodollar Options, and total volume there was up 12% to almost 1 million contracts a day in 2015. The percentage of the volume on Globex increased each quarter during the year, from 14% in Q1, up to 22% in Q4. Our Eurodollar Options average daily volume grew to more than 2.1 million contracts per day in January, and record electronic Eurodollar Options averaged more than 450,000 contracts per day, tripling the volume from a year ago.","Turning to Equities, a couple of items stand out. Within options we saw a 7% volume increase during the year. Also in 2015, we were very pleased to secure long-term rights to the FTSE Russell indexes as a result of our partnership with the LSE.","On January 25, we launched the FTSE Emerging Markets and Europe Developed Markets products and we are looking forward to 2017 when the Russell 2000 launches on CME, and we think there's an opportunity to increase volumes meaningfully.","Finally, last quarter, I mentioned we had launched Basis Trade at Index Close functionality for equity futures and S&P 500 Dividend futures. Since the expansion of this so-called B tick (06:15) to the U.S. major indices in November last year, over 132,000 contracts have been traded. This is the business that has historically been done in a bilateral way of exchange.","In Commodities, we saw record volume in Energy and Agricultural Products. The impact of El Ni\u00f1o and the potential for La Ni\u00f1a, along with the normal dynamics, has resulted in increased usage of our products. We are particularly pleased with our results in Energy. Our total Energy revenue grew by 15% during the year, more than twice as fast as our closest competitor. We have taken share in crude oil futures and options, natural gas futures and options and within coal. During Q4, we were pleased to see the lifting of the 40-year ban on exporting crude outside the U.S. We think this bodes well for the long-term position of our Energy complex and also within the Metals complex, we achieved record levels of large open interest holders and we picked up volume in market share from competing exchanges in gold, copper, and iron ore.","Within our earnings presentation, you'll find a summary slide which highlights many of the initiatives we launched during 2015 to pave the way for continued growth on a global basis. I've gone through some of these on prior calls, so I won't go into any detail this morning.","Turning to 2016, our business has been quite active, as volatility has picked up. We've had a great start to the year, with a new record monthly ADV of 18.2 million in January, and record Energy volume. In addition, total options including electronic options were well above previous levels. Related to options, there are many firms utilizing more complex trading strategies, as the markets have become electronified. We are seeing enhanced liquidity within different strikes and expirations in many products, as many market participants have more data and better tools to manage heightened levels of risk.","There was an insightful report recently from the TAP group (08:33) on this very topic. Exchanges that have invested in meaningful options activity should benefit on a going-forward basis. One more point on January, the volume of outside the U.S. was 26% of the total volume, up from the 24% we averaged during 2015. It is very nice to see the global participation and increased activity throughout the entire day.","It is also worth noting that our open interest grew by 16.5 million contracts or 18% during the month of January, compared to the year-end, and all products have seen higher open interest. This is by far the largest open interest increase we have seen from the prior month.","In January, energy volume from outside of the U.S. grew by more than 80% versus the prior year, while equity volume rose more than 65%. While we don't provide guidance on our volume, we do know our product diversity is unmatched and has been very helpful over the years in different environments. We have had a large number of repeat clients who utilize our markets every day and an expanding number of new clients that we are pursuing with multiple sales campaigns. Clearly, there are diverging opinions related to volatility, global risk and political uncertainty. We don't control these things. Our work is centered on growing the number of tools available to our clients, to help them manage their risk.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Gill. And good morning, everyone. CME had a solid fourth quarter in an excellent year. The full year revenue increased by 7% while total adjusted expense was down by 1%. During the year, we adjusted operating margins from 58% to 61%. Our adjusted EPS and net income year-over-year growth were both above 14% in 2015.","In Q4 last year, we had the second-highest volume in our history, which made for a tough comparison. I'll start with some revenue details for the fourth quarter. The rate per contract for the fourth quarter was $0.789, up 4% from $0.759 in Q3. Overall, we had an increased proportion of volume from higher-paying non-members during the quarter and also had strong Energy volume, which is one of our higher RPC products. The Energy RPC rebounded to $1.23 per contract, up $0.035 from the prior quarter, due to positive mix shifts within the Energy product line from lower priced Power to higher priced Natural Gas contracts and Energy swaps on ClearPort.","Non-member activity in Energy was also significant during the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $337 million, exactly where we guided. In terms of head count, we ended the year with 2,530 employees, basically flat relative to the end of the third quarter. Our compensation ratio for the year came in at 16.1%, compared to 17% in 2014. Looking at the non-operating income and expense line, our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $25 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which is up 13% from the prior year. We remain pleased with the investment we made in the index business, while also ensuring that we continue to offer the world's leading index futures products on CME.","Turning to taxes, for the full year, we ended at 36.4%, slightly below the 36.6% range we expected. As a result, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.9%. And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $1.87 billion in cash, restricted cash, and marketable securities. In January, we returned almost $1 billion to shareholders in our variable dividend. Earlier this week, we announced a 20% increase in our regular dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.60. Our dividend yield over the last four years has been more than 5%, and we plan to continue to return excess capital to our shareholders.","During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $28 million, and for the full year, we came in at $113 million. Our buildout of our New York office space has been completed. We have also made reductions in our data center footprint and we continue to examine opportunities for efficiency there.","Looking ahead to guidance for 2016, let me start with operating expenses. We will continue to be as efficient as possible as we execute on our strategy, with an eye to free up dollars to spend on growth initiatives. Going into 2016, we are providing guidance for total expense, excluding our licensing and other fee agreements. In 2015, our non-license fee-related expenses totaled $1.171 billion. Based on our current plans and business mix, I expect that to increase by a modest 1% to approximately $1.185 billion. As many of you know, the forecasted license fees are driven by your assumptions on Equities, Energy, and other Cleared Swaps volumes. In terms of revenue, as a reminder, we implemented the 2016 transaction fee increase across all six product areas beginning in January. And we expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 2%, assuming the same volume levels and product mix.","In addition, our Market Data clients who previously received a fee waiver are moving from $42.50 per month per screen, to $85 per month per screen, which is the same level our other customers currently pay. We expect our market data revenue to increase by 4% to 5% in 2016.","A couple of additional items. For modeling purposes, at this point, I expect taxes to be at a similar level to 2015, at 36.5%. I expect CapEx to come in between $115 million and $120 million in 2016. In terms of capital expenditures, we continue to execute our Efficiency Program that we started last year to reduce operating expenses to pay for new growth initiatives, reduce the unit cost of critical systems by keeping costs flat while increasing capacity, and by leveraging more Software and Infrastructure as a Service, which tends to flow through expenses rather than capital expenditures.","In summary, I'm very pleased with the hard work this year throughout the company. As you know, operating leverage in our business is significant, and that was clearly evidenced this year. We plan to continue to grow our top line and drive as much revenue to our bottom line as possible and into our healthy, growing dividends stream.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue if you have any further questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First, could you talk about the \u2013 well, I guess, could you talk about the ongoing transition from swaps to futures in the Rate complex? Maybe where you're seeing evidence of progress, and from here, maybe drivers and catalysts and included in the response, can you talk about portfolio margining? I know Gill mentioned that conversations are still taking place, but are you getting uptake on the portfolio margining side and is that a catalyst? And then also the slide in OTC Clearing revenue. That seems to continue as well. So, swaps to futures. Thanks.","Sean Tully - Senior Managing Director-Financial & OTC Products","Yeah, hi, this is Sean Tully jumping in. Thanks for the question. It's been very exciting over the last few years in terms of what we've seen in terms of clients transitioning from swaps over to futures. If you recall early last year, Greenwich Associates published a study looking at our Interest Rate futures on a total cost analysis basis, relative to the swaps marketplace and saw that our Treasury futures, our Eurodollar Futures, our Deliverable Swap Futures, on a consistent basis offer you the same risk profile or a similar risk profile to interest rate swaps at a far lower cost. So, we have seen since 2012 when the mandate to clearance rate swaps got kicked in, a big increase, for example, in our penetration of the cash Treasury bond market. So Treasury futures back in 2012 traded 66% of the average daily volume of the cash government bond market. Last year, if you look at it, we were at 75%. So very significant increase in terms of our market share, relative to the rest of the marketplace.","In fact, last year, because of the jump in the gap, right, relative to the bond future, if you adjust for that duration jump, our equivalent penetration now of the cash Treasury market is about 78%. So we continue to see progress. We continue to see migration into our Interest Rate marketplace. If you look actually this morning, we are at over 62 million open interest in our Interest Rate futures complex, Interest Rate futures and options, a near-record. So, very exciting from that standpoint.","On the Interest Rate swap side, continued innovation. Continued innovation in that marketplace. There were challenges last year, relative to the CME basis, relative to LCH, but our continued innovation is allowing us to continue to get traction. So last year we saw a huge growth in our Mexican Peso Interest Rate swap clearing and we are now clearing approximately half of that marketplace. And then in December, we had our first trades in Brazilian Reais cleared interest rate swaps. If you get the Mexican Peso, since we are unique in offering that relative to the global marketplace, we are now clearing about half of the global Mexican Peso Interest Rate swap market and it's our third most important currency.","Other exciting developments we're seeing is the TN future. So relative to the increases in regulation, the increases in costs relative to capital requirements, on banks in particular, our TN future, a very exciting new launch, where we're seeing a migration into an exciting new product. So our TN future's the single most successful, actually, launch after the first few weeks in CME (19:01) history relative to ADV, open interest and number of large open interest holders. So already after three weeks, we're seeing 58,000 open interest this morning. We're seeing around 25,000 ADV recently and over 140 participants. So very, very exciting.","The increases that we're seeing in particular are coming from asset managers, hedge funds and corporates. Asset managers last year actually outperformed the rest of our market segments by about 9% in terms of \u2013 in terms of their growth in our Interest Rate complex. So we see a continued migration, and we're continuing to innovate on the swaps area. So, with the Mexican Peso and with the BRL, today we offer 19 currencies relative to our competition's 17 currencies. In addition to that, we do look to launch swaptions clearing earlier this year as another unique value proposition to the marketplace, offering unique credit and capital management tools.","Phupinder S. Gill - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ken, just to sum up what Sean just walked through, if you look at the \u2013 and this is in part \u2013 part of what I said a short while ago, if you look at the income for the Interest Rate environment, the $600 million three years ago, in a very flat environment, in a continued flat environment, we grew that to $800 million...","Sean Tully - Senior Managing Director-Financial & OTC Products","$900 million. $900 million.","Phupinder S. Gill - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Excuse me, $900 million.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Can I just add something there?","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Ken, can I \u2013 let me just add something really quick here. You know, we went down a couple million dollars in revenue in swaps clearing, but as you recall, a couple of years ago, several years ago, as we started to introduce clearing of swaps, there's a lot of people that thought that we would (20:41) make anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion doing this business. We went out for it very aggressively to price this in order to build up our core business and to grow the revenue in our core business. And I think what Gill and Sean just walked you through is a couple million dollars down in swaps clearing but multiples of that in our core business. So, I think that strategy really worked to perfection.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sameer Murukutla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. This is Sameer Murukutla for Michael Carrier.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Sameer Murukutla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just on the expense guidance, you know, the growth of 1%, it's pretty conservative relative to your peers. Can you give us some details on what your top-line outlook is, given the 1% growth?","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Well, as you know, we don't give out guidance on volume, which is the main driver relative to clearing transaction fees, but as we look at it as a management team, we're focused really on two things, managing our expenditures and growing our top-line and expanding our margins. So, you're right. We were expecting a very modest 1% increase in expenses and I think what we're looking at is two drivers, one being our Market Data revenue, which we showed was \u2013 where we showed the increase, about 4% to 5%, and then we've also used the lever in terms of pricing in our transaction fees. We provide a tremendous amount of value to our clients. So, we have a 2% increase across the board in our transaction fees. So, when you take a look at the month of January, we've had a record volume for the month of January. We've seen large increases in our options complex. So, the things that we laid out to do, growing internationally, growing our options complex, we've taken the opportunity to adjust prices. So, our top-line is \u2013 we're hitting on all levers there.","And on the expense side, just \u2013 one of the things that we're doing, like I said, is managing the expenditures very carefully, and we've really focused on efficiency, in light of \u2013 in light of security spending, regulatory spending, which we've made investments in over time. And we're continuing to look at our technological infrastructure. Also, we are looking at keeping our compensation relatively flat as well as we kind of manage the \u2013 the human capital here too.","Sameer Murukutla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. I appreciate the detail. Thanks for taking my question.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah, good morning and congrats on the operating leverage you exhibited in the model this year, over 100% incremental margins.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Anyway, my question \u2013 Congrats. My question is on clearinghouses. Since I got one question, and so just today, there was a journal article about stress-testing clearinghouses in Europe, and Chairman Massad just talked about tests of recovering resilience here. So, I guess the question is, first, is there anything \u2013 do you have a view on what could be coming down the road? And will there be any incremental costs, or capital needed in the clearinghouse in your view?","And then the second part of it is Eurex also got approved as a clearinghouse here in the U.S. You're over there in London or in Europe, do you have any plans to expand the clearing beyond just the FX? I believe it's Metals that you clear right now.","Kimberly S. Taylor - President-Global Operations, Technology & Risk","Hi, Rich, it's Kim. With respect to the stress-testing issue for clearinghouses, we invest significant effort already in various types of stress-testing in the clearinghouse that we perform on a daily basis, including stress-testing of the risk waterfall and the capital that's needed for CME to contribute to that. So, we would not anticipate any impact from minor changes in regulation there.","Phupinder S. Gill - Chief Executive Officer & Director","With respect to the CME exchange in Europe, there are plans to expand beyond the Agricultural products, and the FX products that are there. And I ask Derek to make a comment there.","Derek L. Sammann - Senior MD-Commodity & Options Products","Yeah, I think we've actually been quite successful in building the European utilities business out there. So, if you look at the way \u2013 actually we just hit a recent open interest record of about 58,000 contracts, of which about 55,000 is in our European utilities slate of power, gas, and emissions. So, we're very excited we hit a new ADV record in cocoa, which is also clearing, traded on the European exchange, clearing through the European clearinghouse. So, we like the open interest build and the ADV. It's really accessing a brand-new client base for us that extends us into a footprint of users that are not traditional users of Henry Hub, or TI, or products that are part of our core record setting-franchise this year. So, good expansion and looking for more growth in 2016.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","And I guess the question is \u2013 on the first part was, I know there's no incremental costs, but I guess, you're not expecting any major changes then, I guess, in the \u2013 in the guidelines for clearinghouses then?","Kimberly S. Taylor - President-Global Operations, Technology & Risk","Correct.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Good morning, everybody.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I have a question for you guys on the \u2013 question for you on the energy business. How do you expect the lift of the US oil export ban, I guess, to impact the business and, I guess, Gill, I heard you talk a little bit in the prepared remarks that you guys are excited about the opportunity, but maybe provide a little bit more granularity either into specific contracts, strategies, or new users you potentially could target, given this change. Thanks.","Derek L. Sammann - Senior MD-Commodity & Options Products","Yeah, it's Derek. I'll jump in here. We're actually- we've already seen a pretty significant increase in participation in the levels of activity across our entire suite of products.","There was actually an article out this morning on Bloomberg talking about a product that we just launched nine months ago, the LOOP storage contract that reflects exactly the infrastructure shifts and the market dynamic shifts that are now reflective of a waterborne WTI product. So, we've got the participation levels where not only did we hit large open interest holder levels in 2015, we actually saw record levels of Chinese participation and revenue generation. In fact, the greatest revenue generator for us in China in 2015 was our Energies complex, about 82% growth year on year there. So, this is a product that the story is one of a globalizing waterborne product, the market now, I think the first shipment actually left the Gulf Coast last week and headed for Japan.","So, this is something we've been positioning for, for the last 18 months or so. We put ourselves in a position with both the innovative new storage contract with LOOP launched about nine months ago, in addition to our globalizing sales efforts to make sure that wherever there is an interest in energies, we're going to make sure that we are pounding the pavement with our customers.","And finally, on page 12 of the deck that we circulated, you will actually notice that 22% of our energies revenues now come from outside the U.S. That's up from just 18% last year, two years ago. So, we are seeing significant \u2013 a significant growth in the participation in January, particularly as a continuation of that trend. So, we're globalizing our footprint. We're expanding our customer base and there's \u2013 and that gas piece I'm happy to go into as well. But I think I've got my time used up on this one.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. All right. Thanks. Thanks for the color there, guys.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ken Hill of Barclays.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everyone.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Ken.","Phupinder S. Gill - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ho.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, I wanted to ask, you guys have a number of investment companies that are pretty interesting as far as portfolio companies you have on the technology side. One of them is Dwolla, which tends to get the most attention in the digital payment area. I was wondering if you could talk about the investments you're making in clearing and payment infrastructure. And then how you actually see that evolving. So I'm assuming that has a lot of implications for your customers and for you, as well, on the expense side. So, when do you think some of these kind of newer companies might bring that technology to market to impact people in a meaningful way?","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Ken. This is John. We do have a venture group, CME Ventures, that has been investing in technology companies that we see as potentially being important to us in the long run. So, we've been investing in real-time payments. We've been investing in Blockchain. We've been investing in Big Data, computing technology companies, and the like.","So, it's important for us because what we're able to do is by making these investments, we can get a kind of a view of the kind of the future, if you will, and bring that kind of that innovation back into the company. And one of the things that we have a strong culture on is innovation and bringing this knowledge into the company helps us in terms of our long-term planning","Phupinder S. Gill - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, and just to add to what John said, if you look at some of the emerging technologies and the investments that we have made, they translate very neatly into use cases for us. And so we have a bunch of folks running a bunch of use cases across not just the payment and the settlement side but across many aspects of the operations of the firm, with the \u2013 with the intention to reduce not just our costs, but the costs of connecting into our client base. And \u2013 and in turn, reducing our client's costs.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks. Maybe just on the international theme, John, can you talk about what type of RPC trends you see from the non-U.S. users versus the U.S. So, if you are penetrating that market faster, especially on the Energy side increasingly there and also on the Rate side, is that something that can drive material lift to the RPC over and above your forecast?","And then if you could also just comment on the program to incentivize users on brand (31:51), where we stand on that right now?","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. When you take a look at the \u2013 when you take a look at the RPC from outside the U.S, it tends to be higher than within the U.S., because those clients tend not to be members of the Exchange. They pay a higher rate. So outside the U.S., it's about 37% higher RPC than within the U.S., which \u2013 and also when you heard Derek, penetrating outside the U.S. in the Energy space, Energy tends to be one of our higher RPC products. So it's really \u2013 it's an important growth area for us, both from a rate per contract, but also from a volume perspective. I'll turn it over to Bryan to comment on the clients overseas.","Bryan T. Durkin - Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah, I think this demonstrates our very targeted campaign approach to selling and it's delivering results across all of our asset classes. We have seen an 81% increase in activity out of the Energy complex, the main drivers have been from Asia and some of the emerging EMEA markets and in particularly, we've seen some nice new business coming from new commercial clients. We've generated about, I think, 88 or close to 90-something commercial clients globally, and a third of that is coming out of international. So you're going to see more and more efforts in that regard in terms of our targeted approach to these clients.","We've been also very heavily intensifying our efforts in our cross-selling. You've heard me talk about that in the past, and we generated new business from new firms, as a result, I think about 500 new firms and that's broken down to 121 asset managers, 88 new commercial clients, and about 300-plus hedge funds. Again, a third of that is coming out of international.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","I'll say there, just jumping in, specifically on the Energy side, with Brent particularly we actually rolled back some of the incentives in January, so that's going to help the RPC a little bit. We're continuing to grow the business, about 140,000 ADV, maintaining about 12% market share and most pleasingly, we're actually seeing an increased market share of the Brent CI spread that are traded as a listed spread. We're up to about 40% of that market and on bigger days we're closer to 50%. So RPC help and we're getting into a more diversified client base by adding more Brent participation on the commercial side.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's super helpful. Thanks so much.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kyle Voigt of KBW.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Kyle.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Just a couple for John on the market data guidance. I guess we had expected a bit of a larger uptick in revenues, given the full elimination of the fee waiver this year. Can you help us understand what your assumptions are for subscriber attrition for 2016 as you move to 100% of the full monthly rate, and then do you already have insight into the customer attrition at this point in the year? And then, I guess lastly, is just can you just remind us when the last time when you adjusted monthly prices for the market data terminals and how often you typically review this pricing.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, thanks, Kyle. As I indicated in the prepared remarks, we're expecting a 4% to 5% increase in terms of overall market data revenue. As you know, we're moving \u2013 we've moved our \u2013 or grandfathered fee waivered clients from $0 to $42.50 and now up to $85, the same as our other customers. With respect to attrition and the like, we don't have that information now as we're going through the first billing cycle for customers at the $85 level.","So our base core, previously the non-grandfathered clients have remained relatively stable. The grandfathered ones, I think we'll have a little bit more insight as we go into billing at the full rate.","Bryan, would you like to comment on it, from what you see from a customer perspective?","Bryan T. Durkin - Chief Commercial Officer","I just feel that we've done a very good job in terms of stabilizing any reduction in the terminals and you can see that over the course of the past year-and-a-half since we put in the elimination of this waiver. We've seen consistent activity and I would say some additional take-up from those at the full rate. And in terms of those that were grandfathered, we've also seen consistent usage from that group, and we're monitoring it closely as John indicated but we're pretty confident that we went through the main consolidation since we eliminated that fee waiver. And we're really focused now on delivering new products and augmenting the data business that we have today.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","And then, sorry, also on the monthly \u2013 how often you typically adjust the monthly prices for market data terminals and how often you review that pricing \u2013 or when the last time you reviewed that?","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Yes \u2013 sorry, Kyle, this is John. We generally have increased prices every two years. And the last time we did it was two years ago.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning and welcome back to the call for Kim.","Kimberly S. Taylor - President-Global Operations, Technology & Risk","Thank you.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, it seems like the clearinghouse equivalence rule is kind of coming to a head. I think February 21 is the EMIR deadline in terms of determining whether U.S. clearinghouses are compliant for European banks. What do you see as the resolution of this issue?","Phupinder S. Gill - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Pat. I'm going to ask the chairman to answer.","Terrence A. Duffy - Executive Chairman & President","Pat, this is Terry Duffy. Thanks, Gill. You know, Pat, we've been working on the equivalence issue for quite some time now, and we've been working with Chairman Tim Massad actually since the day he's been sworn in, into the administration to take the role at the CFTC. This has been a big issue. This has been a long road, working through all the different issues. We feel very confident that we've gotten all the issues resolved. I met with the chairman along with Gill and Kim and a few other folks just a couple days ago, and I assure you that chairman Massad understands the magnitude of the potential market disruption if in fact the U.S. is not deemed equivalent prior to the February 21 frontloading date. So, that being said, it gives us some comfort, but we'd like to see it ahead of time.","That being said, we have seen some recent articles, I think in Risk magazine, where a couple of banks have made comments as to what they may or may not do, come February 21, and then you've heard from some other participants saying that they feel very confident and they're not overly concerned about this.","This is an issue that we are very focused on and we will stay focused on until it's granted. But, again, I think the chairman has recognized that there could be market disruptions and that would be the worst thing that could happen \u2013 not only to the U.S. market, but to the European participants as well, if equivalence is not granted to the United States. So, we feel confident that we will get this done.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. The S&P Dow Jones venture had a very strong year. I'm wondering if you can expand a little bit on what the drivers of that were. Was it just volumes, strong volumes or was something else going on there? And then anything you guys can share about the outlook would be helpful too.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, this is John. In terms of the JV, we are very pleased with our investment in the \u2013 in our joint venture with McGraw-Hill. And the general drivers for the business are assets under management, as well as license fees generated from exchanges that utilize their trademark and IP. So, it would be primarily CME and the CBOE. And, so we end up profiting from activity both from the move from active to passive investing, which is a megatrend in the investing space, as well as trading activity on both from futures and options, as well.","So, we think \u2013 we were very bullish on that business. It has characteristics very similar to ours, a lot of leverage in their model. And, I think we're very optimistic in terms of the trends in investing and, the position that the JV has globally.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rob Rutschow of CLSA Americas.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","John W. Pietrowicz - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","You give some very helpful commentary on the non-U.S. I had a couple of small follow-ups. You have a lot of new clients, but are those the ones that are driving additional non-U.S. volume or are you seeing better penetration from older non-US clients, and those new clients are kind of a pipeline for additional growth?","And then secondly, are you seeing \u2013 are you taking some share from some of the non-U.S. venues that have look-a-like contracts for \u2013 especially for some of your commodities products?","Bryan T. Durkin - Chief Commercial Officer","So this is Bryan. I'm going to break it down into three categories. One of the benefits of having the broad swath of Interest Rate products that we represent, we're able to reach the client base, particularly within London. We've brought in some new business, particularly in the shorter end of our yield curve that we just haven't tapped before and that's a strong testament to the product complex that we represent.","Also, I think I alluded to earlier our intensified efforts on cross-selling. So, from existing clients, what that means is going in, working with them through strong rigorous marketing and education programs and helping existing users understand how we can complement their business, for example, with Metals, having them come in and do some activity into our Foreign Currency products to hedge their foreign currency risk. That has been very successful.","So, to be able to back that up, new business from existing customers, what we have seen \u2013 existing customers now trading over, I think, it's 1,700 new products that they hadn't tried before. So, it's new business from existing customers, and then it's also new business from new customers, which I outlined \u2013 new business from new customers which I outlined earlier.","Again, it's a combination of targeted sales, bringing together our marketing, our strategy and our business line units together to go out there and call that new business.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jonathan Casteleyn of Hedgeye.","Jonathan Edward Casteleyn - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC (Research)","Hi, good morning.","Sean Tully - Senior Managing Director-Financial & OTC Products","Good morning.","Jonathan Edward Casteleyn - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC (Research)","The earnings trajectory \u2013 hi, good morning. The earnings trajectory of the exchange is going way up. The stocks multiple is coming down a little bit, though. So, I'm surmising that there's some fears about the trading community. And so I'm just curious if you can talk about the breadth of the user base. And, in 2011, you had a big step up in activity, only to be met with declines in 2012 and 2013. So curious, are there any signs that maybe it's different this time, that the activity levels are more sustainable, just from a breadth standpoint going forward?","Bryan T. Durkin - Chief Commercial Officer","This is Bryan again. I mean, if you look across the client segments, we actually for the past year, year-on-year, saw anywhere from single digit and I would say single-digit from the proprietary segment to double-digit growth, double-digit covering our hedge fund asset management community, as well as our retail. One of the things that we really haven't emphasized here is our very strong targeted focus on building up our retail client base. I think this year alone we opened up close to 50,000 additional accounts in that arena.","Again, the targeted sales approach across all of these asset classes, bringing together Derek and Sean's team, has enabled us to \u2013 to penetrate those markets. An interesting one, particularly in the commercial and corporate side of things, seeing about a 8%- close to 10% year on year growth, that's a real positive for us in the context of our overall Interest Rate business","Phupinder S. Gill - Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is Gill. I just want to emphasize one thing that Derek touched upon a short while ago, and this is a testament, again, to the investment that we have made over the years in growing our sales force around the world. And that is \u2013 and the people, relationships, and education campaigns that we have run in China. The past two months, as the upheaval in China has intensified, we have seen a very large number of trade, traders that are seeking opportunities outside of China and that's been driving a significant portion of the international growth that Bryan is referring to here.","You're also seeing the open interest for the entire exchange growing significantly, which is another thing that you did not see in the years that you mentioned, right? So these things, together with the product development, that has been done across the board, is what I would say, differentiates us in this environment from the \u2013 from the past ones.","Terrence A. Duffy - Executive Chairman & President","And let me just give you my- this is Terry Duffy- my short take on this. Because, participants are interesting. They come and go, and they go from asset class to different asset class. But of one of the things that we've been talking a little bit about this morning, is the growth in the open interest in our options products and I really believe that when you look at options growth, that's what preserves your futures contracts. So that's what continues to attract new futures participants. So, we've done a really good job of bolstering our options products with the growth that we've seen in them, that you've got to realize they don't turn over as much as our futures but what they do is they help the Risk Management product, which is the futures contract and you need \u2013 you need to have bigger growth in your options in order to garner more participants in your futures and that's exactly what we're doing. So we expect that mix \u2013 always goes up and down, but this is something that I have never seen in my 36-year history to see the options growth outpace the futures growth and that's a great healthy sign for this company.","Jonathan Edward Casteleyn - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC (Research)","Thanks so much for your thoughts.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Bond of RBC Capital Markets.","Andrew Bond - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Sean Tully - Senior Managing Director-Financial & OTC Products","Good morning. Andrew.","Andrew Bond - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi guys. I wanted to follow up on Ken's question and get your take on the basis spread with LCH. Clearing activity has been a little light to start the year off, with LCH. And I'm wondering if you think it's primarily related to the basis spread. It appears it's come in a bit over the recent weeks, but do you think CME can meaningfully grow clearing activity as the spread settles around these levels and how does it affect the Interest Rate complex as a whole and futurization, I guess?","Sean Tully - Senior Managing Director-Financial & OTC Products","Yes, this is a \u2013 excuse me, Sean jumping in again. In terms of the basis, it has been stable in January and it's really, the level of the basis is really kind of irrelevant to clients. What's much more important is the bit offer spread that they get coming in and the bit offer spread they get going out, and the level of rates they get coming in versus the level of rates coming out. So we don't see that as highly significant to the marketplace. One of the things we have seen is a very large increase in the dealer to dealer activity on CME Group, so we see the dealers hedging their positions on CME with each other. So if you look at that, actually, on recent days we've had dealer-to-dealer activity on the platform, as much as 30% of the overall volumes.","One of the things I said before, again, if you look in addition to that, the migration over the futures, I slightly misspoke. In 2012, we actually had 56% penetration of the cash Treasury bond market, 66% in 2013, and then last year, 75%. So we see also a very large migration over into our futures.","Andrew Bond - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","John W.

We had an impressive second quarter and the diversity of our product offerings was evident in the results achieved. We delivered significant top-line growth in transaction fees and market data revenue which, coupled with lower expenses, resulted in a 23% increase in earnings per share.","After an industry slowdown in April, our volume finished the quarter with June up 15% compared to the prior June. ADV across all six product areas were up in June and four of them were up in double digits. Our commodities portfolio was up 26%, while financial products increased by 12%. In terms of Q2 activity, in our commodities portfolio we saw strong results with ADV up 22% across energy, ags and metals. In ags we delivered record quarterly volume in corn, soybeans and wheat.","The surge in activity was driven by concerns of an El Nino in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, resulting in anticipated increased rain in the U.S. and Brazil and the potential drought conditions in Australia and Southeast Asia. The resulting price movement volatility and declining prices has sparked renewed hedging activity in both futures and options.","Energy volumes also performed extremely well in Q2 with ADV up 20%, driven by 32% growth in our crude complex with 68% of our WTI options now trading electronically on Globex. In June, net gas results trended well as volume rose 30% and net gas options were up 37% as our market share also rose.","Total energy volume and revenue were each of 20%; double that of our primary competitor. Within the financial product area foreign exchange trading growth was significant during the second quarter, rising 42%. FX futures were up 38%, while FX options grew 83%. Interest rates volumes accelerated during the quarter from $5.1 million per day in April to $7.4 million during the rest of the quarter. Interest rate activity at CME has performed well relative to substitute products that were out there and were up 7%.","Our penetration of the cash treasury market increased from 77% at the end of Q1 to 78% this quarter. In addition, the total number of large institutional open interest holders in our rates futures business grew to 1,705 at the end of the quarter which is up 7% from the beginning of the year.","We're particularly pleased with the activity in euro-dollar options ahead of a potential Fed move. Euro-dollar options on Globex were up 60% to 148,000 contracts per day during the quarter and up 84% in June. Importantly, we have seen the percentage of euro-dollar options traded electronically move from 12% in Q2 last year to 18% this year and up to 22% in July. The biggest driver has been a surge in activity coming from European traders.","In addition, we had a record number of weekly treasury options traded in June at 140,000 ADV. July remains extremely strong as well. Lastly, Fed funds futures have become popular again for the first time since the credit crisis. Volume has tripled from last year's [indiscernible] in 2015. ADV is above 60,000 contracts compared to 20,000 last year.","During the quarter our revenue and interest rate swap clearing grew by 36%, while credit swap clearing was up 11% to total approximately $18 million. We have seen a slowdown of activity in swaps in July due to the basis spread between CME and LCH. The basis has stabilized and tightened recently. The OTC swaps revenue trajectory for July looks similar to April based on the client mix, as the decreases we have seen are mainly in lower-priced OIS trades coming from large hedge fund clients.","On the flipside, we have seen a record number of dealer-to-dealer trades which is encouraging. We continue to look at opportunities to address challenges our customers are facing. There has been a decline in cash market liquidity in the government securities market due in part to more stringent capital, leverage and liquidity standards for banks and heightened regulatory scrutiny. And this may have contributed to the increased client use of the Treasury futures product.","We also had a webinar this Tuesday with a large number of market participants to discuss the concept of filling the 15-year gap between the 6 1\/2 year point tracked by our 10-year Treasury contract and the 21 1\/2 year point backed by our 30-year long bond.","Turning to our global business, work by our staff and volume from outside of the U.S. continues to be impressive. Our Q2 electronic trading volume out of Asia jumped 22% from the second quarter last year with the highest volume growth in our FX and equity product areas. Europe was up 10% with ag products up 50% and FX was also strong. North America and Latin America were each up 6%. Electronic volume from outside the U.S. was up 12% and revenue was up 19%.","Turning to growth in our robust options market, we continue to invest in system enhancements, new products and investor education which is driving significant usage of our diverse fleet of option products. Q2 ADV rose 13% to 2.6 million contracts with electronic volumes up 29% compared to the prior year. In July, option volume remains extremely strong.","Overall, 52% of our options traded electronically in June, up from 50% in 2014. As I mentioned on the financial side, we're seeing strong growth in euro-dollar options, weekly Treasury options and also FX options.","On the commodities portfolio we're seeing strength in the WTI options and agricultural products with July running at peak levels in these commodities. I think that suggests that market participants are anticipating more volatility ahead. After some enhanced volatility in early July with the situation in Greece and large movements in the Chinese equity market, activity has returned to the normal summer vacation mode.","However, the options positionings suggests that market participants are looking ahead. So, overall, we continue execute on our strategy to deliver growth in a highly efficient way throughout the organization.","With that I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Thank you, Gill and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our results this quarter. We drove double-digit organic revenue growth, while our expenses decreased, driving significant operating leverage and EPS growth.","Q2 revenue was up 12% which follows the 8% revenue growth we delivered in Q1. Volume in the second quarter started slow, but finished exceptionally strong. Our adjusted expenses for the quarter were down 1% from the same quarter last year, driven primarily by decreases in marketing and other costs and professional fees.","Our variable costs, license fees and bonus increased due to our improved performance compared to last year. Our operating margins are again above 60% with an adjusted operating margin of 60.5% which improved from 55% a year ago. Finally, our adjusted EPS grew 23% during the quarter, up from 18% growth in Q1.","I will start with some revenue details. The rate for contract for Q1 was $0.777, up from $0.753 last quarter. The largest impact was driven by a favorable shift in product mix with record agricultural commodities propelling the RPC higher. The other positives include a larger proportion from higher-paying non-members in several product areas, lower volume tier impact and lastly, our pricing change that went into effect in February.","OTC swaps revenue totaled $18 million for the quarter, up 35% versus $13 million last year. During the second quarter we captured $139 per IRS-cleared trade, an increase from the $130 range which we have been averaging. We cleared approximately 1,950 trades per day in Q2, up 38% from a year ago.","Market data revenue of $103 million was up 15% versus Q2 last year, driven primarily by the elimination of our fee waiver program which we have discussed the last few quarters. Fortunately, we saw better-than-expected screen counts for both grandfathered and full-paying customers in the second quarter. We will continue to monitor the impacts of the fee changes and we currently anticipate about $100 million per quarter of market data revenue for the remainder of 2015 based on potential attrition from here.","Adjusted operating expenses in Q2 were $324 million, down $3.4 million from Q2 last year. We remain extremely focused on driving efficiency throughout the organization and eliminating redundancy to improve agility in customer and market responsiveness.","At the end of Q2 had 2650 employees, down 20 from the end of Q1 and down 30 from the beginning of the year. In July, we eliminated an additional 60 lower-level positions related to the closure of most of our futures pits in Chicago and New York. Within the compensation line our base and benefits were down 2% from last year and down 1% from last quarter. The stock-based compensation increased approximately $5 million sequentially. This was driven almost entirely by the performance share component of our equity program which is based on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 and cash earnings generation during the three-year period from 2013 through 2015.","Based on the fact we're tracking well above the 75th percentile of this S&P 500 in total shareholder return, as well as being ahead of our cash earnings target, we expect to reach the maximum payout and we accounted for it this quarter. Our compensation ratio for the first half of the year is running at an industry-leading 16.5%, down from 17.1% in 2014 and 17.4% in 2013.","Turning to taxes, the effective rate for the quarter was 36.6%. I expect the second half of the year to come in around 37%. And now to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter and after refinancing our debt which we covered last quarter, we had $1.33 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. That is approximately $630 million above our $700 million minimum cash target.","During the second quarter capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $28 million and we're at $55 million for the year-to-date. We expect full-year 2015 CapEx to come in at $140 million, similar to last year and below our original guidance of $150 million. For the full year, we expect adjusted expenses to be $10 million lower than we had previously guided to at $1.3 billion, down about 1% from last year despite our current double-digit revenue growth.","In summary, the second quarter of 2015 once again demonstrated the power of the CME Group business model. Broad-based volume growth and our disciplined expense management drove adjusted EPS up more than 20%. The entire management team continues to focus on driving earnings growth as we come out of the cycle and returning the maximum amount of capital to our shoulders. In the last few months we have closed the majority of our futures pits, reduced overall headcount, consolidated data centers and reduced branding-related costs.","With that we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue if you have further questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. ","Ken Worthington","I want to follow up on Gill's comment on the spread between LCH and CME. It obviously widened out this past quarter and seemed to drive business to LCH, so maybe could you give us further details on what really is happening here?","I do believe Gill mentioned that the spread has narrowed. I think our calculations were that the spread narrowed from about 2 basis points to somewhere in the 1.4 basis point range for a 30-year product, so it has narrowed, but it's still reasonably wide. I guess the last part is what is the outlook there and does business start to come back to CME? Thanks.","Sean Tully","This is Sean Tully, I'm responsible for financials. Jumping in, in terms of the basis itself, in early May the basis did jump. So in the 10-year sector it went from around a 0.25 basis point out to a peak of 2.35 basis points. Once the basis jumped, once it widened, CME Group did make the decision to issue its own specific CME curve for interest rate swaps. Obviously that is very prudent from a risk management perspective, but also adds massive transparency to the marketplace. We announced that on May 13.","June 8 we implemented the CME-specific curve and since then the basis has stabilized dramatically. So since June 8 the average standard deviation on a daily basis is less than 5\/100 of a basis point, so really completely de minimus. If you look at the last week or so, the entire range of that spread has been 1\/10 of a basis point in the 10-year, trading between 0.9 of a basis point and 1.0 basis points.","What that means is that, while the volatility was high during early May, since we have added transparency, since we've added a CME-specific curve, the market has completely stabilized. And in terms of interest rate swaps, if you're an active trader the level at which you get in relative to, let's say, a competitor is not nearly as important as the level you get in versus the level you get out. So what matters is the stability of the spread and we've seen that.","In addition to that, with the stability of the spread, but also with the increased interest in this, we've seen record volumes in dealer-to-dealer trading at CME Group. So we now have 25 dealers trading -- actively trading on that basis and again it's at a very tight level. The bid-offer spread in the interdealer market is again around 5\/100 of a basis point. If you think about that relative to outright level of rates, that is 1\/100, literally 1\/100, the volatility of the level of outright rates since June 8.","In addition to seeing the increased dealer-to-dealer activity, since May 1 we've seen 18 new clients. So we've had 18 new clients that had never cleared with CME Group previously jump into the marketplace and begin to clear swaps here. Many folks wanting to take advantage of the higher rate that they could get at our platform. In addition to that, with the higher rate for certain folks, in particular large issuers of U.S. dollar debt, this may be seen as an advantage. Hence, we've also seen an increase in interest on folks becoming new clearing members at CME Group in particular and particular issuers of debt.","Phupinder Gill","Ken, just to add to what Sean said, a lot of the change in the volume that you saw is associated with the high turnover clients that tend to pay the lowest rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen of Evercore. Your line is open.","Chris Allen","Just wanted to ask if you guys can provide any color on the open interest trends we're seeing? We've seen -- I mean year-over-year growth has been slowing since April; in July it's trending down on a year-over-year perspective. Particularly kind of looking at like the rate open interest levels are raising some eyebrows just given we're pretty close to a potential Fed move in September or December. So any color there would be greatly appreciated.","Phupinder Gill","Sure. I'm going to start and I'm going to ask both Derek and Sean to comment on their individual portfolios. I think on the whole, if you look at the growth of open interest, particularly in relation to where we ended the year last year, it's pretty positive. I think there is a small dip in the energy portfolio and I stress small.","But if you are looking across the rest of the portfolio that we have, where open interest is concerned, where rates and equity and commodities and alternatives, they are seeing double-digit growth in open interest, foreign exchange open interest which as we articulated last year which was very high at the end of last year, is still even up 7%. And for the metals portfolio it is up 2%. With that I'm going to pass it over to both Sean and Derek to comment about their individual portfolios.","Derek Sammann","It's Derek. On the energy side, where I will probably focus a little bit more, the drop off in the open interest has really been on the power side. And that's not just a CME Group story, that's an industry story, so there's no real surprise there. That's a market segment that's going under some significant change right now.","We're doing extremely well on nat gas and WTI. You've seen the volume growth in particular on the options side as well, with the options volume up and TI close to 57%. When you look at our competitor on the Brent side, they are up about 10%. So the outperformance on the volume side being matched by the open interest growth side there.","Sean Tully","In terms of the financials, interest rates since year-end up 10% in terms of open interest. Equities up 20% and foreign exchange up 7% after, as Gill said, very strong growth last year. We've seen increasing uncertainty with the interest rate market [Technical Difficulty] expectations of potential Fed rate hikes later this year or early next year. So continue to see strong growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Rich Repetto","So I guess my question is your revenues are up it looks like around 10% in your first half versus last year and the volume is good. And obviously you had market data outperform relative to your guidance. But I guess, Gill, the question is, if you can rank the top two or three growth initiatives which would you place as the highest priority and how they are doing?","Phupinder Gill","I think, Rich, if you have the asset classes, such as the ones that we have, are your benchmarks across the board. And I think a very specific emphasis for us was to grow our client base; not just here, but around the world.","And in particular the globalization effort that we embarked upon has been really successful. We have seen a growth in our client accounts. We're also seeing -- on the OTC side I think Sean gave us a very thorough analysis of the growth on the OTC side. Of particular interest to us and what we're encouraged by is the growth of the large open interest holders in some of the key asset classes that we have. I'm going to ask Bryan if he has anything to add here in terms of the globalization efforts for us.","Bryan Durkin","Really the diversity of the product and asset classes that we represent has played extremely well in our international growth model and as a result, we've seen some double-digit growth occurring across the asset classes, both throughout Asia as well as within the EMEA sector. I think it's a demonstration of a very methodical and focused program where we're able to strategically locate our employees throughout the globe and be able to identify opportunities for further penetration and go after those customers. So part of the thing that we measure is also new client acquisition that we bring into the marketplace. And we're pretty pleased with the growth trajectory in that end, too, particularly for this past quarter.","Phupinder Gill","And, Rich just to add one last thing and I will ask Mr. Sammann to talk a little bit about that, is the growth in the electronification of options for us. And options in general actually, because we're on the cusp of change but it is uncertain with respect to both the timing and the scope and the scale of that change. They've seen remarkable activity here.","Derek Sammann","I think to the extent that the overall franchise has grown significantly over the course of the year we actually look at July; even on a going-forward basis our July options volumes, on average, are up 30% across the board. Every single asset class is up between 24% and 30%.","Specific on the electronification side, we're continuing to see trends that you've heard us talk about quarter on quarter. Our investment in education, in analytics and technology is allowing us to not only continue to grow our business but all the -- all the growth is coming electronically right now. So when you look at the aggregate portfolio, now 53% of our business in options trades electronically and all that increase in ADV growth quarter on quarter is all coming on Globex.","Gill briefly mentioned the consistent growth in euro-dollar electronification from 12% last year to 18%. July is 23%. Other notable events, gold options, for example, tripled -- doubled in volume last week with the new low in gold and the options volume went from basically 60% electronic to 80% electronic. So what we're seeing is on high-volume days, in spiking volume days, that growth is outpacing itself on the electronic side. So big area of investment in growth and I think the numbers are bearing that out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Alex Kramm of UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Alex Kramm","Not much here, so maybe you can -- one of the items you might give us an update on is the whole equivalency debate between U.S. and Europe, the one-day growth, two-day net. It sounds like that is still ongoing. And maybe specifically anything you've heard in terms of how this can be resolved.","One thing that somebody mentioned that I talked to the other day was that they might just go to the least common denominator which would be two-day gross. I don't know if you've heard that, but interested in what that would mean to your business because that sounds obviously pretty onerous solution.","Phupinder Gill","Alex, this is Gill. Terry just stepped out; he should be back soon. But it is a key focus of Chairman [indiscernible] is what we actually know. I would not go about trying to guess what he is thinking about. In various conversations with him it's clear to us that his orientation is to be fair and also to get the best outcome for global investors here. And Terry just walked in a second ago.","Terry Duffy","So we testified yesterday on the G-20 commitments equivalents. Obviously it was something that I raised in there and you can imagine people saying they want to have parity. I did reference to the Congress and others that we were prepared to give parity by saying that we would take the higher of, whether it was -- whatever the regime was and others still balked at that.","So it's clearly a competitive issue. Chairman Massad recognizes it's a competitive issue and I don't see him balking away from what we have here in the United States as a stronger regime being one-day gross for client and one-day net for house.","So I think we're in one of those situations where we're going to have to wait and see how the chairman reacts. I met with him again yesterday while in DC and --. So I do believe equivalents will get done. It will be done probably, I would hope, sometime in September\/October time period, but we'll have to wait and see. But I do believe that everybody in this country feels fairly strongly that our regime is the best regime. And we were going to have a standard global regime in years to come, hopefully and we won't have to go through this exercise that we're going through right now.","Alex Kramm","And, Terry, sorry you probably missed that part of my question but I suggested that some people have said two-day gross could be one solution. Do you think that's on the table and it could impact your business or do you think that's a nonstarter?","Terry Duffy","I think it's a nonstarter. I don't think it's on the table. I've heard nobody even reference it. I've heard nobody in our governments reference it. They already realize that one-day gross is collecting a higher margin on the client side to roughly over $38 billion to $40 billion higher than two-day net, so I think that they feel that that's plenty of coverage going forward. I have not heard anybody in this country introduce or discuss two-day gross.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. ","Dan Fannon","I guess my question for you, John, is on market data. You obviously gave your guidance. Wondering if you could just give some stats around what's happened thus far and how conservative your outlook is and what some of those assumptions are going forward for how you are thinking about attrition?","John Pietrowicz","Sure, Dan. We're very happy with our excellent market data results. In the first quarter we only had two billing periods in screen counts, so we accrued at anticipated level of higher attrition than we're currently experiencing. So we made an adjustment this quarter to reflect better-than-expected levels of screens.","We're going to continue to monitor the impacts of the pricing changes closely, so we currently expect the second half of the year to be approximately the same as the first half. We're not giving out any specific statistics around the number of screens, but what I can tell you is that they've been holding relatively flat. So we're pretty comfortable at the 100 million per quarter level. I'll just ask Bryan to chime in in terms of what he's hearing from the customers as it relates to market data.","Bryan Durkin","I would just say we got out there well in advance of the changes that were taking effect over the course of the past 12 months. The client base was well informed about our elimination of the waiver. We've worked very closely with the community in terms of making some adjustments in the reporting of screens and whatnot. Categorization of the type of trader; we made some modifications there.","So I think the marketplace, one, recognizes the value associated with market data; understands that we're going to continue to charge for it and as we continue to enhance the product itself, there is value associated with it. And the market is responding effectively in terms of the changes that we've put in incrementally, until we get to the ultimate full paying and end that waiver period of next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open. ","Mike Carrier","Just a quick question, it looked like on the non-op side you guys may be sold some shares on the BM&F side, so just wanted to get an update on the strategic relationship. And then maybe just broader, given the global landscape, just how you guys are thinking about the longer term in terms of either consolidation or relationships and how you guys are positioned for that.","John Pietrowicz","Sure. This is John, Mike. We sold approximately 14.3 million BM&F shares, so we did about $58 million in proceeds from those sales. We still hold 98 million shares or approximately 5.4% of BM&F. We did this for tax planning purposes, so we're likely to do some more. It's really strictly for tax planning. I think the relationship with BM&F is extremely strong. It's one of our key relationships around the globe. We work with them across multiple projects, whether it's on the technology side, whether it's on the product side or on the strategic side. So the relationship is really good.","Globalization is a very key part of our overall strategy. One of the components of that globalization, along with putting customer-facing people around the world is our relationships with key country champions in each of the locales. We recently signed an MOU with India and I'll ask Derek to comment on that.","Derek Sammann","As you probably saw, we put a press release out last week where we executed an MOU with MCX, the Multi-Commodity Exchange which is the largest Indian commodities exchange. They have an 85% market share in the commodity space.","What we've committed to work with them is we've got a 10-year commercial relationship with them by which they license our Henry Hub and WTI settlement prices and they trade features on the back of that that settle to our prices. We wanted to expand that and give them the pace of change from a regulatory perspective in India with the regulators rolling up under one single umbrella under SEBI. We wanted very much to both influence where we can, but also get closer to a strategic partner.","So we've launched a commitment to a number of work streams, one of which is to launch a joint study looking at the feasibility of setting up exchange and operations in the IFSC, International Financial Service Centre, in India in the state of Gujarat. So it looks like an interesting opportunity. India is very much opening under a Modi government. And to the point that John made before about country champions, MCX is certainly the leading commodities exchange which makes sense to match up and work closely with us as the global leader on the commodity side here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Alex Blostein","Given the success you guys have been having in electrifying euro-dollar options and just the options component as a whole, any updates on other potential shutdowns of trading pits and I guess how that could potentially play into your expense initiatives towards the end of the year and beyond?","John Pietrowicz","Sure, Alex. This is John. As indicated previously, when we closed down the futures pits we were able to unlock about $10 million in annual cost savings. We anticipate running the entire floors, both in Chicago and in New York; cost us approximately $50 million a year, so $40 million remaining for the open pits.","What's key for us is that we don't force the markets to move. The markets will move when and if, they are -- find liquidity and better execution on the box, so we want to manage that carefully. When you take a look, several of our pits are now approaching the 80%, 90% electronic phase. So it is something that we -- but we want the market to determine it. And I will turn it over to Derek, who manages our options business.","Derek Sammann","Yes, I think that's right. And as you've heard us talk about, our continued investment in the technology side is to enable the sort of complex spread trading that used to only be available on the floor. We're making that increasingly available with our solutions like CME Direct and adding analytics and capabilities to our electronic trading capabilities. So as John said, the market will find its place of liquidity. Increasingly in times of high volume and high volatility that growth is coming electronically, so we'll let that run its course.","Phupinder Gill","The central theme here, Alex, has not changed from the time that we demutualized. We said that when our clients said it's time to shut the pit, we would shut our pit. But the fact that we have done really well electronically is fantastic for us; it's a client choice. It shows -- the fact that some volume still remains in the pits is an indicator to us that although the trend is very positive that the pits remain viable for the options.","Terry Duffy","Gill, if I might just add, I don't want to undermine the fact that how important liquidity is on strategy-type transactions. Options are strategy-type transactions. Futures lend themselves more to trading electronically. Some of our products do lend themselves to trading electronically on the options side; others do not at this point in time, some of our biggest products with that fact. And the last thing we want to do is to try to move a lever to move a business and hurt that business. So I think it's critically important that we continue to manage it the way we've been doing it all along. Again, I think you cannot dismiss the value of liquidity, market-making capabilities and abilities the way we have on options. They are different from features.","John Pietrowicz","And just to add to what Terry said, we generate well in excess of $100 million per year out of the options pits themselves.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Maybe you can dive a little bit deeper into the energy complex, maybe just to give us an update on how some of the initiatives in Brent are going in terms of getting more commercial volume across your energy complex. And then any thoughts on NASDAQ's NFX platform coming into play here. Could it potentially be even a positive from the usage of market-makers arbitraging volumes against your complex?","Derek Sammann","Brent continues to move along. We have about a 12% market share in that market and it's important, not only as you [Technical Difficulty] for Brent trading in and of itself, but the spreads back into TI. So we're happy with that pace. We have no plans to change anything at this point. We're making steady progress and we've actually had some wins with some smaller commercials jump on board as well. So we're continuing to drive that and expand the ecosystem of participants there.","Relative to the NFX move-in, they opened on Friday. We've seen this entrance in other asset classes over time, whether it was ELX or NYPC or other efforts to come in and launch a me-too slate of products. As we talked about in the last call, in the absence of product differentiation, a capital efficiency story, depth of liquidity, diversity of products or client diversification, outside of that, just launching a me too in the existing products I think is a challenging value prop.","I think if you look at the depth of our market and the expanse of our WTI franchise right now, we're comfortable with the position. We absolutely welcome competition and we will let you guys decide how successful you think they are going to be.","Brian Bedell","And do you think it could actually improve your TI volumes if there is increasing arbitrage activity from the market makers?","Derek Sammann","It's interesting, we actually saw that happen in both NYPC and ELX when there was sort of a risk, [indiscernible] people would just put the risk on here and there. Frankly, unless it's real customer volume and real open interest that grows there, yes, we will benefit. But it won't necessarily be to the benefit if it's just market maker to market maker activity on that side.","So if it's true to form for every previous attack, yes, we will see a small bump in our side. You'll likely see a one-for-one. There is no shift going on, but you're likely to see increase there, match one-for-one increase here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris Harris","So a question on your volume growth outside the U.S. We look at these numbers and they are clearly very impressive. One of the things that we struggle with is how large your addressable market really is outside the U.S.. So just wondering if you guys have done any work on that and maybe wanting to get your comment on how penetrated you think you are at this point relative to the global opportunity.","Phupinder Gill","Chris, I will start and I'll ask Bryan to add if he would choose to. If you look at growth outside of the U.S., I think from your perspective when you are trying to see what the addressable market is, look at the top 10 exchanges as they exist now and then dial the clock back 10 years and look at the top 10 exchanges then. What you won't see is a lot of growth, a lot of activity coming from, in particular, the Chinese exchanges in the various parts of the globe.","The Hong Kong Exchange whose derivatives volumes have traditionally been very small is not a focus for us, but a client buys that emanates from Hong Kong because they also have touch points into China. So that would be a very simple, broad-based look at what the so-called addressable market is outside of the U.S.","And another way to think about it is the portion of the global trade volume that the CME Group companies had several years ago was just a portion of the global trade volume that they have now. And then the third dimension that I would use is the fixed asset classes and the portfolio that we have and the benchmark that we have within each of those. All of those asset classes have a global appeal and so they, in that sense, make the job of selling these products around the world very easy for us relative to other exchanges.","These factors, in total, actually are driving the growth that you are seeing where the quality of the market around the clock, the quality of the products, global benchmarks and the reach of these products are past 200 countries around the world. Does that make sense?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is open.","Kyle Voigt","I guess if you could just touch on another regulatory issue, on position limits in particular. There was a CFTC advisory committee meeting yesterday on the topic and it seems like within the commission this is an openness to having exchanges involved in implementation and oversight of position limits. So I guess my question would really be twofold.","First, what are the risks to the commodities market today that you see under the current proposed position limits and the enumerated bona fide hedging exemptions? And then, secondly, what is the feedback that you've gotten from the commission on potentially being part of the oversight and implementation of the position limits and hedging exemptions? Thanks.","Bryan Durkin","This is Bryan and I actually serve on the Energy Markets Advisory Committee and so participated in that discussion yesterday. And our message to the commission has been twofold.","One, we've had a very strong program in place for many, many years that has been very effective looking at our markets, the efficiency of those markets, focusing on spot-month limits which is where the criticality of market convergence takes effect.","We've continued spreading that message and working with the community and working very closely with the commission on looking at what's been proposed today, how it would be very restrictive in the context and impactful, we believe, to the liquidity and performance of these markets if the current proposed language for hedge exemptions were to become finalized.","We believe that the efforts that have been undertaken by the community in conjunction with market participants has helped the commission understand and appreciate the impacts of the proposed rulemaking that is out there today. We're very hopeful for a more balanced and pragmatic outcome with position limits and hedge exemptions. Terry?","Terry Duffy","Yes, let me just add to what Bryan said, because I did put this in my testimony also yesterday to make certain that we cannot have a position limits regime that's different than the rest of the world to make the U.S. anti-competitive, because one of the greats benefits we have is discovering price in this country.","Yesterday at Bryan's meeting question came up and I heard this through one of the staff, that as a public company are we the right person to be setting position limits. Well, the I answer to that question is we're absolutely the right company to be setting the position limits because we have the most at risk on the credibility of our marketplace more than anybody else.","So we have the expertise to do it, as Bryan has outlined and of course the credibility issue is what we're all about. If we don't have a credible market, we don't have a credible institution. So we have the most incentive to make sure that these position limits are set properly and these markets are policed correctly.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Rich Repetto","Just one quick follow-up, Gill and Bryan, I know -- or Sean -- you went through the whole basis point spread changes, but I guess my question, we're getting $18 million from OTC clearing per quarter; 2% of your revenue. And I know there's a lot of futurization benefits in there that are hard to specify, but it's certainly bolstering our improving revenue and volumes.","But this OTC business, what's the next catalyst to get -- will we expect to see more SEF trading or some other catalyst to get the contribution up from this $18 million that right now we're realizing per quarter?","Phupinder Gill","Rich, I will start and then I will ask Sean and Bryan to join if they have anything to add. I think if you are looking at the OTC effort and if you remember when we first walked down this path we said that the OTC market was extremely complementary to the core business of CME. We continue to focus on that core and in particular how to make the markets in which we offer our clients as efficient as we possibly can. So the $18 million, as you point out, belies the fact that there are cross-margin efficiencies. It belies the fact that there are futurization opportunities and it also belies the fact that there are what I'll call innovation opportunities that exist. One such innovation has been the deliverable swap futures which is the highest of volume-traded futures up to this point in time.","That innovation will continue. The cross-margining will continue and the education of our clients is also an ongoing process. I think, taken together, all of these factors will contribute to the growth of not just the core product, but in addition to the core you would see a corresponding growth on the swap side.","The SEF -- the advent of more liquidity on SEFs may help. There may be some DCMs that roll off of swap trading that might help, but as we have said in the past, many of these swap products are complicated. And the way that they trade now I think seemingly, at least to us, seems to be a rational way to actually trade. The more important thing is once you've done these trades how can you hold them in the most efficient way possible.","Sean Tully","This is Sean jumping in. In terms of innovation within the product itself, most recent innovation was Mexican peso interest rate swaps. Mexican peso interest rate swaps now the third most important currency from a revenue perspective for CME Group. That is the 18th currency that we have.","We will be shortly adding the Brazilian reais currency as well which will be our 19th currency. And we have the broadest set of currencies relative to any of our competition. If you look at so far this year, we've had $46 billion a day in non-U.S. de-currencies. I think it's, without question, the deepest penetration CME Group has ever had in the non-U.S. dollar interest-rate derivatives market.","So it's allowing us, from an ecosystem perspective -- while the revenues are low, from an ecosystem perspective to massively penetrate the global market in new currencies in a way that we've never done it before. And getting back to Gill's point, it's the portfolio margining and the growth of the core. So, 500 clients that we're clearing interest rate straight swaps for we're on a continuous basis cross-selling them into the futures.","Earlier this year Greenwich Capital -- not Greenwich Capital, excuse me, Greenwich Associates, issued a paper, Total Cost Analysis, looking at interest-rate swaps versus futures. And very clearly the interest-rate futures came out as the lower-cost alternative across the board relative to interest-rate swaps.","What that's allowed us to do, as we talked about earlier, is if you look at a couple of years ago our Treasury market futures had a 65% penetration of the cash Treasury market. That's now running at around 78%. So from a relative perspective, we've been able to grow our Treasury futures, again, on a relative basis from 65% to now 77%, 78%, so 13 percentage points. When you think about the size of our interest-rate futures market that is actually quite a large increase in revenues that we've seen on the back of the cross-sell to those 500 swap participants.","John Pietrowicz","Rich, this is John. Just to put a fine point on it; as we mentioned, the volume that has left has been more the high-velocity hedge fund, low charge per ticket kind of volume, so the revenue drop will be lower than the volume drop. And what you will see is the rate per OTC trade will likely increase due to that customer mix shift.","Rich Repetto","I guess my point is, even if it was up 50%, we're still talking 3% of revenue. Again and I acknowledge the portfolio margining and the futurization benefits, but the pure OTC revenue is still small compared to the whole complex. Anyway, that was helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And once more question, it comes from Ken Hill of Barclays. Your line is open.","Ken Hill","I just wanted to sneak one here at just kind high level. We've seen some really good organic revenue growth this year. You guys are bringing down the expense guidance here. At what point do you think about maybe perhaps spending a little bit more? Do you think the natural constraint there might be around an operating margin well above in the mid-60s? Or how should we think about that longer term if we continue to see this good organic revenue growth against spending levels right now?","Phupinder Gill","I think, Ken, I will start and I will ask John to add. Our willingness and ability to spend is almost entirely dictated by the opportunities that we see. And so there is no stop in spending. If there are opportunities that are worth the investment, we have never hesitated to invest and we, on a going-forward basis, will not change that approach.","John Pietrowicz","Sure, Ken. I think when we think about our opportunity set and what we're doing to manage the business, the areas that we're focused on in terms of efficiencies -- things like whether it's de-layering, whether it's closing the futures pits, whether it's optimizing our data center infrastructure, looking at how we provision and consume professional services -- all those expense management techniques are not in any way, shape or form impacting our ability to grow the business. So those are not growth inhibitors.","We do look at redirecting some of those savings towards investments in our growth opportunities. So you'll see, like for example, whether it's growing our business internationally or whether or not it's investing in our OTC business or whether it's investing in electronifying our options, those opportunities are being able to be funded somewhat through managing our core infrastructure. So we feel good about that.","In terms of our operating margin, there is no artificial constraint around how high our operating margin can go, other than 100%, for a longer period of time. I think the way we look at it is, we're managing -- we're pulling the levers that we can pull which is making sure we're running the most efficient engine as we can. And we're also using pricing levers and growing our business through interfacing with our customers.","So those are the -- that's what we're focused on. We're not focused necessarily on how high our margins can expand. Now, historically, we've been as high as 65% and that was several years ago, so that's the way we've been approaching things.","Phupinder Gill","Thank you all for joining us this morning. We're extremely excited about the progress that we've made this year and we look forward to seeing you all soon. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"5427":["CME Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) Q4 2016 Earnings Call February  2, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","John C.

I would now like to turn the conference over to John Peschier. Please go ahead, sir.","John C. Peschier - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Terry and John will make some initial remarks and then we will open up the call for your questions. Other members of our team will also participate during the Q&A.","Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language. Statements made on this call and the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.","For detailed information about factors that may affect our performance, may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are on our website. Also on the last page of the earnings release, you will find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, John. Welcome, everyone. And thank you for participating today. Before going into the details of our performance, I want to start out with a few comments, then I look forward to spending time focused on your questions. As most of you know, I have been heavily involved in leading our growth strategy since we decided to go public in 2002. I had the good fortune to lead the IPO and roadshow, and have been involved ever since.","In 2007 and 2008, I oversaw the acquisition of the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange. These two transactions were a cornerstone of our growth strategies. They have led to the tremendous product diversity and deep liquidity that we provide our customers around the world today.","One of the things we're always focused on is meeting our clients ever-changing needs. This requires continued innovation and the development of new capital-efficient solutions. One example of the benefits that our clients receive is having interest rate swaps and interest rate futures in a single clearinghouse. This has allowed for billions of dollars in margin savings for our clients. In addition, we are committed to reducing our day-to-day operating cost. This frees up dollars to spend on our growth initiatives. The bottom line, as a company, we are well positioned to help our customers navigate today's unpredictable global environment and, in turn, deliver value to you, our shareholders.","Before I turn things over to John, I want to make a couple of comments about today's results. Fourth quarter volume averaged more than 16 million contracts per day, up 24%. That included quarterly ADB records in interest rates, energy products and metals. As you know, we closely track our volume globally. For example, in the fourth quarter, trading volume rose more than 50% during both European and Asian trading hours. At the same time, volume during U.S. trading hours jumped 23%.","In terms of the full year, we reached record levels of volume, averaging 15.6 million contracts per day. This was up 12% compared with 2015. Our global growth was also impressive. Volumes from Europe and Asia were up 16% and 15%, respectively. Also, we continue to expand our options franchise. In 2016, we had record annual average daily volume of 3.1 million contracts, or an increase of 14%. Total revenue for the year rose by $268 million. At the same time, expenses excluding license fees remained relatively flat. This drove double-digit earnings growth.","Looking ahead, I'm more optimistic than ever about all the work we've done to position the company for continued success. We believe the need for risk management will remain strong, especially as unprecedented political changes continue to unfold throughout the world. It was very impressive to see our open interest in December exceed 122 million contracts. This reflects the continued growth of our customer base throughout the world. As I said earlier, we also will continue to work closely with our customers to drive valuable product innovation. Innovation is the lifeblood of every institution and I see it no differently.","I'm encouraged by the good start we have seen so far in 2017. I want to commend my team for their hard work as we continue to manage and grow our business.","I look forward to taking your questions in just a few minutes. But for now, I will turn it over to John to discuss 2016 and our plans for this year. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Terry, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to finish off a tremendous year with a very strong fourth quarter. Our team continues to be intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders.","For the full year, ADB grew 12% from 2015, driving an 8% revenue increase for the year. Adjusted operating expenses, excluding license fees, grew by less than 1% and was below my original guidance for 2016. Global revenue growth coupled with strong cost management led to excellent operating leverage, with adjusted diluted EPS growing 12% in 2016 to $4.53 per share. In Q4, we were able to grow revenue 12% and adjusted diluted EPS 18%, to $1.14. I will touch on the main details.","Our rate per contract for the fourth quarter was $0.731, down from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to a higher proportion of overall trading in interest rates as well as an increased proportion of activity from members during the quarter. Market data and access and communication fees were up $1 million and $2 million versus Q4 last year, respectively. In addition, other revenue increased $6.5 million, mainly due to a significant software sale.","Moving to expenses. Excluding license fees and adjustments, our fourth quarter total expense increased 3% from the prior year to $290 million, which is where we guided to last quarter. We had the normal sequential quarter expense increase this year, driven by marketing events, advertising, as well as project-related fees. Our adjusted compensation-related expense increased by less than 1% compared to last year and the compensation ratio in Q4 was 14.6%, down from 16.3% a year ago. In addition, the decline in our full-year comp ratio had a similar trajectory.","Looking at the non-operating income and expense line for the fourth quarter, our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture drove $28 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, up 12% from Q4 last year. The compound annual growth rate on this contribution has been 13% since 2013.","Turning to investment income. We received $3.7 million in dividends from BM&FBOVESPA. In addition, our investment returns, generated through the reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed fund contributions, increase sequentially to $8.4 million from $7.3 million in Q3. Taxes for the fourth quarter were an adjusted 35.6% and were 36.2% for the full year.","And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $1.95 billion in cash and restricted cash. We returned approximately $1.1 billion of that with our annual variable dividend of $3.25 per share in January. In 2016, we returned $1.8 billion of dividends to our shareholders.","During January, we sold down the remainder of our equity stake in BM&FBOVESPA. The total net proceeds are expected to be approximately $240 million. We will continue our strong and strategic relationship with them, and we have each decided that joint equity ownership is not required.","During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $33 million, bringing the full year to $92 million. Overall our annual spend is lower than previous years, partly because of our asset-light strategy of eliminating real estate and, in 2016, selling our data center.","From capital perspective, we are primarily focused on our technology and clearing services, and we have invested approximately $12 million more in those activities in 2016 than last year. In terms of guidance for next year, we expect CapEx to come in between $100 million and $110 million.","Turning to operating expenses. We will continue to be as efficient as possible as we execute on our strategy. For 2016, we guided to and achieved only a 1% increase in adjusted expenses, excluding license fees, and we expect to do the same in 2017. We anticipate adjusted total expense growth of approximately 1% to $1.09 billion, excluding license fees, in 2017. Included in the guidance are investments in organic market data growth and new product extensions and offerings.","Now to market data. As Bryan mentioned last quarter, we have been doing a comprehensive review of our data business and the opportunity to expand beyond our traditional screen-based real-time offering. Our plan is to increase the data sales team focused on derived data, offer new services, such as our cloud-based data platform, which enables us to easily add new data content and also build out an audit function. We expect to see approximately 5% to 6% organic revenue growth over the next few years, with 2017 being back-end loaded.","Finally, excluding any federal tax changes, we expect our tax rate next year to be approximately the same as this year, at 36.3%. In summary, for the year, our revenue was up nearly $270 million and our incremental operating margin was 92%. Without license fees, that jumps to about 96%. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results, our efficiency on expenses has been excellent and we are excited about the prospects ahead.","With that, we would like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back in the queue if you have any further questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will pause for a second just to assemble a queue. We'll take our first question from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah, good morning, Terry. Good morning, John.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. I guess since we just have one question, a broader question then. Terry, as you look at the potential regulatory rollbacks \u2013 and I know it's unclear what they exactly are. But I'm just trying to get your assessment on the net impact, whether it's positive or negative. And how you look at, say, if the banks do get more active in proprietary trading, because I know you've done well in also getting the firms that have been spun out of the big banks as well.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Right. So, Rich, let me take that in a couple of different ways. First on the regulatory rollbacks, if there's going to be any rollbacks at all. I actually believe that the market in general has shown that there already is rollbacks by doing nothing. And I say that for a couple reasons.","When you look at the existing law that was passed in 2010, the Dodd-Frank law, roughly 80% of the rules were passed at the CFTC and something just shy of that at the SEC. So I believe some of the rules that have yet to be proposed or written may never even happen. And then you have other laws at the Fed, banking laws and things of that nature, that are yet to still come out of some of the legislation. So I think that's almost a little bit of deregulation by doing nothing at all. And I think that's what the market is seeing.","I also think the market is seeing that we're not going to get a bunch of new laws. You've got to look at today's compliance for regulatory matters is roughly $2 trillion. I mean, that's up significantly over the last 20 years. So I think we're getting to a point where the market finally sees some clarity that we have a lot of rules and laws on the books. And no one's saying it is bad to have rules and laws, but I think that, in other words, a rollback or not is yet to be seen in what it would be.","As far as the banks' proprietary trading goes, I'll talk about the Volcker a little bit on that. One of the things that I think is a great opportunity right now. As you recall, the banks were able to proprietary trade in cash treasuries. But for some reason, they omitted the futures contracts. I think that's one of the things that they'll be able to \u2013 we're hopeful they will be able to participate in that market to create liquidity. Liquidity is critically important for everybody. It makes markets more efficient. The more participants, the better the marketplace is. So that would kind of be my theme of what I think is going to happen as far as the regs go.","That answer your questions?","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yes. Yes. Thank you. And then the rules \u2013 go ahead.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","And then, Rich, just on the energy also, I didn't touch on that, but I will because it's a big part of our asset classes. And if Derek wants to jump in, that's fine. But on the regulatory side of things, one of the things that we were seeing out of the past administration was position limits coming down and we didn't know what that was going to look like. I think now, that's not off the table, but I would think that any kind of position limits that are going to come out of the new administration will be at a point we're making sure business can grow, commercials can grow and other participants will be able to grow. So I think that's also a net positive for our energy complex.","And I don't know if you want to touch on that, Derek, or you want to wait until there's other questions about the product itself.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'll very quickly follow up on the participation side. Yeah, I think when you look at what happened over the last four years or so, Rich, you saw a lot of the banks step out of the physical commodities markets, mostly in fact on the energy side.","Now we've filled that void. You see that we've focused on bringing commercial customers in over the last two and a half years, and we're delivering not only record open interest, but record levels of large open interest holders. So the point that Terry made, if there is a means by which the banks can reenter the principal business in the physical commodities market, their coming back into a market that's much more diversified and broader already. So we think that would be nothing but upside to the business.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thank you. Very helpful. I'll get back in the queue.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot, guys.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Hi.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John, just maybe two clarifications. Just one on the market data growth outlook, just wanted to get a sense on maybe what's driving that. And is that an annual growth rate? I know you said 2017 is more back-half weighted, but just wanted to get some longer-term perspective.","And then just on the cash, I don't know if you can give us an updated cash level post-distribution and with the sale of BVM&F. But just wanted to get a sense of where that stood.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, in terms of the market data, after we've done an in-depth review of our strategy, we believe we have a plan that through investing in derived data sales, additional services, including our cloud-based services, and a more robust audit function, that we can deliver 5% to 6% annual growth in this business. And 5% to 6% for 2017 will be obviously ramped towards the back end of the year. So that's 5% to 6% annually over the next few years.","With regard to the cash, we had about $1.1 billion in annual variable dividend. That left us about \u2013 when you look at the end of the year balance sheet, left is about $850 million in cash on hand, which is slightly higher than the $700 million that we had targeted, but we had a very tremendous fourth quarter.","In terms of BVM&F, we did complete the sale of our stake in BVM&F. That netted us in the month of January about $240 million in cash.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. John, if you could just touch on the expense guidance. Obviously the cost control continues to be very good here. If you're not willing to give the volume assumptions under that, at least if I can propose something like, let's say, if we had a 15% increase in ADV in 2017, would you still be able to keep that expense growth at around 1%?","And then maybe, Terry, if you could just comment on the volatility backdrop, your view of what volatility in general may be for interest rates, in particular in 2017, given the new administration and what you've seen versus past years. Thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. Brian. I'll touch on the expense side. We have done a tremendous job across the whole organization. The entire team is focused on really driving our business as efficiently as we possibly can. So our guidance is 1% excluding license fees. License fees tend to be tied to equity trading volume. That's the biggest impact driving license fees. It tends to \u2013 so when you look at the ratio of license fees to our equity volumes, that's probably a good mechanic to use going forward in terms of your assumptions around volumes in our equity complex.","If we tend to have a really tremendous year this year, the area that would flex the most, excluding license fees, would be obviously the bonus. The bonus would go higher relative to our performance. We would attempt to offset that through other mechanisms if it was necessary. In fact, when you look at Q4, you can see that our bonus was higher as a result of the activity. And we still met our guidance for the quarter.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Brian, I'll touch a little bit on the volatility. But as you know, it's very difficult to predict, and volatility is just one of the components that people use our markets for to manage risk. There's a whole host of issues why the markets go up and down, obviously. But when I look at what's coming at us in 2017 which could create some volatility, I always like to look at prices of certain asset classes.","So I'm looking at the equity markets, which are obviously on historic highs, so something could give either way. So if, in fact, the administration does get the corporate tax cut it has been proposing, then maybe the market could potentially look cheap because of what that could mean for corporations to their bottom line. And, if not, maybe it looks a little lumpy. So that could create some volatility.","When you look at our other complexes, the energy complex is also interesting because of the potential conversation around putting a tariff on imported products, what that could mean for the price of energy, and Derek can touch on it as well. But that also could create some volatility between the TI and Brent spreads that could be quite interesting for the energy complex.","I also think what's interesting for 2017 is something we saw here in our own country this year, which is some of the European elections that we're going to see in 2017. As you know, we get a tremendous amount of revenue coming out of Europe. And that is something that, with the elections coming up I believe in Germany and France this year both, it could be another volatile situation. I'm not saying it's going to be the same as when President Trump was elected, but that's something that we could look at. So I think geopolitical volatility could be definitely in the mix and that'll also affect our foreign exchange complex as well once you get that volatility moving.","So, Derek, if you want to add to the energy component, but that's where I see the volatility.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's right. I think our early read of what that border tax might look like is it'd certainly be a boost to domestic production in the U.S., meaning that's a WTI oversupply story. So that's what our customers have been using our products for over the last two and a half years showing outperformance.","So one indicator of where we see people starting to take positions is we've got options on the Brent WTI spread. And we've seen that product kind of languish in the sub 100 to 500 a day contract volume. We're up to 5% contracts (21:38) a day. So to Terry's point, we're out in front of customer needs, providing solutions for them. As these evolve, we see this basically being a boost to WTI and this is where people hedge their energy risk through TI.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Does that answer your question, Brian?","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe just a quick comment on rates given what we've seen in November and all the repositioning...","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So let me kick that over to Sean Tully and he can give his comments on the rates.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. Great. Thanks very much, Terry. Thanks for the question. As we know, the Fed's current range for the fed funds rate is between 50 basis points and 75 basis points. If you look at the expectations for the marketplace, there's an expectation of a tightening in June and then a second one in December. So if you look at our fed funds futures, and actually our FedWatch Tool is really the barometer that the marketplace uses in order to look at what the Fed is going to do. We're currently expecting around end-of-year between 1% and 1.25% fed funds rate.","On the other hand, if you look at the Fed expectation, so the most recent survey by the FOMC itself, their expectations are between 0.9% and 2.1%. So the Federal Reserve has a very large range, more than 1 percentage point, of their expectations for the Fed rate at the end of the year. So there is a lot of opportunity for volatility. We did have a tightening in December.","The other thing I guess I would mention is the Federal Reserve likewise in their survey of themselves, the FOMC, they expect PCE to be between 1.7% and 2% at the end of the year, and the unemployment rate between 4.4% and 4.7%. Those are down to their targets. So they have a target of 2% inflation and 4.5% to 5% unemployment rate. So they are already at, or they will be at by year end, kind of their expectations for long-term equilibrium. So there is the opportunity \u2013 it depends on what happens with the economy, but it is an environment where you should see more Fed activity.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","I think just just to add to that. And I would see Sean as the expert, but when I look at some of the growth that we're seeing in this country, if you ever got some inflation because of the policies either set by administration or other folks that got a little bit over their skis on the buying power that they have the ability to do today, you could almost see the Fed getting over-reactive at the same point.","So we haven't talked a lot about inflation over the last couple of years because it just hasn't happened with the price of energy going down to $26 a barrel. But now that we see some of those changes, the inflation number might spark the Fed a little bit. I don't know, but that's one of the things I'm looking at.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's great color. Thanks so much.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","We will take our next question from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Really just around corporate tax reform. If the U.S. does lower the corporate tax rate, just wondering if you could provide some more color as to what you're going to do with any tax savings, if that would be all passed through to shareholders or maybe if you want to reinvest some of those savings in certain areas of your business?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Hi, Kyle. This is John. Thanks for the question. It's still early in the process to understand the full impact, but based on the plans that have been discussed, we believe we'll be able to keep about 80% to 90% of any tax rate reductions.","When we look at the net income that will drop to the bottom line, that goes into our cash pool that we can either use for further investment in the business or for our dividend. So it becomes part of the conversation as we look at our overall capital structure and investment policy. So it's available. We haven't specified where we would utilize that. But our view on our capital structure won't change relative to that.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, Thanks, John.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Kyle.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Just a quick question here on the industry and M&A. I think in the long run, there's expectations for continued industry consolidation. But with the current environment and the rise of populism, do you see cross headwinds at this point for cross-border M&A? Or how should we be thinking about the opportunity over the near-term versus the long-term at this point?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","I'll start on that and I'll let John make a comment and if Bryan wants to comment as well what he's seeing. On the cross-border M&A, it's very difficult to predict what's going to go on. I think when we're looking at the LSE\/DB transaction, everybody's focused on that at the moment. So I don't know how the environment is going to be for M&A. But I will say that if there's opportunities, obviously we're going to be looking at things if they make sense for our shareholders. If they're not, then we just won't be pursuing them.","So I'm not certain that the new administration or the folks in Europe are going to change the equation as far as where it's at today as far as M&A activity goes being improved or not improved. And I'm not sure if I'm answering your question correctly, Dan, if you're looking for probabilities about M&A, or if you're looking for opportunities in M&A. So I took your question as probabilities.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","I mean, it's a combination just in the sense that I think there are expectations for potentially continued industry consolidation or maybe some opportunities. I think you're kind of touching \u2013 it's not so much near-term it's more about the longer-term picture. But I think we're kind of getting in that area. So...","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think just to be clear. I think we look at M&A, our view is always, are we going to be able to create long-term shareholder value and how does it fit with our strategy. So we pay attention to the marketplace and are constantly looking at opportunities. And when we see something that is long-term value enhancing, we'll act on it.","I think Terry's right. I think the environment is challenging cross-border, but we are always investigating and looking at opportunities.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful. I'll get back into queue. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Hey, guys. Wanted to ask another question on tax. You guys know, there was an accounting change in and around the treatment of equity grants. And for some firms, it's serving to lower corporate tax rates. And looking at your guidance, it looks like obviously that's not the case. So just wondering if you guys could expand on perhaps why that is.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, sure. This is John. I'd be happy to take that. When you look at the change in the accounting rules around equity grants, for us, it represents a two-tenths to three-tenths of a percent impact to our effective tax rate. And that's been included in our guidance.","Now, as you know, that this rule change, the impact on the taxes relative to the rule change is a function of the aggregate cost of the equity grants relative to our total income. So our equity grant expense is a smaller proportion of our income than some of our peers. So the impact to us is less than others because of the size of our income relative to our equity grant expense. Now, just to be clear, this is a non-cash item. So from a cash flow perspective, it has minimal impact. So just keep that in mind as you're looking at the impacts.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Alex.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Also a bigger picture question for Terry. Obviously, as you noted, you've been involved in the company for quite some time, but I think this is your first call as the CEO. So just wondering in terms of strategic priorities for you, any things that you would point out that you might change or would take a different view. Obviously there's been a lot going on in the industry. But what do you think you will really focus on here? And what you think the company might head in a little bit of a different direction than previously? And I know somebody has asked about M&A already, been curious if you think your views on M&A are any different than from maybe the prior leadership team?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So let me take that in a couple pieces. First of all, my focus I don't think is any different than the leadership that's been around this organization for a long time because the focus has really been around the clients. And I said that earlier. And I think that's the most important part of what we do is service our client. What I'm looking at is looking for more ways to create capital efficiencies for our clients in order to bring them in here so they can obviously trade more and then, in turn, if we can do that, we think the shareholders will be rewarded.","We also have to continue to be innovative. Sometimes we rely very heavily on the asset classes we have and we get derivatives of a derivative. So we're always looking at new things that the world doesn't even know it needs yet today for tomorrow. That's one of the things that we're looking at.","But what my focus is is really doing things that drop to the bottom line and being decisive about them. I think we have to be very decisive. And one example of that is to liquidate the BM&F position. It wasn't because the relationship was not good or anything of that nature because the relationship was great. We did it because the commercial arrangements were basically done and we did not need to invest your money in that. If you want to buy BM&F stock, the shareholders can do that themselves. So we acted very decisively on that and we exited that position.","The other thing is discipline as far as new proposals go. If they don't work, we're going to be very disciplined on the expense side of it and also on the timing of how we're going to let some of these things hang out there. I'm not sure if that completely answered your question.","And then on the M&A stuff, I think you asked a question on M&A also, Alex? Do I think any differently on M&A?","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Just curious, I guess just curious if you think your views are different than the prior leadership team. And since you just talked about the initiatives, does that include things like the European business? Can you be any more specific around anything that might be on the chopping block that wasn't before? And I'll leave it at that.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, I'm not going to comment on that because we're always analyzing our investments that we have, whether in London or other places. So we'll continue to analyze that. There's been no decisions made either way on some of these investments in Europe.","But as far as M&A goes, I'm not looking at it any different than what John said earlier, I believe to Chris or to Dan, and that is we're going to look for things that make sense for us. And if we can get to that point, I'm going to be very supportive of it. I'm not a big fan of one-off smaller-type acquisitions that are in the pipeline that people believe that anything could add value. I think that you have to really \u2013 you can't throw everything against the wall and expect it to work.","So we're going to very focused and targeted on what we think can add value to our clients. And that's where we're going with this. And sometimes I'm a little bit more direct than my predecessors, but I'm going to be more direct because I think it's important for you and for our shareholders to hear that from me.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Allen with Buckingham Capital.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Morning, guys. I may have missed this and I apologize if I did. Just on the market data guidance, does this build in any price increases at all?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Hi, Chris. This is John. Relative to market data, no, we have not announced any pricing actions for 2017.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And the forward guidance does not bake that into your thinking or is that just more driven around sales, new products?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, what we're really focused on in addition to our real-time data offering is investing in derived data sales, offering additional services, including our cloud-based services, for our customers so they can get more types of data easily more accessible and building out a robust auto function. Bryan can comment. It's his area.","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Just one more point, Chris, is we're being far more targeted and focused in how we go about segmenting our customers and our consumers of data. We're able to do so with greater level of granularity and we really view that that opens up opportunities for us to drive more business and revenues in that regard.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it. And then just a real quick one. The software sale, $6.4 million, is that just a one-time kind of event?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, the software sale is an unusually large item. So we wanted to highlight it for you. It was approximately $5 million.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Good morning.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Vincent.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Can you provide us with an update on the retail trading push you decided to make it the end of last year?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. It's retail.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Retail.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Retail push. Yeah.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So the retail push is an interesting one, Vincent. Right now we are new at the game of retail, for lack of a better term, what we'd call retail. Retail is basically participants that are already active in the marketplaces in all different types of securities, including trading derivatives. So we have a very small part of that. But the revenue is starting to grow significantly.","When you look at it, I believe we have roughly 4% of the retail trade that we deem as retail of the 14 million active accounts that are retail, so there's another 13.5 million roughly accounts out there that could potentially be using our products. So we are getting more and more aggressive at targeting these folks who are already participating.","And I think what's important here is we're not targeting people that have never traded before or participated in the marketplace. These are professionals that are already in the marketplace. A lot of them are trading ETFs, a lot of them are trading equity options. And, obviously, they have the ability to trade futures. If you saw what I believe our friends at TD Ameritrade made some comments during their call that they had a lot of participants picking up their activity in trading from there. So those are the type of participants we're looking at.","And it's been quite a successful campaign. But it's one of those ones that it takes some time. And when you look at the products that they are looking to participate in, energy, FX and gold seems to be the three things that they like to participate in. These are very household every day products that we talk about. And so that has been one of the big upticks we've seen from the retail in those three asset classes.","So, Bryan, you want to comment further?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Terry. We're also seeing excellent growth coming out of the international time zones. So to put it in perspective, about 50% of our retail activity's coming out of the U.S., greater than 30% now is coming out of international. And within those product scopes that Terry outlined, we just see it as a tremendous opportunity to further penetrate those regions with the diversity of the products.","And also what's interesting is options. You're seeing a really nice uptake with options. In the past, it would be one in every 15 trades would be done by a retail participant in options. And now they're becoming more and more sophisticated, a lot of it through our educational efforts and partnering with our channel partners. It's about one in five now.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Vincent.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","So you've done a very good job of holding the line on expenses, helped by a move to close floors and move people overseas and consolidate real estate, et cetera. You obviously guided expense growth to 1% in 2017, which is also good. I guess looking ahead it would be helpful to know how much in savings you think those actions provided in 2016 and what the impact might be for 2017. And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, what do you view your organic growth rate in expenses to be? And additionally, do you see any moves that you can take going forward that might help mitigate that organic growth rate?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Rob. The entire team here has I think done a fantastic job of really looking at our infrastructure, making sure that we're spending every dollar as effectively as we possibly can. And this includes a lot of benefits for our customers, in fact. When we reduced management layers, it made us more agile, made us more responsive.","We've got staff overseas so we can also be able to handle client business better 24 hours a day and develop all the liquidity that we have on our systems 24 hours a day and service those customers 24 hours a day. So some of the actions we've taken, although have been cost-effective, but they've also been customer-effective.","Now going forward into this year, a lot of the work that we've done in 2016 is carrying over into 2017. So things like, we'll continue to sublet excess office space. We're closing the trading floor in New York this month. We have done that. And then we'll continue to benefit from the technology work we've done in terms of utilizing more Software-as-a-Service. As well as we've consolidated our data center and are working with our partner at CyrusOne, which is making us more effective in terms of costs relative to our data center usage. So I think when you look past 2017, excluding license fees, I would say that a low-single digit expense growth is what I would see going past 2017.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Rob.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up for John primarily here. First off, on the investment income line, how should we be thinking about that going forward now that the BM&FBOVESPA is out? Maybe remind us what else is in there. And considering that some of that is now driving by the margin-driven income, I guess, with the Fed just doing the hike in December, is there another tick up? How are you thinking that line is going to come in for 2017?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Alex. We've been really focused on driving as much income as we can. In fact, when you look at that other income and expense area, from 2014 it's gone from an expense of $400,000 to $31 million in 2016 for the full year. So it is something that is very meaningful. When you look at the components that are in there, one is our S&P Dow Jones joint venture. And for the quarter it was about $28 million. And this has had a CAGR of about 13% since 2013. We've got our interest expense.","And then we've got investment income. And we look at the investment income, you can think of it in kind of four components. The first is the investment we do on behalf of our clients. And that's generated about $21.1 million in income for the quarter. And then a couple lines down, you can see that we rebate a large portion of that back to our clients. And that's on the other expense line. And that was about $12.7 million. So that gives us a net of $8.4 million for the quarter, up from last quarter of $7.3 million.","Then we invest our corporate cash and we've got other investment gains. And that was about $2.8 million for the quarter. And the last component is the dividend income that we received from BVM&F this quarter. And that was $3.7 million. Obviously since we sold off our stake, we're not going to have that going forward.","So with regard to the Fed, yes, the Fed was available for house accounts. It was open and operating in the fourth quarter. We had average daily balances of about $2.3 billion for the quarter and that was about $6.5 billion at year end. We capture about 15 basis points net for house funds that are put up at the Fed. Our house participants receive about 60 basis points.","Now, the non-house customers currently don't have Fed access, although we are working with the Fed to attempt to make that happen. So going forward, until we have some clarity around access for the non-house accounts, we've been in approximately the $7 million to $10 million range for that investment income.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. That's helpful. And then maybe secondly real quick, just coming back to market data, you said back-end loaded. So if you think about the next couple quarters, I guess the core business before some of these initiatives take hold, maybe you mentioned this before, but should this trickle down further? Or do you see stability right now in your core subscription base?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","We see a stable trajectory with the core business. A number of these things are going to be implemented over the course of the next couple of quarters. So we'll be able to say more at the next one.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Sounds good. Thanks again.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, guys. Just as a follow up, you've given some really good color around expense growth and how you're thinking about expenses, but what about perhaps the opposite side of that coin? And so what I mean is that is there perhaps since the business is doing so well at this point, is there perhaps an opportunity to maybe have incremental investment that maybe just take a few more chances or roll the dice on a few more things that maybe you might not during if times were a little bit leaner? Wouldn't now be the time to do that? Or how should we be thinking about these other opportunities that maybe you guys are foregoing at this point?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","John will comment and then I will, too. But I will say that dice rolling is not in our business plan.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Terry. Yes. I think when we look at our spend, we are very disciplined with how we approach expenses. But our focus really has been to optimize our infrastructure so we can free up dollars to spend on growth initiatives.","So when you take a look at what we've done over the last several years, we have had an unprecedented number of new product offerings that are meaningful and additive to our bottom line. So you look at things like our Ultra 10-Year, you look at things like the weekly equity options. Those are meaningful products that we've launched that are helping to drive our bottom line. And that all has been done through being able to optimize our infrastructure, free up the dollars so we can do this kind of launches. Repo is another example of something that we've been investing in for the last couple of years towards new products.","Now, that all said, we'll not forego spending if we believe we have an opportunity in front of us. So there's not a point where we say we're not going to do something when we think there's going to be an opportunity ahead of us. So a couple examples, and maybe Sean could comment on it. On the OTC side of the business, we've had several really important launches that are unique to us that we've been able to launch that have been additive.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yes, so thank you, John. In interest rate swap clearing, for example, we had huge traction last year in Latin American currencies. We now offer more currencies for clearing interest rate swaps than any other platform globally.","If you look at growth last year, for example, in Brazilian reai and Mexican peso interest rate swaps, we had enormous growth. We actually, in the month of January, we had a record day where we cleared in a single day over MXN1 trillion worth of Mexican interest rate swaps, or $47 billion. We're going to leverage that in the coming months and years. This summer we are expecting to add additional currencies. In particular, we're focused there on Asian currencies. So we do hope to launch two additional currencies there later this year. In February, we are looking to launch hopefully by the end of February additional monthly foreign-exchange futures. So the innovation continues.","As John mentioned, the Ultra 10, which we launched in January of last year trades approximately 100,000 contracts a day today. The Wednesday Weekly options in the S&P 500 trades approximately 50,000 contracts a day. So we will continue to innovate, continue to grow, continue to take advantage of, as Terry mentioned, the opportunities to provide much greater capital and margin efficiencies for our clients in order to grow both our core as well as into the adjacent market.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So, Dan, just to comment of the dice throwing comment, which I couldn't help myself but to say that.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Just as a clarification, I guess part of the question was just how loose are the purse strings now versus maybe if the times were tighter?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Well, here, let me say it this way and differently. So one of the things that we have done and we're continuing to do is to put a discipline in place so we can continually be in the good position that you just outlined a moment ago when times are good. And then times can always change, you don't know what's going to happen. But opportunity that I've always seen in my career happens when times are uncertain.","So when you look at what's going on throughout the European community, and I'll use that as an example, don't think we're going that way, but this is an example. With Brexit, that could be two to three years before there's any clarity on what's going to happen over there. So in my mind that creates uncertainty which creates opportunity. But you cannot take advantage of the opportunity if you're not being disciplined with the way you're handling your business today.","So, yes, we can look at different things going forward, new products, new opportunities and maybe take a, we'll use your phrase, roll a dice or two. But it will be very calculated and it will be in a position of strength, not a position of weakness, no matter what the market conditions are.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, and I think just the final point on it, and Terry mentioned at the start. We're very customer-oriented, very customer-focused. So a lot of the new product come from dealing closer with our customers, which allows us to be very responsive, allows us to make change right away as we hear new products or services that they want.","And it also allows us to be in a position of strength when we offer the products. We don't have to do a lot of incenting because it's something that they want, it's something that they value. So it drives our revenue for the bottom line right away because it's value add for them and value add for us.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Very helpful. And then just one really quick short question here. A couple of years ago, there was a little bit of elevated discussion around the Omani Crude Oil Contract. Any additional color or update there?","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, this is Derek. Actually that's a good growth story. It's a market where it's really split between what that East versus West (51:46) benchmark looks like. We've got Omani Sour Crude listed on DME. We're a majority owner of that. That is a business that's acquired about 35% market share of that market. It's about a 20,000 contract a day business. That's a business that's breakeven for us, so we're very pleased with the growth there. In fact, we just hit in January on DME all-time open interest record and delivery record. It's a physical contract, which is what the market asked us to deliver out there.","So we're very pleased with the growth. And we're seeing increased uptake in the product, primarily from commercial, which has been our focal point out there. So we're seeing that in world which is both globalizing and regionalizing an opportunity to provide a physical product in market in businesses that are breakeven for us we think are opportunities to build clients and extend our product footprint.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Very good. That's it for me, guys, Thank you so much.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue. Now I'll turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","I want to thank everyone for participating this morning.

Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language.","Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. For detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, and they're also available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thanks, John. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm going to highlight CME Group's first quarter and then turn it over to Jamie to review our financials. We are pleased to announce solid results to start the year, highlighted by multiple records across our industry-leading diverse portfolio of products. The major driver of this performance was strong growth in short-term interest rate volumes throughout the quarter, further sparked by a report from the Federal Reserve in late March, indicating that the FOMC average estimate of the year-end Fed Funds rate in 2015 and 2016, had increased notably. The Federal Reserve also indicated that the definition of the \"considerable period\" during which rates would remain low beyond the end of quantitative easing may only be 6 months. The Federal Reserve Chair later softened this guidance on rates; nevertheless, the Feds Fund Futures Curve and implied estimate of when rates will rise, shifted upwards with the market expecting the Fed Funds rate to increase sometime in mid-2015. As you continue to see positive economic signs and an evolving desire within the Federal Reserve and extraordinary support measures are no longer needed, our interest rate option products, which allow for more sophisticated risk management of volatility and timing, have been rapidly growing. The market reacted positively in the first quarter 2014 to this momentum. Average daily volume for our core futures and options complex was up 9% compared to first quarter last year, mainly driven by strong growth in our 2 largest product areas based on volume, which are interest rates and equities. Our focus on building out and extending our options franchise continues to successfully grow this important part of our overall business. In total, first quarter 2014 options ADV was 2.5 million contracts, the second highest ADV in revenue quarter ever for options and was up 40% compared to last year.","Interest rate trading volumes rose 19% overall during the first quarter compared to the prior year period. Eurodollar futures and options grew 46% in the quarter, highlighted by a growth of 106% in options, as well as a new daily volume record in Eurodollar futures of 6 million contracts, which were traded on March 19. While treasury futures and options average daily volume was flat in the first quarter 2014 compared to last year, treasury options volume continued to perform well and was up 18%. In addition, momentum continues to build in our Ultra T-Bond futures and options product, which had record quarterly average daily volume of 104,000 contracts, which are up 22% compared to the first quarter last year. April is a very strong month for interest rate complex with average daily volume up almost 40% for the month versus the same period last year, highlighted by growth of more than 70% in Eurodollar futures and options for all the month. Our Eurodollar complex is the clear choice for the market to express its views of the FOMC's policy.","Over the last 12 months, open interest in Eurodollar options has doubled. The key driver here is the likely end of quantitative easing in the fourth quarter of 2014, which is already shifting attention to the next big policy decision, which is when and how much to raise the target at funds rate. With the rate decision coming into full focus, market participants have begun to adjust their risk management activities in the short end in the interest rate curve. Our interest rate swap over-the-counter complex has also benefited on the Fed's actions, as well as our continued efforts to add new capabilities. Open interest continues to trend upward, increasing over 50% from the end of the year to $13.7 trillion at the end of April. Over 440 global market participants have cleared at CME Group, taking advantage of the most capital efficient solution in the industry. 8 clearing members are now live with the service and over 30 customer accounts are already benefiting from this scalable solution. These clients using our portfolio margining service are saving on average over 40% through margin offsets, totaling close to $2 billion of efficiencies. Average daily notional volume cleared in the first quarter 2014 was $125 billion, with the new daily record of $264 billion cleared on March 20, 2014. Although, we've experienced fluctuations in market share for our dealer-to-customer IRS, notional volume cleared, we've experienced a steady increase in the amount of daily trades executed in our market from about 1,200 a day in Q4 last year to 1,500 in Q1 of this year at a level that was consistent with our primary competitor. The number of trades cleared has a much higher correlation to revenue than that notional value of clear trades. Jamie will explain this when he discusses the financials.","As I mentioned, equities is a strong performer in the quarter, which is continuing into the second quarter. During Q1, we saw the benefits of having a broadly diversified equity product line with our overall equity average daily volume up 11% versus last year, including growth in excess of 30% [ph] from NASDAQ, Dow, and the Nikkei index products. Equity E-mini options also rose 66% during the first quarter compared to Q1 last year.","Turning to foreign exchange. The global FX market continues to suffer this year, driven mainly by the FX benchmarking scandal and extremely low levels of volatility. While our FX average daily volume was down 19% in the first quarter compared to Q1 of last year. We continue to outperform the product OTC FX market, where we saw EVS'(sic)[EFS] FX volume down about 34% year-over-year. And based on our own customer analysis, as well as from recent research notes from Greenwich Associates, we feel that the market is increasingly adopting exchange-traded FX futures, which directly ties to our European exchange strategy. We launched our London-based derivatives exchange, CME Europe, earlier this week. Securing regulatory approvals to launch CME Europe marks a critical milestone in our global growth strategy. Our European clients are increasingly looking for ways to manage risk and access liquidity in their local jurisdiction, and launching a dedicated European exchange enables us to offer products tailored to their specific needs. This allows us to access a new non-U.S. client base, and with the move to central clearing, coupled with London's role at the center of global asset trading, opening CME Europe for business strengthens our competitiveness in this high-growth area. Also building on our globally relevant products, we will launch in North America a physically-delivered aluminum futures contract that will begin trading in the second quarter of this year, pending on regulatory approvals. This new aluminum futures contract will also offer global aluminum market participants a new tool for managing their exposure to volatile North American prices, while giving them access to physical aluminum at a number of CME Group-approved warehouses across the U.S.","Moving on to our other products, the energy market slowed after the first half -- after the fast start to the year, the natural gas average daily volume was very strong in January and early February, especially with the cold winter in the Midwest and the Northeast. The high volatility experienced, however, has dropped significantly with overall average daily volume in the energy sector for the quarter, basically flat. And lastly, before I turn the call over to Jamie to discuss our financials. I want to touch on the recent news surrounding high-frequency trading and the impact in our markets.","Let me start by saying that we're part of a highly regulated industry, and the most important thing for CME Group is the integrity of our markets for each and every participant. Any discussion of how to enhance market structure and efficiency, whether for derivatives, equities or other markets, is an important one to have. It is also important to acknowledge that markets continually evolve, and therefore, discussions about safeguards and efficiency must also evolve. CME Group has been and will continue to be an active leader in these discussions.","Likewise, we have been at the forefront of market and system innovations designed to safeguard and protect clients. As markets have become faster and more highly automated, CME Group has developed an array of capabilities to manage risk and volatility and mitigate market disruptions. Those include credit controls, spot loss logic that was utilized during the flash crash, velocity logic and messaging volume controls that will automatically reject anomalous orders caused, for example, by an order entry error or a malfunctioning algorithm. CME Group's regulatory databases capture hundreds of millions of orders and trade messages, market data messages, clear trade records and position records each and every day, which are integrated into other reference data we maintain to provide a comprehensive view of our CME Group markets.","We can identify who is doing what or whom and when down to the millisecond. Orders entered by automated systems and the teams who operate the automated systems are identified in the audit trail. In our markets, high-frequency traders are not afforded any special access or information that is not available to our market participants. HFTs do not have access to or information about customer orders before orders reach the central limit order book. Market data is made available to all subscribers at the same time, and they have a number of options to choose as to how they want to receive it. And lastly, it is important to remember that market participants regulated and academics have been discussing automated trading for years. Significant analysis has been done, highlighting the benefit of these types of participants existing in our markets and given the liquidity they provide, which ultimately tightens the bid-ask spread and reduces cost. The team, including our Chairman, is prepared to answer any detailed questions on this topic that you may have. So please feel free to ask us during the Q&A.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jamie to discuss the financials.","James E. Parisi","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. As Gill mentioned, volume grew nicely during the first quarter, driven by rates and equities. First quarter ADV was up 9%, revenue was up 8%, adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 14%, and the operating margin was 58%. Adjusted EPS for Q1 of $0.83, excludes FX fluctuations, prior period favorable tax results and changes in deferred taxes due to apportionment factors, outlined in our press release.","The rate per contract for the first quarter was $0.767, down from $0.78 last quarter. The main driver of the drop overall was strong growth in our lower price interest rate contracts, and we saw a higher proportion this quarter for members, with member volumes growing 22% and nonmember volumes growing 15%. The transaction fee pricing changes, we implemented beginning this year, added about $0.019 per contract within the 2% to 3% range we expected. OTC swaps revenue totaled $12.8 million, up 19% versus last quarter. Within interest rate swaps, as Gill mentioned, because of the bifurcated pricing structure in OTC, the trade count ends up being the best indicator of revenue. In Q1, we captured an average of about $128 per OTC trade and we cleared approximately 1,500 trades per day. In 2013, we averaged approximately $130 per trade. In terms of market share on trade count, we were at 49% in Q1, up from 48% in Q4 2013, and 47% for all of 2013. We plan to release the average daily trade count on a monthly basis, which should help you in terms of modeling. Market data came in at $89 million, up 17% versus last quarter. The screen counts were fairly stable, with attrition during the quarter of less than 1%, despite the pricing change that took effect on January 1. Additionally, the elimination of the fee waiver for new clients took effect beginning April 1, which should have a mitigating impact on overall terminal attrition going forward.","Moving on, first quarter operating expense was $325 million, excluding a $3.1 million FX benefit and $800,000 of deferred compensation expense, both of which we plan to remove for comparison purposes each quarter. Adjusted history, excluding these and other items previously identified to the last 5 quarters, is available on the income statement data file on our website. This result compares favorably to the Q4 2013 results. Our full year 2014 expense guidance remains at $1.31 billion, which assumes a certain level of license and fee sharing expense, as well as bonus expense, both of which generally vary with volume. Q1 nonoperating expense was $8.9 million, excluding the deferred compensation impact. We mentioned in our last volume release that we did not receive a dividend in Q1 from BM&F, similar to last year. Interest expense is down to $33.7 million, based on the pay off of a portion of our debt in February. Lastly, our index joint venture income for the quarter was the best yet, partially driven by increases in ETF assets under management and exchange-traded derivatives.","Turning to taxes, the effective rate for the quarter was approximately 37.4% on a pro forma basis. And now the balance sheet. We had approximately $1.1 billion in cash at the end of the quarter, reflecting payment of our $750 million note maturing in February and payment of our $870 million fifth dividend in January. This begins our -- this brings our total 2013 related dividend to $1.5 billion. Over the last 2.5 years since we implemented the new dividend policy, we have returned $2.9 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends, representing in excess of 10% of our market cap. Lastly, during the first quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $37 million.","In summary, we are keenly focused on planting the seeds for future growth, while also ensuring that our core business is positioned to benefit as various macro themes continue to play out.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And first, thank you for the detailed comments on HFT, Gill. I guess, my question is to Terry because you're mostly in contact with the regulators and the politicians, as much as anyone I know. But from your perspective, do you think that they separate the HFT issues from the equities market -- equity market and the futures market? And just, not to put you on the spot, but what do you think your exposure is if there was HFT regulation, say, by the SEC? Would it spill over, with spillover to futures? Or do you feel like you have exposure there?","Terrence A. Duffy","Rich, I would say that in the years that I have been in Washington -- and I just got back again late last night. Gill and I were both there, and Bryan. They can have an opportunity to lump everything together, and that's just the nature of Washington, DC. But what we do -- I think we do a very good job at is educating the differences in our model versus the equity models. And we didn't do that when Michael Lewis' book came out. We've been doing that for 10, 12 years now. So I think we -- but unfortunately, Congress turns over every couple of years, so you always have that risk and exposure. I feel very comfortable, though, with the people that we've been dealing with and talking with on the Hill, that they understand the differences at a certain level. There will be a potential hearing coming up in the Senate ag on HFT, which I will be participating on. And then there should be another one coming up in the Senate banking, which I'm not sure of the date of that. Again, we will use those opportunities to continually draw the differences in our market structure and the equity market structure so we don't get swept into some kind of reform that doesn't apply to our business.","Phupinder S. Gill","And Rich, just to add to that for the perspective of what the Chairman just said. The equity futures that this group of traders, so called HFT traders, is less than 3% of the overall revenue of the firm.","Operator","Our next question's from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you give us a little bit more detail on what you're seeing out there in terms of futurization? I don't think you talked about it much in the prepared remarks this time. And maybe give us some data that you might have in terms of, like, new participants that you're seeing for the first time, trading futures and also maybe rope this in, into some of the new SEF mandates and how those are going to be evolving over the next few months? And if you think that could be a driver of people finally saying, \"Okay, this is getting too complex. Let's start in futures again?\"","Bryan T. Durkin","I'll start, and Gill will add onto it. But you can see in terms of our overall growth in our open interest on the future side has trended up very nicely, over this past quarter particularly. And then you'll see, very much so, a strong trend across the Eurodollar curve, as well as the treasuries on the open interest. I would point you to, in terms of new users coming into the market, if you look at the Commitment of Traders report as it pertains to asset managers, there is a very significant trend in terms of their increase in open interest from over 1.8 million contracts to about 3.6 million contracts. And that ties directly into our interest rate futures product line. There is definitely, I think, continues to be some confusion and trepidation in the context of the SEF rules themselves and what the requirements are going to contemplate for the end users. And we're seeing that having the positive effect, quite frankly, in terms of turning towards the usage of our futures.","Phupinder S. Gill","And just to add to what Bryan just said, Alex, I think if you look at the deliverable swap futures over the past months, the open interest is up about 38% and to 108,000 contracts also. And there is an added dimension here that we've been full focused on the futurization efforts on the rate side, but we're also seeing some positive trends on the FX side where, with the market investigations that are going on, the open interest orders have come up in spite of the low volume on the FX side. So those are -- that's an average dimension that we had not seen until a short while ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I could just comeback to the HFT trading question. Terry, part of this was the whole -- and equity is very different in very different markets, I am sure we get that, but then part of it was kind of the latency advantage that the high frequency trading firms had, had. And there is an argument that, that shouldn't be the case. Whether it's unfair or the appearance of unfair. If -- walk me through what, if any, discussions that you might be having or hearing with regards to potentially limiting co-location services or limiting kind of some of the latency advantages. Like maybe forcing everybody to slowdown to the same pace, everybody being CME or maybe forcing you to kind of eliminate some of the advantage. I know you don't have the huge co-location business right now, but people can co-locate beside some of your data centers. So if that -- if co-location was something that they really -- the advantage of it wanted -- was something they wanted to pressure, is that something that you think could significantly impact that customer group for CME?","Terrence A. Duffy","I'm sorry. I just want to understand your question. Are you saying that co-location could come under pressure?","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes. If there was -- some of the regulators, like the New York Attorney General, for example, is kind of suggesting that it's unfair and this is a practice that should be ended.","Terrence A. Duffy","I think that when they dive into what co-location facilities do, they will understand that they're the fairest system in the world, and that's what we strive for at the CME. So when we bring regulators, we bring legislators out to our co-location facility and we show them how there is no difference to the match engine, no matter where you're at in our co-location facility because of how we operate the facility. And I think that, that is something that has become a huge benefit. So if you were to say a co-location needs to go away and your server is going to be in some building and someone else finds out where that building is at, that gives that particular individual the only advantage of being closer to a server. So I think people are understanding that. I do think that co-location got a bad rap, for lack of a better term, during this book because it appeared that some of these facilities may have been doing favors or giving speed to certain participants and not to others. That's not the model that CME deploys. I think that answered your question completely.","Phupinder S. Gill","I think if co-location did not exist, there will be a lot of folks buying up space around the facility just to get in there. And so to the Chairman's point, it's actually a more level playing field because it does exist. And anybody can participate, not just a very large...","Terrence A. Duffy","And I think to that point, Gill, when we were talking yesterday with some regulators, we said that if, in fact, we didn't have co-location facilities today, you would probably mandate them by law for us to have them.","James E. Parisi","And I would just add one more point, Niamh. You mentioned about possible favoritism on data access or data distribution. We don't provide any proprietary feeds or separate feeds to any market constituents. All of our data comes out through one consistent mechanism, one type to all the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I know you're just getting going here in Europe with the exchange, but I was wondering how you think about leveraging that clearing house and exchange in Europe as you expand into other regions over the longer term. So I was hoping you could -- how you see not only like marketing and sales efforts unfolding in Europe, but also in other regions like Asia, potentially leveraging that European hub?","Phupinder S. Gill","Sure. I'll start. If you look at the clearing house and the exchange we just launched, as we know, in this part of this week, I think market participants are just getting their feet on the ground. I think by the end of the month -- next month, we will see the participants in their full capacity participating. There are some connectivity issues within the firms themselves. But once they sort those out, we will start. And I think, in the words of our head of Europe, it has gone off to a gentle start. But the bigger question is, what's the plan here. And if you look at where it is located in terms of both the matching engine and the CCP, and you look at the sales force that CME has deployed, both in Europe as well as in Asia, as we develop and continue to innovate, we will have an option, depending on time need, as to where to list the various and sundry products as we develop them. So you could find as customer needs are European based, we would put them there with full access for everybody or we'll list them here in the U.S. So we have an additional platform in which to list any kinds of new innovations as we see fit. And beyond that, I don't think there's anything to share yet.","Operator","The next question comes from the Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And so energy activity has been somewhat weak in March and April. And you mentioned in your remarks that volatility has declined in nat gas, but it just seems like there might be something more going on there. I don't know if some of the disruption in the commodity markets or the banks is having an impact. But any color on those dynamics there would be helpful and thoughts on how we should be thinking about energy volumes shaping up over the rest of 2014?","Phupinder S. Gill","I think the low volatility in the nat gas is not necessarily a structural issue. It's largely driven by demand and supply. I think there are various and sundry things happening in the nat gas markets around the world, not just in Europe and in the U.S., but Asia in particular is going to be an area of full focus where growth is concerned. And I -- to your other part of your question where you see there may be something going on, I think structurally the biggest thing that's going on and the biggest debate in the energy marketplace at this time, the supply issues, as it relates to brand and there's a lot of debate around that. And also the oversupply issues that we have here in the U.S. that has been spoken about. The oversupply at the Oklahoma facility has been really significant and now the oversupply condition is on the coast. And so it puts a lot of pressure on the authorities with respect to what to do with that crude. A lot of it is being refined and exported, but it increases the pressure on the debate to allow for the expansion of crudes. Structurally, that's what's going on and I...","Terrence A. Duffy","Yes, Gill, just to add to that a little bit. I think the other part of her question was what about the banks coming out of the market a little bit. And I think when you look at the -- Gill, outlined it very well when he gave you the fundamental reasons. If the banks were in or the banks were not, the fundamentals would be the exact same as they are today. So if in fact the fundamental situation changes in the energy market, the volumes will follow whether the banks are participating or not.","Bryan T. Durkin","On that point of fundamentals, there are still significant potential fundamental factors that could result in higher, more-than-current volatility levels that we're experiencing. And seeing higher volatility return to the space when looking at weather, the Russian situation and the huge U.S. natural gas inventory shortfall, other global initiatives or concerns with respect to Venezuelan unrest, from all of these things could have an impact on volatility going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMC.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Margins, 58% this quarter, a really nice improvement from what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And I know you've given guidance for '14. But as we think about expenses longer-term, you've gone through this period of elevated investment over the last couple of years. This investment is going to season. It would seem like there is the potential for some disproportional operating leverage if you get the boost in revenues from the OTC side, the interest rate side. So I guess my question is, does this concept have any merit or does the incremental revenue continue to get spent on an accelerated pace on the next investment ideas?","James E. Parisi","Ken, this is Jamie. I think there's a very big focus internally on expense. We've said before that we look over the long run to grow our expenses and control them in a way that we're going to grow them probably in the mid-single digits. And when you have that kind of expense control and you lay on top of that growth in volumes in the out years moving forward, you're right, there is significant amount of operating leverage still alive in the model going forward. And we would expect that to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chinedu Onwugbolu with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With regards to the growth of the options business, what would it take to increase the electronic penetration in assets classes such as interest rates and energy? Is it a case of CME building the right tools for market participants? Or are there kind of wider, more strategic challenges that you need to overcome?","Phupinder S. Gill","No. I think if you look at the electronification percentage of the options products that we have, and also look at the types of investments that we have put into our matching engine over the year, the investments are there. The market practices that lend themselves more easily to electronic trading have taken place. Our electronic percentage has gone up from 35% last year to almost half this year, and where they continue to stay on the floor is when we're talking about trading strategies that are extremely complex. And so they lend themselves, at this time, more easily done on the floor. Where you see other markets around the world that have, it seems, have converted 100% to an electronic marketplace, in reality it's a call around marketplace with 5 or so market makers making markets on the phone and using the matching engine simply to book the trade. And that's not the case here. The strict rules that we have bifurcate between electronic trading, bid trading as well as block trading.","James E. Parisi","I would add to that, that we have an intensified emphasis in terms of augmenting our functionality within the match engine to handle the most complex strategies and multi-legged transactions. We're in the process of rolling out that additional functionality, working with the marketplace to bring more and more of that into the electronic platform.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So wanted to dive into the FX markets for a second. Clearly, volumes here today have been somewhat soft and then April seemed pretty light as well. Is that a function just of volatility or do you guys see something else that maybe structurally is driving volumes that are lower?","Bryan T. Durkin","We think that a lot of it is the functional aspects of the market and cyclical factors that are affecting the performance of the overall FX market. We're seeing unprecedentedly low volatility, which is hampering volume in that product sector. There is a number of other fundamental factors that impact the market users themselves in terms of their participation we're seeing because of this low volatility. And I also think the issues that are affecting the marking of the FX contracts in and of themselves has caused some pullback from certain segments of the market, particularly in the hedge funds in central bank area. However, we view this as being short-term, but challenge. And we're very confident about how with certain changes from a structural perspective, how this could be very positive in terms of our overall draw into our marketplace. It's a difficult comparison in terms of looking at it from Q1 of 2013 versus today. Volatility and volumes were driven largely based on the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Eurozone crisis and the debt ceiling standoff in Washington. Those factors have somewhat changed today. With respect to capital rules, clearing mandates, we're seeing an increasing interest in terms of shifting customer interest that we hadn't normally seen in our futures product, coming into our futures products. So we view that, that bodes favorably for the strategy that we've undertaken in terms of continuing to build that complex, while also offering some alternatives on the European sector.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just want to follow-up on Gill's answer to Rich's question. Just to clarify, HFT was less than 3% of equity futures revenues. Just wondering how you guys define HFT, whether you're excluding electronic market makers? Just because I recall that the last disclosure you gave around customer segmentation, prop trading, including algos, as I recall, it was over 40% of your overall business. So just any color on that would be helpful.","James E. Parisi","Sure, Chris. This is Jamie. That was a very broad category, as you noted. When we look at it, HFT is not really an extremely well-defined term. That said, we did announced this based on Q1 data. We looked, we filtered firms by speed, order modifications and by volume of orders processed. We then looked at their automated trades. We then took a look at that and bumped that, we looked at it versus where our customer-facing focus on firms fell and kind of triangulated a little bit there. And it looks like, based on that analysis, that these firms represent about 30% of our volumes and less than 15% of our total revenues. And included in those numbers are volumes related to market making that happens with -- that they perform. So it's a -- I'd say, a fairly conservative number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Stratton with Citi.","Neil Stratton","I just had a question on the revenue per contract. Obviously, it'll shift based on product mix and client type and such. Is there any broad trends you expect to play out over the next several quarters?","James E. Parisi","I think when you look at the RPC, it's all those mix issues, right? So you're certainly going to -- if you expect the interest rate volumes to continue to grow in an outside way versus other quadrants that would weigh on the overall rate because they are a lower fee contract. As markets -- as people move from OTC, perhaps, into futures, we're likely to see some, over time, pickup in nonmembers. That would be a positive for the rates. And certainly, we put pricing changes in this year and that was a positive starting in January. And then when I look -- well, if I look down into energy -- I know there was question about that earlier. But on energy, there is some good non-U.S. growth in energy volumes, and actually some good nonmember growth in energy volumes as well in this past quarter, kind of masked by the overall flat result.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gaston Ceron, Morningstar Equity Research.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Thanks for the additional color and disclosure on HFT. I realize it sort of must feel like we're beating a dead horse, but just to come back to it, hopefully one last time this morning. Jamie, on that number that you gave, I think you said it was less than 15% of total revenue, I guess, for the first quarter. I just wanted to be clear.

We had strong tailwinds in Q4. We averaged more than 20 million contracts per day, which was up 31% compared to the prior year. For our full year, we have record volumes in four product areas, along with total options and electronic options volume. We made progress expanding, our volume from global market participants during the year. In Q4, we had 22% volume growth from participants based outside the United States totaling more than 4.8 million contracts per day. For the full year we were up 18%.","We launched a number of successful new product designed to solve customer needs during \u201918. Many of the new products were detailed in the executive commentary that we provided earlier this morning but let me just highlight a few of them. First the FX link was launched in March of 2018 and won the Risk Magazine Award for innovation of the year. It is currently being facilitated by nine futures commission merchants and the client base is growing.","Liquidity is available across multiple currencies with clients noting that the prices often match or better FX swaps. FX Link had a record day of 24,000 contracts in January of \u201919. As related to Sulphur it was launched in May of 2018 and average daily volume built steadily to 14,800 contracts per day in December, reached to 18,000 in January and is averaging 23,000 per day in February. Global participation has surpassed a 105 firms including major banks, buy side and proprietary trading firms. ","In November we launched Physical West Texas Intermediate Houston Crude Oil Futures in conjunction with Enterprise Products Partners, the leader in crude infrastructure in the Houston area. The product has steady growth from November to February and we think this offering will be useful addition to our existing energy franchise.","We were pleased to announce the NEX Group acquisition in March and completed in early November. The markets in optimization business each performed well during the fourth quarter. Our teams are working in a really collaborative way and we have made good progress on the integration planning so far. In terms of the most important components of the integration we have let customers know that the BrokerTec migration to Globex will begin in 2020 and the EBS customer migration will begin in 2021. ","Turning to this year volume has slowed across many global asset classes. We are averaging 17 million contracts per day this year. As I referred to earlier Q4 was an exceptional quarter and we saw high volatility. It's not unusual to see that the market pause following periods of elevated volatility. It is worth noting our open interest is currently sitting at a 129 million contracts. This is one reflection of the health of our business.","Our options business is averaging 3.8 million contracts a day so far this year. The important part about this is that they are comparable to the levels of all of 2018. Options as a percent of the total volume has increased from 20.5% for 2018 to 22% in 2019. These are valuable tools in this environment. ","Several global issues are in the headlines as many of you know, which could have an impact on any market, including Brexit, various trade negotiations, uncertainty around another potential government shutdown or other government actions. As we know markets like clarity and we\u2019re hopeful that some of these issues I just outlined will start to get resolved. ","That being said we do look closely at how our products compared to other alternatives and we continue to be the leader. Our strategy has been very consistent overtime. We focus on maximizing activity and bringing in new market participants to manage their risk, launching new products and enhancing existing products. We are intensely focused on expanding the core business and integrating the valuable components of the recent acquisition of the NEX Group.","Expense discipline is something I have been very focused on along with my management team and we will continue to do so. ","I would now like to turn the call over to John and look forward to your questions in a moment. John?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks Terry and good morning everyone. As Terry mentioned expense discipline is continued focus of the entire organization. Between 2016 and 2018 CME group\u2019s revenue has grown by $580 million excluding NEX, while total adjusted expense increased only $55 million during that time. We have built a very scalable platform and we intend to operate the combined CME and NEX businesses efficiently. ","We are very pleased with how the integration is progressing so far. The teams are working well together as we begin our synergy and customer outreach plans. Our goal is to provide increased benefits for our market participants who have been providing us helpful feedback along the way in terms of what they'd like to see. ","I'll briefly cover the financial results for the fourth quarter, and then I'll provide some guidance for 2019. Let me start with CME standalone results. Our revenue is up 15% for the full year and up 23% for the fourth quarter. Our rate per contract was strong considering the amount of activity we saw during the quarter which tends to be impacted by volunteers. ","Market data revenue grew $8 million sequentially and included $6 million of incremental audit revenue with very stable screen counts. The annual adjusted expense without license fees increased by a modest 2.8%, which was line with our original guidance. The increase was driven entirely by bonus and stock-based compensation during 2018 reflecting the company's strong results. Otherwise expense would have been flat for the year. Our incremental operating margin for the year approached 90%. ","In the fourth quarter NEX contributed $134 million of revenue, the majority of which was in the clearing and transaction fee line and $88 million of expense, with more than half reflected in the compensation line. ","Overall adjusted EPS including the two months of NEX results was up 58% in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly growth rate we've seen in the last decade. For the full year adjusted EPS grew by 43%. During 2018 we declared dividends totaling $1.6 billion. ","Turning to the guidance for 2019, we anticipate expense excluding license fees to be between $1.65 billion and $1.66 billion reflecting a full year with NEX and the P&L impact of $25 million of expense synergies, we expect to deliver primarily in the back half of the year. ","We continue to target $50 million run rate synergies by the end of the year. CapEx is anticipated to be between $180 million and $200 million. Finally we expect the effective tax rate to be between 24.5% and 25.5%. Please refer to the last page of our executive commentary, where we provide additional financial highlights and details. ","With that short summary, we'd like to open the call for your questions. Based on the number of analysts covering us please limit yourself to one question and then feel free to jump back into the queue. Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. ","Richard Repetto","Yeah. Good morning Terry, good morning John. And I guess -- good morning. You know you talk about expense discipline but I guess what I was very impressed, the precision of the guidance is pretty amazing as well. So I guess the question is NEX -- and John you mentioned this I think it was in total $134 million in revenue. When we look at the expenses $87 million, so anyway the margin looked at you know in the mid-30 to 35% pretax for NEX. And I think that's a little bit stronger than what we had anticipated. ","So could you talk about sort of the outlook for NEX in the margins, given that I guess right out of the gate, the strong contribution?","Terrence Duffy","Sure, thanks Rich. Appreciate it. Yeah, couple of a couple of points you made there; first is, is the precision in terms of the guidance. We as a management team actively manage our expenses every day and you saw what happened over the last several years where we've been very close to the guidance we've been giving out. We do a bottoms-up build of the budget and then you know we manage it actively. So you saw this year we hit $1.105 billion and that was what we had guided to in the beginning of the year. ","In terms of in terms of NEX's margin, there's a couple of points you know. Number one, the $88 million reflects two changes that are being made to the expenses, that impact NEX. The first is at the time of the acquisition internally developed capitalized software is included in purchased intangibles. So as we noted in the executive commentary, the NEX -- when you take a look at NEX's expense run rate that would go down by $5 million per month due to due to that treatment of that asset. ","The second piece is again in capitalized software, as NEX rolls on to CME Group's policies we anticipate there to be less capitalization of wages and salaries. So that would mean less capitalized software and higher wages and salaries. And that we anticipate to be about $1 million per month. ","So the net impact to NEX\u2019s expense rate would be a decrease of about $4 million per month. So if you take a look at NEX\u2019s margins, taking that depreciation impact into consideration, it's more in the 26% to 27% range if you're looking at it the way NEX previously treated those items. ","So in terms of forward looking information, NEX is going to be following CME's business model. So in the future, some of NEX\u2019s organization or many of NEX\u2019s organizations we rolled into CME. So they'll lose the distinction of what is NEX\u2019s expenses versus what is CME\u2019s expenses because we run a very much a shared services model. And that's what's going to be able to generate the synergies that we anticipate generating in the next several years.","Richard Repetto","Thanks, and congrats on a strong year. Terry and John.","Terrence Duffy","Thank you very much, Rich.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Daniel Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. I guess it's a two part question here for you, John. So could you break down the expense guidance between what core CME is and what you're assuming for NEX in 2019? And then also if you could talk about, I think you said it was -- looks like it was accretive this quarter, kind of put some numbers around what the accretion you think could be or contribution could be in total for \u201919?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Dan. Yeah, I think the way to look at it -- like I said at the start, we do a very much of a bottoms up build. So the way, the way one can look at is we took our expenses, which was $1.105 billion, and if you took NEX\u2019s expenses, excluding license fees, and you take November, December, and you annualize that, add the two together and multiply it by a growth rate of 3% and then back out $25 million in P&L expense synergies that gets you right around 16.50.","So that kind of gives you an idea of how we approach from looking outside in. And really, the 3% reflects cost of living and escalators that we have in some of the service contracts that we have. So that's one way to look at it. ","In terms of accretion, obviously out of the gate, we're cash accretive. We didn't give out any specific numbers around that, something that you can certainly calculate. We believe that as we phase in the synergies we\u2019ll be very pleased with the amount of contribution NEX will provide not only to our earnings but also to our annual -- to our dividend policy or capital return policy.","Daniel Fannon","Okay, thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks, good morning folks. Maybe if you guys talk a little bit about the revenue synergy opportunities with NEX, and I appreciate if you can really forecast and that's usually difficult area to forecast, but maybe if you can talk about some of the things that now that there -- the deal is closed what areas you're specifically looking at, where you think you can enhance your both legacy NEX and CME revenues and sort of maybe just a little bit of a timeline of those areas.","Bryan Durkin","Thanks, Brian. This is Bryan Durkin. We're really excited about how well we've hit the ground running, since we've closed the transaction. If you look at the performance we\u2019ll cover the market side first, looking at the BrokerTec activity, they had their largest quarter in almost, I think the history, up 25% and we're seeing continued drive towards that platform as it is the area of confidence that the market comes during uncertain time period. ","When we look at the overall performance of the repo business, while slightly down in the U.S. repos, we're up to about 9% in our European repo business. And when we look at the foreign currency side of the market we've seen growth in terms of an increase in the client base accessing the platform it's up over 7%. So we\u2019re excited about what that could mean to us in the context of bringing in other worlds two leading market places together, both in the foreign currency and the treasury market specter. ","When you look at the optimization side of the business we\u2019ve seen again continued growth in the services that are provided from TriReduce as well as TriResolve and TriBalance. Each of those areas are performing quite well. TriReduce has just rolled out some improvements to their platform, which allows the market participants to enjoy increased cycles in terms of their compression services and what we would call a low touch access to the platform to make it far more user friendly and far more accessible.","With respect to the overall efforts of TriBalance we\u2019ve actually increased the number of clients by about 50% in the past year. So the post trade services continues to be, we think a wonderful area for us to grow not only within the U.S. but more so on the internationals here. ","Terrence Duffy","Maybe I'll just add a little bit. This is Terry Duffy, on the EBS platform I referenced earlier in my remarks about the migration of not only BrokerTec coming on to the platform starting in 2020 and then the EBS coming on in 2021 we think that is something very exciting especially from the EBS. I think maybe Sean can talk a little bit more especially as it relates to the EBS on the cross selling opportunities that we could potentially see great growth from. So Sean maybe you want to touch on that little bit on the single platform.","Sean Tully","Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you Terry so on the EBS side we\u2019re very excited about -- and actually saw the growth base off last year. So huge growth for example in NDFs, our non-deliverable forwards, where in the fourth they had extraordinarily strong growth. As well, we had very deep penetration internationally, and in particular, very high growth in CNH, especially with the volatility in the markets between the U.S. and China. So, great business, great growth.","In terms of bringing the marketplaces together, Terry mentioned in the earlier remarks FX Link, where we're bringing together the OTC spot foreign exchange market along with our futures market and creating a clear, standardized, lower-totaled cost alternative to the FX swaps market, where we're seeing very good growth -- about 15,000 contracts a day so far this year.","So very excited about bringing two platforms together, much like we had already worked hard at FX Link, as well in order to cross sell. In terms of that international side EBS has very deep penetration in regional banks in Asia and regional banks in Europe. So we are very excited about cross selling the CME Futures products into the OTC market as well as the OTC products into the futures market place. And we see those market places as highly complementary.","Terrence Duffy","So Brian hope that gives you a little flavor where we\u2019re going as far revenue synergies.","Brian Bedell","Yeah and to the extent you can get pricing benefits for customers do you anticipate just getting more customers that you have a net positive revenue synergy that would offset any kind of price reductions?","Terrence Duffy","Yeah we haven\u2019t discussed price Brian to-date and I think the synergies really are what we outlined, what Sean just said. It\u2019s especially I'm referring to the EBS side for sure because we have the ability to cross sell, have people trade both futures and cash on a single platform. We think there\u2019s a huge benefit there and what the pricing of that exact product will be is yet to be determined.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Ben Herbert. Please go ahead.","Ben Herbert","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask on the open interest build year-to-date and if you could particularly talk about just large open interest holders and kind of the trend you\u2019re seeing there, I know is I think reached a high November but just wanted to ask about the year-to-date?","Terrence Duffy","Yeah, Ben it\u2019s Terry Duffy. Let me just touch on that. I referenced to it earlier in my remarks this morning we had a 128,900,000 and some odd thousand, so just under 129 million so I think it rounded up to 129. But when you look at that it\u2019s only in new commercial participants that are coming to our market.","As you know, a lot of daily traders who facilitate liquidity. Whether they're high-frequency or algorithmic traders, they don't normally carry large open-interest positions, but the commercials do, which is, as I said earlier, a great sign of health for our business. So, what I'd like to do is maybe have Derek and Sean comment on what they're seeing from their respective sides of their businesses as relates to the OI holders. Derek, maybe you could start..","Derek Sammann","Yeah thanks Ben, it\u2019s Derek Sammann here, Yeah, as Terry said we\u2019re seeing a continued growth in the participation and what we're most excited about is the growth of the non-U.S. participation that's growing both OI participation and continuing to grow our liquidity footprints out across time zones. In the energy market specifically, we see a continued narrative around the globalizing gas and crude oil market where we're seeing infrastructure builds, export facilities. In fact, the EIA, which is the Energy Information Administration, put out a report confirming the U.S. has now as of November 2018 become the single largest producer of crude oil in the planet.","So we're on track to deliver 11 million barrels a day in 2018. The expectation is that the U.S. is going to be producing 12 million barrels of crude oil in 2019. And natural gas is following that same path. What that means for participants using our Henry Hub Natural Gas contract or WTI crude oil contract, being a reinforcing of the global benchmark status that, that achieves is not only U.S. producing record amounts it's exporting record amounts.","So on the back of what was an energy all-time record quarter Q1 '18 an all-time record revenue year in 2018 as a whole, we're continuing to see not only out performance of our energy franchise but growth in open interest and large open interest was driven in the energy business specifically from participants in Asia. So continued strong growth there. ","One of the things we are looking at the large open interest holders and it's important to note that given the government shutdown, the CFTC has delayed report. So the large open interest holder reports are only out through the first week in January. So we're looking for a backlog of those reports that come out. But I think what you see is a continue trend that tracks the growth of our business, the global footprints reflective of the global benchmarks status of our products across the asset classes. ","So I'll turn over to Sean for financials.","Sean Tully","Yeah, we're always very excited about bringing new participants, especially large open interest holders and last year was a great success. So in November, we had an all-time record in rates, LOIH, and then in September, we had record LOIH both in equities and in foreign exchange. ","In addition to that, we continuously look at making sure that our products are the lowest total cost relative to any alternative products where people can take similar risks, in order to bring in those participants. So we're always excited about outperforming the alternative products and bringing the participants into our markets.","Terrence Duffy","Does that help, Ben?","Ben Herbert","Yes. Absolutely. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning everyone. I think this is both an ask going forward and also a question for now. But John, you didn't break down the revenues in particular on the transaction and clearing side for NEX. They used to do that between FX and treasuries and things like that. So I guess the question for today is do you have some of those numbers so we can see how those revenues are actually tracking because we can obviously check the volumes? ","And then two, can you actually start breaking it out on a more consistent basis, which will be really helpful from a modeling perspective? I guess that's the ask. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Yes. Thanks, Alex. Yes, let me let me break down some of the geography on the income statement with regard to the revenue because it's a bit different than what NEX reported. In the clearing and transaction fee line NEX contributed $91 million. The majority of that is related to their markets business, so that would be EBS and BrokerTec. ","In terms of the market data NEX contributed $12 million in market data and we're putting all of the market data for NEX in that line. The majority of the market data comes from their markets business as you would expect. ","The balance with $31 million is in the all other line. And that is primarily all of the optimization businesses that NEX has excluding TriReduce, which is the compression business which is reflected up in the transaction -- clearing and transaction fee line. So that's the breakdown. We'll be looking at the appropriate level of disclosure going forward, as we spend some time with the businesses and determine what the right amount of information is that we should give out. ","So we will be doing that going forward. Just some color around, as you're mentioning, we're giving out some of the volumes and we want to kind of give you a little bit of color there. So when you take a look at EBS. They're -- when you take a look at their revenue growth compared to their volume growth, is very much like CME Group in terms of that relationship, especially for their central limit order book. And then when you take a look at BrokerTec, their volume growth is higher than their revenue growth, is more pronounced because that's much more of a mature business and they have many more bespoke agreements. ","So in terms of the overall business one of the things to take into consideration is that similar to CME Group, the types of our products that are being utilized. So for example, in EBS, if it's emerging markets versus G10 currencies, or if it's in BrokerTec, the amount of U.S. treasuries versus European repo have different revenue associated with that -- the type of transactions being done. ","So whether it's central limit order book or bilateral trading impacts their revenue capture rate. And then finally the type of participant that trades also has an impact. So very similar to CME in terms of the impact on revenue growth versus transaction volumes. But we'll be looking at the appropriate level of disclosure, once we've had the opportunity to run the businesses for a little bit of time.","Alex Kramm","That's great. Thanks for the color and yes, the more you can give the better obviously. Thanks. ","John Pietrowicz","Yeah, we're very transparent organization and we will definitely keep that in mind.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Sameer Murukutla","Hey. Good morning guys, this is actually Sameer Murukutla on for Michael Carrier. Just a question on, I guess, capital management, as you move forward past this deal, you guys are not that levered. So I guess, can you give us an update on where you would like your leverage to fall to, maybe how aggressive are you going to be in lowering that levels versus raising cash or dividend? And I guess, Terry, what's your interest near term on any other transformative M&A. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Good morning, Sameer. Thank you for the question. So let me tell you kind of where we're at, in terms of our leverage. CME has about $4.4 billion in total debt and we have an approximately 1.3 times debt-to-EBITDA. We have given guidance that by 2020, by the end of 2020, we want to be a one-time debt-to-EBITDA. So in the first quarter NEX had some debt that we inherited of about $400 million in Euro denominated senior notes which matures in early March and then they have $170 million yen-denominated term loan that is up at the end of March. ","So as those mature we will likely replace that in the near term with commercial paper, and then we'll be paying down that commercial paper over the next several quarters, into next year as we -- as we delever down to one times debt-to-EBITDA. ","In terms of -- I just want to bring up, in terms of interest expense, as you look to model it, I would expect interest expense to increase from this quarter to next quarter, as we\u2019ll bring on a full quarters impact of the acquisition financing. And that's going to be offset by some debt pay down that we did at the very end of Q4. And also there's a rate differential between the bonds and the term loan note versus the commercial paper. ","So we should see a tick up, about 10% or so in terms of interest expense into the first quarter, then you'll see that come down over time as we de-lever. ","In terms of the aggressiveness of de-levering, I think our actions reflect our sentiment in terms of how we're going to approach that. In terms of what we did in the fourth quarter we took a very balanced approach where in terms of how we approach the de-levering, we expect to do that this year. So we'll be very balanced in terms of the amount of de-levering versus the amount of capital return versus the amount of investment in the business. ","Terrence Duffy","So Sameer, let me just answer your latter question about M&A. Right now, I'll give you a very canned answer obviously, we're very focused on working on integrating the NEX transaction. I've been here a long time and one of the things I've been very focused on along with my management team is to create experiences that can benefit our clients. And if we see things that we can enhance the value of the client proposition, we think that's good for our business. Hence, the reason why we pursued the NEX transaction that we did. So we think that's ultimately good for the end user clients. ","So that's a way of telling you that my focus, and we're not a company that does a deal a day, where we're very laser focused on creating value for the clients, because we know that will create value for the shareholders ultimately. And that's kind of how we approach this. So right now, that's what I'm looking at. I'm looking at completing the NEX integration and if there's things out there that make sense that would add value for the client, I am -- we're always willing to look at it. But right now, I'm focused just on the NEX integration.","Sameer Murukutla","Perfect. Thanks for the detail guys.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks Sameer.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Alexander Blostein ","Hi guys, good morning. I was hoping to go back to the discussion on kind of core CME franchise. Total open interest trends definitely hanging in there. What I was hoping to zone into a little bit more is the energy business and it looks like the volumes obviously could be all over the place. And I don't want to extrapolate the first quarter, but it looks like open interest within energy down 20% or so year-over-year. So it was hoping to get a little more granularity what's behind that? Thanks.","Terrence Duffy","Derek, you want to comment on that?","Derek Sammann","Yeah, Thanks for the question. When you look at energy business. Yes, you have to bear in mind a couple of things in the context. In Q1 of 2018, we had an all-time going in record. In fact, we finished the year at all-time revenue record and we actually had come off November as a single month volume record as well. I think we put up 3.1 million ADV in the month of November and then within that on November 14 had a single day record of 5.1 million contracts. ","So our comps versus what was in all-time record Q1 of '18 are tough and the success that we're having. What we are seeing is that in -- as we have built into the structural build of the energy market, I talked earlier about what we're seeing is continued infrastructure supportive of record generation and production of U.S. crude and natural gas. And now the infrastructure built around that with LNG facilities coming online in the Gulf this year, we're seeing an increased participation in NYMEX based products based on the U.S. benchmark.","So we are seeing a tough start to this year, along with most of our assets classes here. I think what we're focused on is what we've always done to Terry's point, how can we build a suite of products and functionalities and a product suite that best suits the needs of our commercial end user customer base. So coming off a record year, the number of innovations and builds that we're putting in place from Q4 into Q1, this year with things like our new Houston contract that we launched in November. ","When you look at the growth of that contract, we launched that November 5, that launched we have doubled our volume in January versus November, December of last year a little over 1.1 just over 1,000 contracts today. Open interest is up to 4,000 contracts. And we're seeing that actually trade. What's interesting about the Houston contract is that contract actually trades as a spread sort of WTI contract. ","So customers that are part of the emerging export infrastructure for global crude are using NYMEX space, Cushing WTI product and spreading that against the physically delivered Houston contract. That means a contract in our WTI is linked to a contract trade as a spread against HCL. So we're excited about the continued innovation growth there. ","When you look at particular the open interest numbers you need to look at the benchmark products and the power figures are tiny, tiny contracts. We've removed those from the earnings information that we gave you guys on slide 8. So note the overall kind of OI in that in that contract as a whole is relatively flat over the last couple years. ","So we're really focused on what we're doing with coming off record years and record months of 2018. The innovations with things like Houston crude, just reinforces the WTI benchmark. What we've announced in the crude options market first time ever providing commercial customers an ability to directly sell their crude products on a CME Group platform. The first option will go live in November 5, or excuse me, March 5, and that will continue to support the WTI franchise. ","And when you look at the state of our franchise versus the other guy out there, we're actually seeing that our overall market share in all 2018 was about 57% of WTI versus Brent. We've actually built up to 60% in January and 62% in February. So you've seen us innovate and grow our product expand our client base, focused on outperformance when we have tailwinds and outperformance versus competitive products when we have headwinds as well. So that's what we're doing to solve customer problems and really focus on our end user commercial participants.","Alexander Blostein ","Got it. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Jeremy Campbell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey, thanks, guys. So, your CapEx guide of $180 to $200 million versus your more typical $100 million annual pace -- how much of that lift is the long-term run rate now with NEX, and how much more is it more of a near-term or one-time-type function of items like tech enhancements, platform integration, and cost-achieve integration?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Jeremy this is John. So yeah, if you take a look at C&E historically it\u2019s been in the $80 million to $100 million in terms of our CapEx. NEX has been more in the 100 to 114ish range so that gives you kind of a range of a $180 million to $214 million in terms of the combine companies range. ","And NEX is a different business than we are. So there\u2019s more investments in some of their platforms, especially in optimization. So that\u2019s been some of the investments they\u2019ve been making. I would expect it\u2019s come down overtime as we migrate their mortgage businesses on to Globex, but I do expect an elevated level of CapEx going forward but probably not at this level for the long run.","Jeremy Campbell","Got it and then John I think you mentioned that RPCs are low this quarter because we\u2019re hitting lot of volume tiers after a really good kind of volumes in fourth quarter is it kind of fair to think that like where volumes are tracking year-to-date that we might see RPCs coming closer to 3Q levels?","John Pietrowicz","I think it\u2019s safe to say that there's a couple of things that factored into the RPC this quarter versus previous quarters. One is obviously the amount of volume was tremendous in the fourth quarter. Also we saw interest rates being a higher proportion of the overall volumes versus some of the other product lines. So definitely I would expect the RPC in aggregate to go higher to the extent that there\u2019s less volume. But it\u2019s also a function of market participants and also the types of products that are been traded. ","Jeremy Campbell","Thanks guys. ","John Pietrowicz","Thanks Jeremy.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Christopher Harris","Thanks, guys. So, we've got a more dovish Fed all of a sudden. What do you think that implies for the growth of CME's business over the near term? I think that would be a negative on the margin, but I'd like to hear your thoughts?","Terrence Duffy","Well I'm going to go ahead and let Sean comment and then I might make a comment or two also Sean?","Sean Tully","Yeah, so thank you for that. You\u2019re correct in terms of market expectations. But so while we\u2019ve had a few tightening over the last few years, each year at the moment there are no tightening predicted for this year. Nonetheless we\u2019re constantly focused on new product innovation, bringing in new clients and relatively to RPC question earlier lot of that new product growth has to do with innovation and adjustments to our product mix.","So I\u2019ll give you some example. Actually, looking at the BrokerTec side -- I'll mention that for a moment -- back in November, BrokerTec reduced the minimum price increments in their two-year notes, and that caused very strong growth in the two-year notes relative to the rest of their complex, north of 5%. So, that product adjustment was taken very positively by the marketplace, making it lower cost to cross the bid offer spread on that platform, causing strong growth.","Similarly, in January, CME Group lowered the minimum pricing increment in our tier notes. So the tier note futures. And in terms of that, that likewise seeing an uptick of about 2.3% relative to the entire complex. So we\u2019re seeing very strong growth in the tier notes relative to those changes to those products. But also talk a bit about penetration I spoke earlier we\u2019re constantly focused on the futures side as well as the OTC side to make sure that we\u2019ve got the lowest cost product relative to alternatives.","That\u2019s a total cost product. So if you look at treasury futures in particular one things that we\u2019ve talked in the last few years is our growth relative to the overall cash market place. We\u2019re currently buying at a 116% our treasury futures versus cash treasury bond market. So we see continued strong growth. In addition to that invoice spreads, I\u2019ve talked about that a number of times over the last couple of years. ","Invoice spreads CME Group relative to portfolio margin illustrates swaps against our treasury futures offers a much lower total cost alternative to the soft spread market. That marketplace this year is running it over 100,000 contracts a day. That's grown from several years ago, about 8,000 contracts today to now well over 100,000. So a high RPC product, that RPC is around $1.90. So and we've grown it from about 8,000 to well over 100,000 a day this year. ","In addition to that, I might talk maybe a little bit more about some of the other innovations and impact they've had. Sulphur futures continue to do very well. Our Sulphur futures marketplace is now running about 92,000 contracts open interest more than 105 participants. December, we did about 14,000 a day, January, about 18,000 a day and this month about 23,000 a day in terms of the contracts.","On the equity side, continued innovation there. Basis Trade Index Close, a very exciting results high RPC product, right about $2.60. That particular product last year, you may recall 2017 we did about 13,000 contracts a day, last year; we did about 40,000 contracts a day. This year, we're doing 44,000 contracts a day. ","Last thing, I'd like to mention is a total return futures. Total return futures are a standardized listed lower total cost alternative to equity index swaps, Those OTC equity index swaps. This is important under the uncleared margin rules. And we're seeing very good growth there. So in December, we launched further out the curve in our S&P complex. So went from 18 months out to around 5 years in the futures. ","We also launched NASDAQ, Dow and Russell total return features. That product, while it's only doing about 3,000 contracts a day, has an RPC of well over $5. So we continue to innovate, we continue to bring more clients, we continue to drive our total cost benefits. ","Terrence Duffy","Now, let me just add a little bit, I think Sean really hit on all the high points there and so it's kind of hard for me to add anymore, other than we've been able to grow our interest rate business over the last several years, especially in a zero interest rate environment, which I think is really impressive because the innovations that Sean and his team have outlined and brought forward. ","But secondly, CME is not just an industry business. When you look at just this morning, you look at the President maybe going as far as extending the trade agreement with China for another 60 days, which on the pre-market rallied the market dramatically, which people needed to manage risk. A few moments after that you had retail sales come out with the biggest percentage drop since 2009. So people needed to manage the risk there. We have all the products to manage that risk. And so I think it's really important to note that CME business is not based just on a dovish or all hawkish bet.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. BrokerTec went down in early January. And it seems to have had a bigger impact on trading than say, when we see equities, the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ go down. What reaction have you experienced from regulators and dealers and to what extent do you think there might be any longer term implications from the shutdown and the impact it had on the market?","Bryan Durkin","Thank you. It's Brian Durkin I mean, first of all, yes, we had an unfortunate incident that occurred during that session, and it was attributable to internal operational error that we were able to identify quickly resolve. And we put in the remediation steps to ensure no future current in that regard. And explaining to our marketplace, what had taken had taken place, the market responded very understandably, and very appreciative of I think, the immediacy with which we handled the situation and the responsiveness that we were able to provide to the marketplace in terms of recovery resolution and moving forward. ","And I just would like to note that December in that period was our all-time high in terms of our overall activity, which again goes to the efficacy of the platform overall. The continuity of performance that has been enjoyed and will continue to be enjoyed going forward.","Ken Worthington","Okay. And the regulatory response?","Bryan Durkin","As we normally would, we just communicated what had transpired and the remediation steps that we took to prevent future occurrences. ","Terrence Duffy","That's very common what we do in all these situations, right. ","Ken Worthington","Okay and no implications you think?","Bryan Durkin","No, from the perspective of the user base and where we are with moving forward, no we\u2019re very confident in terms of the controls that we have in place.","Ken Worthington","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Hey, good morning. Most of mine have been answered but just maybe this one on the cash treasuries market, the market structure I think remains relatively bifurcated in that business the client dealer and dealer to dealer space with NEX mostly playing in the dealer to dealer space. I guess, one for maybe for Terry or Sean I just wanted to hear your long term view in terms of the market structure evolution in that cash treasuries market and how that\u2019s going to unfold or maybe out CME is going to play a role in that looking forward?","Terrence Duffy","Kyle, thanks. I\u2019ve said this from the moment we announced the NEX transaction and I am passionate about this we did not acquired NEX to change the market structure as it relates to BrokerTec. We believe in that market structure, we believe the market participants who are utilizing that platform which are the largest banks and biggest platforms around that there\u2019s going to be change they\u2019re going to be the probably the ones influencing that change.","We like the transaction because we think it\u2019s complementary to derivatives business. That\u2019s why we like BrokerTec so much. But on the market structure standpoint I and nobody around this institution is looking is to change any of the market structure as it relates to BrokerTec. I don\u2019t know that Sean or Bryan you might want to make a comment but that\u2019s where we are at with this transaction today. And listen I think that this acquisition of NEX and I think the components that it has especially BrokerTec EBS and others are very valuable for the clients.","As I have said earlier my focus and the team\u2019s focus is on how do we create an experience that could help benefit the clients whether they\u2019re trading cash or futures. And that to me is what critically important for us is the market structure so we\u2019re staying away from that component.","Kyle Voigt","Yeah, fair enough, and then John if I can ask the same question as an earlier caller here when you said that 10% uptick you expect for interest expense in 1Q I just want to clarify that is that versus the adjusted interest expense number of the $44 million this quarter?","John Pietrowicz","Yeah, that\u2019s correct. I mean as I said we\u2019re going to have a full quarter\u2019s impact of the acquisition financing that only included two months. So you get a full quarter\u2019s impact and then you\u2019ve got full quarter\u2019s impact of having NEX\u2019s debt on our books and then you also will have some offset or some reductions to interest expense.","As I said we had a paydown towards the very end of Q4 and then also you\u2019ve got rate differential between NEX's debt and the commercial paper that will replace their debt with in the short term. So that\u2019s why you see it\u2019ll be a tick up in the first quarter and then you\u2019ll see it go down in overtime. We expect the majority of the pay down for this year to occur in the back half of the year.","Kyle Voigt","Okay, great, thank you.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks Kyle.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Chris Allen ","Good morning guys. I think most questions have been answered. And I guess just one quick one any update on the DTCC clearing link and the progress you guys are making there in terms of customer uptick and how you hit thinking about clearing opportunities long term?","Terrence Duffy","Bryan?","Bryan Durkin","Thank you we\u2019re continuing to work closely with DTCC in terms of trying to enhance what currently is available with the two path margin and capabilities and seeing what opportunities exists now that these wonderful assets as a part of CME Group, what we can do to extend that further. We\u2019re very excited about the opportunities in front of us. In that regard our goal is to really assist our clients in terms of enhancing their capital efficiency and we'll hopefully have more to report down the road.","Chris Allen","Thanks guys.","Terrence Duffy","Yeah, thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mr. John Peschier. You may begin, sir.","John C. Peschier","Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Gill and Jamie will spend a few minutes outlining the highlights of the quarter, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. Terry and Bryan are on the call as well and will participate in Q&A. Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language.","Statements made on the call and in the slides on the website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. For detailed information about the factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for being with us this morning. I'd like to take the opportunity to highlight 2013 results focusing on Q4 and then discuss the big picture environment for CME Group in 2014. Afterwards, Jamie will review our Q4 financial results.","During 2013, there were signs that the U.S. economy had regained some traction following its slowdown in late 2012 and early 2013. Fundamentally, deleveraging is behind us and the rebalancing that has taken place, positions the economy for growth.","In addition, the annual budget deficit is expected to further tighten over the next few years, reflecting a healthy recovery of the private sector. The tone of the Fed is also positive and this, together with the continued energy boom, all bode very well for our benchmark products across all fixed asset classes.","Given all the fluctuations and uncertainty we have faced, our job has been to work on behalf of the industry from a regulatory perspective and to provide innovative ways for clients to manage risk. Our response to these challenges on many fronts have been exceptional and we are very proud of what we have accomplished and the way we have positioned our company. With that as a backdrop, our fourth quarter ADV growth was in line with what we have seen over the last few quarters.","Average daily volume for our call futures and options complex was up 11% compared to fourth quarter 2012, driven primarily by continued strong growth in interest rates, which rose 29% during the fourth quarter compared to the prior year peak period. Eurodollar futures and options grew 48%, while treasury volumes rose 15%. In January compared to the same period last year, interest rate volume increased 18% and our Eurodollar business remains elevated, up 45% during the month which is a great sign for us.","Innovative product expansions launched in the last 3 years accounted for 4.5% of fourth quarter interest rate activity. Within our energy franchise, we have experienced a strong pickup during the winter months. In particular, we have seen strength in natural gas. December volume was up 40% year-over-year and January was very strong as well, up 30%. We drove strong growth in coal in Europe, up 90% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period of the prior year. In addition, volume in our Dubai Omani product grew 36% during the year to more than 6,000 contracts per day, and January activity continues to grow up around 54% to 8,200 contracts per day, including a record day a few weeks ago.","Our other product areas had lower volatility during the year including equities, FX and agricultural products. The steady rise in equity market value during 2013 was not conducive for driving equity volume growth, although we outperformed our primary U.S. peer. However over the last month, there has been a decent pickup in volatility impacting several product and the volume across the board has responded accordingly. Our global focus continues to drive outside growth in volumes overseas.","During the fourth quarter, Latin America volumes were up 36%; Asia and Europe volumes were up 12%; with North America up 8%. In addition, we look to expand our global presence by adding new clearing members in key areas. During the quarter, we added China merchants futures as our fifth Asian clearing member, which allows us to better address the needs of our increasing client base in the region. We will continue to enhance and expand our network of clearing members there, allowing us to bring our wide range of global benchmark products to new Asian client segments.","Our options complex also continues to perform well with fourth quarter ADV up 39% versus the prior year peak period, building on 31% growth during the third quarter. Options on financial products, including rates, equities and FX were all up more than 40% versus the prior year. In January, we traded 1 million equity options within a single day for the first time.","We also had an impressive open interest build in options during 2013, with options open interest increasing 28%, outpacing huge futures which rose 14%. During this impressive growth in options -- driving this impressive growth in options is our continued success in growing the electronic participation in this complex. We ended 2013 with 45% of our total options business trading on Globex up from 35% in 2012.","Moving on to OTC clearing. We continued to make progress during 2013 following the completion of the 3 ways of the Dodd-Frank clearing mandate. Highlights for the year include becoming the global leader in dealers customer OTC interest rate swap open in interest launching 11 currencies to bring the total to 18, enhancing our value proposition with 7 clearing members now being able to offer portfolio margining and increasing the total global institutions carrying IRS, CDS and FX at CME to approximately 420 firms.","As I mentioned earlier, our efforts to position the company to benefit from a changing regulatory environment are starting to gain significant traction and you are seeing a continued shift in market share and open interest into our clearing house. Since December, our open interest has grown by $2.7 trillion, or 32%, driven by our real money clients like asset managers and insurance companies. The net result is that we are now the global leader holding 52% of the global outstanding client cleared swap open interest. In January, we had the highest volume month since inception at around $124 billion a day.","In addition, we have seen clients of traditional swaps ramp up their trading of our futures and options products. However, their use of our core products remains at the very early stages in our view. December marked the 8th straight month we have seen 20-plus percent year-over-year growth in our interest rate futures and options business. Our interest rates rate per contract reached $0.50 in Q4 for the first time since 2010. This was primarily driven by a continued pickup in volume from nonmembers.","Our Deliverable Swap Futures contract reached a new record level in December of 12,000 contracts traded per day, up 33% from the prior peak month of September 2013. Open interest reached 114,000 on December 10 prior to the role. We expect to build on this success in the current year as we plan to launch several new rate offerings during the year.","Looking forward to 2014, we see good indications that we will be able to build on the momentum realized during the last year. And after 4 years of modest recovery, most economies believe the U.S. economy appears poised for its best performance since the death of the financial recession in 2008 and 2009.","In addition, the impact of government intervention hasn't just been felt in the U.S. as key global markets have also been affected. For example, there's a lot of focus on MiFID II legislation in Europe. There's still a lot of detail and interpretation that needs to take place with a fairly long implementation period. One of the key aspects we have been focused on is the impact on non-EU clearing houses with customers based in Europe. The language on that front has progressed quite positively during the process, so we don't expect change in terms of our existing core business cleared in the U.S.","In light of this, what has been missing from the world economy is the energizing effect of synchronized growth and the European stability, improved prospects for the U.S. and continued health of the Asian economies that trends in our favor. Overall, we see good indications that the fundamental drivers of the core business are improving and we're optimistic about the long-term prospects for our developing global initiatives.","2014 has started off well and our main focus is on enhancing efficiency throughout the firm and capturing incremental revenue. With that, I will turn the call over to Jamie to discuss the financials.","James E. Parisi","Thanks, Gill, and good morning, everyone. As Gill mentioned, the volume grew nicely during the fourth quarter and the rate per contracts increased based on several positive mix drivers. We were impacted by a few unusual items on the expense side, which I'll highlight. But excluding those items, we came in very close to our original guidance on expense for the year.","Adjusted EPS for Q4 was $0.64, excluding the GAAP loss on the NYMEX building sale, which added $27 million of other expense during the quarter, as well as a $7 million pretax impact due to an intangible asset write-off by the S&P joint venture, which was recognized as non-operating income and expense.","Now, let's get into some of the details starting with revenue, which was up 4% compared to the prior year. The rate per contract for the fourth quarter was $0.78, up from $0.762 last quarter. The main driver overall was product mix with commodity products making up a higher proportion of the total volume in Q4. With an interest rate as Gill mentioned, we have seen a pickup in nonmember activity during each of the last 2 quarters. OTC swaps revenue totaled $10.8 million, down from the prior quarter due to a mix shift with a large sequential increase from our lower priced high turnover of clients.","Moving on, total fourth quarter operating expense was $337 million excluding expenses related to the sale of the NYMEX building. For the year, expenses were approximately $1.271 billion, that was $21 million higher than our original expense estimate of $1.25 billion. There were 2 primary drivers of the variance. First, in November, we announced that we were a victim of a cyber-intrusion making us one of the many organizations subject to this type of crime in recent months.","During the second half the year, we expensed $16 million related to CME's response to the event. One other item to note during the year, deferred compensation was $9 million due to the strong equity market growth. As you know, deferred comp expense is offset in investment income so there was no bottom line impact. Therefore, we do not normally take it into consideration when setting our expense guidance.","Turning to taxes. The pro forma effective tax rate for the year was approximately 37.7% and 37.2% for Q4. And on the balance sheet, we had almost $2.54 billion of cash and marketable securities, which includes $750 million held in cash for the February 2014 debt paydown. Our annual variable dividend was paid out in mid-January and totaled about $870 million, bringing total 2013-related dividends to $1.5 billion, reflecting a payout percentage well over 100% driven in part from one-time items primarily the building sale proceeds and proceeds from our interest rate hedge. That leaves us about $900 million in cash heading into 2014. During the fourth quarter, expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $39 million, bringing us to $130 million for the year at the low end of our prior guidance.","Now let's turn to 2014. We expect operating expenses to come in at approximately $1.31 billion, up less than 3% from the adjusted 2013 expense, or up 5% when you exclude the cyber incident and deferred compensation. This 2014 guidance does not include deferred compensation, is based on our targeted bonus level, which will vary depending on performance and assumes a certain level of license and fee sharing expense, which also varies with volume.","Capital expenditures in 2014 are expected to be $175 million. Included in here is approximately $37 million associated with our NYMEX office space to bring it up to our corporate standards and make it more efficient. This will be the first time this space has been updated since the building opened 17 years ago. Excluding that, we expect to be below $140 million again for the year.","We announced several pricing changes which went into effect recently. First, we adjusted transaction fees and certain tier levels within our core business. Based on 2013 activity and mix levels, we would expect that to result in a 2% to 3% increase to transaction fee revenue. In addition, effective last month, we expanded our market data fees for professional screens from $70 per month to $85 per month.","Lastly, as many of you know, we are working to eliminate market data fee waivers, a policy many clients have increasingly utilized over the last few years. Beginning in 2014, we are not granting any new waivers. And starting in 2015, we will begin charging 50% of the standard fee to existing clients that have the waiver in place. We expect this to add incremental market data revenue beginning in 2015. With respect to taxes, we expect our 2014 rate to be between 37% to 38%, consistent with 2013.","In summary, we continue to focus on investing for the future. In particular, we have positioned ourselves to fully take advantage of the changing regulatory and competitive landscape, as well as the improving cyclical trends. As always, while investing in our future, we also remain intensely focused on generating excess capital and returning it to our shareholders. With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our and our first question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So Europe has finalized MiFID II legislation and there are some clauses in there that call for derivatives that have been accessed. And I guess what I'm curious about is whether you think Europe kind of setting that precedent might ultimately creep over to the U.S.? Maybe you could just run us through what would be required in terms of legislation or regulation in order to create some kind of open access in the U.S. and what you think your protections might be? And I guess, just generally how you're thinking about the competitive dynamics for futures longer term given those developments in Europe?","Phupinder S. Gill","Ms. Miller, this is Gill. I'll start and then I'll ask the Chairman to add some points here. But I think with respect to the open access provision in MiFID II it's not clear to us, yet as to what exactly it means. But there's a clause there that addresses companies such as ourselves to the extent I think that we don't ask for open access, then open access rules would not apply to companies such as ours. Within the Europeans here itself, I think the open access rules themselves have not been very clear so we're waiting for some clarity there. And I ask the Chairman to give.","Terrence A. Duffy","Yes, just to add to what Gill said, it's Terry Duffy. The rule that they put forth a couple of weeks ago under MiFID II, won't take place until 2016. The reason why they did that is because there is a lot of unclear issues yet to be resolved as far as how they're going to have open access in Europe. But it will not apply to a U.S. DCO or DCM at once, unless they want to have open access against that particular entity in Europe. As far as a bleeding over into the United States, which I think was the second part of your question, as you recall in 2010 when Dodd-Frank was passed, there was a provision in Dodd-Frank that said no clearinghouse should be compelled to take the counterparty risk of another clearinghouse, which basically means no open access in the United States. And I think that's very compelling that's part of what our Congress voted in a very big piece of legislation and I don't see that ever being attacked. There's other parts of Dodd-Frank that I think people are trying to work within or under the rules, but the law in and of itself has been passed the implemented going forward and now we're just seeing things come out in Europe. But I don't see that coming into the U.S., obviously would -- it would take an act of Congress to change it.","Operator","Next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess my question is on February 15 and the staff implementation or launching. And I could see where the clearing -- you talked about the mix change, Jamie. When are we going to see the positive benefits -- do you think February 15 where we get that higher paying client in the mix, do we -- is the potential for that mix to shift back towards or more weighted towards this higher paying client?","Bryan T. Durkin","Rich, it's Bryan. A couple of things, with respect to the SEF mandate, while it's starting in February, there's still a lot of confusion on the part of the client base. We're working very closely with all of them to help effectuate and make sure that they're able to comply with the trading requirements. We've really been gearing up in terms of supporting the clearing services and ability to provide portfolio management. But we also see already somewhat of an uptick in the context of the core business, particularly as it pertains to our Eurodollar and interest rate complex. And we're seeing that phenomena grow particularly as it pertains to the asset management community, as well as within the hedge funds. And that can be translated as you see a nice uptick in our rate per contract within the interest rate quadrants.","Operator","And next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Kyle Voigt, I'm stepping in for Neve. My question is on just OTC interest rate swaps clearing. So we're seeing continued growth in clearing volume quarter-on-quarter. But on a market share basis versus your large competitor, looks like your market share has pulled back from highs around 40% down to the 26% to 27% range in December and January. Just wonder if you can give us some color around underlying drivers of this?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. I'll start and then I'll ask Bryan to add. We had a record January for cleared trades and our open interest has also increased compared to December, it's been up 30% -- 37% or so. So in terms of the open interest share itself, we are looking -- we are looking quite good and we're quite pleased with what we have. Something for you to keep in mind is that there's a huge amount of the so-called overnight index swaps, the OIS swaps that are being traded and cleared at [indiscernible] and it makes up about 60% or 65% of the trades that they have. So that's why you're seeing CME having a commanding open interest share. And if you look at the trade counts themselves, those have not changed. So in terms of the number of trade they're pretty consistent in what we are seeing. And in fact CME has about 51% of the trade -- that trade count.","Bryan T. Durkin","And I think our approach has been a very solid one in the context of the client base that we have brought in to the circle. Representing, we're 91 coming -- I mean we're #1 in terms of our global interest rate client open interest representing 52% of that market share. And those clients are continuing to increase their usage, both on the OTC clearing side of the equation, expanding their usage as we've increased the number of currencies that we support. That number has now increased to 18 and we're seeing a nice pickup in the non-U.S. denominated currencies as well which speaks well for the level of open interest that we represent for these long duration clients. We also have seen a pickup in the high turnover clients. Their activity towards the end of the year increased as well. I think you have to keep in prospective, as we said last quarter, our focus is in driving overall growth between our core, as well as our OTC clearing services. And combine the revenue overall growth was approximately 35%. So we're very pleased with that holistic picture of leveraging our core, as well as the expansion of our OTC clearing services.","Phupinder S. Gill","Kyle, this has been very consistent with what we have said right from the start that the OTC clearing activity that we engage in it's all about the core and is actually very complementary, as Bryan points out to the core. So when you look at the numbers to Brian's point, look at them holistically and include what you're seeing in the Eurodollar scene too, which has seen a tremendous pickup in the activity.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to circle on the market data on the fee increases there. I mean, we've seen the continued decline over the course of the year in that revenue bucket and I was wondering if you could kind of explain that. Was it due to the decreases in the screen count? And I believe last quarter, you provided guidance about $50 million impact the screen count was stable, is that still in play right now?","James E. Parisi","Yes, Chris, this is Jamie. Yes, the guidance from last quarter was if screen count stayed consistent with where we ended -- where we were in last quarter going forward and you apply the new rate, that would be an extra $50 million or so of revenue. We have seen some continued pressure on the terminal count in the fourth quarter as we continue to see banks downsizing and some of the legacy incentives still were in place in the fourth quarter so that waiver where people were taking advantage of that waiver for trading terminals. Though the teams obviously here have analyzed different alternatives to reinvigorate the revenue, this revenue source. And as we mentioned, they've made these changes to the waiver policy, that I think going forward will help mitigate some of that terminal decline that we've seen from people migrating from paying terminals to waive terminals and then ultimately us collecting some fee on those waive terminals in 2015.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Any color on the amount of fee that you potentially collect from the fee waivers?","James E. Parisi","It's too difficult to say at this point because you don't know how people are going to react whether they're going to consolidate terminals and whatnot. So we're going to leave that out for now, but I do think it's -- it'll be somewhat meaningful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to touch on the Energy business here. So you guys did some pretty heavy discounting over the course of 2013 in hopes of bringing new participants into the complex and helping the overall energy complex. So I was just wondering if you could provide any color on if that's changed to somewhat of a customer mix there, if you're seeing more commercial participation or if it's had any impact on incremental volumes here?","Bryan T. Durkin","It's Bryan, and yes, I think that the focus and the emphasis that we put in place on bringing in some of the commercial interest is definitely showing itself more so across the sector, within our crude product line, within our efforts on building up the brand contract, as well as our natural gas business. So if you take a look at the overall comparison of how we're tracking volume quarter-on-quarter versus open interest, we're seeing some very nice pickup. We have stabilized the rate per contract. We have been able to see some great I think acceleration pickup in the natural gas contracts in particular. We're also seeing some strong uptick in participation in our overall options. We just recently introduced our natural gas basis contract. And we're very pleased with the initial interest and pickup there. We have 17 companies already that have cleared natural gas basis. And that's particularly referencing back to my earlier comment on commercial interest. Six of the top 25 natural gas basis customers have executed with us. We have some strong market maker participation. We're very excited about the introduction of that contract as it complements our overall natural gas business.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jamie, just had a few questions on the expenses. So I guess first, I just want to make sure the impairment was in the non-op line, so in the -- like in the unconsolidated subsidiaries, and then just on some of the lines in the quarter, just seems like the other line item, I think communications, you guided to a higher level came in at lot lower. But you had professional, it was just a lot higher. So just want to make sure, we kind of understand, whether it's the building loss, where the cyber investment or the spend came in, in the quarter? And I think on the cyber in the deferred comps, just how much of that was this quarter versus you guys mentioned it was for the full year, but obviously it was back weighted?","James E. Parisi","Sure. So the $16 million I referenced in terms of our spend on the cyber incident came through professional fees. And that was roughly half in Q3 and half in Q4. I recall about $8 million in Q4 from that in professional fees. And then deferred comp was about $3 million of expense in Q4 as well. And then on other expense, don't forget we tend to be heavier weighted on marketing expense towards the end of the year because of the events, and whatnot that we hold in the fourth quarter, and a lot of the advertising tends to be weighted in the backend, so that's why you saw a little bit heavier spend there as well.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So just the marketing that would be in that other bucket, so x the building loss, that was driving a lot of it partially seasonal?","James E. Parisi","Yes, yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Jamie, you guys have been successful in exiting or monetizing kind of non-core assets over the last couple of years. Wondering if you're still in the process of exploring other potential sales or exits in the next 12 months? And then remind us again on your kind of minimum cash levels. And if that has -- if you think that might change over that same time period looking out over the next 12 months?","James E. Parisi","Sure. With respect to the shedding non-core assets, I think obviously the buildings were the big things that we've done over the last few years. And we've sold all the real estate, significant real estate that we want to at this point. Obviously, owning our major data center and owning our trading floor facilities, we're going to keep those on the books going forward. And then the other part of the question was around which?","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Your minimum cash and if you expect that to grow?","James E. Parisi","Yes, on the minimum cash, we're still targeting $700 million minimum. Do note though over the last few years, every time we've paid that annual variable dividend, we brought the cash down to about $900 million, losing a little bit of a cushion there above our minimum. So just to keep that in mind as well. But the minimum that we're looking at is the $700 million.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to the expense guidance. Jamie, you gave a couple of items here, but maybe you can flush it out a little bit more. First of all, I -- you didn't give a range this year. So just wondering, why you have that much confidence on one particular number, in particular given that we've had a couple of examples over the last few years, when if I remember correctly, you were more towards the higher ends or above that. So maybe you can just talk about that. And when it comes to the licensing fees, obviously that's going to be driven by equities and energy volumes. So maybe just like what are you assuming there in terms of volume growth, so we can or maybe bring that up or down little bit depending on all [ph] volume assumption? And then just lastly, again, talk about what goes into the expense guidance in terms of expectations for some of these line items and bonus accruals and things like that?","James E. Parisi","Sure. Just in terms of the expense guidance itself, our best estimate at this point is $1.310 billion. That's where we're going to strive towards for the year. So we thought we would give you the number that we're working towards. And in terms of giving you any volume guidance, I appreciate your desire to get that from us. But as usual, we're not going to provide any of that volume guidance to you on those particular product lines or any product line. But when I look at the guidance and you look at the increase versus 2013, I'd say the lion's share of the increase is really tied to staffing with the annual merit and promotion adjustments, obviously, being a component of that, as well as new hires in support of growth and regulatory areas kind of driving the other part of the increase in that line. In order of absolute dollar magnitude, I'd say the next area of growth in the expense when you look at the different line items, will be in the occupancy line as a result of the fact that we're now leasing the NYMEX building, with offsets to that expense in depreciation and amortization because we no longer own the building. We should also see as we said, some growth in the licensing and fee sharing. And then driven also by the full year impact of the OTC revenue share that comes through that line. And then, we'll see now -- we'll continue to see likely increases in professional fees, as we continue to invest in growth opportunities. And then when we look at technology support line, we should see some increase there in the coming years, as we look to reconfigure our backup data center footprint. But think that's kind of a laundry list of some of the things that were driving that expense guidance for next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick one on the interest rate complex. The Fed tapering has clearly been beneficial to volumes. Just wondering as you guys look at the volumes speak to your customers, do you think a lot of that participants now are back into the market, just assuming that tapering is going to be over? Or do think there's still a large portion of the customer base that's still out of the complex, but potentially could get back in as the Fed continues to accelerate taper?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill, I'll start and I'll ask Bryan to add. I think the -- if you look at the indicators over the last 4 years or so, the front end of the Eurodollar, for example, saw a sharp decline in volume and any kind of activity and that led to us doing some development work across other parts of the curve that made up some of that loss. What we have been seeing, particularly over the last 2.5 or 3 months, is a pickup, a significant pickup in activity in those front 8 months and a corresponding pickup in activity. So in the back months and the Treasury futures and options are also reflective of more activity. So it could be that they ask now definitive expectations as to when Fed easing will end the uncertainty as to whether it'll end or not, it is bringing a lot of folks into the marketplace in order to actually hedge. And that's reflected on the expanded activity that you're seeing. Parts of the curve that for the last 4 years has been -- have seen a decline in all volume. In terms of participations, open interest holder activity also has gone up. So that's indicating to us that many participants are coming back in the market, particularly over the last 3 months or so.","Terrence A. Duffy","Can I just add to that a little bit, Gill? Just giving you a little -- this is Terry Duffy. When you look at what's going on in the interest rate market, with the tapering of $10 billion going on a month, we still have another $70 billion a month to get out of the $85 billion a month of tapering, before we even get the rate movement at all. So I actually believe there's a tremendous amount of participants that are still on the side lines they're waiting to see the program -- acuity program completely end. And then we'll see some fluctuation in rates and then we'll see some proprietary trading shops that maybe have not been in there. And not the pure hedges, but a lot of high turnover guys. So I still think there's a lot of participants on the sidelines.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","And we'll go on to the next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Back to the OTC clearing question. I know it came up a couple of times, but with respect to the market share dynamic, and I know there's certain differences between you guys and LCH. But you guys clearly have a pretty significant capital savings to offer the clients. Why do think that hasn't been higher, I guess, as of yet? And what are some of the catalysts that you think we need to look for, for folks just to take up the gross margin and portfolio margin opportunity that you could offer?","Bryan T. Durkin","Well, we're actually quite excited about the uptick in the firms that are availing themselves to the cross-margining efficiencies. We have over 7 clearing members now that are live with portfolio margining and several more in the testing phases. And again, I think you have to really focus on the level of global market participation that we have within our complex for OTC clearing. We're very pleased to see that number growing. We have over 420 global market participants. And our focus and emphasis is continuing to grow that user base on the client side of the business in particular and we're the beneficiary of bringing new business into that core.","Phupinder S. Gill","And with all the things that are going on in terms of compliance with both the rule changes that are occurring here, and in Europe and elsewhere. I think to the extent that the focus for some firms are not there, it's a matter of prioritization. And we do know that, at this point in time many of the firms and their customers are focusing on the Fed issue. And those folks that have their members not ready to do cross-margining have found their way into the deliverable swap futures complex for us. So basically, that is as Bryan points out, a lot of enthusiasm and there have been 7 firms that have signed up, I think the last quarter, when we spoke that number was only 2 or 3 firms. So we have seen growth.","Terrence A. Duffy","And Gill, maybe there was one other thing we can mention, as we're talking about OTC, the mandate for the trading of swaps will be kicking in around September 15. I don't know if we touched much on that and what that could potentially do to our core business, whether it's futurization or adding basis type trading with our swaps and futures coming together. And that is something that I think we all need to keep a very close watch on how that's going to materialize starting in the middle of February and going forward over the next several months.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And Gill, when you mentioned that there are more users albeit it's still early switching over from using more traditional swaps to futures. Any evidence you see about the type of clients who are doing that? I don't know if there is any pattern you can point to or if it's still too early to tell?","Phupinder S. Gill","Too early to tell at this time now in terms of what trends to expect. But I think as Terry points out, if you look at the next 7 months, it will be instructive as to who would be participating. And also on our slide, if you look at Slide 10, the last open interest holders for deliverable swap futures has continually gone up. It'd be gather that number's slightly above 20 and now it is at 50 and change.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just want a follow-up on MiFID II. Obviously, we're going to get more details on it. But what is the optimistic case for CME in terms of helping CME better break into Europe? Maybe without having to offer open access in the U.S.? And is there potential to maybe take advantage of partnerships that you have with other firms to get access to Europe without reciprocating in the U.S.? And I know we don't have details, but could there be potential that you are thinking about there?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill, and I'll start here. I think our focus has been largely to see which parts of the law might encroach on the core business of the firm. And on that front, we're quite pleased with what we are seeing there. There are several compliance-related issues that our entities in Europe have to basically make sure that they're in compliance with those rules. With respect to the partnership opportunity, as you know, it's been the preferred model for CME, with very small exceptions to partner with entities around the world. And so we view Europe no differently than we view any other part of the world. With that complete understanding that the client base is very mature there, they understand the products such as the client base that is here. And to the extent that there are partnership opportunities that present themselves, we would almost always look at them. So at this time, our focus is very decidedly on what the MiFID laws are saying in the implications for the businesses that we have here. And at first glance, it looks pretty much business as usual with multiple exceptions as to how it's being conducted in Europe on a going forward basis. So the next 2.5 years would be instructive as to how we position ourselves.","Terrence A. Duffy","And Gill, if I could just add to that. I think what's important to note here is, when we first decided to list the clearinghouse in Europe and to register for an exchange in Europe, MiFID II was not out and no one even thought of any proposal on open access. So our business plan wasn't going to be based around if in fact we could take advantage of an open access throughout the European communities. Actually we opposed that type of language in Europe because we believe in a vertical silo as we do here in the U.S. That being said, I think that we have great opportunities as a start up in Europe to continue to build our business and what we have to do is have a value add. I think as Gill clearly pointed out, the incumbents are going to have a distinct advantage for their products it's no different than we all do today in the vertical models. But at the same time, we'll be in the new business in London and we're doing it for the reasons for value add not because of a law that we think could help make the business more accessible.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gaston Ceron with Morningstar Equity Research.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just have a quick follow-up on that very issue that you were just touching on. Maybe I missed it, but do have an update on -- you mentioned a lot on that exchange, do you have an update on the timing for that? And also -- just so I understand, so when and if you open that, the new MiFID rule would apply to that, is that correct? And also you seem pretty definitive that it would not bleed into your U.S. business. So does that mean that even if as volume that originates in Europe but comes to the U.S., the rule would not apply to that? I'm just trying to get it straight.","Phupinder S. Gill","Okay. You asked quite a few questions. No, that's just fine. I'll start with the one that I remember, but this is the last part of your questions about how confident we are. Our focus in the first instance is to make sure that European clients will be able to continue to access U.S. markets in the same way and in the same fashion that they currently are doing so. So on that front, there is some work that's being done between the regulators here and the regulators over there. On the second piece is the open access issue that was addressed a short while ago. In terms of the launch of the exchange, we have no update at this point. We still continue to work with Bank of England and other authorities to make sure that they are comfortable with the process and procedures that we have. And that should be resolved soon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.","Robert Rutschow - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I had a quick question on rates. It seems that some of the benchmarks that are used, particularly the ones based on surveys are being shied away from and being changed, and so I'm wondering did you see any opportunities to develop new products to take share, further share globally in rates?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. I think the jury is still out there. I think they are -- there's a committee that's been headed by the Dr. Duffy [ph] from Stanford, and he is looking at the alternatives and their scheduled to release a report quite soon here. I think as you may have well read, there has been 2 schools of camp, one was basically to fix the indexes as they stand and make sure they are not easily manipulatable. And the other hand if the one that says get rid of them and start fresh. And so I think the work that this committee is doing will be instructed with respect to the direction that they are going to go to. But in any case, I think what CME Group is focused on is basically growing the comp -- the complex as we see it both in the short end, as well as the long end. And on the short end, where the index, the LIBOR index is being used for the Eurodollars, we are and we have been and continue to look at alternatives that make sense for our client base and also reflect the operating reality in which these products can be used. And so whether they're based on a survey of actual transactions or whether they are based on any other criteria, whatever the outcome, CME Group will support them in helping our clients grow their businesses.","Bryan T. Durkin","I think you would just note the success that we've had in our innovation and development of new products being responsive to changing dynamics in the marketplace itself. We're very proud of what we've done with the Deliverable Swap Futures, the Ultra Bonds, the Mid-Curve options, the E-micro FX the weeklies and the FX, as well as in the interest rates. And so we're drawing about 7% of our listed interest rate volume now coming from the development of new products and new product innovation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I was just wondering if you guys for market data, can you tell us what percentage of your current terminals have waived fees versus -- are paying fees?","James E. Parisi","No, we don't. I'm sorry, Jillian, we don't release that information.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, fair enough. And then just one other question, I know you raised your fee rates, obviously, in a lot of different categories in January. But from what I saw there weren't any changes made to volume tiers. And I was just wondering, whether you still might have some flexibility there to adjust it higher in 2014, especially, for like interest rates? Because a lot of the fee hikes were actually in ags, but where you've seen the most volume in open interest growth has been on the rate side. So I was not sure if there's more to do there?","James E. Parisi","So there were actually as part of the fee changes, there were some tier adjustments across various products. That's [indiscernible]. I don't know if there's any more to comment there.","Phupinder S. Gill","I think in terms of fees, this was a large-scale, across-the-board fee increase for us. But in terms of the tweaks that we can perform on the various contracts that we have, we will always look at the volumes and the trends. And if it make sense for us to adjust tiers, we can do that in very quick order.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the cyber protection expenses. So, Jamie, you said that $8 million was split -- $8 million 3Q and 4Q. And I guess the question is, was the $8 million expected? Was that in the guidance for fourth quarter? Did you know -- would you expect or was that sort of a surprise as well? And do you have anything baked in for 2014? I missed that if you did already say it, on cyber protection in the expense guidance.","James E. Parisi","Rich, this is Jamie. It was not in the original guidance for Q4. This is kind of a little bit of a new ground in terms of the spend, so didn't have that in the guidance. As far as 2014 goes, whatever we need to spend on security of our systems and soundness of our systems is embedded in the $1.31 billion that we -- that I noted earlier.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And can I take one more crack at. Do you expect the mix to change back to the higher-paying buy-side clients in the OTC clearing? Possibly with the Feb 15 stuff implementation?","James E. Parisi","You know, Rich, it's hard to say. But I would -- I think a lot of them are already clearing with us. And if anything, they're looking for ways potentially to migrate to futures. So that may weigh on that percentage going forward on the -- as far as the OTC business goes, but obviously benefit the core.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just had -- what, actually 2 follow-ups. The building and other revenues, the decline in the quarter, was that driven by the sale of the NYMEX building? Is this a good run rate going forward?","James E. Parisi","In terms of the building and other, we saw lower compliance fines was part of that. Also the lower lease revenues from New York from the sale of the building was part of it. And then we also saw lower process servicing fees because of some year-end true-ups with some of our partners. So it was a mix of things. So in terms of a run rate, hard to give you a sense off of that. But I think that when we look at where we have been, you look probably at an average of this year, you're probably not too far off, and then adjust a little bit for the building revenues.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just in the professional fees, so it's equal in terms of the cyber expenses this quarter and last quarter. But we still saw a roughly almost a $10 million sequential increase. Just wondering what was driving that? I'm not sure if I missed that earlier.","James E. Parisi","Well, you had a -- it was up -- it -- really driven by growth spent on growth initiatives, including international OTC, energy market distribution. And so that was what was really driving that on the professional fees side.","Operator","And our final question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just one more follow-up on the fee changes that Jillian just asked about. You're seeing 2% to 3% in aggregate. Maybe, Jamie, can you break it down a little bit more by product bucket? I think interest rates in ags, if you look at the fees scheduled get the most, but if you add some more detail you want to share, that would be great. And then related to that, obviously, you've been benefiting from the member\/nonmember shift here a little bit, with everything going on with OTC to futures and things like that. I mean, that probably should continue to be in favor of nonmember, which are obviously higher? But anything that could change that in the near-term that you're seeing or do you think there's continuation of that trend?","James E. Parisi","I'll highlight, I'll touch on your question on the rates and maybe ask Bryan to comment on the second part. But on the rates, there's not too much more to add there, really in terms of the fee increases that we're putting in, there will be -- if you look at the larger impacts are likely on the commodity side, particularly in ags, with some of the lower -- the lowest impacts likely on the equity side. So it's kind of the way to think about where they are coming through and then the rest are kind of in the middle. And there's no real changes on the Eurodollar side.","Bryan T. Durkin","And then I would just touch on again, taking a look at the distribution of users and these products, we're seeing again a very nice uptick in participation across the asset management community, the hedge funds in the corporate, which are typically the higher-paying clients. And to reinforce what I'm saying, if you take a look at asset managers, usage of Eurodollar futures has increased significantly in the first half of the year, the asset management community represented about a million contracts of open interest, which was roughly 12% of our open interest, in line with the timing of the last Dodd-Frank clearing mandate. These holdings have increased substantially in the fourth quarter of this year to over 2.8 million contracts, which represents over 21% of the Eurodollar open interest. So again, reinforcing the increase to the utilization of the futures product from this client base.","Phupinder S. Gill","Just to finish Bryan's point, in terms of the trends that you asked about, if you look at the earnings call slides and you will see the trends there along the exactly the same lines of what Bryan is referring to there, increasing trends in terms of large open interest holders across some of the key asset classes. They are returning to 2006, 2007 levels, which is very encouraging for us.","Operator","I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.","Phupinder S. Gill","Okay, with that, thank you all very much.

I would like to turn the conference over to John Peschier. Please go ahead, sir.","John C. Peschier - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Gill and John will spend a few minutes discussing the results, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. Terry, Bryan, Derek, Sean, and Kim are on the call as well and may participate in the Q&A session. Before they begin, I will read the Safe Harbor language. Statements made on this call and the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and involve risks uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are on our website. Also on the last page of our earnings release, you will find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Mr. Peschier, and thank you all for joining us. We have consistently talked about our focus on globalizing our business, growing our industry-leading options and futures franchise, and solving challenges our customers face through a number of innovative product extensions. We made progress across all of these areas during the third quarter. Year-to-date, our volume is up 8%, as is our transaction revenue while earnings per share is up more than 10%. This morning, I will start with our secular drivers then I will shift to a few product highlights.","We have expanded our global footprint in spite of the challenging macro environment over the last five years. This quarter, we saw volume from Europe and Asia grow in the low single digits while the US activity was flat. Energy, in particular, stood out in Asia, Latin America, and Europe. We also saw noticeable outperformance in FX during third quarter out of Europe, which is great to see. In addition to the country of origin information that we share with you, we also track electronic volume throughout the 24-hour trading day. In Q3, our volume during European trading hours increased by 20%, while activity during Asian hours was up 7%. The US trading hours volume is down 1%, because of tough comps vis-a-vis August of last year.","Turning to our efforts in our options franchise. We remain the leader relative to other global exchanges in terms of total options volume traded. During the third quarter, options reached the highest percentage on Globex to date, with more than 57%, and September exceeded 60%. A critical focal point has been our continued investment in our functionality and technology to enable increase adoption of Globex execution for complex option spreads. We are pleased to confirm that we hit a record of 50% of all option spreads traded electronically in September, up from less than 20% in 2012.","We continue to launch a number of exciting new product extensions. Our Ultra 10-Year Treasury contract reached 73 contracts per day, compared to 61,000 in Q2. Open-interest continues to build and the bid offer spread is getting tighter. Building on the success of our weekly equity options that expire Friday each week, we launched weekly equity options with Wednesday expirations about a month ago. Those are averaging 23,000 per day, and on one day, we traded 45,000. In continuing to tailor contracts to meet specific client needs, we launched S&P 500 Total Return Index futures and those have begun to trade in October. The other areas of focus related to the initial implementation of the uncleared margin requirements include some cleared FX products like NDS and options, and potential new futures contracts primarily in interest rates, equity, and FX.","Moving on to our commodities portfolio, we had another strong quarter led by metals and energy. up 22%, and 17% respectively year-over-year. In addition to strong volume growth, we continued to expand and diversify our global customer base across all of our commodities' asset classes. We reached an all-time high this month in the number of large open interest holders in energy, while ags and metals large open interest holders have grown in the mid-single digits and remain near peak levels. This reaffirms that global customers continue to manage their commodities market risk exposure here at CME Group.","Our metals business has been our fastest growing segment this year, with volumes up 29% to date. Our precious metals business has performed extremely well despite a relatively flat volatility curve over the last year. With 74% of our metal options now trading electronically, we have been able to expand our global customer base by delivering futures and options liquidity all the way through the Asian and European trading days. And in our industrial metals area, we continue to build on our success with our copper business, up 17% year-to-date compared to LME's copper business which is down 7%.","We also continue to grow our copper open interest with September month-end open interest up 17% year-on-year. We are particularly proud to have expanded our metal business with Asian clients by 45%, proving that we can effectively build business despite a challenging volatility environment.","Energy was particularly strong in Q3, average daily volume of 2.3 million contracts, which is up 17%. In Q3, crude was up 20%, natural gas rose 23%, and refined products increased 13%. Our natural gas options business has been a particular area of success, with September volumes increasing 40%, driven by the significant growth in electronic volume. Within natural gas options during the third quarter, we set records for monthly ADV, a single day volume record, as well as record levels of options trading on Globex at 44% for August, up from just 15% a year ago.","We believe that there are structural shifts taking place in both the crude and natural gas markets, driven by the US now becoming the swing producer in these markets, and we are well positioned to benefit from this shift. We have seen natural gas prices around the world begin to connect, which we believe bodes well for our physically settled Henry Hub contract over the long term. We see confirmation of global adoption of CME's benchmark energy products in our global customer growth, with energy business in Asia up 104% in September.","Turning to financial products and starting with interest rates. Average daily volume in Q3 was up 2%, and year-to-date we are up 5%. At the end of the quarter, our large open interest holders were very close to an all-time high. Our total open interest in rates at the end of September, of about 55 million contracts, was up 15%, with Eurodollars up 17%, and treasuries up 10%. Clearly, there is an increased focus on the front end of the yield curve and our Fed-watch tool is currently projecting a greater than 75% probability of a December move. Open-interest in the first four quarterly Eurodollar futures contract reached 5.3 million contracts, which is a four-year high.","Also, it is nice to see that our year-to-date Fed Funds futures average daily volume is up 70%, to 134,000 contracts per day. Within treasuries, we have increased our cash treasury penetration market share metric to the highest level to date, and have increased by more than 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year, to more than 80%.","Over the counter swaps revenues approached $17 million in total during Q3, up from $13 million in Q2. We reached all-time volume records in our Latin America interest rate swaps in September, with $10 billion per day in Mexican peso, and $5 billion per day in Brazilian real. In addition, we have begun to charge for interest rate swap compression services and have compressed over $2.2 trillion since the fees have been implemented.","Turning to equities, compared to the same quarter a year ago, S&P 500 volatility dropped substantially with a more normal summer quarter. Our volume was down 12% but compared favorably to the majority of the other equity-related volumes traded elsewhere. For example, we tracked the notional value of the E-mini S&P futures that we trade compared to the SPDR ETF. Last year, in the third quarter, the notional amount traded in our S&P futures was seven times that of the SPDR. This year, in Q3, that ratio jumped to more than 10 times higher. When you think about the all-in cost to trade based on a tight bid offer spread and deep liquidity, we are considerably less expensive.","Lastly, within FX, we have seen decent year-over-year growth in volume in September and October, and we have outperformed other FX venues. Most importantly, within FX, we are pleased to see a new record number of large open interest holders in the most recent report in advance of the widely anticipated Fed meeting in December.","In summary, through the hard work of our staff, we continue to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible, and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Despite volatility in many asset classes being down significantly from Q3 last year, which included a particularly volatile August in 2015, we were able to come in basically flat in terms of revenue and EPS during the quarter. Volatility by definition does not come in smoothly when comparing periods, and I am pleased to say that our adjusted EPS through three quarters has grown 10% to $3.39 per share. Our adjusted operating expenses excluding license fees were down 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating margin expanded slightly from a year ago to almost 66%. Our rate per contract for the quarter was $0.75, down from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to a member\/ non-member shift in some of the asset classes that saw lower volatility, like equities. Also, within energy, we had a surge in our lower priced natural gas options which created a negative venue shift.","Moving to expenses, excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense dropped 1% from the prior year to $257 million, and it was down 5% sequentially. Compensation-related expense dropped 2% compared to the last year, and the compensation ratio in Q3 was 15.2%, down slightly from a year ago. Our non-compensation-related expenses were down less than 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. Looking at the non-operating income and expense line, our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture drove $28.4 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, which was the highest level we have ever achieved.","Turning to investment income, we received $2.7 million in dividends from BM&FBovespa. In addition, our investment returns generated through the reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranteed fund contributions increased sequentially to $7.3 million from $5.2 million in Q2. This is a result of a higher average net return compared to the prior quarter. For Q3 this year, we had an average net return of 13 basis points. Taxes for the quarter ended at an adjusted 36.6%, which is slightly above where we guided.","And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, we had almost $1.6 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, up approximately $260 million from the prior quarter. Earlier this month, we sold down our BM&FBovespa stake to approximately 2.4% and raised approximately $150 million. The brokerage costs were minimal, so the vast majority of that will be included in our cash balance and available when we determine the annual variable dividend.","We believe the steady return of capital has differentiated us from our peers, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to supplement our earnings growth with a healthy dividend for years to come.","During the quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $23 million. The level of capital expenditures is impacted as we continued to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service, which is included in expense. I now expect CapEx to come in a bit below $100 million for the year, driven by the shedding of our real estate assets and the recent sale of our data center.","Last quarter I mentioned the subscription program that we made available for our members. We continue to work with our membership as they weigh the benefits of taking advantage of the program. The take up so far has been relatively small. We've booked about $170,000 in Q3, and with recent conversions, we are approaching a run rate of $3 million per year of new revenue.","We recently announced our 2017 pricing schedule. In a targeted fashion, we adjusted the volume discount tiers, incentive plans and the base rates. If volume comes in exactly as it has this year, we would expect transaction fees resulting from the change to increase by 2%. We take a very long term view on pricing changes. Our goal is to increase volumes, which reduces the overall cost to trade on our markets, as we bring in more participants and enhance liquidity. With record volumes in open interest and expanding number of global participants, the value to our customers from transacting in our markets has never been greater. We remain focused on being as efficient as possible. We have been reducing the core operating costs to free up expense dollars to deploy on growth initiatives. We are currently working on our 2017 budget and will report out on our plans next quarter.","Last quarter, we adjusted our expense guidance excluding license fees for the second half of 2016 down to $548 million. The guidance remains unchanged, as we have a normal ramp in the fourth quarter for marketing events. We anticipate launching a new retail advertising campaign that will likely impact us in Q4, and we are expecting higher pro fees based on some growth oriented projects that are underway. The guidance translates to less than 1% expense growth in 2016 on this basis.","In summary, so far this year, revenue is up $169 million, and our incremental operating margin is 94%. Without license fees, that jumps to about 100%. Our secular growth drivers continued to deliver results with or without volatility. Our efficiency on expenses has been excellent, and since the first of the year, we have returned $1.6 billion in dividends.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back in the queue if you have any further questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, thanks, guys. Hey, John, maybe first one just on expenses, so, obviously good in the quarter, and when we look at the full year guidance, it looks like the fourth quarter \u2013 I know there's seasonality, but there's a decent ramp, I think even relative to maybe last year \u2013 a bit higher. So I just wanted to get a sense on what's kind of already in the run rate, meaning that you expect, versus what would be, like, volume based.","And I know going into 2017, it's early, but when we think about what you guys have said, kind of longer term in like the low single digit expense growth, just any color that you can give on how much of that is, like, volume oriented, and so if revenues are strong, you'll be at the top end of the range versus the bottom. And I know it's still early, but any color there.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure, Mike. Thank you. When you take a look at the increase in expenses from Q3 to Q4, really, it's coming in primarily into three categories. One is compensation, which, similar to this quarter last year, included our annual adjustments to the estimates associated with stock-based compensation, which will cause an increase quarter over quarter \u2013 or, I'm sorry, quarterly sequentially, an increase in the fourth quarter. There's some timing related to professional fees related to organic growth initiatives between the third and fourth quarter. And the other line, which, similar to prior years, is seasonally higher in the fourth quarter and includes costs associated with marketing and customer-facing events. So to put this into context, we anticipate only a 1% annual increase in organic expenses this year, and we decided not to adjust our guidance.","When you take a look at next year, we will update everybody in the fourth quarter's conference call, but we did say that we'd be between the low and mid-single digits, with the higher end of the mid-single digits being due to higher revenue achievement. So the entire team here is extremely focused on expense discipline, and we're carrying that forward into 2017.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And we'll take our next question could from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Phupinder S. Gill - CME Group, Inc.","Hey, Dan.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","I guess, John, you kind of highlighted your commitment to the dividends, but just want to talk about M&A with, obviously, industry M&A still happening. Can you talk about how you are thinking about maybe transactional versus kind of non-transactional revenue in terms of that context? Or is it really just a focus organically for you guys going forward?","Phupinder S. Gill - CME Group, Inc.","Go ahead.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure, Dan, thank you. So there really is no change to our view on M&A. We look at M&A with an eye on creating long-term shareholder value. So we definitely pay attention to the marketplace and are constantly looking at opportunities, and when we see something that is long term value enhancing, we'll act on it. With regard to whether or not it is transactional versus non-transactional in nature, really, we look at it more from a point of view on creating long-term shareholder value. So if something does create value and we see that it fits in our business strategically, that's something that we will act on.","Phupinder S. Gill - CME Group, Inc.","Dan, just to add to what John said, I think given the nature of the business we have, vis-a-vis other exchanges, we have six asset classes, we have benchmarks within those asset classes and when you put the focus on client needs, I think it's entirely appropriate for us to \u2013 in line with what John said, look at adjacencies that might make sense to our clients. So our length is across the ecosystems of the asset classes that we are engaged in with a view to bring more value to our client base.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Phupinder S. Gill - CME Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Allen with Buckingham. Please go ahead.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Morning, everyone. I just wanted to ask a question, I guess this is probably for Terry, there's been a bunch of headlines out of the EU with regards to a transaction tax and there's clearly some worries in the US with the potential for the Democrats to gain more control about a transaction tax. So any type of updated thoughts on that and what you guys are hearing maybe out of D.C., and how you are thinking about it moving forward.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. I think that this is one of those topics that I have heard forever since I have been here, in the last 35 years, 36 years. You know, people have said \u2013 and I have actually read a few reports that if, in fact, Secretary Clinton is to prevail in the presidency and they also prevail in the Senate and the House and control all three branches of the government, that it would be easier to pass a transaction tax.","Well, I would say what happened in 2008 when that was the scenario, when President Barack Obama became elected and the Senate and the House both went Democrat, they didn't do anything. We work very hard on working both sides of the aisle to educate people about how they would be putting a very, very large tax on a very small universe of people that provide liquidity for farmers to transfer risk, people to do mortgage hedging, people to do all different hedging in all the asset classes that Mr. Gill just referenced, and if those spreads widened, I have testified many times how you put forth a transaction tax of a couple hundred million dollars, let me show you how it'll cost the consumer several billion dollars by doing so.","So, I think as long as we act professional and continue to make the arguments, I'm confident that we won't see such a nonsensical tax, but at the same time, taxes are going to probably continue to go up in some way, shape or form. I don't see it in the size of a transaction tax. You have to remember that around the rest of the world, there are transaction taxes, but not on pure futures. And the ones that do have it are so de minimis, are losing business. So most of the transaction taxes are in securities-based products, which people hold for a period of a lot longer and they have a much larger universe of participants.","When you look at our participants, and whatever the number is, I guarantee you, as we get to the bigger participants, that number is much, much smaller. So you would have a huge onus on a very small group of people, as I said earlier, and I just can't see even how our government would look at that, and that's one of the arguments that we have made historically, and I think it resonates. Listen, we've got to feed 9 billion people by 2050 with the same amount of acreage we have today. And if in fact the cost of food goes up significantly because people can't manage risk, that's going be a bad thing for the American people, and I think even the Democratic side of the aisle understands that.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yes, good morning. I just \u2013 one comment. Well, I still don't understand the expense increase from 3Q to 4Q, John. I mean this isn't just a little ramp, this is almost double. If you look at the last three-year average from 3Q to 4Q, it's $18 million. You are guiding to a $34 million increase here, this year. What makes this year different than the last three?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Well it's, first off, the increase from \u2013 when you take out license fees, the increase from Q4 last year to Q4 this year is a $10 million increase. We did have timing related, some growth oriented projects that shifted between Q3 and Q4. We also, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've got an advertising program that we're expecting to \u2013 that we're expecting to launch in the fourth quarter. So that's impacting as well.","So as you have seen from what Gill had mentioned, we've got an unprecedented number of new product launches and that's \u2013 and part of doing that requires some organic spend. So in total, we decided not to adjust our guidance, and as I mentioned, it's really a 1% annual increase in expenses, and, in fact, if you look at the last two quarters of 2014, and compare that to the last two quarters of 2016, we're flat.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Maybe for Kim. Want to see where CME was in the process of setting up the account with the Fed for the investment of non-house cash? I think a few months ago, you thought it might be completed by now. So where does it stand? And if it is completed or were completed, at this point in time, how much non-house cash could be deposited if the account were, in fact, open?","Kimberly S. Taylor - CME Group, Inc.","I think we have been talking more about house cash.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yep.","Kimberly S. Taylor - CME Group, Inc.","And I think that total, the total house cash that we hold is kind of on the order of $20 billion, fluctuates from day to day. We have our accounts open for the house cash with the Fed, and we're going through the last stages of the testing to make sure that everything will flow appropriately. And then we're still working with the CFTC and the Fed on the non-house cash or what we would call the customer cash, as well.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Any timeline on the non-customer \u2013 non-house cash side?","Kimberly S. Taylor - CME Group, Inc.","On the customer cash side, the non-house, that timing is really in the hands of the Federal Reserve and it's not something that is very easy to handicap.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question come from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, good morning, everyone. Probably for Gill, but maybe for some of the others too. You mentioned, Gill, the uncleared margin rules that came in in September, can you elaborate a little bit in terms of the discussions and what you have seen from clients in terms of, you know, I hear you on NDS, but I think historically you've also talked about uncleared margin rules would drive more uptick in futures.","And then, just lastly, who is shifting so far? What kind of customers? Because I think the bigger group of clients coming on in March, so just curious, if you think that's going to be a bigger bump and more dramatic change when those rules come in. Thanks.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Sure, Alex, this is Sean jumping in. On the uncleared margin rules, September 1st was the date U.S., Japan, Canada implemented them. The CFTC had a no action relief until October 3rd. The biggest impact, according to the BIS reports, are in rates and foreign exchange. In terms of rates, the biggest new offering that we have out there, that we think could help to relieve some of the challenges that the market faces are swaptions clearing. On swaptions clearings we currently have seven clearing members who have been approved by the risk committee, two new clearing members in the last couple of months, and we are excited that that's a great place to relieve a lot of the uncleared margin requirements in the rates area.","Then if you look at the FX market, as you said, the NDF market, we have an NDF marked offering out there. We also clear cash settled forwards. But in addition to that, we've begun working very hard on OTC FX options clearing, and we believe that the combination of all of those products together will be very attractive to market participants. We are working very closely with a set of mark participants on that.","In terms of equities, equities according to the BIS reports, is kind of third after those other two asset classes in terms of the impact on the marketplace.","We launched on August, late August, a Total Return S&P 500 futures that would nearly replicate the economics of a total return swap. So the OTC equity swaps market. With the no-action relief until October 3rd, we didn't see any trades in that until the week of October 3rd, but that week immediately, we had several participants trade in that first week, about 3,500 contracts. So you are talking about $3.5 billion approximately. And they traded in blocks of about 500 million each. So you had very large participants testing the pipes relative to the equity futures, the equity total returns future.","In terms of the next four years, it's only the top 20 or 21 institutions in the world that are affected today. Over the next four years, the expectation is that will become over 2,000 firms. So we do expect it, relative to our focus on it, relative to the new products and services that we are offering that there will be a lot of pain out there that we can help relieve with the new cleared products as well as with futures products","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Morning. So the dealers keep bringing up the topic of the \"\"skin in the game\"\" in the clearinghouses and how much capital that CME puts up in terms of the waterfall. What are your current views in terms of maybe additional money that you will need to put in the clearinghouses? And what sort of leverage do the dealers have to try to impact your behavior there?","Phupinder S. Gill - CME Group, Inc.","I'm not sure, and I will ask Kim to join in. I'm not sure about the leverage that the dealers would actually have, but we are actually focused on the \"skin in the game\" issue itself.","As you may or may not know, we pioneered the concept in the late '60s and we are comfortable with \"skin in the game\", we think it's necessary to have, but we also are very much in tune with respect to the moral hazard issue here. And if you look at our \"skin in the game\" and what the amount is, there are tons of views out there of the ad hoc views with respect to what that amount should actually be. From our perspective, at the $500 million or so level that we have across the board, it's about the average contribution of each of those firms. All right?","And we have affirmatively said that we strongly believe that those that bring risk should be the ones that fund the guarantee fund. We manage the risk that they bring, and we are ultra-comfortable with the levels that we have.","Anything to add, Kim?","Kimberly S. Taylor - CME Group, Inc.","I would just expand a little built on the moral hazard point. I mean, I agree with Gill, that we are very big believers in \"skin in the game\" from the clearinghouse, the clearinghouse needs the alignment of incentives with the clearing member. But the clearing members are very important participants in any kind of default management situation and the mutualization of risk across clearing mechanisms is part of the reason why clearinghouse mechanisms work so effectively. And turning too much of that to the contribution of the CCP up front, could change the dynamics of the risk mechanisms that support a good default management. So the moral hazard is very real and shows up in multiple ways in the process.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thanks for the color.","Operator","And we'll take our next question with Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys, good morning.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Alex.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So just thinking through the dividend policy, and I guess the tradeoff between increasing the variable \u2013 increasing the recurring dividend versus a bigger special as we are thinking out over the next year or so. Just curious to get your update on that.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","We feel very strongly that we've got a very good dividend policy between the regular dividend and the annual variable dividend. As you saw this year, we adjusted our regular dividend up 20% to create more of a balance between the annual variable and the regular dividend. So, we are very committed to the policy, and as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, there will be some positive increases in terms of the amount of cash going into the fourth quarter related to our sale down of our stake in BM&F, so that freed up about $150 million in cash that can be used when determining the annual variable dividend.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sure, I was just thinking, that you know, is the increase in the quarterly something we should expect every year from you guys, or was the event this year kind of one time?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","It's really \u2013 it's a board decision, but if you take a look at our past, we've had a policy of consistently increasing our regular dividend, but it's really a board decision, and it's something that we'll be analyzing in the fourth quarter along with the annual variable dividend level.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Morning, Kyle.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Just on the energy slide, comparing your WTI versus ICE Brent contract, I think if we look at futures open interest specifically, we aren't seeing necessarily the same shift. So can you help us understand the variance there between open interest and ADV? And I guess, what is driving the increased volume and activity rates in your WTI contract? Thank you.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Kyle, it's Derek. Thanks for your question. We are actually very excited about the growth rates that we've been able to unlock in our energy complex, and it's a number of factors both that we are controlling for in terms of our ability to both roll out product, acquire new customers, position our benchmark products in what is a market that is shifting structurally in favor of our benchmark products that, whether you look at the lifting of the export ban in crude back in December of 2015, creating a waterborne product that is WTI \u2013 we now have a product that the market is increasingly adopting as a global benchmark. As Gill referenced in his earlier comments at the top of the call, our growth in Asia, particularly in our energies franchise, is up in excess of 100%. So adoption and participation in our markets globally is increasing as we are leveraging Bryan's teams on the ground in Europe and in Asia to go access and bring new customers on board.","And when we actually think about the energies complex as a whole we're thinking about well beyond just the crude story. We're talking about nat gas as well. So as we talk about the overall franchise on slide nine of the deck that we sent you guys, in the same structural shifts we talked about that are beneficial to our crude business favoring WTI over Brent, we're also seeing some reconnecting of the global nat gas market. On slide nine on the right-hand side, we've got a graph of what we're showing as a reconnecting of the prices of U.S. nat gas, really driven by our physical Henry Hub products, between the prices both in Asia and Germany.","And when you look at the market share that we've grown to, we are now 76% market share of the global Henry Hub futures market. That's up from 73% in 2015 and 68% in 2014. So we're excited about as markets converge, the role that the Henry Hub futures complex, the physical part that we launched, will play as a benchmark product pricing in the global nat gas market as those prices disconnect from the crude market and reconnect globally.","Also, the open interest levels over the course of this year, we've reached not only record levels of open interest in nat gas, but we're hovering right at all-time highs in our large open interest holders on the futures side. And on the options, as we talked about previously, record levels of electronification in nat gas options and continued growth, our nat gas options business is up over 30% this year.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Just staying on the energy theme, can you comment, Derek, about NASDAQ's NFX effort, whether that's actually enhancing your volumes, given the arbitrage between markets? And if that program is expanded over time, is that a net benefit for you, or do you see that actually eventually being sort of a headwind on the incumbent's market shares?","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","When I look at the progress that we've made relative to the business that we've developed, we've got a nice problem. We've got a market that's up over 30% in September volume-wise. As I mentioned, the market share increasing up 70% on the futures side, and our market share relative of the nat gas options is still around 64%, 65%. But what we've really done is we've focused on electronifying the nat gas options business. When you look at what the other offerings are out there, this is a market that's typically been brokered, and we're the ones that have gone from less than 10% electronic in nat gas options to a record of over 40%, as Gill mentioned at the top of the call.","And as you've seen us do across products over time, when you focus on functionality and electronic access to your options market, bringing people into the transparent central and order book, we tend to see the velocity of transactions increase, and more important, we can access a global customer base. That's really hard to do in a block market. So we're excited about the progress we've made. The large open interest holder record levels that we're touching on is really a reflection of the increased global adoption of our product set. So we're excited about the multiple records we've hit in nat gas options \u2013 ADV, single day record, large open interest holders, as well as the deferred bump (39:49) liquidity that we have built and focused on over the last 12 months as well. Our open interest in months 6 through 12 is up 36%, as we are focusing on the commercial end user customers to bring them into our market, and those are the physical users that are using our product.","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","I would just add to that, particularly out of Asia, which has been a bit of a struggle in the past in terms of the adoption of our energy products, the leader in terms of growth throughout greater China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, as well as within Korea, has unquestionably been in the energy. Those that had traditionally favored the alternative to our WTI have been increasingly adopting our crude, and they've been very noticeably active in the natural gas, and very pleased to see the greater transparency associated with that. So we are going to continue driving that progress within those regions. Same holds true for within greater Europe.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vincent Hung with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi.","Phupinder S. Gill - CME Group, Inc.","Hi, Vincent.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","I just wanted to get your take on the FSB paper on CCPs and what global regulators are doing in respect to the systemic risk of CCPs. So where do you expect regulation to go, if anywhere at all?","Phupinder S. Gill - CME Group, Inc.","This is Gill, I'll answer that, and I'll ask Kim to add if she has anything to add. I think the FSB, like all the other regulators, are concerned about CCP resiliency, just as Chan and Massad at the CFTC is, and I think the authorities such as the CFTC are familiar with TCPs, familiar with the risk that TCPs bring, and they are comfortable, I think, with the framework that they have been overseeing for decades. I think the FSB, which includes some of the central banks of the world, that don't necessarily \u2013 have not necessarily overseen CCPs are coming to grips to what those mean. They're looking at various and sundry scenarios. And this is all part and parcel of the knock-on effects of the crisis of 2008.","On our part, we're working very hard to educate to the extent that we can, and also contribute to the debate, to the extent that we are allowed to.","Kimberly S. Taylor - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, I would just add a couple of things. Gill mentioned the kind of varying perspectives of different regulators, and one of the things \u2013 part of our advocacy is to help educate regulators that are newer to the regulation of clearinghouses or CCPs. Because although the G20 and the regulation have pushed products into clearing mechanisms because clearing mechanisms worked in the crisis, the interesting thing is that now they are thinking about slightly changing the way clearing mechanisms need to work. So we want to make sure that clearing mechanisms maintain their effectiveness, and our advocacy is in that regard with respect to flexibility and crisis management, and the ability to have strong risk management programs.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rob Rutschow with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, good morning.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Phupinder S. Gill - CME Group, Inc.","Morning.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Just a question on RPC. You mentioned in the press release a negative mix shift in equities and energy. Is that purely just mix in terms of customers, or are you seeing end customers take actions to try to reduce their RPCs?","And in addition, the advertising you mentioned in the fourth quarter, is that geared towards trying to drive more non-member activity?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure, this is John. I'll take it, and I will ask Derek to comment specifically on the energy side. So within equities, we had a higher proportion of member trading. And in energy, we had two factors. One is we had a larger proportion of member trading than last quarter, with member volumes up 19% and non-members up 15%. We also saw a large increase in the use of our electronic natural gas options, which are lower priced than ClearPort.","And Derek, if you want to comment on what you're seeing in terms of options trading, that would be great. But before we do that, I will just mention, in terms of the advertising campaign, yes, it's geared towards more retail and non-members. So with that, I will hand it over to Derek on the options.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, on the nat gas side, as John mentioned, there's two things going on. Number one, you have seen us build into sustainable growth and options markets by making sure that we can build those marks electronically. So we can market that liquidity globally. We've faced a market structure in nat gas options a year ago that was 95% brokered, less than 5% traded on screen. So every time we shifted businesses from a brokered market onto the screen we have done that because our experience has shown that you create a sticky ecosystem of user participants by bringing them into the central of an order book. The downside of that is you end up giving up our block surcharge, when we charge people an excess amount for dealing outside of the central of an order book.","So it's been a very disciplined approach to move that business on screen. So we are finding a great deal of success moving from less than 10% electronic, to a record of 44% electronic earlier this year, I think in August and September. So it's a shift that we have anticipated, a shift we've undertaken in other markets as we've globalized and electronified them, and with the business up 31%, typically you also start to move through volume tiers as well. So we consider this a first world problem relative to volumes growth and a disciplined move on to a central order book.","Rob Rutschow - CLSA Americas LLC","Great, thank you.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","","And we have a follow-up question from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, hey, hello, again. I guess a couple of follow-ups. I will start on market data. I don't think you have mentioned it, but I think you've given some guidance in the past there, it was down sequentially. Any updated views of how that should be trending in the next quarter, maybe even 2017, as people trade in their memberships, and things like that? Or their screens rather.","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Hi, it's Bryan. First of all, just to give you a little color since the elimination of the electronic fee waiver has been effect for almost a year, wherein all of our professional users are paying the full market data subscribers fee, our revenues and our subscribers remain stable. Now as we continue to advance our market data and IP growth opportunities, we have been performing a holistic assessment of our current program, and our assessment indicates that there are opportunities to extract additional value and revenues from our assets.","So, for example, in 2017, we expect that the manner in which we charge for our core market data services will be modified to tailor our fees in a more targeted fashion. Our approach to charging trading and non-trading participants will be modified to address the global nature of this business, and the various subscriber profiles that are consuming our data. So we believe our current pricing schema does not fully capture the value Alex described to these different user segments.","And just to give you a recent example of our targeted approach, I think I referenced at the last call, that we are increasingly commercializing our derived and historical market data offerings. So with respect to derived data, there are increasing opportunities and there's a significant pipeline of demand for our data IP, as the demand for the development of external product continues to increase.","Now, this clearly has been an area of revenue opportunity for us that we plan to drive greater growth, and it's been typically referenced in the past as core market data. So we will be separating that out increasingly, and going after those opportunities on a derived basis.","I think you also may be aware of our recent announcement of our new historical market data platform, which we just recently introduced in conjunction with TickSmith. To the usable, data needs to be instantly accessible and we have done that with our recent introduction of TickVault. Data users now can browse a data catalog, subscribe to the content needed and access it via the web interfaces and APIs almost instantaneously.","So this is making data access easy, and it's responsive to the global demand that we've been hearing. So we see more opportunities to extract more value in that regard. So that just gives you a taste of how we are relooking at the assets from the market data and IP perspective.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry, go ahead.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sorry. Just one more point on that. When I'd look at the fourth quarter, I think market data will be in the neighborhood of $100 million.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right great. That was more color than expected, so thanks for that. I guess just moving on, since we are in follow-up mode here.","On the membership, new membership opportunity, I think you said it's a little bit disappointing relative to what you expected. So can you just talk about the feedback that you have gotten? Is it basically people saying your stock is a good value, we like the dividends, we'll keep it? Or any other reasons why maybe the take up has not been as high as you expected?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. I wouldn't say it wasn't as high as we expected. I think we're right now at about a $3 million run rate per year in terms of \u2013 in terms of the amount that we had anticipated \u2013 that we gave out in terms of take up. So although it's only 173 \u2013 $170,000 for the quarter, we are at a $3 million run rate. So, it does take times for firms to make these decisions, as you indicated. They are weighing the annual variable dividend that they get in the fourth quarter by \u2013 or into the first quarter as \u2013 for holding our shares, so they take a look at that.","Also, we think it's beneficial for new members coming in, especially those from overseas, that were holding CME stock and having that amount of capital is prohibitive. So, that takes time to work through the system. So, in terms of the overall opportunity being about $40 million, we're at roughly 10% of that and it's only been out for just a couple of months. So, for us, this is really nothing but upside for us.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","And then, just one last one. Apologies in advance. But, you mentioned the retail advertising. Any particular reason why you are so focused on retail right now? I mean, can you just remind us how big retail is for you? Is this a global campaign? Is this just a US campaign and why now? Why do you think there's an opportunity in retail?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Definitely a global campaign. And we have been working towards this for the past several years cultivating opportunity and growth from this retail segment. And to give more focus on it this past year, we actually separated it out as a distinct client segment line, headed up by a gentleman that's been leading it for a number of years on our behalf, Mark Omens. Now, as we see the growth happening across our asset classes, it's representing a very significant revenue stream for us, looking at it from the non-member perspective as well. And we see that across all of our asset classes. It's one of the fastest growing segments that we've seen. Terry?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, no, I agree with that. I think that when you look at a revenue coming out of our traditional retail, the way we measured it basically next to nothing, and then putting in roughly a couple hundred million dollars I think last year alone and coming from the retail side of the business the upside is just extraordinary. We have I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% of the retail trade globally, and if we could just double that, you can imagine what the revenue could do for this company. So, we are taking a strong look at that. I think what's important is here we are not targeting the mom and pops on the street. When we call retail, we are talking about participants that are in the market today, trading anywhere from 10 contracts to 20 contracts a day already. And we are trying to harness that into the business.","What I think is also fascinating is when you look at some of these discount retail equity brokers traditionally, they are starting to merge together, the ones that offer futures. So that only bodes well for us to concentrate just more among people that are already offering these products.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right, thanks. I was here plenty of time, thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions so I would like to turn the conference over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","John C. Peschier - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you very much. And for some closing remarks, the entire team at CME is focused on maximizing our secular drivers and taking advantage of the structural changes in our markets. We are operating the business as efficiently as possible.","Let me illustrate that for you. When you compare the first three quarters of 2014 with the first three quarters of 2016, we have grown the top line over $400 million and our adjusted expenses are down $23 million, while continuing to innovate and launch many successful new products.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mr. John Peschier. Sir, you may begin.","John C. Peschier","Thank you, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. Gill and Jamie will spend a few minutes outlining the highlights of the second quarter, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. Terry Duffy is also on the line, along with Kim Taylor and Derek Sammann.","Before we begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language. Statements made on the call and in the accompanying slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q on our website.","Also note the final page of our earnings release contains a reconciliation to our GAAP results this quarter.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you, John, and good morning. I will discuss our performance in the second quarter and provide updates on a few of our strategic initiatives before turning things over to Jamie to review the financials.","During the second quarter, several themes continued to unfold, including the European crisis, bank downgrades, the continuation of Operation Twist and the Fed's 0 interest rate policy. The environment we operate in remains challenged, and global trading volumes continue to be impacted by low levels of volatility. In light of this, the entire organization is working to be as efficient as possible.","Average daily volume in the quarter was 12.4 million contracts, down 9% versus the second quarter 2011.","However, we did experience better volumes in May and June, 13.2 million and 13.1 million, respectively which helped offset the slower April of 10.7 million contracts.","Interest rate ADV in the second quarter declined 20% versus the same period last year. Volumes continued to be impacted by the Fed's 0 rate interest -- 0 interest rate policy and quantitative easing. The expectation of continued slower growth in the U.S. has pushed out the Fed funds great hike expectations, which also continued to weigh on volumes. Helping to stabilize our interest rate complex is a growth out the curve, especially in years 3 to 5, as well as in the so-called Mid-Curve Options.","Our interest rate team has been successful in building this new liquidity, and we expect this to drive even when activity in the front end picks up again. This is a good example of how we leverage our people and our products for the benefit of our customers, making CME Group the most compelling place to manage interest rate risks. This is evident in the strong outperformance of our markets versus interest rate products listed by other exchanges.","Also during the quarter, FX volume was flat compared to the same period last year. Overall, June average daily volume was $1.1 million, the highest FX volume month of 2012. This was driven by a boost in our euro currency volume resulting from increased volatility going into the Greek elections.","Our key growth contributors continue to be the so-called commodity currencies, the Aussie dollar, the Canadian and the New Zealand dollar, as well as our emerging market product, led by the Mexican peso. This is indicative of how our FX business continues to diversify as we grow our entire portfolio of currency pairs. This was also a key driver of CME Group's Q2 outperformance versus some of the larger cash FX platforms, most notably ICAP's EBS, which reported Q2 results that were down 24% compared to the last year.","We also hit multiple open interest record in June, leading up to the June quarterly expiration, hitting an all-time high of $2.3 million open FX contracts on June 7, 2012. We finished June with open interest up 22% year-on-year.","Overall, volatility remains slightly elevated going into the post-Greek election market, so we expect that we may see continued levels of concern as focus now turns to the Greek coalition government actions, as well as the state of Italy, Portugal and Spain.","Equities volume was up 3% versus last year. The increase was driven by strong performance in E-mini Dow futures, E-mini S&P options, E-mini S&P 500 weekly options and E-mini S&P 500 end-of-month options.","While assets under management continued to decline during the quarter, volatility picked up briefly when U.S. markets rallied sharply at the end of the quarter after better-than-expected news from the EU summit.","The VIX hit a high of 27 on an inter-month basis and has trickled down to close the month out near the 17 level.","Energy ADV was down 1% versus last year. This was driven by strength in natural gas and refined products, which were offset by lower WTI trading volumes. However, we have experienced strong volumes in the month of July with ADV up 9% versus July last year.","We also recently launched the CME Direct platform for energy trading in June to address customer needs for straight-through processing. This new technology offers side-by-side trading of exchange-listed and OTC markets. CME Direct will initially support trading of CME Group's benchmark energy futures market alongside OTC energy swaps through leading interdealer brokers.","Although metals volume is down 8% for the quarter versus last year, metals open interest continues to grow, up 9% at the end of June versus the same period last year, driven by an 11% increase in gold. We are encouraged by the recent base metal volumes with copper average daily volume increasing more than 57% versus Q2 last year and now representing more than 21% of our metals volume.","In agricultural commodities, volume is up 11% versus last year. Severe drought conditions in the Midwest is driving higher volatility along with the expansion of the CBOT grade and OTC trading hours on Globex have both contributed to strong performance.","Our markets have been particularly active in July with volumes up more than 50% as customers turn to us to manage their risks. Open interest has grown from 6.1 million open contracts at the beginning of January to 8.7 million open contracts as of July 25. This represents a high for the year and growth of over 20% versus the same period last year.","Moving on to our growth initiatives. We continue to expand and enhance our global partnerships. During the quarter, DOJ approved our S&P Dow Indices joint venture with McGraw-Hill, and we closed the transaction, combining S&P's leading position in equity, commodity, real estate and strategy indices with Dow Jones' recognized strength in equity, commodity, emerging market, target date and dividend indices, provide an opportunity to offer a complete and growing index family in more asset classes, benefiting more investors throughout the world. As a result of this venture, we have also extended our exclusive rights list for trading and clearing futures in S&P products for as long as we own equity in the joint venture.","Turning to technology. In Q3 of this year, we will launch a significant CME Globex performance release. The new platform introduces advance order entry and market data gateways deployed on our jointly developed FUMA [ph] network to provide improved processing speed, decreased variability and significant hardware efficiency. This will provide a more consistent trading experience for all of our electronic trading customers with a significantly reduced server footprint while increasing capacity on peak. As we execute our long-term CME Globex strategy, we also maintain focus on cost and efficiency.","To continue improvement and the elimination of legacy systems, we have been able to keep technology-related expenses essentially flat, lowering technology cost as a percentage of total operating expense from approximately 35% in 2008 to approximately 27% this year. Over the last 4 years, the CME technology division has been executing our long-term CME Globex strategy to evolve the trading platform around the customer experience.","We defined a carefully planned roadmap to globalize our infrastructure, provide critical market controls and move to a more efficient and less expensive hardware platform while maintaining the highest levels of reliability, integrity and trust. In that timeframe, we successfully completed the migration of our legacy electronic matching engine to a modern distributed computing platform for increased performance and efficiency. We also built our state-of-the-art next-generation data center and migrated all of CME Globex to prepare for launch of the CME Co-Location Services, which went live early this year.","We have also expanded our global distribution to enable the business growth we have seen internationally with the launch of network hubs in key strategic countries and a global network backbone to efficiently and reliably transmit the network traffic.","Turning to the clearing area. We continue to expand our OTC product offering and remain well positioned to benefit from the regulatory mandate. Earlier this week, the CFTC voted to propose several parts of the interest rate and credit default swaps for the clearing mandate and also finalize the rule on the phasing of the clearing mandate. The proposal on interest rate and credit default swaps marks a significant milestone of mandated clearing. Once it is published in the Federal Register, a 90-day review period will start with the first month including a public comment period.","This proposal also applies to interest rate and credit default swaps and will be followed by energy swap and other asset classes, which will generally follow the same process.","Assuming the proposed and final rules are published in the coming weeks, our current working assumption is the clearing mandate for all or a subset of these interest rate and credit default swaps will be in effect for swap dealers and major buy-side participants in early 2013. The clearing mandate for additional market participants will be phased in over the course of next year.","Also earlier this month, the CFTC passed final product definition, as well as the final rules for the end-user exceptions to the clearing requirement for swaps. Once the long-awaited product definition rules and the rules for implementing the clearing mandate are published in the Federal Register, the clock officially starts for compliance with a host of rules already passed by the CFTC. This progress in rule-making is a key step forward for the CFTC and clears the way for them to finalize the remaining rules.","Several new buy-side firms cleared their first OTC swaps with CME over the last 2 weeks. We have seen a significant increase in firms finalizing their internal OTC clearing readiness and setting up production accounts to prepare for launch.","Importantly, during the second quarter, we finalized our long-term OTC clearing agreements with a major sell side bank for clearing both interest rate swaps and credit default swaps. Of particular note is the global nature of the interest rate swap clearing arrangement, which enables the expansion of our clearing services with this group and other potential partners into Europe and other regions around the world.","To date, we have cleared nearly $700 billion across OTC financial products with $554 billion in rate swap and another $138 billion in credit default swaps. The open interest currently stands at $362 billion, which represents a $52 billion increase since May. We remain the leader in B2C OTC clearing for U.S. clients.","Also during the quarter, we began clearing FX OTC non-deliverable forward trades, further expanding our market-leading OTC solution across multiple asset classes. We continue to work with buy side, sell side and clearing member firms to further develop our overall OTC offering, and FX has become a key priority for clients in the last few months.","As we noted on the last earnings call, we started to provide portfolio managing of OTC interest rate swap positions and Eurodollar and Treasury futures for house accounts on the 7th of May. The risk reduction achieved will result in capital efficiencies of up to 85% for certain portfolios, and this is a number that remains unparalleled in the industry. We expect the same capital benefit should be available for customer accounts prior to the mandatory clearing date.","Shifting to our globalization efforts. We continue to make progress during the quarter. Our processing services revenue has more than doubled to $4.2 million compared to last year, the strongest quarter we have had, and up significantly from Q1. This strong growth was driven mainly by increases from BM&FBOVESPA, Bursa Malaysia and the Korean Exchange.","In addition, looking at the breakdown of trading in CME Group's products on a global basis, we had an 8% increase in Globex trading revenue during the quarter compared to Q1 with the strongest growth coming from Asia and South America, each up more than 20%. We also continue to see improved liquidity throughout the trading date with Globex average trading volume during non-U.S. trading hours up 9% sequentially, while the U.S. trading hours average trading volume grew at 3%.","In summary, this was another challenging quarter for the Financial Services sector. However, we do not let that distract us from positioning the company to build on its industry-leading business by expanding our diverse product offerings while continuing to invest in our global growth strategy. We will continue to remain as efficient as we can with a strong focus on expense discipline, which you saw this quarter.","We continue to generate significant cash flow, and we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. We are well situated to ride out the current weakness and are focusing on positioning ourselves to fully benefit when the current headwinds turn into tailwinds.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jamie to discuss the financials.","James E. Parisi","Thanks, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to review the results of what has been a very productive quarter, while we also continued our focus on efficiency.","We accomplished a lot during the quarter, including the sale of the CBOT building, a smooth CEO transition and the close of our joint venture with McGraw-Hill at the end of June.","I'm going to cover quite a few details, which should assist with modeling going forward.","Many of the activities in the quarter drove nonrecurring items, which are included in our GAAP results and were noted in the earnings release. I will touch on these during my comments.","In addition, we completed a 5 for 1 stock split in July, which is reflected in our results today, for all periods referenced.","Let me start with revenue. As Gill mentioned, the average daily volume was down compared to the second quarter last year. However, volume trended up in the latter part of the second quarter, and in total, increased slightly from Q1. Total revenue came in at $796 million, up 3% from the first quarter.","The rate per contract for the second quarter was $0.812, which was up slightly versus last year and in line with the Q1 rates. Compared to last quarter, the product mix was favorable, offset by unfavorable venue mix and higher volume discounts.","Turning to expenses. Total CapEx spend was $327 million. Excluding the nonrecurring items from the quarter, operating expense would have been $306 million, down $17 million from the first quarter operating expense of $323 million. These items impacted us in the compensation, professional fees and license fee lines.","Starting with compensation and benefits, this line item was $131 million, which included $12 million of contractual payments, including costs associated with the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation associated with Craig's retirement and severance related to the S&P Dow Jones JV, the CBOT building sale, the Korean Exchange transaction and our voluntary exit incentive program.","In addition, due to the 3% decrease in the equity market in Q2, we had a credit of $1.7 million in deferred compensation, which is offset with lower investment income, compared to a $4.1 million of deferred compensation expense in the first quarter.","Our overall headcount went down during Q2 from 2,702 to 2,604, driven by the S&P Dow Jones transaction and the sales of PMA and the CBOT building. Another 110 employees from the S&P Dow Jones transaction will move up the CME payroll in July, bringing the total CME Group number of employees down to approximately 2,500.","Lastly, as mentioned in Q1, we opened an office in Northern Ireland, which is focused on certain technology functions we are augmenting overseas, and our plan is to initially hire between 80 and 90 employees there. This addition of headcount will reduce our overall expense and these individuals will replace existing technology consultants.","Turning to non-compensation expense. There were 2 primary expense categories, which were impacted by the index JV transaction. Within professional fees, we incurred approximately $6 million of success fees related to the deal. Also, within license fees, we will move to a profit-sharing arrangement from a per contract fee, which we discussed when we announced the deal.","Despite closing on the last day of June, we did say a retroactive incremental amount of $3 million for the full impact of the second quarter profit sharing. Our operating margin, excluding the $21 million of expense adjustment, was 61.6%.","Turning to non-operating income for the quarter. We had a net $65 million gain related to the S&P Dow Jones transaction, which is included in our GAAP results. Our tax expense on a GAAP basis totaled $257 million, which includes a $132 million noncash charge to establish deferred tax liability associated with the closing of the S&P Dow Jones JV.","Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $34 million in the second quarter. For 2012, our CapEx expectations remain in the $140 million to $150 million range.","A couple of final comments on modeling. During the second quarter, we recorded approximately $27 million of revenue from the Dow, CMA and real estate businesses, which will not continue going forward. We expect expenses in the second half of the year to drop to $595 million from $629 million in the first half. Several expense items are back-end loaded such as marketing and depreciation.","In addition, based on CFTC rule-making progress around the clearing mandate, our total buildout of the swap -- our potential buildout of the swap data repository and other requirements, we expect higher regulatory and legal-related costs in Q3 and Q4. For Q3 at this point, I would expect expenses to be in the $300 million range.","One final note going forward. We will be recognizing our share of the quarterly income from the JV in non-operating income. An early, rough estimate for the share is $15 million per quarter this year, depending largely on index trading volume and assets under management.","Lastly, we continue to make progress on the tax front, and we are adjusting our tax guidance. For the second half of the year, we expect taxes to come in around 40.5%, down from our prior 41% guidance. Our preliminary estimate for 2013 would be in the 38% to 39% range, down from our prior estimate of 39.5%. And we will update this estimate as appropriate.","Turning to the balance sheet. We had $1.3 million of cash and marketable securities at the end of June, an increase of $230 million from the prior quarter. $149 million of this increase is tied to the sale of the CBOT building.","Keep in mind, we made 2 tax payments during the second quarter versus none in the first quarter and versus one payment in each of the remaining quarters. So a tax payment in Q2 totaled $325 million, and we paid out $150 million in regular quarterly dividend in June. As of mid-July, we had approximately $1.6 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet.","In summary, we accomplished a lot this quarter. We closed the S&P Dow Jones JV. We sold the CBOT building. We finalized our clearing agreements with the major OTC dealers, and we decreased our ongoing expenses. We are taking advantage of the current state of the market to focus on positioning CME Group to capture future growth opportunities and trading excess capital of the business to return to our shareholders.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess the question, the first, I think there's a follow-up. But Jamie, can you just give us the expenses that are coming out with the JV that were attributed to the Dow, CME prior? Because you had $27 million in revenue, it was roughly breakeven?","James E. Parisi","So with the Dow and with JV and the sale of CMA as part of that JV, it's all embedded in the guidance, the expense guidance that I gave you for the second half of $595 million. The area that of that -- those particular ones will impact the most will be on the compensation line, the amortization of intangible line. And on the license fee line, you'll actually see an increase in license fees as a result of that due to that profit sharing that I noted earlier.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then the one follow-up would be, I guess, for Terry and Gill. You went through some good detail in walking through on the OTC expectations, the OTC clearing. And I guess, Gill, you said 1Q '13, if you just did the 3 months, you'd be in November, and I guess the phase is major swap deals in the beginning. Would you see -- expect to see a significant uptick at the end of the year or the first step-up at the end of this year? Or why that delay till later in -- early 2013?","Phupinder S. Gill","I think what you're going to see is the mandate will kick in, it seems, to us in February of next year. What you're going to see, because we're talking about thousands of accounts that are going to come on board, the ramp-up period is definitely going to be in full gear in the fourth quarter of this year. And as I said a short while ago, we are seeing many accounts that are already now preparing to launch. And in the last 2 weeks especially, we've seen activity coming into us. So a safe assumption would be you're going to start seeing mostly serious clearing beginning around the end of the third quarter, and the fourth quarter is going to be very busy for everybody.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I think you're adding 3 months onto sort of the feedback loop that the CFTC get the -- I think that's where the 3 months comes from.","Phupinder S. Gill","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe we'll just stay on the OTC topic for a second here. I think you mentioned that in the quarter, you finalized some of the agreements with the dealers. And I think you said in the past that you're going to be focused more on getting some of the dealer volume, too, even though at LCH, they have a pretty nice sweetheart deal right now. So can you give us any more color on how those discussions are going? Could there still be some sort of restructuring of the agreements with the dealer? It sounds like you've been very aggressive in talking to the dealers in terms of getting some volume over here. So any indications would be great.","Phupinder S. Gill","Sure. This is Gill, and I'll ask Jim to chime in if he has anything to add. I think with the finalization of the agreement with the dealers, it simply formalizes all the activity that has been going on up to this point in time, which both of us have taken on a good-faith basis. I think the dealers will continue to work with the buy sides just like we are working with them and the buy side. And keep in mind, for every one of these, that the buy side, there's a sell side transaction also associated with it. So the dealers are clearing here. And as capital efficiencies become more of an issue, which is actually here, especially when Basel 3 kicks in as a requirement. I think the rational thing to do is to work efficiently to lower the capital.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. Good. And then I don't know if Terry is on, but clearly with some of these customer losses at MF and I guess PFG, there's been more discussions or more noise from you guys in terms of holding some of -- more collateral at the clearing house level and not at the FCM level. So just wondering if you -- in what stage we are if you're engaging with FCM in terms of talking about how this could look, what the reception is? In particular, I think historically, FCM have made like, I don't know, 40%, 60% of their income on interest. So would this change? Or do you think there could still be a way for the FCM model to be fairly similar to how it looks like now from a profitability standpoint and how this could maybe impact friction in the system and trading volumes?","Terrence A. Duffy","Gill, can you hear me? Alex, what I would say to that, and I testified -- I said this yesterday in Washington, is it's just not something that CME wants to do as far as holding the customer funds. We are not trying to impact this soon [ph] or remediate or anything of that nature of their model, realizing very much so that the percentages that you outlined are correct. At the same time, there has been 2 major events in our industry. Some have come to us looking for different solutions. This has been raised. What we had said in the release the other day is that we would have been prepared to work with the industry. We don't have all the mechanisms how it would work, but the important thing is we do not want to disrupt the FCM model. So this would not be a profit generator for CME Group. And again, what we're trying to do is just, again, build the confidence back into the marketplace for the clients, which they deserve. So that's really what we are trying to do here. The last thing we want to do is to have any notion of whether they were trying to disintermediate the FCMs, or holding their customer funds.","Phupinder S. Gill","If I can just add and stress one thing. This is not a proposal, but it is an idea that we floated out there a few days ago with the intended purpose exactly as Terry pointed out. It is very specifically to restore confidence in the marketplace and in our actions. We clearly recognize that the vast majority of our FCMs have done a phenomenal job handling the client funds, and this, in no way, shape, or form, indicts any one of them. This is simply very specifically to restore the confidence that we know has been lost as a result of the rogue actions of 2 firms.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. So way too early to think about any potential timing, I guess.","Phupinder S. Gill","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to get your take on the ongoing LIBOR investigations. And maybe more broadly, when I think about the CME, I think one of the core principles of the company is that you have these great global benchmark products. So how do you go about ensuring you've got that right suite of benchmark products for the next 10, 20 years like you have had for like the last 10, 30 years?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. I'll start, and Derek Sammann who is with us, might want to add. I mean, where the LIBOR is concerned, we expect that it is going to remain the predominant short-term reference point contract. There are issues, as you did note those issues. We are in support of anything that would fix those issues. There's a lot of money that's indexed to that rate now, and CME has, in the past, worked with the BBA, and we will continue to work with the authorities and anybody else to make sure that it continues to be the benchmark on a going-forward basis. Just as a point of note though, it's not the only contract that we have. We have a suite of interest rate products. So as a reference point, we have the vast majority of any potential shifts that might occur. Derek?","Derek Sammann","Yes, that's a good question. Let me jump in also. I think what you're speaking to is our track record of successful product development, so product extensions. And when you look at what we have talked about in the last couple of years, the products we put on a curve, whether it's the Ultra Bond or the Weekly Treasury Options, the Mid-Curve Options, not to mention the service development that you've heard Kim and Gill refer to around the swaps currencies, so we think that as we continue to look at points on the curve and look at various products, various opportunities, we're going to continue to put products out there to speak about client demand, whether it's across the curve, or in terms of different products open to us as a result of OTC clearing. So you'll be hearing more from us. Kim did mention about the cross-margin opportunity for a range complex as a whole in swaps. That was rolled out, as Gill mentioned, on May 7. We're seeing people take up opportunities on that. We hope to have that provided out to customers over the coming months as well. So we look at this as a suite of products and services, and our track record of new product development and product extensions I think puts us in a good place, listening to our clients and putting product ideas out there to serve their needs.","Terrence A. Duffy","Gill, can I jump in for one second?","Phupinder S. Gill","Yes.","Terrence A. Duffy","Howard, what I think is pretty fascinating, too, is I know LIBOR has come under a lot of scrutiny. And I agree with everything Gill and Derek have said. And I do believe that we will remain a preeminent benchmark. And just to add a little bit of credibility to this, some of the people that are crying the loudest are still using it, and that would be the United States federal government. The Fed still uses LIBOR as it makes its loans today. So they use that as a reference point when they make their loans. So I do believe that this will still continue to be the benchmark going forward.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And my follow-up, Jamie, as you and the team begin the 2013 budgeting process, you evaluate working capital needs, you look over the M&A landscape, I was just hoping for your latest thoughts on how much of that cash on the balance sheet, over $700 million in it, you'll sweep and return to shareholders at the end of the year?","James E. Parisi","Yes, sure, Howard. It's hard -- I can't give you an exact answer. There's certainly -- we've been fairly active in doing smaller bolt-on acquisitions. So that will -- we'll use some of that cash for that and continue to do so. But that said, there is a significant amount that we've already generated through the first half of the year. We'll continue to generate through the second half, and we will look to, as we always say, look to return a significant portion of that excess to the shareholders. One thing that we are considering and thinking about is keeping our eye on the tax loss as it relates to that fixed dividend and seeing whether it would make sense to pull it forward into this year if the tax laws progress the way that they are currently written.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up on the customer fund. If we think about like the different options that the industry has, whether the clearing houses, you manage that, or if it's outsourced to a custodian or one of the trust banks, I guess more important because those are 2 different options. But just from the FCM's standpoint, like it's a tough business already. And so if they lose that or the customers have to pay for that, like do you sense that given the changes that are taking place, there's going to be more pressure on like industry trends or like volume trends or pricing trends? Or is there an outcome that can make customers more secure yet there won't be additional pressure on either volumes or pricing?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. I think a couple of assumptions that you have to make, and I think these assumptions are good assumptions. The vast majority of the FCMs that we have are handling the customer funds in the right way. As you rightly point out, it's a straight component. It's a very large part of the business model of the FCMs. It is something that we're extremely sensitive to and have begun conversations with them with respect to how to best handle this confidence issue. It may be the highly restrictive investment policies that are in place now would be a very good engaging factor for these guys. There are several banks, as you might know, that are part of the infrastructure of our system, and those banks may get involved. And so if those banks do get involved, they tend to be considered as an independent third party, and they, instead of us, might be an alternative choice. The important thing, as Terry pointed out a short while ago, is to not change or harm the FCM business model as it exists now. There are -- to your point a short while ago, there are going to be continued pressures on the FCMs, but the 3 big things that we are focused on with respect to this issue is: number one, to restore the confidence; number two, to make sure that the FCMs continue to be able to operate their businesses as they do now; and the third piece, which we have heard from our firms, has been to lower the back office cost for our firms.","Terrence A. Duffy","If I could just add to what Gill said, Michael. I think we have said this historically because it's true. The cheapest part of transactions in the futures industry are the cost of execution. And what drives the real benefits is the type they offer. So even though the cost of trading is down significantly, even if there was an uptick in cost by the FCMs, it would still be a -- the user would still be a main benefit because that is still the lowest cost of the trade. The slippage is where the real big cost comes in. So I don't see that as a real big impediment even if their model was to be impacted and competitively raised up to offset some of their revenue losses.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up with some of the tax rates. So guidance is a little bit lower now. When you look at your options or maybe what you're looking at in terms of how you can lower that over time, is there a lot more to be done? Because obviously, there was the Illinois stuff, but then it seems like for all companies like, you can look around and try to figure out if there's more ways to become more efficient. So I'm just trying to gauge like what inning are you in, in that process, albeit it's an ongoing process?","James E. Parisi","Yes, that's right. It's a good question. It is an ongoing process. We're looking for continuous improvement in the rates. The fact is that the vast majority of our assets and intellectual property and all else has been developed here in the United States. So that really does limit our ability to have any tax placed outside the U.S. A lot of those companies that you do reference that -- have strategies were they have acquired businesses outside the U.S., property outside the U.S. to drive income, that's allocated outside the U.S. Still, cash balances are outside the U.S., but they're not able to repatriate, and therefore, return to shareholders. So there's -- it's a lot of moving parts and a lot of things to consider as we continue analyzing our tax situation. I'd say the biggest potential opportunity for us, I'd say we are the poster child here in the U.S. for a reduction in corporate taxes. So corporate tax reform in the U.S. would be, I'd say, the best potential for us.","Terrence A. Duffy","And just to add to that, Jamie, I think, Michael, when you hear about the fiscal cliff coming at the end of the year and how we're going to deal with that, one of the trading blocks, for lack of a better term, has been the corporate tax rate. And I think the Democratic side of the aisle is that, that's one of the ones that they'd like to use to modify to get other revenues up on other sides. So to Jamie's point, that could be our biggest benefit because that could be the one they could use to trade.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies & Company.","Surinder Thind - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Surinder Thind calling in for Dan Fannon. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the voluntary exit program. You mentioned -- it went by really quickly. There was about 100 or so individuals in terms of the headcount reductions. Was that part of the exit program? And is that program come to an end at this point? Or what is the status of that?","James E. Parisi","Yes. The program, we implemented it last quarter, and it\u2019s done in terms of people subscribing to it. Most folks that are still on the payroll and are subscribed, they're going to transition off over the coming months. I'd say on the decrease that you saw in headcount in this quarter was really driven by the CMA and other -- to settle the CMA business. Some of the Dow Jones headcount came off this quarter. More to come next quarter. And we also, obviously, have been trying to keep it as efficient as we can across our core. So really, we haven't seen a decrease from the voluntary incentive program yet in terms of headcount. It is a -- I'd say the number is a more modest number.","Terrence A. Duffy","And Jamie, isn't it fair to say that their first available date for these folks to do it is August 15?","James E. Parisi","Yes, that's right. Yes.","Surinder Thind - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we should start seeing some modest additional headcount come down. And as a follow-up, I just want to talk a little bit about the open interest. And so we've seen the open interest come down a fairly significant amount from earlier in the year, and it seems most of that is from the -- within the interest rate complex. And so it seems there's been a lot of volatility. Can you talk a little bit about some of the factors that have been driving the open interests? And is that something that's just given the current condition, that's just kind of remain volatile and we have to wait for interest rates to start moving up? Or maybe some thoughts around that.","Derek Sammann","Sure. This is Derek. Thanks for your question. I think you're seeing a lot of this driven by the rates environment right now. I mean, you've heard us talk to you over the last couple of quarters about what's going on in the kind of the Front 2 contracts or the first 2 years of Eurodollars versus the Back 8. We're continuing to see in what we call the whites and the reds, or year 1 and year 2, both volumes and OI continue to contract. Certainly, what you saw on June 20, when the Fed announced the additional $400 billion in Twist and most likely pushing out rate rises out into late 2014, early 2015, that's continuing to be a drag on the very front of the Eurodollar curve. What we are seeing, and we've seen this trend for the last 18 months, and Gill referred to this, is we are still seeing good growth in years 3, 4 and 5. Now that being said, it's not fully offsetting the dropoffs in both volumes and open interest in years 1 and 2. Where we are seeing strong growth in open interest is both foreign exchange and agricultural products, and this is really driven by -- you saw a lot of the risk on appetite going into the Greek elections over the course of the first couple of weeks in June. We hit multiple open interest records at about 2.3 million contracts on June 7. We're also seeing significant growth in the ag complex. Volumes are up, and open interest is up, and that's clearly indicated to us that the market's continuing to come to CME and risk manage on the basis of what's going on here. So rates up. If you look at the 2012, the full year, June is up 7%. Rates were up 6%. Equities were up 21%. We haven't spoken much about equity so far. Energy at 3%. And as we mentioned, ag and metals up 17% and 18%. So I think we are seeing the bulk of the dropoff from the front end of the Eurodollar curve. We are making part of that up in the middle part of the curve, but it's not fully offsetting.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And if I could go back to the regulatory reform, we're so much further along than we were 2 years ago, but as well as that, I guess we saw the recent reports, the reports that IEF and whatnot about collateral for these non-paired derivatives. And I'm asking because where are you feeling now about the risk that the OTC markets just shrink too much in that it doesn't kind of get diverted into futures but the overall pie just shrinks? How do you think that risk has changed? Are you seeing any change in activity from your customers? And then I guess alongside that regulation, are you starting to see maybe some of the activity in the people yet top off at non-bank stops?","Phupinder S. Gill","In terms -- let me take the first bit, and Kim might want to add. We have not seen a -- we have not had any positive indication as to the market shrinking at this time. What we are preparing for, I would say, and this would be consistent with respect to how other exchanges would think about the world, you're going to end up in 1 of 3 places, where OTC trades may become more efficient to be done because of the cleared nature of these trades. So you may see actually more of these swap trades, which is very correspondingly very positive for the futures. You may also see a futuristic environment where futures become more efficient, or you may see the market as it exists now, which is positive again on both sides as capital efficiencies with the gross margin offset that we provide become the norm. So there are, essentially, these are 3 ways in which we believe the market is going to evolve. With respect to the second part of your question, you're talking about the profit traders in the banks that may be coming up?","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes. They have reemerged in shops. Either they have joined some shops or they have formed their own funds and they have started to actually clear. Kim, do you have anything to add?","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And Kim, if I could have my follow-on. The cash, you said you're at 1.6 billion in July so far. And thanks for the information about watching the tax rate changes that you could bring that annual variable forward to this year if the tax rates are likely to change. But could you update me on how much cash you need to keep on the balance sheet now that you've got this fixed move designation? And is it still around $750 million that you feel you need to operate and everything over that is excess?","James E. Parisi","Yes, this is Jamie. We're still at the $700 million range. We're keeping an eye, see how some of the capital requirements develop. But we're -- right now, we're comfortable with the $700 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could update me on your outlook for M&A, I guess how CME is viewing M&A right now? And particularly in light of the loan melt's [ph] exchange-bidding process, it was rumored that you guys were participating in that process. So any color you can add there would be useful.","James E. Parisi","Yes, sure. This is Jamie. Our view hasn't changed all that much. I'd say we're still -- we still don't see much in the way of major significant M&A around the globe for all the reasons that we've gone through before. There will be opportunities for smaller-size, I'd say, or medium-size like you saw with LME to come take a look and review the opportunity. So we'll continue to be opportunistic, but our view really hasn't changed, and we'll continue to be very disciplined in our approach.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Then my follow-up question. The farmers and ranchers fund that you guys said you were going to make available in light of the Peregrine issue, do you have an early read on how much that might actually be utilized?","James E. Parisi","Yes. This is Jamie again. It's obviously a very important constituency. And we did open up the fund, as you pointed out, for those impacted at Peregrine. And our early read on it is that the impact on CME is not a material impact to our financials.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, on the Bush-era tax cuts, they are set to expire at the end of the year. You mentioned that you might move the dividends forward, but you're a big tax -- sorry, big dividend payer. In a world with upwards of 40% tax rate on dividends, does that change your view on your capital return policy? Or is it -- do you think it's still a good idea to do dividends over buybacks?","James E. Parisi","I think it's something that we're certainly going to evaluate. We'll analyze it. We'll talk with our Board about it. And as that develops, certainly we would inform the markets.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Then on the crude oil option side, ICE seems to be taking business away from CME. How are you responding to this? And is there a way to stop or slow the pace of attrition?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. I think in all our markets, as we face competition, we have to respond, and we are doing exactly that.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you let us know like are there tactics that you're using? Because I think their market share has gone from like 15% to 30%. Do your tactics -- are you adopting them? Or can you share with us what you're doing?","Phupinder S. Gill","I think if you look some of the things that I've said earlier on, we are introducing CME Direct. And that just launched a short while ago. There are certain incentives that we have put in place. And those have taken hold. If you look at the performance of our options market, particularly in the last few months, a lot of that volume has started to come back to us in terms of the fundamentals. There are certain fundamentals that are driving the oil markets back to its TI, and I think if you look at where the options market is going, the incentives that are put in place, the system solutions that we put in place would all contribute to growing the market for CME, including bringing some of the volume, if not all of it, back. I think some of us compete on the basis of price and some of us compete on the basis of the value that we add on the portfolio basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just talk about the sequential decline in market data and information services? You obviously had the price increase in the first quarter. Wondering if there's any pullback in users, or was there something else driving that?","James E. Parisi","Yes, this is Jamie. Good question. We do continue to see some diminishment in the number of terminals out there. And I think it's really driven by cost cutting on the street as people are looking to become more efficient. They're always looking to reduce their terminals. That's one of the areas they can do it. You're seeing this across all the exchanges, actually. But that said, the price increases that we've been able to put through over the last several years have been outpacing the decrease in the terminals. And we would expect that as -- when market starts to repair and there's more hiring going on, then we'll start -- we'll see those terminals come back out.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then I just want to make sure I have the math correct in terms of the impact of the index business. So roughly $27 million is coming out of revenues. I mean, some expenses have already come out. And then another $6 million, basically, sequentially next quarter, offset by a $15 million increase. So if we kind of think about it from where we are from Q2, it's about a $6 million hit sequentially, is that correct?","James E. Parisi","Yes. I'm sorry, you're tying it to off the -- you confused me a bit there. Can you go through it again with the -- you were tying it to the index business? Or were you just more general?","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess it's a little bit more general just in terms of the guidance. $27 million coming out of the revenues we saw this quarter, which includes the index business at CME. Expense guidance of $6 million down sequentially, offset by $15 million in other non-operating income from the JV. So netting it all together, like $6 million sequentially, is that kind of correct?","James E. Parisi","Yes, you got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz with Stifel Nicolaus.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","If we can just go back to the interest rate business for a moment. Trading activity has fallen off pretty sharply here in July following the brief recovery you saw in the back half of 2Q. I'm just wondering if this is at all LIBOR related on the Eurodollar side. That seems to be where most of the weakness is coming from. And then also just kind of what you're seeing out there in terms of customer engagement in the overall rate complex in light of all the moves being made by the Fed and then whether you still anticipate the influx of new business from swaps users.","Derek Sammann","Yes, this is Derek. I'll pick that one up. Yes, we haven't seen any direct correlation of the conversations around LIBOR directly impacting Eurodollar. What we're seeing is a continuation of the trend we've seen for 18 months, which is the Front 2 quarter, the Front 2 annuals, the whites and the reds or year 1, year 2 dropping off both in volume and ADV terms being partially offset by years 3, 4 and 5. So there is a couple of data points also I'll let you in. When you look at the growth of the 3-, 4- and 5-year, for example, we're actually now seeing significant growth with all the golds, which is the fifth year. In fact, on July 6, we just hit a record of 340,000 contracts in the Gold Mid-Curve Options. And this is the story that we told you a year ago in terms of what we're seeing from the blues. And that was falling from the greens. So what we're seeing, really interest and volatility further pushing out the curve, following Twist, following the expectations that weaker global economies will most likely push this further out, forcing that impact on the front end of the Eurodollar curve. In terms of the client's acquisition opportunities, you've heard each one of us talk about the clearing opportunities and across the margin offsets. We're also looking at the impact of the 1-day versus 5-day margin they may [ph] set up by CFTC. And what we're looking at is as we are seeing rules, clarifications, as we're seeing definitions lock down and now service starting at the cost for Q1 kick off, what we're actually seeing is using opportunities to talk to customers, not just about clearing but the potential to migrate customers directly in the future. So many of our conversations are walking into firms to talk about how we can provide OTC clearing for you as a direct result of the mandate, but we're using that opportunity to introduce futures in the equation as well. It's one of the scenarios that Gill talked about as an opportunity set for us. So if we see this in conjunction with the growth of our global sales force and what we've created and talked to you guys about in the last 18 months, as client acquisition opportunities, we're leveraging our broader suite of services beyond just exchange-rate derivatives and then the benefits across margin that accrue right now at house accounts, and we hope to have those accrued clients over the course of the coming months.","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. I just want to emphasize something that Derek mentioned, which is that the gross margin future that we are offering here is unique in the sense that it is not replicated, not able to be replicated by anybody. So you can't offer lower price here to get gross margin offsets, for example. You need the open interest. And that's what we have here. And as more of the swap trades come onboard, it becomes more capital efficient for our client base to actually put that rate here.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. So it looks like you expect about $60 million of annual pretax income from the new index JV. I'm just wondering if you can remind us what your total capital outlay was for your share of the business and what kind of ROIC you're targeting on that investment?","James E. Parisi","The total capital outlay, when we originally bought the Dow, was in the $600 million range. And we typically look to get a return on our capital in the, call it, 10% to 12% range, usually a little in excess of the 10% to 12%. They're kind of a hurdle.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Ditmire with Macquarie.","Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research","It does seem that the -- let me just put this question. On the LIBOR issue, I understand crystal clear that CME is committed to helping the LIBOR standard improve and continue as a global benchmark. But if due to situations out of your control, the market moved away from LIBOR, could you confirm that you guys would be able to adjust the contract specifications of the Eurodollar future and leverage the incumbent liquidity of your very deep franchise with whatever short-term interest rate standard the market wanted to use?","Phupinder S. Gill","All right. This is Gill. I'll start and then I'll let Derek to add some details. This contract is too important for us not to continually adjust it or pay attention to it. It's one of the flagship contracts that CME has.","Derek Sammann","Yes, I think that's a great point. And I would say we're continuing looking at ways that we can adjust, affirm and certainly streamline any other major products that we trade, particularly our benchmark products. And we would probably point to the CFTC's order and statements made a number of weeks ago as to the impact in the import that the global regulators are placing on, making sure that this remains a robust market mechanism for the long term to come. I would also just note that not only, as Gill mentioned, do we have our Eurodollar contracts but our Treasuries contracts and our Fed funds futures, which are trading about 30,000 contracts a day, and that's a product that already has significant open interest, about 500,000 contracts in the futures and about another 300,000 contracts in options outstanding as well. So not only do we have an existing suite of products beyond just Eurodollar and the certain [ph] complex, we also think that level of imports placed by the federal regulators, I think, just only enhances the long-term viability of this product over time.","Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research","Okay. On the JV, when you guys announced the deal last year, I think you guys said that you expect the deal to be breakeven. It seems to me that the numbers say that it's not quite breakeven on a run rate basis right now in 2012. Is that accurate? And if that's true, is it because the Dow Jones portion of the business had been doing better than the S&P portion of the business going into the deal?","James E. Parisi","No, I think you're right. It's not quite accretive in the way we've laid it out here for you. Something to consider is that over time, the equity market's been under pressure, assets under management have fallen, that sort of thing. The other thing to consider is that the deal is both an investment and a JV but also extending our license fee agreement with them. And anytime you go to negotiate and extend the license fee agreement, almost by definition that, that negotiation will end up in a dilutive transaction, if you already have that book of business right, as they look to raise rates and that sort of thing. So in some sense, dilution is tied to the licensing side of it. But I think long-term benefits and locking up -- locking down that license for as long as we own the JV. And the dilution here is really very -- not at all material to the overall CME Group.","Operator","And we have time for final question, and that comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","One more follow-up question on the rates for Derek. As we move into 2013, can you comment on what your expectation is for being able to convert users of the OTC swaps into exchange rate? Obviously, you've  been having those conversations for some time but probably you're not seeing it in volumes yet. I guess let me know if you think we are seeing it in the current volumes. What's your conviction that you'll be able to convince those users as we move into 2013? And about when do you think we'll start to see the impact of that on a rate complex?","Derek Sammann","Yes. So I think what we're really going to focus on is what we're doing and how we're positioning ourselves on the OTC clearing side. This is a new opportunity to be able to access and expand our customer base with a broader suite of services. This is about customer choice. This is about providing the customer the option in terms of the product of choice, the risk tool of choice and the source of the choice and the risk mitigants. We've talked about the ability to walk in and talk to a customer about the suite of services and the cross-margining capabilities available to that customer. That's highly attractive to customers that are already trading our futures and trade swaps already, and this is an opportunity to be able to really put the focus on the clearing side of the business and represent ourselves to provide the best of those clearing services into that customer base. With a clarity of the definitions coming through over the last couple of weeks and starting to clock for what we believe to be a mid-Q1 implementation and take-up, as you've heard Gill talk about before early in the conversation, they are beyond the sea of clients that are clearing in a pre-mandate world with us right now. There's a significant number of clients that are already through -- that have completed the testing phase and are simply waiting for the day to kick off. So we see that beginning to ramp up over the course of Q4, and we see -- at a pre-mandate point, I think you'll see a more significant jump in terms of those that have simply said, \"I'll do everything I have to, to be prepared but will most likely do very little until the day that I have to clear.\" So we're spending our time with the customers, making sure that they are ready and able at the point where it puts over.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then my follow-up would be just on expense flexibility. A question for Jamie. If we are in a tougher volume environment, near term, how do you think about near-term expense control versus some of the expenditures for some of the longer-term growth initiatives? Do we have material flexibility to reduce the current guidance from 595 in the second half?","James E. Parisi","I'd say we have -- there's obviously a lot of operating leverage in our business model that cuts both ways, right. So it's very difficult to naturally decrease expenses as volumes are not as strong as they've been in the past. But you have seen us taking a lot of -- making a very strong effort to be very disciplined. We'll continue to do that if there is a point. There are a couple of items that are volume-related in our expenses. Licensee fee and incentive program expense obviously fall under that category as does our bonus. And there is a point at which the bonus hits the cliff where if we perform below a certain level of 20% below our target for the year, that there will be no bonus payments. So that's a natural mitigant. But other than that, I'll say that we'll just -- we're going to continue to be as disciplined as possible while also keeping our eye on the future. This is -- for us, we view this as a cyclical downturn, and we're operating in that mindset.","Operator","And at this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers.","Phupinder S.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to John Peschier. Please go ahead, sir.","John C. Peschier","Thank you, and thank you, all, for joining us. Craig, Gill and Jamie will make some introductory comments, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. Terry, Bryan Durkin and Kim Taylor are on the call as well.","Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language. Statements made on this call and in the accompanying slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","Detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K, which is on our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Craig.","Craig Steven Donohue","Thank you, John. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before I turn this over to Gill to review our first quarter performance, I wanted to just say that our succession transition has been going extremely well. As I'm sure everyone appreciates, the close working relationship and teamwork between me, Gill and Terry over these last 9 years is making this transition very easy. Since the announcement of my retirement, we have been, and are continuing to transition internal responsibilities. We've also been spending time with our customers, partners and industry colleagues to ensure a smooth hand-off in areas where I was playing a more active role. ","Given our exceptional progress, I would expect that the formal part of my transition can be completed very soon, and likely prior to our annual shareholder meeting. This will give us the ability to accelerate Gill's assumption of the CEO role and ensure that we keep moving forward with purpose on the execution of our global growth strategy. ","Given that this will be my last earnings call, I want to thank each and every one of you for your friendship and support during this last 8.5 years. I will miss interacting with you, but wish all of you and my CME Group colleagues much continued success. CME Group is a strong institution with great people, great products and great partners, and I will enjoy watching the company thrive and prosper with your continued support and Gill and Terry's leadership. With that, I'll turn it over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you, Craig. The CME Group has certainly been blessed to have had Craig at the helm over the past 8.5 years. ","During -- I'm on to the report now. During the first quarter, global trading volumes were impacted by low levels of volatility. The uncertainty about market direction has lead to greater focus on the release of economic data that measured the overall health of the economy. While concerns remain, there are some positive signs that an improving economy would bode well for our product set as the trading community responds to better news. ","With that as a backdrop, I'm going to spend my time today talking about the areas that are well within our control. And those include product technology and clearing offerings. We have accomplished a great deal during the first 90 days of the year. Let me provide you with some examples. First, in terms of products, a couple of takeaways. Our volume has been muted, we are performing fairly well compared to our peers in several product areas; and second, we have seen a nice pick-up in open interest, which has jumped by 16% from year-end 2011 to 90.5 million contracts. Lastly, we continue to lead the industry with the breadth of our product innovation and our global relationships. ","Interest rate volume was down from a year ago, but down significantly less than our European peers. Although volumes, for us, have been hindered on the short end, it is important to note the deepened liquidity in the middle of the curve has helped. For example, at the beginning of 2011, we launched Mid-Curve Options on year 4, the so-called blue Mid-Curve Options. This contract averaged almost 250,000 contracts per day in March and was very active as volatility picked up temporarily. ","Another important innovation was our weekly treasury options, which continue to gain traction each quarter. On Thursday, March 8, in anticipation of the non-farm payroll report, we traded 78,000 contracts and it has become a popular gamma product for our trading economic events. These new products build on the success we had 2 years ago, with our Ultra Bond offering. In addition, longer-dated treasuries, the 10s, the long bonds and the Ultras, are going faster than shorter-dated treasuries. Bottom line here is while others have created look-alike products of our benchmarks, it created new rates products, which are generating revenue and serve as important tools for our customers. ","On to FX. FX daily Volume was down, primarily due to government intervention in Japan and Switzerland and uncertainty related to the Euro. CME Group's emerging market currencies, which have been a major focus area for us, were up 20% year-over-year. Our total FX open interest exceeded the all-time record set in 2007, 9x in March. Most importantly, March marks the all-time high in CME Group value traded relative to the current FX market leader, with CME Group reaching approximately 96% of EBS volume. ","Within equities, open interest has jumped 18% from year-end 2011. While down, volumes in our Equity products outperformed the other most actively traded index futures products around the world. Volatility was low during the quarter, with the VIX averaging 18 relative to 30 in Q4, 2011. So within financial products at CME, we are performing well relative to our peers. ","We have been quite active in terms of innovation in our agricultural product area. We recently announced the launch of CBOT Black Sea Wheat Futures to begin training on June 6, subject of course to regulatory approval. This is an important next step for CME Group as it relates to our new market development efforts in Eastern Europe. In addition, along with the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, we launched the MGEX-CBOT Wheat Spread Options. ","Within metals, similar to some to the financial products, we have seen a pick-up in open interest, primarily gold, which was up 10% compared to the end of 2011. We have seen continued growth in metals volumes traded during non-U.S. hours, which has jumped from 21% of electronic volume in Q1 '09 to 27% in Q1 2012. ","Of note, copper trading has increased significantly so far in 2012, the most pronounced pick-up occurring in electronic activity during Asian trading hours. Average daily volumes for copper products increased more than 40% versus Q1 of last year, and now represents more than 15% of our metals volume. Interest in copper has been driven by the supply\/demand picture, as well as in the interest in trading copper on the basis of economic growth in Asia, with China becoming the largest consumer. ","In addition, we also added to our OTC offering by announcing the April 30 launch of Aluminum Swap Futures, based on the Platts index. Increasing industrial demand from Asia and growing competition for resources had lead to increased price volatility in some raw materials. ","Within energy, the main driver of the quarter was the strength in natural gas and we had an all-time high in revenue on CME ClearPort. While the WTI\/Brent spread widened a bit during the quarter, we believe that the reversal of the Seaway pipeline, which will be operational in May, is an initial factor which should help narrow the spread by relieving supply stock in Cushing. Over the last month, concerns about the situation in Iran have decreased and the spread has tightened. ","From a longer-term perspective, we increased our investment in the Dubai Mercantile Exchange from 28% to 50%. Our goal is to build this product into 1\/3 crude oil benchmark that appeals to traders in Asia. Increased trading volumes and wider acceptance of the contracts should encourage producers and buyers of Middle Eastern oil to adopt it as a benchmark for long-term crude sales to Asia. ","We are pleased to see some very encouraging early signs with a record DME Crude electronic volume day yesterday of 13,000 contracts, as well as expecting April to be the fourth consecutive record trading month. ","Turning now to the clearing area. Our OTC clearing momentum has continued as customers have huge -- utilized our multi-asset class platform well ahead of the regulatory mandate. To date, more than 1,800 buy side accounts have cleared more than $515 billion in total notional in IRS and Credit Default Swaps, with $283 billion cleared during Q1. In addition, the pipeline is expanding with 2,500 additional accounts currently testing with us and 15 of our intermediaries. We are viewed as the leader in D-to-C OTC clearing in the U.S., clearing more business in Q1 than we did in all of 2011. ","In rate swaps, we now offer and clear the top 7 currencies, which represent 95% of the vanilla interest rates swap market clearable at CME. Earlier this month, we successfully added Australian Dollars, Swiss Francs and Japanese Yen. We remain focused on expanding this business globally and we plan to launch OTC interest rate swap clearing through CMECE later this year. ","We will provide portfolio margining of OTC interest rate swap positions in Eurodollar and Treasury Futures house accounts beginning on May 7. The risk reduction achieved will result in capital efficiencies of up to 85%. These are figures that remain unparallel in the industry. We expect the same capital benefits to be available for customer accounts prior to the mandatory clearing date. Based on recent comments by the CFTC, our working assumption for the initial phase of mandatory swaps clearing is in the October, November time period for swap dealers, major swap participants and active hedge funds, while smaller banks and asset managers will potentially follow in early next year.","In terms of technology, we had a seamless launch of our co-location services at the end of January, which took considerable effort by our technology and operations group. Based on strong demand, we expect to open the second phase of the facility for customers in the second quarter of next year. We will give more clarity on the additional revenue opportunity later this year.","Shifting to our global efforts. In terms of Q1 trading volume, we continue to see faster growth from customers outside the U.S. Our overall electronic volume in Q1 was up 3% sequentially, with U.S. volume up 2%, while volume from Asia and Europe each jumped 10%. We have made significant headway with educational efforts, particularly in Asia, and as we mentioned last quarter, we have a healthy pipeline of new Asian intermediaries, which we plan to leverage. ","During the quarter, we signed on with the Bank of China to explore and collaborate in the long-term business relationship that will harness the strength of both organizations to provide mutual benefits as both parties grow their global businesses. These efforts include commercial banking and collateral management activities with BOCI's Hong Kong, London and U.S. branches, as well as potential product offerings. ","We've also further expanded our relationship with BM&FBOVESPA by implementing a cross listing and cross licensing agreement. Under the arrangement, Ibovespa, the main Brazilian stock index, will be listed and cleared by CME Group as U.S. dollar denominated Ibovespa futures. BM&F will launch S&P 500 index futures to be settled in Brazilian real along with WTI futures. ","In summary, it was a busy first quarter for us and we continue to execute on our plans to position the company for the long- term in an efficient way. Looking out a few quarters and into the next year, we expect much of the uncertainty related to Dodd-Frank to be mostly behind us. We expect our OTC globalization and non-transaction related opportunities to continue to take flight . We are optimistic the U.S. economy will continue to progress in the right direction. It should bode well for our product set and the confidence of the cautious trading community. ","Now, I will turn the call over to Jamie to discuss the financials.","James E. Parisi","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to review the results of the quarter and then I'll talk a little bit about our focus on efficiency from a financial perspective. ","Let we start with revenue. While average daily volume jumped 5% compared to the fourth quarter, ADV was down 11% versus the same quarter a year ago when we posted exceptionally strong quarterly average daily volumes due to the impact of significant unrest in the Middle East and the natural disaster in Japan. ","Rate per contracts for the first quarter was $0.811, which was up slightly from the first quarter last year and the same as the RPC in Q4. Looking at the sequential comparison, various mix-related items offset each other. Product mix was slightly positive to the rates and that was offset by a negative venue mix and member\/non-member mix, as member volumes grew faster than non-member volumes. ","In terms of non-volume related revenue, we saw a 12% increase in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase in market data revenue and the addition of co-location, which launched at the end of January. Total co-location revenue during Q1 was $9.7 million, offset slightly by decreases in other connectivity offerings as customers migrated to co-lo. This revenue is found in the access and communication fees line.","Total expense was $323 million for the quarter, up about $4 million compared with the fourth quarter, excluding MF Global items from last year. Turning with Compensation and Benefits expense, this line item was $135 million following the typical higher first quarter seasonal pattern, due to a jump in the FICA and the vacation accrual areas, along with our merit and promotion increases for employees, which typically hit in February. ","These 3 areas accounted for an increase of $11.4 million from the fourth quarter. In addition, due to the 12% increase in the equity market in Q1, we've booked $4.1 million in deferred compensation expense, which is offset in investment income and was $2 million more than Q4. Modeling purposes, typically every 3% change, up or down, in quarterly equity market value will drive about $1 million of expense in this category. ","We saw a reduction in headcount during Q1 of approximately 35 positions from 2,737 to 2,702. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $3 million of severance expense as we recognized -- as we reorganize certain functions. In total, the seasonal accruals, deferred compensation and severance related costs resulted in a $15 million increase from the fourth quarter. ","In addition, we announced internally that we will be offering a voluntary exit incentive plan to a select group of employees, and we will likely provide some detail on this next quarter. At this point, it is difficult to quantify based on the uncertainty of acceptance and the potential to backfill some of the positions. ","Lastly, we are currently in the process of opening an office in Northern Ireland, which is initially focused on certain technology functions we are augmenting overseas. Our plan is to initially hire between 80 and 90 employees there, which will eventually allow us to reduce consulting costs. ","In terms of non-compensation expense, in Q1, we recorded $190 million compared to $203 million in Q4 and $185 million in Q1 of 2011. Some specific items to focus on there. We spent approximately $3 million during the first quarter on the index joint venture with S&P, down a bit from the fourth quarter. We had the strongest ClearPort quarter in our history with approximately $83 million of revenue, which increased the ClearPort rebates by $2.4 million sequentially. This is reflected in the license fee line. In addition, co-lo was operational in February and resulted in an incremental to $1.3 million related to depreciation, utilities and maintenance versus Q4. ","Turning to non-operating income. Last year, during the first quarter, we received dividends totaling $17 million, which included $2.7 million from an investment in IMAREX to $14 million from BVMF. This year, we received $6.6 million in dividends from BVMF, which is paid at the discretion of their board. Our tax rate came in at 38.6%, which included a one-time favorable adjustment. We expect our effective tax rate to come in at 41% for the remainder of the year, which represents the lower end of our original guidance for 2011. ","Turning to the balance sheet, we had $1.1 billion of cash and marketable securities at the end of March, following the $147 million regular quarterly dividend and the $200 million annual variable dividend, both paid in March. You may have seen the news earlier this week about our sale of the CBOT building. The total sales price was approximately $151.5 million. And based on using some capital losses associated with other portions of our business, we expect to retain more than $145 million of the proceeds. ","Capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $30 million in the first quarter. In 2012, our CapEx expectations are in the $140 million to $150 million range. A couple of final comments on expenses. For the remainder of the year, the sales of the CBOT building will reduce expenses by approximately $15 million with a similar amount of revenue eliminated. ","All else equal, we expect second quarter expense to drop by approximately $10 million from the first quarter, driven primarily by a reduction in compensation and building-related costs. Lastly, we expect to close the Dow and S&P contraction during the third quarter and we will provide additional clarity on the impacts for this and the voluntary exit program at that time.","In summary, we are very focused on being as efficient as we can to maximize the results while also investing in long-term growth areas like co-location, globalization and OTC clearing. ","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Anyway, my first question is, so on the expense side, Jamie, the $10 million reduction, can you break that out a little bit with what's going on between the building versus the comp, because the building has the revenue offsets. And just in general on the expenses. You did mention this voluntary exit incentive. If volumes stayed where they are, would you be looking at greater expense reductions over the course of the year?","James E. Parisi","So in terms of the $10 million reduction for the next -- that we anticipate for the next quarter, a lot of that is driven by -- on the comp side, as I said. There's a lot of -- seasonally, Q1 is typically very high for the reasons that I pointed out. Also, as you look at the buildings, you're going to see impacts in the occupancy line and depreciation line and to a lesser extent, the professional fees line. Those will be the key areas where that impacts going forward. And I would take  that -- the $15 million of savings that I talked about, and pretty much prorate that over the period from the sale date forward. In terms of overall expense, I think we've been pretty clear all along that we believe that the current situation in terms of volume is cyclical and as a result, we want to be judicious in terms of our expense discipline and not cut into muscles that we end up spending even more later on down the road. So that said, based on the guidance that I gave last quarter, to me, it's kind of clear that expenses moved somewhat as volumes increase or decrease, but those expense changes are much smaller than the revenue changes obviously, as you would expect in a model like ours where there's a lot of operating leverage. So if volumes were to remain at current level, which is down roughly 10% or so versus the prior year, I would expect that our expenses might grow around 1%. But then when you include the building in there, the impacts of the building is likely flat versus the prior year. Remember that the key drivers here, in terms of expense variability as volumes change, are going to be the bonus and the license fees, and those numbers I'm giving you roughly up ones are flat are -- exclude the impact from the disposition of the CMA and Dow and the voluntary exit program. The other thing to think about too is, on the bonus side, there's a certain level when we're more than 20% below our cash earnings target, where there's a cliff and that bonus expense just totally goes away. But that -- we're not close to that level yet. The other thing to talk think about as you're thinking about the expenses for the coming year. We did enter this year with a conscious effort on everybody's part to limit or reduce expenses wherever we can. And you just can look at the baseline expense growth in the slides that we have to see that. And you can also see that we've already been actively managing our staffing growth as I've talked about, flat growth from Q3 to Q4, and then down 35 positions from Q4 to current. Now we're going to continue to look for efficiencies wherever possible, like the fill, the building, the opening of the Northern Ireland office, the voluntary program. And some of the benefits of these programs aren't necessarily going to be all realized this year. There's going to be some upfront costs associated with some them, so that's all worked in there. We're working as hard as we can to reduce expenses.","Phupinder S. Gill","Rich, this is Gill, if I can just add to what Jamie was saying. As you could tell from what he said, the leadership of the firm is extremely focused on expense -- disciplined both in the short term, as well as long term, and while continuing to position us for continued growth.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Howard Chen from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just my follow-up -- sorry, my first question is on the CBOT building sale proceeds. Do you expect those to go towards the dividend, maybe some share repurchase as the stock remains weak? Or allocate it towards something else, Jamie?","James E. Parisi","I think we're going to be very consistent with what we've said in the prior call in terms of any -- at the end of this year, we're going to look back and see what cash we've got on the balance sheet and review whether or not it make sense for us to do that -- the variable dividends for next year. And that will -- these proceeds will play into that.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just my follow-up question, maybe one for Kim or Gill, is on OTC clearing. We can certainly see the nice pick-up in volumes ahead of mandatory clearing requirements. But I'm just curious what if anything you're seeing or hearing as the Moody's review becomes kind of up front of mind in both the clients and the dealers. Are you seeing any kind of acceleration in activity or conversations around that potential event for the dealers.","Phupinder S. Gill","I'll start, Howard, and Kim might want to add since she's on the ground with this issue. I think what you're seeing, particularly now, is more and more clients are testing. It's not on-boarding with us because in recent conversations with the CFTC, the expectation is that mandatory clearing would be here before the end of the year. And there's a certain amount of excitement, particularly as it relates to the cross margin offset where we are in the best position to provide the most efficient margining offsets, both for initially the house account and by the third or fourth quarter of this year, the whole business when we extend it to the client account. Kim, do you have anything to add?","Kimberly S. Taylor","I think you've rightly identified that counter-party credit concerns are one of the issues that customers look at when they're thinking about moving their business to the cleared environment ahead of the mandate. SO I think that, that will continue to be the case as people evaluate the aftereffects of the Moody's downgrade. I think, also, there are a couple of factors, the downgrade being potentially one, and I think further work developing the capital costs associated with Basel 3 and some of the banks that will also be starting to drive some interest and perhaps more B2B, as well.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So it sounds like on the call, in your comments, you referenced yourselves as a leading dealer to client OTC clear in the U.S. And I mean that's definitely the case that also kind of highlights the fact that there's not a whole lot of dealer-to-dealer going on in your market. So I just wanted to kind of get an update on what piece of the market you're really going after. Are you happy being a dealer-to-client solution, or do you think it's possible and do you want to get some of that dealer-to-dealer volume? If so, what do you do to go after that?","Phupinder S. Gill","Jillian, this is Gill. I'll start again, and Kim might want to add. From our perspective, as you know, the sweet spot for us currently, is the dealer-to-client side where we have been appealing to the buy side who have expressed some concerns with respect to counter-party risk, and so they have come on board pretty much very enthusiastically from a capital efficiency point of view to the extent that they continue having the momentum of the D-to-C trades that we have been seeing. It becomes, I think, very capital efficient for the dealers themselves to basically pass a lot more out their to all of their trades at the CME in order to achieve that capital efficiencies that they can't otherwise get. So our expectation is that over time, you would see a healthy balance between the D-to-C trades, as well as the D-to-D. So our ambition is, if you will, is to harness both of those activities. But currently, we are seeing very, very strong activity on the D-to-C-to-C side.","Kimberly S. Taylor","And I think I would only add, just a follow-up to something that Gill had already mentioned. In addition to tracking the client business and thereby making it efficient for the dealers to put their offsetting transaction here, we're very focused on being capital efficient for the dealers in general. The first thing that's coming in that regard for countries is the risk offset between the dealers future positions here and the interest rate and the interest rate swaps that they have. And on some of the estimates, there are let's say, significant collateral cost associated with them.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Just as a follow-up, you guys mentioned you're going to be launching a bunch of cross-listed products with BM&F this year. Just trying to get your thoughts on how we should be thinking about the size of that opportunity? And when you look at your relationship with the BM&F, what is the most important piece to you? Is that the order routing you've already rolled out or is it more of these cross-listed products?","Phupinder S. Gill","If you look at our relationship with BM&F, actually, it's a very comprehensive one. It includes a couple of dimensions, one -- several of the dimensions you've already mentioned, in addition to that is the joint development effort that we undertook some time ago. And we're also working with that client base and the regulatory authorities there to make it easier for trades to flow, both north and south, as well as south to north, with particular focus by us in the south to north trades. And so it's a bigger relationship than that. With respect to cross listing, I think it addresses a very important opportunity, both for themselves, as well as for us. And when you have these activities that you see CME engage in, where cross licensing is concerned, whether it's India or Brazil, we are looking at these economies that are by and large closed, but yet with an interest express by a client base to trade particular products, either it's CME or at Bovespa. And so by lifting these products on either side, it exposes each of our client bases to the liquid products that we have. And I think it's a long-term venture on our part to grow the volume. In Ibovespa, taking that as a specific example, it's a phenomenal add-on to what is already a world-class equity complex that we have. It provides our client base with further diversification.","James E. Parisi","And I think, Gill, when you look at the -- in the first quarter, when you look at the financial impacts and the revenues that we've achieved from our relationship with Brazil, in terms of the software agreement that we've got them, the co-development agreement, we garnered around $1 million or so and fees tied to that. But then when you look at the fees that we're generating in South America from transaction fees, it's a multiple of that. It's in the first quarter, somewhere on $5 million or so fees that we generated from people trading in our products and our platform from South America.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alex Kramm, UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to talk about the volume environment a little bit more. Obviously, Gill, you gave a lot of color by product and what you're seeing there. But can you talk a little bit about, in case I missed it, about the customer mix? And if you've seen any changes, in particular, on product-by-product basis? Is it fundamental users that have been cared back, are there any particular reasons? Or are you seeing other, like high-frequency traders pay back a little bit? Or has the mix really not changed and everything is just soft right now?","Phupinder S. Gill","Yes, we don't give out exact numbers, but I think it's safe to say that the volume has been down across the board. What's been encouraging about the volume in some of these asset classes is there has been a percentage tick-up in activity in participation like activity among the commercial, as well as some of the individual prompts. And this is specific to an asset class like foreign exchange. What is encouraging, though, is the overall tick-up from year end in terms of open interest. So while volatility is dampening, the volume activity of our client base, the open interest across the board is up about 15% compared to year end last year. And they're seeing a pick-up in activity from the asset managers. Bryan, do you have anything to add?","Bryan T. Durkin","No. I just think it goes to the efficacy of the sales program that we have in place. We've got new users coming in to some of these products, as Gill alluded to on the FX side, where we saw some decreases in certain client segments. We've seen new client segments coming in and doing a substantial uptake in the foreign currency product, particularly in the emerging markets. And these are generally position holders, which is a good signal for the future growth of that complex. And it's a similar trend we're seeing in our other products.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just a very quick one for Jamie here. On the transactions fee line, clearly, if you just look at the volumes, the 3 or 4 and the RPCs, you'd obviously get a little bit of smaller number. I think the delta is the $1.6 million, obviously, very small. I assume that CMECE and also the swaps clearing, can you just give us a flavor of -- is that actually true? And then also what this business are contributing, I know very small, but just so we have an idea?","James E. Parisi","Yes. In terms of the OTC, it's still obviously in the very early stages, but revenue in the first quarter, which is in the transaction fee line, was in the neighborhood of roughly $2 million.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Ken Worthington with from JP Morgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You mentioned kind of record activity at ClearPort. As you kind of look forward for the rest of the year, what is your outlook there and what are the key things that, I guess, either you or we, should be focusing on?","Bryan T. Durkin","Couple of things. It's Bryan. You need to keep an eye on the acceleration of our capabilities to roll out a product, particularly on the agricultural, as well as in the general -- I mean, energy, as well as the agricultural sectors. What you're seeing is an increase in the introduction of esoteric OTC structured-type products that is showing our direct responsiveness to the client base and that is accelerating. I think our efforts and our performance overall, with respect to ClearPort. The focus as well on the OTC interest rate side of the equation is also something that transcends itself into some of our other core product mixes. So we're seeing some similarity in users and new users coming in accessing ClearPort.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Excellent. That's helpful. And then just on Slide 5, on the volatility charts, the strong indication that recent volatility has been at lower levels. As you think about volatility over a longer period of time, say over 10 years and 20 years, what does that tell you about the level of volatility? Are we getting back to normal volatility levels? Or is it really unusually low volatility levels that, over a longer period of time, should rise? And then, I don't know, maybe 10 to 20 years isn't the right time period. Maybe it should be 5 years if the time period is better in the shorter term, maybe address that as well?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. I'll start and I don't know if anybody has anything else to add here. But predicting volatility on a going forward basis is not something that we would know or know how to do. I think -- but if you look expectations or what the general market expectations are with volatility levels as low as they are now almost across the board, you can expect a pick-up. The question becomes when, right? And on the rate side, for example, given the Fed announcement yesterday of continued no Fed action to the end of 2014, there is no real consensus among, even in SBF or MC with some people's dissension -- with some dissension there, so I think the uncertainty and the dialogue around the uncertainty of when the Fed will actually move is going to bode well for the CME Group's market with respect to the commodities for example, that's going to be highly dependent upon things that are essentially out of our control: weather, demand. But given, in general, the volatility patterns that we are seeing, the expectation is it's going to be up and I can't tell you, Ken, if it's going to be the next 3 years, 5 years or 10 years.","Terrence A. Duffy","This is Terry Duffy. I think one of the interesting things about volatility and looking at traders' behaviors, is volatility might be low, but prices are already either all-time highs or all-time lows, which is only telling you one thing: volatility has to increase. If you look at the price of nat gas at a 10-year low, you'll look at the price of WTI and Brent at an all-time highs, you'll look at the price of the interest rates, as Mr. Gill said, is lows. And food products are trading at very high numbers, but the volatility being low. So we're looking at historical prices, both low and high, but no volatility. That equation has to change. It's only a matter of pure fundamentals. It will change.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take your next question from Michael Carrier, Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the expense side. So I just want to make sure, when we're talking about the $10 million reduction this quarter, that topped the $323 million. And then if we are in a environment where the volumes are -- this is relative to what you guys gave the last quarter, so the 2% to 3% expense increase for -- at a low-volume environment. But if we are on the negative side, besides the bonus comment that you mentioned that, that can decline, any other areas that you can pull back, and if you can size that like the level that you need to be for that bonus to come down and how significant that could be?","James E. Parisi","I'm not going to cite exactly where the bonus cliff is, but as I said before, it's minus 20% off of our internal cash earnings targets. And just in terms of -- because of the operating leverage in the model, it is very difficult for us to reduce expenses without cutting into muscle over time, so we want to be very careful around that when we're just in a cyclical low. So if we're down at volume levels like we are today, down 10% and that were to persist throughout the year, I think that we'd be somewhere in the flat range in terms of expense growth versus last year. And of course, on top of that, we'll look to see where we can to reduce other discretionary expenses. But that's the best I can give you at this point. And as the quarter progresses, we'll give you some further updates because of the disposition of the Dow and CMA and the voluntary exit program, those are all somewhat -- those all have impacts on the expenses going forward and we'll give you more detail on that next time.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, just on the OTC comment, you mentioned around $2 million in the revenues today. So when you think about the traction that you've gained in terms of clients and the amount of open interest that they control, is there any expectation as you get into the back half of this year, or the end of 2013, on where that revenue can get to? And then just on the co-lo, I just wanted to clarify, I think you gave what the amount was, you got a full quarter of a run rate, do you have that number, just going forward?","James E. Parisi","Well, on co-lo, I would love to -- again, we only got 2 months under our belt, so I would look to the guidance that we've given previously of $40 million  to $45 million for the current year. And your other question was on OTC?","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right.","James E. Parisi","Expectations? Again, we're so early in the process, I don't think that we want to put any expectations out there for the current year. You can look at what we said in the past about what we charge per million or what we expect to garner per million in term of revenue in the interest rates swap sides, $5 to $6 on the CDS side, we've said $7 to $8. I think if you look at the most recent quarter, we were in that range, probably between $6 and $7 per million. So I would use that to model.","Operator","And moving on. We'll take your next question from Matthew Heinz, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Wondering if you could just illuminate the London strategy a little bit for me, maybe in terms of how you expect to leverage CE IRS clearing to help jump start the Dry Core [ph]  business there. I guess, in the similar fashion to what you're doing in the U.S. with cross margining swaps and futures?","Bryan T. Durkin","Well, I'll start, it's Bryan. Definitely, through our intensified footprint in Europe and our introduction of the CMECE clearing offering that we have, we have targeted that client community in the context of managing their OTC interest rate exposure and we have found a very strong interest and being able to provide that offering locally within the European region. We have intensified our efforts and focused to introduce those products to respond to those regional demands and concerns. We also see that by doing so, it is resulting in equivalent new interest in a number of our core products. So by having that offering coming on the horizon in the very near future, we are bringing in the beneficiary of bringing in new business in multiple asset classes from the local region.","Phupinder S. Gill","Matt, this is Gill. Just to add to what's Bryan is saying. I think one of the questions you had was with respect to the potential for cross margining between CMECE and the U.S. side. As you may know, we had a long-standing arrangement with the LCH across margining some years ago and we've begun the conversation with both the FSA and the CFTC on allowing CMECE's portfolio to be cross margined with the clearing offering here. Now in light of the implementation of Dodd-Frank and their -- and this going to be viewed in a different light, so we don't have any guidance to give with respect to that just yet. But the conversations are beginning now.","Kimberly S. Taylor","This is Kim. If I could just add in, with respect to the rates offering at CMECE, we are getting good customer response to some of the features that are part of our U.S. offerings, the immediacy of clearing, the simplified workflows, the product sets that we have. Those are resonating with the customer base in Europe as well.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I really appreciate that color. And then just as a quick follow-up. You talked a little bit what's impact -- the government intervention impacting the Asian currencies, and I appreciate that. But what do you think has driven kind of the slow down in the major European currencies? And then I haven't looked at the breakdown in a while, but what's the share or the breakdown between your G7 and your emerging market currencies in the FX business?","James E. Parisi","With respect to the slow down on the European side of the equation, it really is an overhang from the European debt crisis and the intervention with respect to those main currencies that would be tied to it. With respect to emerging markets, we're very, very excited about the continued trend and the increase in open interest, as well as volume in the emerging sector. The open interest is very high across the board for all of our foreign currencies and we're going to continue to intensifying our efforts. We've seen there a wonderful uptake, in particular in the Mexican peso. And I think your other question was the breakdown. 75% of the volume is centralized in the G7s. So when you look at that, and if you see those trends that have occurred over the course of the last 2 years, there's been a substantial uptake in the emerging market, and we're continuing that focus.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell, ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. I just -- first one on your product -- on your customer mix, obviously, you guys are doing a very good job in building organically the customer base in some of the new customer types that you alluded to Bryan. But if we look at, I guess, the  usage of high-frequency trading within the mix, I mean, to what extent do you think seeing lower high-frequency usage based on lower volatility and the multiplier effect that you typically get with volumes versus the extent that there's potentially a structural change would just lower participation by high-frequency shops. I guess when we think, if volatility comes back, do you expect to save the type of move back in volumes?","Bryan T. Durkin","An excellent question. We have seen some reduction in the overall performance of the, what would be categorized as the more proprietary, high-frequency traders across asset classes. What's very interesting, and I alluded to earlier, is the significant uptake across other client segments into these same products. So if you take a look at the interest that we're seeing evolving, particularly from the corporate side of the equation, I think historically, we have focused very much so on the commercial users of the markets with our client segment team that is very focused on both corporate and commercial. We are seeing new clientele coming into our products. As we do that, those that are traditionally interested in hedging, for example, their foreign currency or interest rate risk, are taking a look at some of the asset classes that we offer and we're seeing -- for some low incremental but consistent interest in our commodities particularly in metals and agricultural complex.","Phupinder S. Gill","If I can just add to what Bryan was saying. I think the lack of participation from the so-called  high-frequency guidance will be due to the lack of volatility and not necessarily structural changes that might be on the horizon.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the RPC for ClearPort and energy complex. That's been down the last couple of quarters in that low 150s range versus higher 150s. I know there were some low volume contracts, I think like the PJM Power contract and there was -- a mini-WTI contract that influenced that last quarters. Is that something we should consider continuing for the foreseeable future? Or do you think we'll see a sort of a snap back up in that RPC in that line?","James E. Parisi","It's really hard to say, Bryan, because that -- at ClearPort, there are hundreds of different products with different rates. So oftentimes, that change in that RPC is going to be driven by product mix shift and it's very difficult to predict the marginal changes in that rate going forward.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. It's inferred that the mix is in favor of current RPC, I guess like into the end of the first quarter?","James E. Parisi","I'm not quite following your question.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Is it the current mix that would give you the RPC that we're -- for getting for first quarter, is that a trend that's continuing into the end of the first quarter at least that we can sort of base our modeling forward on?","James E. Parisi","Yes. As I said is, it's very difficult to tell.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","On the Analyst Day, you gave us -- we knew -- some really comments I remember, and one of them -- we were talking about the new Dodd-Frank and the OTC opportunity, but some comments on clients that we're talking about how the marginal requirements for swaps are going to be higher than for futures. So maybe they were thinking about moving into futures instead. And then are you seeing that kind of come through in the form of maybe block trades? Have you any kind of anecdotal or any evidence that you are actually seeing some -- maybe some new customers or people kind of moving out of swaps into futures? And maybe that was what some of the recent headlines were about? Maybe some of the guys in the picture saying as well and they're also happy about it. It didn't seem like any of the block trades that happened on that occasion were outside of the balance of block trades. But I'm just wondering if that's maybe an opportunity we should start to build in?","Bryan T. Durkin","A couple of things. It's Bryan. First of all, we are seeing new business coming into our core interest rate futures from new clientele that originally has been coming in to utilize our interest rate swap OTC clearing services. I would not say that, that is switching business into futures. I would say that it's more augmenting their current risk portfolio. So as they are clearing business through us, they are also looking at the efficiencies in the liquidity provided and the core product for interest rates and utilizing your dollar strips to augment their interest rate swap exposure on the clearing side. With respect to the block trades, I wouldn't necessarily make that correlation. There is a whole host of reasons why our users need to avail themselves to our block trading facilities. That's 1 of 4 platforms for our user base to be able to facilitate and manage their risks.","Phupinder S. Gill","Niamh, this is Gill. Just to add to what Bryan was saying. I think you -- even though you -- we can't tell or we don't know or we would not ascribe the interest and the growth in several of our product lines offering, interest to clients preferring which is OTC. There has been, as you pointed out, a lot of talk, particularly among the asset managers about shifting over to futures rather than OTC forbearers and for these reasons. But that's not evident.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then if I could touch another. We heard some recent comments from -- I'm sorry, a senior politician suggesting about the regulators kind of increasing the budget, which is nothing new, but also suggesting about kind of limiting the leverage that people could apply in the derivatives market. And I guess it turned our heads because supposedly, it was kind of something that they discussed with the regulators that they didn't seem objective to it. So are you having any discussions at all with the regulators about higher margin requirements in the futures market or anything like that?","James E. Parisi","Are you referring to the President's remarks on the margin?","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","That would be it.","James E. Parisi","I actually said this in testimony the other day, that the worst thing to do to try to control prices is to utilize FX margins to do so. Margins are there for a risk management tool not to effectuate price. And then there's been multiple studies that, no matter what you do with margins, it's not going to affect the price in the long term. We raised margins on energy, I believe, 5x in the last 12 months, and our oil markets and the price still marched straight up. So what the President -- I think, may be a little bit confused and some of his advisers may be a little bit confused there, when you raise margins when a product is going up, the people that have all the money are the longs, the people that don't have the money are the shorts, and the margin applies to both sides of the equation. And that only exacerbates the problem for the upside if you're going to try to utilize margins as a tool to effectuate price. I think Congress gets that very, very clearly.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So you are comfortable the regulators get that too?","Unknown Executive","Yes.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Gaston Ceron, Morningstar Equity Research.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a real quick question. I know you guys said that you're going to wait until the next quarter to give a little more color on S&P and the DJ joint venture. But I guess one question that I had, just for modeling purposes going forward, is as I think what the impact this might is, can you say, as it stands now, how much of the total revenue did your Dow Jones business that you have today, how much of total revenue did that contribute and what are its margins?","James E. Parisi","The Dow business itself was about $24 million or so of revenue in the quarter, and the margins on that are similar to the margins of the overall company.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And it's my understanding that after the JV -- is the new JV is put in place, this will be a below the line type of situation, right?","James E. Parisi","Yes. It'll be below the line and there'll be some adjustment on the license fee line as well, where we're obviously paying some license fees for the JV for those products.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Matthew Heinz, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Matthew S. Heinz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on the RPC in the rates business. I was just recalling some higher block trades percentages in the quarter that caused a bit of a stir in the press. Just wondering how that impacted the rates RPC? I guess I was surprised to see it down quarter-over-quarter, given that uptick. Can you just maybe talk about what was going on there?","James E. Parisi","Sure. There was -- I mean, when you look at the various mix impacts on the rate quadrant, you're right to point out that the venue mix was actually positive for the rate this quarter as our volume outside the pit proved faster than our regular volumes, our ex-pit volumes grew faster. However, we did see a -- quarter-over-quarter, because of the increasing volumes, the discounts also increased and that more than offset that.","Operator","At this time, that will conclude our Q&A session. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","James E.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Peschier. Please go ahead, sir.","John Peschier","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm going to start with the safe harbor language, and then I'll turn it over to Terry for brief remarks followed by questions. Other members of our management team will also participate in the Q&A. Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, they involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. For detailed information about factors that may affect our performance can be found in our filings with the SEC, which are on our website. Also, on the last page of the earnings release, you will find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest in CME Group. 2017 was certainly an unusual year. Virtually every asset class experienced reduced volatility. So throughout the year, we focused on areas that we could control. That included adding new products, operating all of our markets in the most efficient manner and expanding our global customer base. We were aggressive in optimizing our operations. As you know, we sold investments we had in other exchanges, we wound down our European exchange and clearing house, we announced the exit of our credit default swaps clearing business and we focused on making investments in new product launches as well as our market data, audit and derived data functions.","Focusing on increasing the efficiency [Technical Difficulty] organization has resulted in another successful year of reducing our total controllable costs, while continuing to invest for the future. We also continue to evolve our sales strategy to help generate additional business and acquire new customers. Specific global sales campaigns were developed across every product area. We measured that success by tracking additional metrics. These efforts drove non-U.S. average daily volume up 10% for the year. This was achieved despite difficult comparables from the election year of 2016.","Also, we had 11% growth in our options franchise driven by increased trading on rollbacks. During 2017, we reached all-time highs in total open interest, along with records for the number of large open interest holders in several asset classes. This bodes well as market volatility normalizes.","As we begin 2018, we saw all sox product areas post solid growth in January as we continued to execute on our strategy. We also have seen open interest levels rise as our global clients are actively managing risk. These two measurements are extremely encouraging as we begin the year.","With that, we'd like to open your questions - open the call for your questions. And I know we have a number of analysts that will cover us, so we'd ask that you ask one question and then get back into the queue. With that, we'll open it up to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just quickly on, I guess, both tax reform and the expense outlook. First of all, should - with your expense guidance just up about 2%, 2.5% to 3%, should we assume that largely most of the benefits of tax reform you would expect to accrue to shareholders, I guess, with the increase in the variable dividend upon increasing the cash flow. And maybe if you can comment, if the volume scenario turns out to be a lot better this year, given sort of the traction that we are seeing earlier in the year, how should we think about expenses potentially flexing up, I guess, would your incremental margin - what do you view as your incremental operating margins?","Terrence Duffy","Thank you, Brian. Several questions in there. So in terms of the tax reform, we're very pleased with the tax reform. We believe it's good for our customers, intermediaries and good for the markets. In terms of what we're planning on doing with tax reform - with the tax reform and additional cash flow, we're not specifically earmarking anything. We've given out our expense and CapEx guidance, which is increasing this year versus over the last several years. And this provides us more financial flexibility. In terms of the expense guidance, it's often in line with what we've been communicating, which is in the low single digits. The majority of the increase is driven by compensation. It's the usual cost-of-living increasing - increases, the staffing related to growth initiatives.","And finally, within our expense guidance, there is a change in pension accounting, which will impact our top line by about $4 million and there's no offset that we booked in the other income and expense section of our income statement. We haven't changed our capital return policy in light of tax reforms. So it's - we think it's very positive. It's positive for our customers. And we think that it'll be helpful for all the intermediaries and the customers.","Brian Bedell","And you're still being incremental margins over 90%?","Terrence Duffy","Yes. I mean, it's obviously going to be a function - since you have our expense guidance, it's really a function of sales. And if you could see in our first quarter so far, our volumes are up about 18%. So very, very positive and we would expect our incremental margins to stay in kind of the range it's been.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Rosenblatt.","Christopher Allen","I wanted to ask about market data, so run rate's increased there. You noted in the slides it was driven by derived data and audit. I wonder if you could parse out the two, we know audit can be a bit lumpy. Just trying to get a sense for what the run rate is going forward?","Bryan Durkin","It's Bryan. With respect to the derived data, we continue to see a nice pipeline of demand for that product. And I think it goes to the interest and demand in our multi-asset class benchmark futures and the need to develop product for a variety of our client base that looks to expand their product offerings. So that pipeline is continuing to build in a nice way. With respect to audits, you're correct to point out that it can be lumpy, and appreciate that you recognize that. However, our goal within the audit is to make sure that we have compliancy and that we're protecting our IP in that regard. And hopefully, correcting some noncompliance that brings our user base into our requirements of reporting accurately their real time usage of data. If you look at the overall attrition rates for the past quarter, we've seen actually some improvement in that regard. And quite frankly, we've seen that from some of our user base properly recording and reporting their real time data usage. So we feel that all of this is having the intended effects.","Christopher Allen","So were there any like any onetime catch up on audit that we should be aware of just kind of not get over our skis in terms of modeling going forward?","Bryan Durkin","It's hard for me to comment on the audits. I would just say that there's a number in the pipeline that we're continuing to conclude. And our goal here is to ensure compliance with the reporting and make sure that the consumers of the data are complying with our requirements and that we're receiving the revenues that we should receive based on their usage.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","I wanted to talk about the energy business real quick or ask about the energy business real quick. One of the things that's been standing out so for this year is the very strong growth so far this year. In particular, relative to your primary competitor. Now obviously, there's a little bit of a product mix, but would love to hear from anyone on the call if you're seeing anything else. I mean there's regulatory changes or you know that the sales performance - but anything you could add would be great.","Derek Sammann","Yes, Alex, this is Derek, thanks. We are very pleased with the results that we've posted up in 2017. I think we're chock-full of records that we've pointed to in the documentation we sent you guys. Going from a very strong record year in 2017, as you pointed out we started with a record year so far in '18. What we're seeing is broad-based growth across the entire energy complex. We spend a lot of time talking about WTI, we're - actually have just posted a new record ADV month in January, inclusive of not just WTI, but also our gasoline contracts and heating oil that we set multiple open interest records in as well. What's really driving that is both broad-based participation, but our record non-U.S. participation. You've heard us talk about focusing on electronifying our markets to be able to access a non-U.S. customer base.","And in some of the documentation we've provided you guys, we're showing that, a significant growth in the non-U.S. participation of our markets. That is continuing into January of this year. Q4 of last year, the energy business was up 40% in customers from outside the U.S. But that's a function of the sale campaign that Terry referred to earlier. The efforts and investment we've made in the front-end of technology to access customers to provide liquidity 24\/7 and we're seeing that flow through across into our commercial customer base, which has been the central focus point for the last 2.5 years on the business side and sales side, leveraging our regional sales people. So if you couple that with the results of the U.S. Energy Department figures that were just released yesterday, showing U.S. production topping 10 million barrels a day in production and almost 2 million barrels a day in exports, we see that as the continuing strong structural story behind WTI as a global benchmark in the waterborne products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Fannon","I guess another question on market data. I think there's a price increase coming on April 1. Can you talk about that and what you're kind of expecting for attrition? And then, Bryan, just to follow up on the further - your earlier comment about derived data, can you talk about how you're positioned better in 2018 to capitalize on that opportunity versus the start of last year, which resulted in a little bit of delay of that?","Bryan Durkin","Sure. First of all, with respect to the pricing increase, we have announced that increase, which goes into effect beginning of April from $85 to $105. We have not increased prices for several years. Yet we continue to increase the number of products across both futures and options. And we offer, I believe, the broadest space in terms of products in our market data suite. The market, in terms of response, we'll watch this closely. However, we believe that the efficacy of the magnitude and the number of products offered justifies - and the investments that we've made in the infrastructure, justifies the increase. In terms of impact on attrition, it's hard to say. We'll watch this very closely. But we're also, in conjunction with the audits that we're conducting, seeing some changes in terms of reporting and as a result, that has reduced some of that attrition pressures. So we'll monitor it closely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Just a question - I know this is on the quarter, but just given the strength that we've seen in January, just wanted to get some sense with the higher volatility, what you guys are seeing across the different product suites in terms of just your typical customers that are picking up their activity, given kind of a shifting outlook. Or you're seeing users that might have been more dormant pick up their level of activity? So any color around that. And then just on the pricing, any changes that you guys have made across the complex that we should be aware of for 2018?","Terrence Duffy","Mike, it's Terry Duffy. I think the best way for us to try to give you a little bit of color on that is to let Sean and Derek walk through. As you've seen, especially in our interest rate complex as we've hit open interest records, we've hit new records in Globex trading. Derek talked about the amount of records in our releases. So I think what will be helpful is if we let both Sean and Derek make some quick comments on what we're seeing for the first month of '18. Sean?","Sean Tully","Thanks very much, Terry, and thanks for the question. So we've seen a great start to the year in January. Last year, we had a record number of large open interest holders and a record open interest in each and every one of the financial's asset classes. So we're continuing to penetrate a much larger customer base, in particular, much larger customer base relative to alternative products. Another example we've been talking about continuously over the last few years, is our penetration of the cash Treasury bond market. So currently, our treasury futures are trading about 94.6% of the volume of the cash Treasury bond market. That's up from the 80% area last year and up from 55% if you go back six years ago. So we've seen tremendous growth there. This year, very exciting again. We've just seen, in the last couple of weeks, a new record number of large open interest holders in our interest rate complex.","We've seen a new record open interest in our foreign exchange complex. And we've seen records in our Eurodollar options on Globex. Actually, we had a record day, just a couple of weeks ago. And very interesting thing, nothing we've talked about - as spoke about earlier is the electronification of our markets, how it gives us much better access to international participants and how when you electronify our markets, we see a much higher velocity of growth. So we had - again, we had a record Eurodollar options volume date earlier this month, one. Two, on that day, very interestingly, we had a 47% electronic market. Not only that, but in fact, we did more volume on the box from Globex on that day than we did on the Eurodollar options, than we did in the pit. So the strategy that we've been following in terms of the electronification is absolutely working in terms of getting more participants, more global participants and higher velocity of growth. So we're very excited about our sales approaches, we're very excited also about new products.","On the new products side, a lot of excitement there with all of the new participants. So we had great growth in our weekly options, a lot of new weekly options. We launched Wednesday Weekly Treasury Options last year. They're doing over 18,000 a day. As you, I think, know, in our S&P options over the last 1.5 years, we introduced Monday and Wednesday Weekly Options doing over 90,000 contracts a day. Our Ultra 10 contract that we launched just a couple of years ago, doing 145,000 contracts a day. Two years ago, we launched something called BTIC, basis trade index close on our equity complex. This is a functionality allowing participants to trade on the central limit order book at a spread to the cash market close. That's trading 39,000 contracts a day in January. It's a very high RPC contract. So the innovation, the electronification, the sales campaigns are all increasing the number of participants. Derek, I don't know if you want to jump in?","Derek Sammann","Yes, some similar trends. I'll reference some comments early on the energy side. Really, our focal points on energy and we've got - with so many records, Peschier told me to stop sending them data to put into this thing, so I won't touch on those. Really, the drivers behind the growth, I talked about the commercial customers, that has been our singular focal point for almost 2.5 years. And if you look at the growth, it's not just the volumes but the growth of the open interest and the large open interest holders, the data's in the deck, it shows you the success we're having in globally penetrating end-user customers. The breadth of our product portfolio in energy, I mentioned before, not just crude oil in WTI, but our nat gas, our gasoline contract, RBOB, our heating oil contract, we're having a total franchise open interest record and volume record overall in both energy and metals, in January, so the strength continues.","And I think the - true on the metal side as well, particular strength in our industrial metals in copper. The overlay to all of this, and Sean mentioned this as well is, you've heard us talk about focusing on growing our options complex. And options continues to accelerate and strengthen our order book in futures as options traders tend to hedge their exposures in our underlying futures. And if you look at our starting point in January of '18, we came off a total year record in ADV for 2017, and we're setting an all-time options record in January of '18 as well. Our option ADV overall was up about 30% in January. And it's particularly interesting, when you look at some of the commodities markets price action with crude oil up at $65, it's really unclear whether that next $15 move is back to $50, with the glut somehow coming out of the U.S. or potentially up to $75 with some of the constrictions in the supply chain. That is a perfect environment for options.","So our energy options in January is actually up 37%. This is a purpose-built market in fixed income, in energy, in equities for use of options and we're seeing that. The investment that we've made in our options business across asset classes, both an accelerant to our underlying growth, but it makes our futures value proposition that much more sticky as well. So I would say, despite the volatility profiles, you've seen us grow in low volatility environments, flat volatility environments and now selectively sharply increasing volatility environments. And our remit around here is to continue to add customers, globalize business and enhance that customer experience around our product set.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","I guess the question is, you had record revenues in 2017, you got strong January volumes, you got price increase coming in, you had 94% incremental margins and controlled expenses looking forward. So I guess the question is for you Terry, how do you look at M&A? There's certainly been a lot of talk about it. And potentially diluting this, I guess, pure profitable model, versus the other advantages of building scale and looking for additional products, et cetera. So the outlook for M&A given all the talk that's been out there.","Terrence Duffy","Well, Rich, first, thank you. There's been no change to our philosophy as it relates to M&A. As you know, I highlighted in my opening remarks about some of the things that we've decided to liquidate over this past year, which were important to continue to keep the model that we have in place that you outlined going forward. So we're very happy with where we're at. At the same time, I think that when you look at any M&A opportunities, they have to make complete sense for CME and our discipline will be there. If anything, we put ourself in a very strong place in order for us to participate, if something becomes available that we think can add value to this company. I have said this before and I'll say it again, over the last 14 months, we are not looking to just acquire to acquire. We will only look at things that we think that will benefit our shareholders and our clients. And the one way our shareholders will benefit if we can do an acquisition that can add value to the experience of our clients, which will add additional revenue for our shareholders. That's the philosophy, so that philosophy has not changed.","Richard Repetto","And are there accretion targets, margin targets? Or I guess, because there are properties out there, but none of them have your margins, et cetera.","John Pietrowicz","Rich, this is John Pietrowicz. So thanks for the question, we are - Terry indicated, we're very disciplined. You've seen over time the acquisitions that we've made, a lot of the advances that we've done in this business has been through CBOT, acquisition in NYMEX, our Dow Jones joint venture. We do have targets that we look at. We look at things from an accretion dilution perspective, we look at it from an NPV perspective, we've got internal hurdle rates that we look at. So we basically triangulate on M&A to make sure that we are in a position to create value for our customers and for our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Question for you about cryptocurrencies. Obviously, still in the early days for you guys, but now we're starting to hear, I think, increased conversation from the CFTC about their desire to regulate and provide oversight of cryptocurrencies. So curious if you can talk about the potential impact that, that regulation might have and what your expectations are for that contract in general?","Terrence Duffy","Well, I'll start, Patrick, it's Terry. And then I'll ask Sean to jump in as well and anybody else around the table. The crypto market is something - obviously it's brand new as far as a listed product goes. But I think when we're getting a lot of interest on a product that's been around actually for nine years now, I think the interest is obviously all coming because of the appreciation of the value of the product. And introducing futures to it is actually, I think, helped mitigate some of the volatility in the product in and of itself. But as far as the regulation goes, we worked closely with the CFTC before we launched this product. We put new standards in place that we don't have on our other contracts such as higher margins, velocity and stop functionalities, similar to what we have on the equity markets on the percentages.","So I think it's 7, 13 and 20 that we have on percentages as a market to - market volatility increases or decreases. So I think, from our standpoint, the CFTC, there's been some things in the news lately about how are they going to regulate these types of markets and really, I think it's incumbent upon both of us. We've seen new markets historically, since at least I've been in this business, you can go back to the early '80s with cash settlement, nobody understood really what cash settlement was because every product had to be physically delivered and then people got more comfortable with different methodologies. So you could use that as an example of cryptocurrencies to some example. This is new to the marketplace with the exception, as I said earlier, it's nine years old. And we will continue to work with the regulator and as far as the growth of the product goes, this is one of those wait and see.","The last thing I would ever want to do was to potentially lower the margins and just think that we could effectuate a tremendous amount of trade off of this. This is very much a walk as we go through this, not run. So we will not do anything in the near term that we think that could increase the trade at the point of introducing additional risk to the system. So I don't know if that completely answers your question because this is - this topic is so broad and there are so many different opinions on it. So only I can say to you is, on the revenue side, it's going to be, I think, a slow grower, which is fine. It's 1,500 open interest, we're trading 1,000 a day. That's obviously very small in comparison to the volumes that CME Group has today. John referenced some new contracts that are trading 30,000 to 50,000 a day. That's not this product. We also design this product, as you know, to make sure that we do not attract the small retail participants, that's not something that we wanted to be a part of.","So our contract is much larger than our friends down the street's contract. And I think that is the prudent thing for us to do. So Sean, you can comment on it if you want. But I think from a regulatory standpoint, we're working close with the regulators on a daily basis. And from a revenue standpoint, this is going to be something that we'll be very methodical on.","Sean Tully","Yes, I think, Terry, I think you captured it very well. We - in addition to the limits that you mentioned, we also have a position limit of 1,000 contracts. Again, it's only about 1,500 contracts open interest. We're seeing interest from the buy side, sell side, retail and crop firms. And about 32% of the volume so far is coming from outside of the United States. So we are getting additional participants. But it's relatively a small part of our activity.","Operator","We'll go to Ben Herbert with Citi.","Benjamin Herbert","Just wanted to get some color around FX. And I know you called out very strong growth in Asia, but just anything else with the underlying customer base and mix shift there. And the new product launches in '18 and how you think that might grow the base.","Sean Tully","Sure. This is Sean jumping right in. Thank you for the question. We're very excited about the foreign exchange business. So the foreign exchange business last year, significantly outperforming the largest two cash market competitors in terms of volumes. And as I said earlier, we saw several new records, in terms of the large number of open interest holders last year. And we've just seen another one now in January. We were in the process of offering several new products that we're very excited about. We recently launched Wednesday Weekly Options, they actually had back-to-back record days a couple of weeks ago with the Bank of Canada meeting, of about 10,000 contracts a day on the Tuesday and Wednesday of that week around the expiry.","Putting that in perspective, we're running around 6% of our entire FX options complex is already being driven by this brand-new Wednesday Weekly expiry. So we're really excited about that. In addition to that, we launched last year, monthly futures on our FX complex. So the monthlies are very exciting. Because for the first time, we are - we have a product that's trading about 10,000 contracts a day. It's going to offer participants an alternate to FX forwards on the IMM dates as well as the FX swaps. In addition to that, we do expect sometime in the first half, to launch something called CME FX Link. With CME FX Link, we will be offering participants with our partner, Citigroup, which has already been announced, the single largest OTC FX dealer in the world, to bring the OTC markets and the futures markets together. So you're going to be able to trade the basis between spot FX and each of our front FX futures contracts. This is going to allow participants to do FX swaps.","Spot FX against each of our monthly futures. So we're very excited about being able to penetrate those marketplaces. If you think about the global FX market and the most recent BIS results, the spot FX market is about 1.7 trillion a day. Our quarterly FX futures, historically, have gone after that spot market. On the other hand, if you look at the deliverable forwards, the FX swaps and the currency swaps, those marketplaces make up about 3.1 trillion a day of the global OTC FX market. With our new products, we're also going after those market places and those participants. So we're very excited about our business there, we're very excited about offering participants the lowest total cost most efficient product possible. In FX, the last thing I'd like to say is, we're following the same playbook that we've followed in interest rates. If you look over the last six years, what we've accomplished in interest rates is new products. 17% of our interest rate revenue in 2017, actually came from new product launched since 2010.","We've been very focused on having a product that is a much lower cost, much better value proposition and getting in new participants. In FX, we're following the same exact playbook. I'm excited to tell you that in December, Greenwich Associates published a study showing that the CME futures, FX futures are a far lower total cost, as much as 75% than the OTC market, representing the same risk. This is the same study that Greenwich Associates published in regards to our interest rate futures back in 2015. So we're very excited about using the same playbook, about offering participants a wider set of products that penetrate a much larger percentage of the marketplace and trying to win over the OTC marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Maybe one just on the net investment income, just wonder if you could give us an update on the cash balances, how does it sit currently? Your net investment income in 4Q? And then lastly, how your take rate on those balances has changed after the December hike? I think you passed along 80% of the benefit. But just wanted to clarify.","John Pietrowicz","Sure. Thanks, Kyle. This is John. And yes, in terms of the Fed activity, no, the small benefit that we saw with the Fed move in mid-December was offset by lower average cash balances. The cash balances from Q3 to Q4 were down about $1 billion - little over $1 billion. So that decrease of - offset the small benefit that we got because we didn't start earning until the additional basis points until mid-December. You are correct. We're keeping a net four basis points on balances at the Fed versus what we return to our customers.","Kyle Voigt","Okay. And was that just because total collateral was down in your keeping? Or was that just - was that a shift - a mix shift, just customers holding less cash?","John Pietrowicz","Yes, that's an excellent question. It's a - we saw both cash and noncash collateral decrease between Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Worthington","Maybe for Derek, it was mentioned a lot of times during the quarter, a number of times record volumes in natural gas. So I'm wondering how the natural gas market is evolving, we're obviously seeing more LNG capabilities coming online. But things that seem to impact gas trading in the past, don't seem or didn't seem to have the same impact more recently. Kind of think hurricanes in the Gulf and how gas reacted this round versus in years past. So maybe talk about how the gas trading market is evolving in the U.S.? Where the differential market stands today. We've seen a surge in ClearPort volumes more recently. So maybe how the gas business is sort of flowing into ClearPort and this migration from - I'm sorry, yes, into ClearPort and how the migration is working from ClearPort to Globex? I think there's like six questions in there, but all gas related.","Derek Sammann","All right. Well, you know I talk fast, Ken, so I'll try to keep up with you. Relative to the - there's a structural story in the gas market you've heard us talk about and it's absolutely playing out over the course of the multiyear horizon. 2017, I think you saw a very, very tight range from a trading price perspective, we're starting to see that breakout. Couple that with what we're seeing to the point you made earlier is there has been a significant structural change in the global natural gas market. Historically, natural gas was priced on an index versus oil. And we've seen that correlation break down as gas itself has been able to separate itself from oil. And now you're seeing a growing infrastructure for exportable Henry Hub gas in the form of LNG or liquid natural gas.","There's one liquefaction plant that's alive down in the Gulf coast and there are, I think, three more coming online in the next two years. What that means, driven by the frac-ing revolution that generally we associate with crude oil and WTI coming out of the Permian basin, there's a significant amount of natural gas, Henry Hub priced natural gas coming out of the U.S. at a much lower price point. And we are now becoming a swing producer in the global natural gas market just as the U.S. has become the swing producer in the global crude market. The implications of that, Ken, is that we're actually seeing an exportable form of Henry Hub priced, basis Henry Hub gas, coming out of the U.S. that will eventually start to see significant shipments outside the U.S. as more liquefaction plants come online.","We're seeing that reflected in our own business. Our natural gas business was up 8% to a record last year in 2017. In January, our business is up 55%. Nat gas futures alone has been 744,000 contracts a day. As I mentioned, that's contributed to our overall energy record this year. And the last piece, I think you talked about ClearPort versus electronic trading or Globex trading. We're actually seeing a shift from broker market - market structure nat gas options to electronic trading of natural gas options. So not only have we grown our natural gas options business, we've converted that business, I think the first quarter of 2016, about 32% of our natural gas options traded electronically. And in January of this year, so four quarters later, that's north of 62%. So that's a market structure shift that is both reflective of the underlying connectivity of the global physical gas market, but we're also seeing that reflected in terms of the venue shift from brokers to electronic. And we typically generate better revenues from the Globex-based business. And relative to the total non-U.S. growth in Jan, we're seeing that continue to grow apace.","So growth in global participation end-user participants in our nat gas is following a very similar path to what we put in place for WTI net structural story as well. So we're very excited about that. We are also right in the sake of what's called the gas season, natural gas from November to March. So typically, we see volume boost, but this is an outsized growth in January, which given investments we've made, we think that we can continue to globalize participation as that market connects globally with Henry Hub at its core.","Bryan Durkin","I would just add on the international perspective, the growth in nat gas, both out of EMEA as well as Asia has been tremendous. I mean, what we're seeing coming out of China and South Korea, I would keep watching those growth trajectories because it's played out very well in the last couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris","Do you guys think that tax reform does anything to change the growth trajectory of futures volumes?","Terrence Duffy","I think what's helpful is it creates a more healthy customer base. So we talked a little bit about it before, I mean, our customers, our intermediaries, are healthier, which creates a healthier customer base, which should improve the markets. In terms of our futures volume directly attributable, probably not a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","Just a quick follow-up, I guess, at this point. At the end of last year, you made a number of pricing increases, we talked about pricing increase in the market data side, but I don't think we talked much about on the trading side of things. And I think in the past you were able to kind of provide, given the same kind of volume mix and customer mix, the implications on kind of blended RPC could be for you guys for 2018. Just broader strokes, that would be helpful. And a quick follow-up again, along the same lines, but when you think about the mix shift in the energy business, can you spend a couple of minutes on kind of how the mix shift is evolving and any implications that could have on RPC specifically within energy?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Alex. This is John. No different than prior years. And it's part of our normal course of business, we review incentive plans, volume tiers and the face rates that we charge our customers. And we're very targeted with how we approach pricing, really does not impact - not to impact volume. We're not going to give exact numbers in terms of revenue guidance going forward. I would say it's in the same range as we've done in previous years. I'll turn it over to Derek to talk about the energy question.","Derek Sammann","Yes, so there's probably four things I'll touch on relative to mix shift. First of all, you've heard us talk a lot about our investments and scaling of our non-U.S. participation. Typically, we see the rates per contract associated with non-U.S. customers higher than our base rates. So we're investing in acquiring a global customer base and that typically is positive for our mix shift. Within the customer mix itself, as we focused on our commercial customers, that also typically carries a higher RPC than our base rate. Very few of our biggest commercial customers are actually members - direct members, they change for various reasons. So as we continue to focus on to that end-user customer base, good for the open interest and good for drawing financial participants in, but they also typically carry a high RPC.","And finally, from a venue and a products mix perspective, you saw us post very, very strong natural gas volumes and participation in both January as well as last December, also carries a higher RPC. And as we shift businesses from brokers to electronic trading, typically that's positive to the RPC as well. So hopefully those four mix, whether it's product venue or client, give you a sense of what we're seeing in the energy side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Just on the equities RPC, that moved up nicely. Is that all due to the Basis Trade at Index Close contracts or was Bitcoin a contributor. I know that's a higher RPC. Maybe if you could just tell us what the average RPC so far has been on Bitcoin?","John Pietrowicz","Sure, in terms of the equity RPC, we had a better non-member mix. We had the full quarter impact of the Russell 2000 and BTIC, which was particularly strong and, Sean, do you want to talk a little bit about BTIC?","Sean Tully","Sure. On the BTIC, the RPC is running well north of $3 a contract. Again in January, about 39,000 contracts a day, about triple the volume of last year. And then last year was double the volume the year before. So we are very excited about that product. On the Russell 2000 as well, we are seeing a higher RPC than we are across the rest of our equity complex. Last time, we also mentioned that last year we saw growth in the NASDAQ futures and NASDAQ also has a somewhat higher RPC. So a number of positive tellings on the RPC side there. In terms of the Bitcoin, it does have a very high RPC. It is north of $5 per contract. Nonetheless, as Terry said earlier, we're only doing about 1,500 contracts a day. In terms of average daily volume, we only have about 1,500 contracts open interest. So the primary drivers were the Bitcoin, the Russell 2000 and the NASDAQ.","Brian Bedell","The BTIC, you mean for this...","Sean Tully","The BTIC, and the Russell 2000 and NASDAQ.","Brian Bedell","Yes, if I could squeeze just one more in maybe just on market data, I know there's a lot of moving parts here because of the audit's uncertain. And then the - with the price increases on the terminals, potential attrition rate is in question. But if you could just talk about how much do you think derived data will improve in 2018. And whether it's possible that you could see as much as a double-digit increase in market data fees in 2018 versus 2017.","John Pietrowicz","This is John. In terms of guidance, we're not going to be providing revenue guidance going forward. I think what you are seeing is the results of a lot of hard work that we've done to build out the audit team and the derived data sales. As Bryan indicated, we're building up a pipeline in terms of opportunities in the derived data side. And also, we're making good progress in terms of ensuring compliance with our reporting of terminals. So that should help with the attrition numbers. You are correct, we do have an increase in April from $85 to $105, so we're going to keep a strong eye on kind of the attrition impact to that. But combining that with in-sourcing the audit function should be helpful ensuring compliance and ensuring that the reported numbers are accurate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Just wanted to come back with a couple of follow-ups. The first one on capital return, I think this was asked, but maybe not answered, but when you think about the higher cash flow from tax - from the lower tax rate, et cetera, how are you thinking about the dividend in general? I think somebody asked about the variable dividend but - sorry, yes, the variable dividend. But given the higher run rate, is there like a position to actually bring the quarterly up as well? I mean, how does - maybe this is for Terry, how does the board think about that? I mean has there been discussions around the bringing the quarterly up as well with the higher run rate here?","Terrence Duffy","Alex, I think that from the board's perspective, as you know, they've been somewhat aggressive since we became a public company in 2002, when we were very aggressive about having a quarterly dividend and then introducing the variable. So we've moved it up, historically, throughout the years. And the board visits this on a quarterly basis. And I look forward to having a conversation with the board very soon. We have a meeting next week. So we'll be discussing quarterlies and other capital return policies as it relates to the dividend.","Alex Kramm","All right. Fair enough. And then just maybe secondly on the expense guide, I think you laid out kind of like the drivers of expenses for this year higher. But I think there's a view out there by some that given the low growth and expense over the last few years that maybe you underinvested a little bit in some areas and they might be like an upgrade cycle that has to come that's going to surprise us all. Can you maybe comment a little bit around that. You didn't talk about technology investments, et cetera, but your CapEx is coming up. So do you think you're keeping up with technology and demands from customers or is there a level of surprise that we should be getting ready for over the years?","John Pietrowicz","No, I mean, I think our technology team has done a fantastic job in terms of architecting our systems, so you don't have the step functions that you used to have years ago. It's much more linear in terms of the investment. You are seeing us make - in terms of our guidance, both on CapEx and on expense, additional investment in the business relative to those areas. We are very pleased with the performance of our systems, we're able to handle these record volumes. You heard from Sean and Derek, the number of records that we're setting. And when you take a look at some of the massive days such as the Brexit or the U.S. elections, we handled them without issue. In addition to the performance that we're doing - performance that our systems have, we also are very cognizant of security and that's an area that we continue to invest in to ensure that our - ensure the integrity of our markets.","So it is an area that we are continuously investing in and continuously innovating on. Just kind of circle back in terms of the tax reform, one of the things I mentioned was, it's good for our customer base. In terms of our customer base, obviously, those that are corporations, you will see a significant reduction in taxes, which could help in terms of driving additional business onto our exchange with the lower tax rate and the ability to utilize our products relative to their risk management needs. Couple that with the change in accounting for hedging - hedge accounting, I think both are positive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","I'm going to kind of pick on you a little bit with this question. You guys obviously have a lot of strength in a lot of different products, both in the fourth quarter and then to start 2018. But one area that kind of jumped out to me was your S&P 500 futures. If we look at CBOT, their SGX options volume was up about 40% year-over-year in January versus your S&P futures volume was up about 8%. What do we read into that? Is there a different use case right now in the current volatility environment that might impact SGX a little bit more or is there something else going on?","Sean Tully","This is Sean jumping in. No, our volumes in our options have grown as a portion of the overall marketplace over the last few years consistently. So while there may be short-term fluctuations that are somewhat different, certainly over the longer term, we have been outperforming the other marketplaces. And in particular, our - as I said earlier, the BTIC, which allows participants to trade our futures at the cash market close, their options do settle to the cash market close. And we do believe that the delta hedging is now being done by our BTIC. In addition to that, I will mention that our equity options are actually up 46% year-over-year. So we're actually doing very, very well.","Terrence Duffy","Yes, I think that's important. I just want to jump in on that a little bit because I think Sean nailed it. But when you're in these low volatility times, options become a very attractive play. And that's what we're seeing. So that's why we're seeing the growth in our options and our features. So I think you're not actually comparing the right products. So when you look at our options growth on our S&P versus just the futures against the SGX, it's a little bit different. So Mobile increases more activity in options.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.","Jeremy Campbell","Just wanted to do a quick follow-up here. I mean, your slide deck still says you still keep - you look to keep $700 million of minimum cash. I think, per prior calls and conversations, there's some hope that, that minimum cash level could get reduced a little bit because of shutting down European operations and exiting OTC. I'm just wondering, did you guys decide that $700 million firmly remains the right number? Or is that still kind of up for discussion and possibly still on the table as some dry powder either ahead of the 2019 year-end dividend or other avenues of capital deployment?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Jeremy. We are very pleased to have dividend out almost $1.2 billion with our annual variable dividend, which got us down to about $715 million in terms of the minimum cash balance. So it's much more aggressive than we've been in the past. But we did not change the minimum level of cash at this time. We did take into consideration the cash that was returned from the wind down of the European exchange and clearinghouse. So our cash levels, taking into consideration the annual variable dividend, was about $145 million lower than it's been over the last year and significantly lower than it's been over the last couple of years. So we've been much closer to the $700 million target.","Operator","And our final question comes from Jonathan Casteleyn with Hedgeye.","Jonathan Casteleyn","First to your thoughts on activity levels in fixed income versus quantitative tightening. So this has been largely loss diagnostics in its $4 trillion position. So I'm curious as it unwinds, it's [indiscernible]. Exactly what do you think the activity rate could be on the exchange?","Sean Tully","So certainly since October, the Federal Reserve has been reducing the size of its balance sheet. As they've announced, as we know, right, since October, they've been reducing it by around $10 billion a month. And that will increase over the next couple of years. So that by 2021, I think the $1.3 trillion reduction in the balance sheet that they're looking for. This should have a very gradual positive impact on the need for additional hedging. As you know, the Federal Reserve, when they purchase treasury and mortgage-backed securities, were not price sensitive. However, the additional securities that will need to be purchased will be from price-sensitive buyers. And so therefore, on a gradual basis, it should help to increase our volumes.","Jonathan Casteleyn","Okay, makes sense. And quickly, I have a question for Terry. Obviously, you seem to have your finger on the pulse on the comings and goings in the regulatory environment in D.C. So curious, just some perspective about how you think the environment's getting more restrictive, less restrictive? And any sort of catalyst coming down the pipe from a regulatory standpoint?","Terrence Duffy","So I got most of your question, we have maybe a little telecommunications problem with the call. But I think that your question was based around the regulatory environment. Is it better, worse, indifferent. Is that kind of the general question?","Jonathan Casteleyn","Yes, exactly. Sorry about that. Yes.","Terrence Duffy","Yes. I would say that the regulatory environment is, obviously, for the most part the same. I think when you look at Dodd-Frank, just as it applies to us, not a whole lot has changed. As far as the law goes and what Congress voted on, I think what you're seeing is the regulators are now writing rules that are applied to Dodd-Frank that they don't need congressional votes on. So at the fringes, they can make some changes which is positive for us. I think when you look at what the Europeans are going through right now under EMIR 2.0 and MiFID II, that's a different landscape for some of our European competitors and some of the business we do under their - under the EMIR 2.0 regulation. So that's something we're keeping a very close eye on.","As you know, we were just deemed equivalent in the European Union within the last two years. We believe that, that will continue to be the same equivalence of rating, even though they're coming up with new regulation. There's a lot of people on the regulatory side here in the United States in our government and in our legislative branch that are aware that U.S. businesses have been deemed equivalent and want to make sure that we continue to have that status in the European Union. So from the most part, I would call it positive to neutral? And - but that's an ever-changing environment and we keep a very close watch on it.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Terrence Duffy","I want to thank all of you, on behalf of myself and the rest of the management team for participating in today's call, and obviously, your interest in CME Group. We appreciate it very much, and have a wonderful day. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"5489":["CME Group, Inc.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Peschier. Please go ahead, sir.","John Peschier - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us today. And we're going to start with the Safe Harbor language. Then, I'll turn it over to Terry for some brief remarks, followed by your questions. Other members of our management team are here also and will participate in the Q&A session.","Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any of these statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance can be found in our filings with the SEC, which are on our website. Also, on the last page of the earnings release, you will find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, John, and thank you, all, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in CME Group. I hope you got a chance to read through the third quarter earnings commentary document we provided earlier this morning. We have made good progress with several initiatives during the quarter. So, let me share a few of those highlights. The diversity of our deep liquid product offerings was important during Q3, as trading generally slowed on exchanges around the world following a very strong first half of the year.","At CME, we saw particular strength in treasuries, equities, emerging market, FX futures and several commodity products. This offset a bit of a slowdown in global energy trading based on market conditions and fundamentals.","More importantly, we gained traction in new offerings, including our SOFR and SONIA interest rate futures contracts. We saw rising volume in open interest, as well as our record volume in our S&P Select Sector futures in September. We set new daily records in the new monthly FX futures and CME FX Link offerings. This totaled approximately 50,000 contracts on a single day in September.","Within our commodities complex, we announced a Q4 launch date for physically-delivered WTI Houston Crude Oil Futures contracts. This helps reinforce the strength of our global benchmark WTI Cushing contract.","In metals, we also saw continued growth in the copper options. We had record Q3 average daily volume in our wheat options and also records in our Livestock options complex. We continue to make investments in our global sales effort.","In September, we launched a new interactive CME Liquidity Tool to help market participants analyze liquidity, including current and historical bid-ask spreads, book depth and cost to trade statistics across the CME asset classes.","Customers can analyze activity during U.S., London and Singapore trading hours, helping to create new trading opportunities. CME's new Liquidity Tool has attracted a large amount of interest from clients across the globe. This is available on CME's website, and I encourage all of you to take a quick look at it.","We're also pleased to announce the extension of the exclusive NASDAQ futures license through 2029, ensuring market participants worldwide will continue to have seamless access to our suite of NASDAQ products and benefit from the capital efficiencies by trading alongside our industry-leading Equity Index complex.","Finally, with respect to our next transaction, we're pleased to announce that the Department of Justice approved \u2013 with the approval of the transaction, we continue to expect the deal to close before the \u2013 before yearend. We have been working diligently over the last few months on the high-level integration planning with the NEX team.","Our trading volume has picked up nicely so far in October. We are up 41% quarter-to-date versus last year. I mentioned product diversity earlier, and it's nice to see interest rates, equities that are up significantly in Q4 so far, with the other four product areas growing just as well.","With that short summary, I'd like to open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. Our first question will come from Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe can you just talk a little bit about the equities complex. We did see the RPC drop in that area a little more than we expected. If you can talk about the development of some of the new contracts. It looks like, as you outlined, BTIC, Bitcoin was only about 3% of that. I mean, it was a very good development but it's only about 3% of the total equities line. So, I don't know if that had any influence on the RPC. I would have thought actually would have been positive. Maybe if you can just address those drivers.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Brian, its Terry Duffy. What I'm going to ask John to do is talk a little bit about the RPC, and then Sean can give a little bit more flavor on the fundamentals of the overall equity market. Is that okay?","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. Great. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Okay. Good. John?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Great. Well, thanks, Brian. Yeah. We did have \u2013 we did see a sequential decline in the RPC from Q2 to Q3. It was driven by \u2013 primarily by two things. One, we had a higher proportion of member volume, and we also had lower activity in our premium priced privately negotiated products than last quarter.","If you take a step back, overall, we're very pleased with our RPC performance in the equities complex. When you consider that we had both higher volume and a higher RPC compared to Q3 of last year, and as Terry alluded to in his prepared remarks, we've seen a very strong start to the fourth quarter with equities up more than 115%.","I'll turn it over to Sean to talk a little bit about some of the activity in some of our newer products.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. We're very excited about a lot of the new products that we've launched. So, on the BTIC, or Basis Trade Index Close, which was launched now a couple of years ago; last year, you'll recall probably that we did around 13,000 contracts. This year, we're doing 36,000 contracts, and it's got nearly a $3 RPC. So, we're very excited about the developments there.","Other developments, we've announced that we've extended the NASDAQ contract. We're very excited about that. We recently had an all-time record day in the NASDAQ contract, and we're seeing huge growth year-over-year in those volumes of over 50%. So, we're extremely excited about that \u2013 extremely excited about the success there.","Another thing that we've been doing that we've talked a lot about, as you know, delivering margin capital and total cost efficiencies to the marketplace. One of the areas that we've done that, in particular, with the advent of the uncleared margin rules in OTC space, is we've offered total return futures on our S&P complex. We currently only offer those products out to 18 months, so relatively short. Nonetheless, we've got huge traction.","We now have over 200,000 contracts, open interest, in our S&P 500 total written futures. The total return market \u2013 total return swap market, I should say \u2013 trades out to 10 years very actively. So, we are looking to extend that product beyond the S&P 500 to add additional indices. We're also looking to extend and add additional futures contracts that will extend the product out in terms of the maturities. So, we're very excited actually about those developments in the equity market.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","And I think, Brian, the other question you had was on Bitcoin? Is that right?","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. And then, what I guess I'm getting at \u2013 I mean, it's definitely good development of these products. I would think they would be accretive to that RPC. I know Bitcoin is and BTIC is. So, maybe just your thoughts as you develop those into 4Q. Clearly, the member side of it might swing things around. But can we expect an uptick in the \u2013 a rebound in that equity RPC?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. John?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure, yeah. I think really what you saw this quarter, Brian, was more member activity trading than we saw then in Q2, which obviously they have a lower RPC also because there was more member activity. They hit more of the \u2013 more price tiers, which also had an impact to the RPC.","One of the things I also mentioned was the privately negotiated trades were down as more people are using Globex than the privately negotiated trades. And Globex has a lower RPC than those privately negotiated trades.","Sean, do you want to add anything to that?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah \u2013 no, I fully agree with what John said. If you look at the year-to-date RPC last year versus the year-to-date RPC this year, it's up substantially. So, it was similar to the Q3 event when as you know we saw very low volatility. If you, again, look at October, October has been a phenomenal month, with our equities complex up well over 100% on a year-over-year basis in the month.","In addition to that, I might mention, in terms of large open interest holders, Q3 obviously was a very quiet quarter, if I could say that. October, we're growing, if I could say, very, very strongly across all of the asset classes, in the financial scene, in particular. One thing I'd like to mention \u2013 one of the things that Derek and I say continuously is we look to grow our complex in any volatility environment. So, I think we're very pleased with the fact that we reached a record number of large open interest holders in each and every one of the financials asset classes during the month of September.","Remember, again, Q2 was relatively quiet so \u2013 but we had a record in FX, we had a record in rates, we had a record \u2013 new all-time record in equities. So, bringing new participants in, we're getting deeper penetration with our existing participants and we're growing much stronger brace \u2013 base, excuse me, to grow from.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","I want to add one more thing only because it's opportunistic, Brian, and John referenced it and I think it's important. When John talked about the lower rate per contract in the equity complex due to some ex-pit transactions, they are now migrating on to Globex, that is an extremely positive story for CME Group. Everything we've talked about since this company has gone public is about the liquidity coming to a central limit order book place to be the most cost-efficient marketplace in the world. This is validating our model. So, I want to make sure we understand. This is a good story not a bad story in that rate per contract because of where the business is going.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. That's really helpful. And then, maybe just to add on one on the interest rate, John, while you're at it on the equities. Maybe if you can talk about the development of the SOFR contracts and you've launched the SONIA as well. And maybe just describe what you think might be the substitution effect versus the Eurodollar and the futures \u2013 Fed Funds futures \u2013 or do you think the launch of these contracts will be additive to the overall volume; in other words, with a multiplier effect rather than a substitution effect?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. We definitely see right now and it is completely additive. So, we see the opportunity with the new interest rate benchmark to see basis trading in particular between that benchmark and the existing benchmarks, right. CME Group with our future open interest and Eurodollar futures, fed fund futures as well as the treasury futures, is the place to trade the basis between the new index and so the SOFR index, if I could say it, relative to those other indices.","We've offered intercommodity spreads against our Eurodollar futures, for example, and our fed funds futures. That means that it is the single most efficient place from an execution standpoint, so minimizing your execution costs to trade the bases between SOFR and LIBOR, or SOFR and OIS, or SOFR and Fed Funds.","In addition to that, we have \u2013 obviously, with the large open interest in fed funds and Eurodollars, in addition to that, the efficient from a capital margin and total cost perspective relative to the clearing with up to 85% margin offsets against all other futures contracts. So, in addition to that, in regards to SOFR, we now have over 80 participants trading SOFR contracts. We've got over 40,000 contracts open interest. That is the equivalent of over $155 billion in notional terms, and we're trading about 8,000 contracts a day this month. So, we are excited about that. In terms of SONIA, we have an ADV this month of 3,400 contracts. So, we're also getting very, very good traction there.","One \u2013 another unique value proposition that CME Group has that no other firm has, no other clearing house has in the world is \u2013 we're both clearing the SOFR interest rate swaps and we're clearing the SOFR futures. So, we did announce \u2013 we did start clearing SOFR interest rate swaps. We've cleared interest rate swaps for five different institutions. There was a great \u2013 if you've seen our press release \u2013 some of the top rates institutions on the planet have already started clearing the SOFR interest rate swaps with us. So, we also have that unique value proposition of having both the futures and the swaps and we have that both for SONIA and SOFR.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, John.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Dan Fannon, Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Terry, some of your domestic peers here are dealing with some regulatory scrutiny, and obviously from the SEC and not your primary regulator. But just wanted to get a sense of the dynamics of the rhetoric that \u2013 with the CFTC or anywhere else \u2013 is really changing and what you're focused on from a regulatory perspective at this point.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So, Dan, it's a good question because I think there can be a little bit of confusion between the two different regulators and the two different models. So, I'm assuming you're referring to some of the SEC rulings as it relates to pricing on market data, number one. And I'm assuming you're also talking about what we're dealing with from a regulatory standpoint from European equivalents on the other. Is that a fair way to categorize your question?","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Yes.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So, on the market data and how we work with our regulator, our regulator does not approve any pricing at CME Group, where the SEC obviously does. We have proprietary products that we invest a tremendous amount of revenue and tremendous amount of manpower into developing these contracts. You just heard Sean Tully talk about the SONIA, the SOFR, some of the other \u2013 the BTIC products that we have come up with and him and his team did to add value. So, we don't go down the path of having to get approval from the CFTC on pricing of these and that includes also our market data. So, that's different from the SEC model.","On the equivalents issue, you saw the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission a week or so ago get very aggressive with the Europeans, letting them know quite well that the U.S. will not be a political football \u2013 using my words, not his \u2013 and in this game between the UK and the EU as it relates to central clearing houses being able to do business in certain jurisdictions.","So, as the Commodity Exchange Modernization Act was written in 2000, our sole regulator is the CFTC and we cannot actually comply with what is being proposed out of a mere 2.0 by ESMA to be in that Tier 2 section because it would be technically against U.S. law. So, I think what's going on now is cooler heads are starting to prevail and will start to get the deference that the Chairman has been calling for here in the U.S. And that's why I see that outside of that from a regulatory standpoint I think, as we said earlier, we're thrilled about the Department of Justice and their approvals on our transaction and we're just going forward.","But outside of that and from a regulatory side, I think CME \u2013 and I've said this for a long time, the headwinds of CME are now behind us on regulatory issues. We've dealt with this between 2009 and say 2013, 2014 before all rules are finalized but the rules are the road here in the U.S. are very clear, and I think that's been a great benefit to not only exchanges like ours but the banking system of the United States as well.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Kyle Voigt, KBW.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess one just on energy open interest. I'm just looking at your WTI futures open interest specifically. It looks like, as of yesterday, it was tracking down about 10% year-on-year. And I think WTI is one of your three largest contracts by revenue and you posted a very strong growth over the past four years in this contract. So, I was just wondering, I guess, why the turn here for the open interest? And I was wondering, what do you think is causing that and whether you believe the structural growth for WTI is still intact?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Derek?","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. Kyle, it's Derek Sammann. Thanks for asking that. Yeah, I appreciate the opportunity. The TI contract has been a huge growth driver for, yeah, over the last four years for us and continues to do so. We saw an industry-wide slowdown in Q3 this year. If you actually look at the year-to-date market shares between, sort of the growth of our WTI contract, year-to-date we're down 2%. We're seeing ICE's Brent contract down about 4%.","In line with that, we are seeing some pullback in open interest. We hit a peak open interest level of about 2.6 million contracts in mid-May. We've seen that track lower; we're down just to about 2.2 million, pretty much in line with our Brent OIS as well. So, we are not seeing anything other than I think what has been a quiet period trading.","Generally, when you look at sort of the conditions of trading in the energy market through a Brent, through WTI, a market where you got high price, low volatility and where you see that TI-Brent spread move out, generally, that's a set of combination of factors that really kind of tends to provide some pullback for some market participants. So, we're not necessarily surprised. We are seeing an industry slowdown a little bit. But we're very pleased about it, as we're seeing the continued participation and strength of the commercial participants.","If you go back to probably 2012, 2013, 2014, we were probably underpenetrated with the commercial client base and the work we've done over the last four years, driving a lot of the growth that you just referenced in our TI contract has been predicated on getting into and being relevant and having the participation of those commercial participants. They were the contributing factor to record OI and TI up above 2.6 million contracts.","So, we've had a good start to Q4. I think our Q4 \u2013 our energy volume is up about 10%. We're seeing continued participation from the commercial participants, and you also saw us announced that we have a November 5 launch date for our Houston physical crude contract. So, we're excited about what that brings to the overall completion of the physical and a value chain from Cushing into the Gulf of the export market participants. And we've been working very closely with the commercial participants to get to that launch. So, certainly, the slowdown in Q3, we're seeing that pick up again along with our nat gas volumes year-to-date and going into Q4 as well.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. And then, if I could ask you a follow-up. Just wondering if you could give some high-level thoughts as to the \u2013 just because there's heightened investor attention around this \u2013 around the expected resiliency of your earnings stream through a cycle?","And there maybe are some potentially, like, obvious impacts to in \u2013 an adverse economic scenario maybe to your net investment income or the S&P index equity income that you have, right, in the income statement. But just trying to get a sense of really how you think your volume would hold up in that type of environment, just given that, during the financial crisis, we did see some large declines in open interest and volumes in certain product classes? Thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. Pardon me. I'll start Kyle. This is John. Then, I'll turn it over to Sean to make comment on some of the financial products. But generally speaking, as you know, we've got a very resilient model. So, even during the toughest times during the crisis, we still are very cash generative. We still had very good margins. And it's really a function of the need even in these \u2013 in those periods of time for people to hedge.","So, one of the things that Sean had mentioned in his comments is really developing the markets with regard to the volatility environment. So, what we've done is we've been able to grow even on the slowest days, our volume. So, if you look at our slowest 10 days, you see that increasing over the last several years. So, really, we're becoming embedded in our customers' day-to-day operations.","In terms of our financial profile, I would say you would see us taking a strong look at our expenses with our several line items, which we can take a look at. With regard to slowdown, the variable portion is you see in terms of our bonus, you also see in terms of our license fees. Those are two line items that will decline in a situation where we have declining volumes.","Also, in terms of our interest income line, that's really a function of where our customers want to invest their money. If there's a crisis and they want to invest their money in cash, we certainly would earn as they move to cash from fixed income. Also, in terms of other factors that we would take into consideration, it would be really around why the recession is coming. So, generally speaking, if it's a highly volatile situation, we'd see an uptick in volumes followed by obviously a slowdown, should there be a recession.","Sean?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, we continuously look, as John said, right, and I've mentioned it earlier, in every environment to grow our complex, right, with a record number of large open interest holders in each and every one of the financials asset classes during the Q3 when volatility was lower is, I think, a good example. Another good example is, during zero interest rate policy in the United States, we continued to launch a lot of new products and continued to grow the rates complex.","If you look today actually at our treasury futures complex, over the last 52 weeks, we're now running at over 111% of the average daily volumes of the cash treasury bond market. That number, if you'll recall, was in the mid-50s just five or six years ago, so huge growth there.","In addition to that, in terms of new products, we talked about SONIA and SOFR. We also launched new Eurodollar Mid-Curve options this year. Those are traded \u2013 the new contracts \u2013 a fifth quarterly as well as some term Mid-Curves three, six and a nine-month contract and have traded over 0.5 million contracts. I didn't mention actually earlier anything on the FX complex, but we're having very good success with our new monthly futures.","Our new monthly futures recently had a day of 33,000 contracts. We also traded at a spread to the quarterly another 12,000. So on that day, those new monthly contracts added 45,000 contracts to our FX complex. This obviously, if you think about our FX complex only does about 1 million contracts a day, so that's a very significant impact on the overall growth. We've also launched FX Link. FX Link recently doing about 9,000 contracts a day. This allows participants in the OTC FX swap market to move their positions into standardized listed lower total cost alternative. So, we're very excited about that.","In terms of the financial crisis, I think the overall system is in completely different place today. Bank balance sheets are strong. Economic growth is strong. And in a very strong environment where you see large price volatility, we see a lot more volume. And you can see that in October where our interest rate complex year-over-year in the month is up 43%, equities complex is up 116% and the FX complex is up as well. So, it is a very healthy volatility.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Just one last thing is \u2013 Kyle, just to put an exclamation point on what Sean was saying. If you look at our volume over the last 40 years, there's only been a handful of times where the current volume was less than the previous year's volumes. So, only a handful of times, and that's through a myriad of economic and financial conditions. So, as I was saying at the start, our model is very resilient and I think we are in a much better place today than we were even before the crisis.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hello. Hey. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just a couple of clarifications. Can you talk about the spread income that you're getting on a cash collateral held at the Fed and sort of the outlook into the fourth quarter after the September rate hike in terms of what you're getting and what you're paying out and maybe the cash collateral balances \u2013 the client cash collateral balances held at the Fed at the end of September?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure, Brian. Thanks. If you take a look at our financial statements, overall earnings from managing cash was up about $1 million, with returns on corporate cash offsetting lower earnings related to cash on deposits to clearing house. Those deposits were down about $1.5 billion on average versus the second quarter, and our earnings were down about $2 million sequentially.","Now, the rate of decline in terms of the average balances held at the clearing house has slowed compared to the decline between the first quarter and the second quarter, which was down about $7.5 billion. We've been retaining zero over the last couple of Fed hikes and returning all of that to our customers. We want to be competitive in terms of other investment alternatives that our customers have. So, looking at, so far in the month of October, we've seen those balances come down about another $1.5 billion from the end of September to today.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, just on the \u2013 some of the \u2013 non-GAAP items and the FX losses and the losses on derivatives and the debt cost for the acquisition \u2013 I guess, going into fourth quarter, are we going to be sustaining any of those debt cost relative to NEX? And then, maybe if you could just characterize the derivative losses and FX losses and your hedging programs there?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. The loss on derivatives line in our non-GAAP reconciliation is the loss on the FX currency hedges that we have for NEX. So, those would end once the transaction gets closed. In terms of the debt cost, we will roll those \u2013 those will start to roll in once the transaction closes. In terms of the other FX changes, that is \u2013 those will change a bit based on our go-forward hedging views, which we'll provide you some guidance on that once the transaction closes.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, just lastly on the annual variable dividend, it looks like you have $1.4 billion in excess cash, less the $700 million, I think that you typically earmark...","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yes...","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...balance plus the free cash flow that you'll be generating in the fourth quarter. And is it just the October and November because I think you just decide that in December or is it the full three months? Is that an accurate way to think about the variable?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. I would think about it \u2013 you hit it right on the head. We have $700 million in excess of our $700 million minimum. We will use cash plus commercial paper to fund the balance of the transaction and we do \u2013 that's a Board decision in terms of the annual variable dividend and that's \u2013 we usually review that with the Board end of November and early December, when we set the level for the annual variable dividend. And we take a look at the entire fourth quarter when we do that.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. Okay. Great. Thanks for the follow-up.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sameer Murukutla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Sameer Murukutla on for Michael. Just a quick question, given the recent default of one of your peers' clearing houses, Terry, can you just give us your thoughts on how you think the European regulators would respond? Would there be any increased call for skin in the game again? And how do you see the European reviews spreading across the pond, albeit with a more friendly regulatory environment here in the U.S.?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Sameer, I think it's really difficult to answer that question right now until all the facts are \u2013 been analyzed by NASDAQ and their counterparties. One of the things that we do not have here at CME, as you know, we don't have anybody that does not come through an FCM. So, there is an extra layer of protection that comes into our clearing house.","And as far as skin in the game goes, I'm always a big believer that you don't want to create a moral risk or a moral hazard by letting the exchanges who are agnostic to the price going up and down having \u2013 have someone have their capital put at risk first. We are big believers in people that introduce risks to the system should be putting the monies into the system and that is to protect, in my opinion, the smaller FCMs that are part of that default pool.","If you look here in the United States, some of our smallest FCMs are clearing some of the most important business around, which is how we all eat in this country and produce food and other products. And the banks don't clear those particular clients. So, if in fact they're a large bank or somebody else was to have a major default and take down some of the smaller FCMs, we think that would obviously be more catastrophic than what happened in Europe.","So, as far as skin in the game goes, we do believe that people who bring the risk, introduce the risk should be putting up the money to protect the entire system. And that to me is the fairest way to look at it. CME today \u2013 Sunil can comment \u2013 we have roughly across all our \u2013 about $400 million, how much do we have in the default funds?","Sunil Cutinho - CME Group, Inc.","$250 million.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","$250 million in our default funds across our businesses. We think we have a significant amount of money and skin in the game. Is it going to trickle back here to the U.S.? I think what I just laid out for you in a very short argument will hold \u2013 I will say that many more times I'm certain for months to come. But I've been saying it for years already, and I think the argument is extremely valid that whoever brings the risk and introduces it needs to make sure they put the money up to protect the rest of the system.","Sameer Murukutla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Terry. I appreciate the detail. Just a quick follow-up. Given the new rollout of this \u2013 the quick fault or derived dataset, can you provide us any update on what kind of inning you're in, in the derived data product maybe \u2013 and overall, on the market data product, what kind of attrition you're seeing and just in the quarter, what kind of audit fees you saw?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Yes. thanks. Well, I'll let Bryan Durkin comment on that for you. Bryan?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you. In terms of the derived business, we're very pleased in the context of the pipeline of demand that we have for our data to develop proprietary products, and we see that as a continuing trend. So, we're tracking according to our plan with respect to derived. In the context of overall market data and how we're faring there, we're actually quite pleased in the context that, as you know, the fee increase took effect April 1. Our customers have now had a good seven months to observe and adjust to that pricing change.","As we look at the attrition, our attrition levels are much lower than what we had contemplated or projected. So, we're quite pleased with how the market has reacted to that. And I think it underscores the validity of the product, the services, the market data platform that we introduced for them to be able to consume this data efficiently. So, from that perspective, we feel good about where things stand and the trajectory that we're on.","In the context of the audits, the audits are performing what we had hoped which is compliance with our program. So, you will see from time to time a chunky increase in the context of audit findings. As I've tried to make clear in the past reports, audit findings will be sporadic, though they may not be every quarter. It's based upon when the findings are completed and resolution of those cases with the firms.","What's more important is the context of correcting behavior. So, as you look at the attrition levels and those levels have actually decreased if you compare it to the past, I think that underscores that we're in the firms, we're helping people correct behavior and we're seeing people increase in terms of complying with their subscriber requirements.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","So, just to highlight something. We had about $2 million in audit findings in Q2 that we didn't have in Q3. So, the sequential \u2013 the balance of sequential decline was in a very small amount of attrition, to Bryan's point, much less than we had anticipated. Also, in terms of the go-forward, I would just highlight again that it will be sporadic in terms of when we find the audit findings and when they're going to be recognize in our financials.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Sameer, real quick, I just want to backtrack on one thing you said earlier that I actually said. I want to make sure that I was clear and I wasn't. We don't allow a single individual clear when it comes into our books. That was the scenario that played out on the NASDAQ power exchange that happened. It was a single individual clearer. We don't have that at CME. So, I just want to make sure we have that. That was what I was referring to.","Sameer Murukutla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Chris Allen, Compass Point.","Chris Allen - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. I just got real quick one. Just on the NEX deal, I think the last approval is the competition authority. And I believe that deal lapses if they do \u2013 if they send it to a separate review. I'm just wondering what happens in that scenario?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","What \u2013 so, Chris, I'm sorry. You \u2013 what happens in this scenario with what?","Chris Allen - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","If they push it to a second review \u2013 second level review with competition committee?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Right.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","So, yeah \u2013 and so, technically, it would \u2013 technically, it would lapse. But obviously, we've been looking at our alternatives at that point. So, we'd address it should that happen. I think what \u2013 as we've said and we do believe that the transaction will be closed before yearend. So we feel very good in terms of where we stand with the regulators.","Chris Allen - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. So, I'd like to turn this call back over to management for closing remarks.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Let me thank all of you for participating on the call today.

Also, note the final page of our earnings release contains a reconciliation to our GAAP results this quarter.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you very much, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to highlight CME Group's first quarter, and then turn it over to Jamie to review our financials.","We experienced a solid start of the year. First quarter average daily volume was 12.5 million contracts, up significantly from the 10.5 million contracts we averaged during the second half of last year. Open interest has jumped 18% year to date, up to 82.3 million contracts. Additionally, the first stage of the OTC clearing mandate was completed successfully, with cleared volumes roughly double what they were prior to the mandate.","Let me turn to the highlights of our core business. In the interest rate complex, we successfully grew volumes in open interest, up from the levels that we saw in the second half of 2012. Treasury volume has been particularly strong to start the year, with first quarter ADV of $3.4 million, up 24% compared to the same period last year. This included a Treasury futures monthly record of 3.8 million contracts in February, up 33% over the prior February, and we reached a daily all-time high of 10.1 million contracts on February 26.","Additionally, we've continued to successfully expand our options business with a record level of electronic trading of our 10-year Treasury note options of 54%, as well as generating 48% volume growth in our popular weekly Treasury options. Treasury options volume in February was the second highest month in our history. Overall, interest rate average daily volume was 5.7 million contracts in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 4.3 million during the second half of 2012.","Although the last 2 years have been challenging due to low volatility and low overall rates, we have invested in our interest rate complex through new product development to position it to strongly benefit once we come out of this difficult cycle.","In the intermediate and long term, we would expect an improving economy, the end to quantitative easing and increasing uncertainty around both the long and short ends of the curve, a large part of this for the franchise. This product line also stands to benefit from the migration of noncleared OTC interest rate swaps into clearinghouses and potentially, substitution of futures contracts for some of those OTC products. And CME Group's value proposition is significantly enhanced with the introduction of portfolio margining for both house and client accounts, creating powerful capital efficiencies for our global client base.","Looking at OTC, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a nice pickup in volume since Wave 1 of the CFTC clearing mandate kicked in on March 11, the first of a series of important dates for the industry. Since then, we have averaged 20 billion per day, which is nearly twice the amount we've cleared from the beginning of the year leading up to the mandate.","Interest rate swap open interest has also grown 44% to $1.4 trillion since the beginning of the mandate. Recently, 270 buy side firms have registered with CME for OTC clearing, and we are working closely with hundreds of firms and many intermediaries preparing for Phase 2 that begins on June 10. We continue to work to build liquidity in the deliverable swap futures contract, and we have 35,000 of open interest and several thousand contracts traded per day mainly by hedge funds asset managers, mortgage services and banks. Right now along with our FCMs and end customers, we are focused on on-boarding for Phase 2 of the mandate. Post June, we expect an increased focus on our entire suite of rate offerings, including call futures, the DSF product, as well as cleared swaps.","During March, we've successfully completed the first customer portfolio margining between cleared swaps and futures through one of our FCMs, and we expect 3 to 5 additional clearing members to provide this to end clients in a more scalable way later this quarter, driven by client demand.","The number of intermediaries automating this process should increase throughout the year. Our sales forces is increasingly hearing about the importance of capital efficiencies and our interest rate swap product suite offers the best opportunity to optimize deployed capital, leveraging our existing deep open interest across the U.S. yield curve.","We also continue to launch new products and product extensions for OTC clearing. During the first quarter, we launched interest rate swaps clearing through our European clearinghouse, and in the second quarter, we anticipate extending our OIS product out to 30 years, adding 3 new currencies, as well as launching amortizers based on customer demand.","Turning to FX. This complex continues to perform exceptionally well, driven by strength in our Japanese yen and British pound contracts, as well as significant year-to-date growth in our emerging markets FX product suite. First quarter ADV was 1 million contracts, up 19% year-over-year. It's important to note, we saw particular strength in terms of trading from Europe and Asia during Q1. Volume in FX trading during Q1 from Asia grew 60%, while activity coming from Europe was up 21%. This speaks to the continued FX market share gains we're achieving on a global basis. FX options also continued to be strong, up 70% in Q1 versus the same period last year.","In terms of FX open interest, we experienced record levels in March of 2.6 million contracts. Since the beginning of the year, our FX open interest is up 13%. In addition, we achieved a new record of 929 large open interest holders in Q1, up from barely 400 in 2009. This indicates that more customers are holding an increasing amount of FX risk at CME Group.","Equities have also performed well and have significantly outperformed our peer. Q1 2013 ADV was 2.6 million contracts, up 9% year-over-year. Growth was supported by net inflows through March of $135 billion into equity funds, as well as an increase in the VIX midway through the quarter, which contributed to strong volumes in February, up 22%; March, up 13%; and April, up 16%.","E-mini options were up 86% in Q1 versus last year and up 88% in April, supported by expanded participation in our weekly and monthly options. Also, in the quarter, volume in our Nikkei-based products was up 76% in our yen contract and 116% in our dollar contract.","In addition, open interest is up 23% year to date. Our metals complex has also benefited from recent volatility. This has driven all-time record April 2013 ADV of 532,000, surpassing the last high in August 2011. We also hit multiple records on April 15, which included combined futures and options trading of 1.5 million contracts, 78% above the prior record, and we set all-time trading records in gold futures, gold options and copper futures.","Turning to the agricultural commodities. The Kansas City Board of Trade integration is going well, and volume in that product was up 24% in Q1 versus first quarter last year and up 21% from the fourth quarter. Going forward, we are excited about the opportunity to leverage our leadership position in this category around the globe, especially in Asia.","Lastly, I will touch on our energy complex. April is a very strong month with ADV of 1.9 million contracts, up 20% versus the same period last year, driven by increased volatility, rising natural gas prices and ongoing corrections to infrastructure issues. In April, crude, natural gas and power were up significantly compared to the first quarter. In recent weeks, the WTI and Brent spread have tightened considerably to under $9 in the June contract and the Seaway pipeline boost of daily activity will continue to be helpful.","Longer-term significant U.S. production should help the WTI and our refinery natural gas products, with an increased focus on energy independence and the potential for exports. In the meantime, we are also focused on expanding global solutions through our DME and brand product offerings to grow our presence in key areas, such as Europe and Asia.","One final note, we had record total volume and revenue from Asia during the first quarter. We saw 24% volume growth in Q1 compared to the prior first quarter. And average daily volume totaled approximately 440,000 contracts per day. Transaction fee revenue from the region grew 31% compared to the prior year.","During the quarter, all fixed product areas grew, with particular strength in ags, FX and equity products.","In summary, we remain the only pure-play derivatives exchange with the widest range of benchmark products, covering all major asset classes. We continue to build on this by investing aggressively in our global growth strategy, which includes launching new products and product extensions, expanding our global footprint through further developments of infrastructure and partnerships, as well as enhancing our worldwide sales force, leading to unparalleled distribution of our products and better insight into customer needs. All of this, coupled with a strong expense discipline equates to significant cash flow generation. This has led to a consistently strong return of capital strategy to reward our shareholders while continuing investing in the future growth of the company.","Now I will turn the call over to Jamie to discuss the financials.","James E. Parisi","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to walk you through the detailed results for Q1. From a financial perspective, we had a nice quarter despite 4 fewer trading days compared to Q4. Our revenue jumped approximately $58 million, and our adjusted expense is only $7 million higher, resulting in incremental margins above 85%. Please take note that excluding the foreign currency fluctuation losses mentioned in the release, our earnings per share would have been $0.73, up over 15% versus Q4 adjusted EPS.","Let me start the Q1 discussion with revenue. The rate per contract for the first quarter was $0.785, down 6% sequentially. The largest driver was product mix. While we saw volume increases across all of the product lines, lower average fee products, like our interest rate contracts, saw faster volume growth than higher fee agricultural and energy contracts. Another driver of the lower average rate in Q1 was member-nonmember mix, as member volumes grew faster than nonmember volumes. We also saw an impact based on energy-related incentives.","First quarter other revenue was $23 million, up from $14 million in Q4, due primarily to a progress payment from BM&FBOVESPA related to our trading platform co-development.","Moving on, total first quarter operating expense was $301 million, excluding the previously mentioned FX impact. Breaking down operating expense in more detail, compensation and benefits was $129 million, up $16 million sequentially. This included $10 million of timing-related items that tend to impact Q1 more severely than other quarters. Examples include our vacation accrual that we'll reverse out later in the year, as folks take their annual vacations, and other employment taxes that are subject to cap that get hit earlier in the year. In addition, deferred compensation expense was $2 million higher than the prior quarter, as the U.S. equity market was strong in Q1. Remember, this is also recognized as interest income below the line, so it has a net 0 impact on our bottom line.","Finally, our bonus was up $4 million sequentially based on better performance versus our targets. Headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 2,615, up 50 during the quarter, including the KCBOT employees, continuing -- continued hiring in our Northern Ireland office to replace consultants and hires in growth areas like clearing and sales.","Overall, our teams have been very focused on being as efficient as we can on the cost front. Looking at noncompensation expense, each line item was flat to down with the exception of license fees due to growth in both equity and CME ClearPort volumes.","Turning to nonoperating income, we did not record a dividend this quarter from BVMF. We record dividends on the ex-dividend date, and the ex-date for their Q1 dividend fell in April this year. Based on what they've declared, our portion will be approximately $10 million. We will recognize this dividend in Q2, and depending on their timing, we may end up with -- may end up recording 2 dividends from them in Q2. We had been able to record -- if we had been able to record this dividend in Q1, our Q1 EPS would have been a couple of cents higher.","Turning to interest expense. This item totaled $39 million in Q1, which we guided to last quarter. We will be paying down our upcoming August maturity, and will likely look to issue new debt later this year to prefund the February 2014 bonds. Once we've worked through these near-term maturities, our run rate quarterly interest expense will likely be between $26 million and $27 million starting in Q2 2014.","Equity and gains in unconsolidated subsidiaries was $17.5 million, with good results from the S&P Dow Jones joint venture. In April, the company purchased the noncontrolling interest in CME Group Index Services, LLC for $80 million. Index Services had maintained a 24.4% interest in the S&P Dow Jones joint venture. As a result of the purchase of the noncontrolling interest, our share in the JV increased to 27%. We are also pleased with the recent extension of the long-term agreement between the JV and CBOE, which would favorably impact the JV's results beginning this year.","Turning to taxes. The pro forma effective rate excluding the FX impact was approximately 38.5%.","On the balance sheet, we had $1.9 billion of cash and marketable securities, up approximately $240 million during Q1, and capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $19 million in the first quarter, driven by technology spending.","In terms of guidance, our 2013 expense projection of $1.25 billion remains unchanged based on the expected timing of some growth-oriented investments later this year. In addition, our CapEx guidance remains between $140 million and $150 million.","April average daily volume so far has been good relative to Q1. Over the last 5 years on average, ADV has fallen 12% in April compared to the first quarter. This April, we were down only 7%, and the decline is skewed to the product lines with lower average rates. In addition, as footnoted in our release, please note that first quarter average daily volume in RPC figures do not include the KCBT volume, but the $2.3 million of transaction revenue generated is included in the first quarter clearing and transaction fee revenue on the income statement. The KCBT volume has been reported within the overall CME Group volume as of April 1.","In summary, we continue to focus on investing for the future. In particular, we have positioned ourselves to fully take advantage of the changing regulatory and competitive landscape, as well as the medium-term favorable cyclical trends. As always, while investing in our future, we also remain intensely focused on generating excess capital and returning it to our shareholders.","With that, we'd like to open the call up for your questions. This quarter, given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question, please. Please feel free to get back in the queue if you have further questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","My one question is going to be on OTC. Gill, you addressed a couple of points, at least, that I'm interested in. Even though you're still at about 10% of, let's just say, your peer on the interest rate swap clearing but with the promise of a big Phase 2 starting in June. And so I guess, my question is, of the 200 people or so you got connected, how many of those are already clearing? And can you give us any numbers on what you -- the uptake a little bit more specific in June? And then also, this portfolio margining. I know you mentioned it, but how available will it be for all the buy-side clients, come June?","Derek Sammann","Rich, it's Derek. I'll pick up on that. So a couple of points on the phase-in. So you've heard us talk a lot about the phase-in clients of the Phase 1. We didn't expect a lot of new clients to come on board then. The Phase 2 is significant, and I want to make sure we talk a little bit about the makeup of the group that we've seen so far. As you know, the Phase 2 clients are predominantly dollar based. Most of these are falling under the dollar-based mandate. And so far, about 61% of the products that we're clearing are dollar based, and only about 25% of that trading at LCH is dollar based right now. So given the fact that we see strength in our dollar-based platform on the clearing side and the bulk of the Phase 2 clients are dollar based, we think we will see some acceleration through that group. The 270 firms that Gill mentioned are those that have been working with us and we believe are prepared for clearing in that Day 1 time frame. So we think we're in a good position to capture a portion of that. Relative to the portfolio margining, we talked about this last quarter. We are prepared. We've rolled that out. We've had 1 or 2 FCMs prepare for that and actually have rolled that out selectively. But to be very honest, we don't expect that to be significantly taken up until we're farther into the phase-in on-boarding clients because it's a big impact on the FCMs, and they and we are primarily focused on on-boarding, getting clients into the clearinghouse. So we have that available. It's a function of bandwidth for the FCMs to work on portfolio margining.","Phupinder S. Gill","And Rich, it is available for both all clients, as well as all house accounts. Anybody who has a swap position that can be offset against the futures is eligible for that offset. So it is wide open to everybody. If you look at the overall scheme of things, the only exchange or the only CCP that has this margin offset is CME Group. No one else does have it. So from a capital-optimized perspective, it is the one solution out there that maximizes capital efficiencies for our client base.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My question's on the core business. Over the years, we've seen higher RPC be a good stabilizer when volumes are weaker and then get back a little when volumes improve. But I guess, when you look at the business complex by complex over the past 2 years or so, it seems like that historical relationship is slipping a bit. So I'm just curious. When you look at the data, do you agree with that? And what can you do to possibly help, like, restore that balance that we've seen over the years?","James E. Parisi","Yes, Howard, this is Jamie. I could start and my colleagues can jump in. As you look at it, it's very much, for the most part, a mix issue as we've touched on over time. Shifts between member, nonmember, shifts between the various products within a product set will also impact that. So I don't think there's anything concerning there for us at all. You did see this quarter, we've -- a few things impact the rate. The incentives, certainly on the energy side, impacted the energy rate. Those were tied to things like options incentives and incentives around new products like Brent. So it's -- really, what we're trying to do is drive volume growth across the products with things like that. So I don't see any concerns going forward.","Phupinder S. Gill","Yes. If I can just add, Howard, that what you're seeing over time is as we've had customers that are paying the full freight do more and more business, they would typically make a decision to take up membership, which may reduce their fees over time. And as more and more of these clients come on board, they will start at a high rate, and if it makes sense, they would pay the lower rate once they decide to become \"members\" of one or more of the CME Group exchanges.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen, Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","When I back out the KCBOT revenues, I'm arriving at a rate per million traded from over the counter about $3.35. I wonder if you could confirm that and just give us some color in terms of how to think about that rate moving forward and what may have impacted it this quarter, whether it's from the incentivized -- incentive pricing standpoint or anything on the competitive front.","James E. Parisi","Yes. Chris, this is Jamie. You're right. The average rate is in the neighborhood of $3 per million of interest rates, when you look at the combined rate of interest rate and CDS. And basically, our -- the total revenue for interest rate, CDS was about $2.8 million for the quarter. The rate per million was fairly consistent, I'd say, with the rate per million in the prior quarter. And what we're seeing is, on the IRS side, the average rate is slightly below the $3 per million rate. And really, when you look at Phase 1, it's very much concentrated in -- with the hedge funds who tend to have a higher percentage of those high turnover-type businesses who may avail themselves of our high-turnover incentive plan. So they're not putting on and holding a lot of open interests, the ones who are getting that incentive, so it's not taxing the clearinghouse as much. So that's the, kind of, the reasoning there. And as we go to the next phase, we would anticipate that there'd be a heavier mix of the non-high-turnover customers who would lift that rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm, UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to, I guess, Howard's question on the pricing, in particular, on the energy side here. Obviously, that declined a lot. And Jamie, you mentioned something about Brent and options, so maybe you can give a little bit more detail, in particular, because when I look at it, it seems like a lot of that came on the ClearPort side. So just wondering, there's been a lot of changes in the energy markets as it relates to ClearPort with ISRI restructuring and you're doing some changes here as well. So just wondering if there's some product shift as well or maybe you're competing a little tougher here or anything that's going on in that market.","James E. Parisi","Sure. Well, we're certainly competing a little tougher around the Brent where you're seeing those incentives. On the ClearPort side, you did see a decrease in the average rate there, and that was as a result of the conversion from EFS to blocks, which are at a bit lower rate. So that drove the ClearPort average rate down a little bit. And as I said, on the options front, we did some -- we've got some incentive programs going there. And Bryan wants to add in.","Bryan T. Durkin","But these programs are definitely having the intended impact in the context of the growth that we're experiencing, particularly across the Brent complex. We have several dozen firms now that are very actively trading in Brent. We've reached and exceeded an inflection point in terms of our open interest in their contract, and we're seeing a very heavy spreading occurring between the WTI and the Brent. And all of this is tied very much together in terms of the increasing dominance of the WTI contract, as we've indicated over the last several months. Looking at that spread and seeing how that spread is coming in is very indicative about the domestic prominence of U.S. production of crude oil. So all of these initiatives that we've undertaken are very strategic in the context of building up our crude, our refined products, as well as our options growth.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And those incentives are ongoing, right?","Bryan T. Durkin","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy, Raymond James Company.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So my question is about the deliverable swap futures that you guys launched a few months ago. Seems like you're getting some nice traction, some nice progress in terms of building up volume and then maybe saw a little bit of a step-back in April. Can you talk about the customer reception that you've gotten for those products and what your expectations are at this point?","Derek Sammann","Yes. It's Derek. I'll take that. On the deliverable swap futures, we've put that out in December to make sure that we were out in advance of the launch with the mandate kicking off on March 11. We wanted to make sure, based on client demand, that we had a product out there to go through a first roll. Customers are very concerned about that process of taking a future, then delivering into that swap. So we've maintained, I think, about 35,000 or 36,000 contracts open interest. That first roll of March, we saw about 25% of those products actually deliver into a cleared swap, which is a little bit higher than we would normally see but actually, about what we expected given the customer desire to make sure that process works smoothly. What our customers have told us is they wanted to get through a delivery cycle. They wanted to make it deliver and rely on that liquidity and that volume. But also, we're not as surprised to see the banks who are participating in the large parts in that market are also focused, as are we, on on-boarding through these first phases. So we've maintained levels of open interest. It certainly is there as an alternative to those customers that may not be able to get on board for cleared swaps. So we're pleased with where we are. We've got good open interest, ADV about 4,500, and increase of market makers are beyond just the 4 or 5 dealers we have. And the considered add participants. So very pleased about where we are.","Phupinder S. Gill","Just to add there and, as you said, there are 27 FCMs that currently cleared, and there's a recent report by Morgan Stanley that basically articulated that the Treasury futures and swap futures are going to benefit from Phase 2 and, in particular, those high clients that won't be able to make the cut on June 11, they have an alternative. And the sales force at Morgan Stanley and a couple of the large banks are going push deliverable swaps.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller, BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So I just wanted to touch on the Obama derivative tax overhaul. It seems like the mark-to-market tax accounting and the elimination of this 60-40 tax treatment for derivatives could have an impact on the desirability of futures products in general. Maybe you could just kind of discuss the potential impact of the tax changes on your business and how likely you think they are to actually come about.","Terrence A. Duffy","Jillian, this is Terry Duffy. I think that the President's budget, if you look back historically, we have seen this going back to the first President Bush where they had the elimination of the 60-40 tax treatment, and they also have a transaction tax put in their budget. As you know, 60-40 is still in play, and it was voted in along the early '80s that the transaction tax has still not happened. I believe that most people on the Hill understand that this would be a detrimental tax against a very small, few people, good for folks who create a tremendous amount of liquidity. As you may or may not know, corporates do not get 60-40 tax treatment today, only individual market makers do, which make up a tremendous amount of the liquidity in the market. They know the bid-offer spreads were widened. This is a $2.5 billion score over 10 years, and if you look at the federal budget, that doesn't even hit the first line of the first balance sheet. So I think people know that would be cutting off their nose to spite their face if they try to deploy or eliminate 60-40 because of the mark to market and no long-term capital gains in futures trading. So I do think that will not prevail. Also, Chairman Camp, out of the Ways & Means Committee, has proposed to restructure the tax code as you know, and he is -- actually said that he would have an elimination of 60-40 tax treatment if and only if the top-end rate was to be 25%. I don't believe that will happen either, but that would not hurt our business whatsoever if that happened. And again, with the transaction tax, people are looking at the Tobin tax. As you know, that's an economist over in Europe who's proposed a transaction tax in Europe, of which some of the European countries have approved it, but what is interesting about that tax is that has to go for a final vote at the year end after the German election in November, and I don't think that's going anywhere either because the EU has already said they will not accept it. So I do believe that some of these taxes that have been proposed and the elimination of certain treatment is something that we have seen historically, and we are on top of it. And I'm somewhat -- I am confident that we will be able to continue to fight this back.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon, Jefferies Company.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I know you haven't disclosed it in a while, but maybe if you'd talk about it in general terms about your customer mix and talk about the segments that are behaving well. And also maybe the dynamic when rate volumes have spiked at points in time, how that might have changed, in terms of who's more active or if it's generally broader based.","Phupinder S. Gill","I'll start and then I'll ask Derek to talk about the rate side. There's been no major change in the mix of the client base as we had spoken in the past so that there's nothing to update you on that. On the rate side?","Derek Sammann","On the rate side, we've talked about this before, particularly as it relates to deliverable swap futures. It had more participation from the dealer side of liquidity provision on some of the products that could be complements or, perhaps, products that segue from OTC swaps into overall futures. What we have done is continue to have healthy participation across the rate spectrum between the maker and the taker side. We actually have seen more of a product shift out of euro, dollars into Treasuries. Treasury's about 60% overall of our volume right now. So when you look at the growth of that Treasury side, it is important to note, Gill mentioned that we hit some records in February in our Treasuries complex, and those are records stood back and -- or that were set back in '07, '08. So a lot of folks are asking us, \"Well, what do you see the spike in volumes to be?\" We're already exceeding the levels from the Treasuries complex now in this difficult environment that we set back in '07, '08. Drivers of that certainly build out more products, specifically to address the client shift to make sure we had products that would address the needs of the asset managers, pension funds and long-only guys like Ultra Bond. So product development has been focused on bringing client segments in, as well as diversifying into parts of the curve where there's volatility.","Bryan T. Durkin","I'd like to add -- it's Bryan -- on to that in the context of the broad asset classes that we represent and the strong client outreach that you all know we've been working on over the last couple of years. It is definitely having its impact in terms of bringing in new client base across a more diversified usage of products. And I'd say we've seen that very prevalent in the hedge fund and the asset management community. And again, I think it goes to the very targeted focus of our sales team.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jamie, just on the expenses and maybe the other revenue, just some moving pieces, but just want to understand on the expenses, just given the $301 million run rate and then if we just take the guidance, you would be at, like, a $316 million, I think, roughly going forward. And I know there are some items that are coming online throughout the year. So maybe just give us an update on the timing of when we should expect the expense increase throughout the quarters. And then just on that other revenue line, just given that BVMF, like, the progress payment, just remind us, like, how often can we see that or is that a onetime. Just trying to gauge that other revenue line.","James E. Parisi","Sure, on the -- in terms of the expenses, going forward, as you know, the run rate, given the guidance, is higher than what we experienced in Q1. I think going forward, the big changes or the -- where you'll see some of that come through more dominantly is in compensation, pro fees and marketing. Compensation is going to grow as we fill open positions to meet existing needs, as well as growth opportunities. The pro fees always comes in lumpy, but as we continue to invest in growth opportunities like the European exchange, for example, and regulatory compliance, we should see a higher run rate there going forward. And on marketing, again, it's lumpy. It tends to be more back-end loaded, tied to events and branding that occur later in the year. So as I look across the quarter, it's hard to give you a hard and fast -- I'd say it's fairly evenly distributed across the remainder of the year.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then anything on that other line, on the revenues?","James E. Parisi","Sure. I'll -- was the question around the progress payment from BVMF?","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, just in terms of -- I know you've had some of those in the past, but just give us an update on -- is that -- ending, can we continue to see some of that in the future?","James E. Parisi","Yes, this -- it was tied to the delivery of the equity platform, which is up and running and has been very successful. They're very pleased with the platform. And there's, I think, one more phase, but I don't anticipate there being any significant payments from that this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Harris, Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is on capital management. So you guys kind of ended the quarter here with a fair amount of cash on the balance sheet, and I know we have some debt to pay down later this year. But it still seems like you guys are going to be generating a significant amount of cash, and just wondering if you could quantify for us what your appetite is to return capital this year, whether it be through share buybacks or another special.","James E. Parisi","Well, as you know, our bent is very much towards dividends, and we pay out 50% of prior year cash earnings in our regular dividend. And then, at the end of the year, we'll do the analysis around another fifth dividend, a variable dividend, that we do each year. And this past year, we pulled that into December for tax reasons because of the uncertainty in the tax rules. But going forward, I'd say the timing around that variable dividend is very likely going to be the beginning of each year, as we are able to look at the results from the prior year. So probably in the February-March time frame. But yes, we're very much committed to returning that excess capital to the shareholders.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So just to confirm, nothing for buybacks this year we should expect?","James E. Parisi","I wouldn't put that as a high priority, no.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander, KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Can I go back to the deliverable futures because I -- you mentioned Morgan Stanley's report, but they had taken a stake also in your -- in the competitive, I guess, the ISRI exchange venue, but where do you stand or what's your view on the collateral differential and especially, I guess, Bloomberg's lawsuit with respect to the CFTC? Arguing that 5 days VAR for swaps versus 1 day for future isn't fair. I mean, does that -- that should, all else equal, maybe favor futures? But do you think the lawsuit itself, could that maybe slow some of the transition into futures? Or maybe people will just -- saying, \"Oh, it -- heck, it's just so much easier, I'll do a future instead of a swap.\" Could the lawsuit kind of pose any threat to the opportunity there or slow it maybe?","Phupinder S. Gill","I'm not sure what the lawsuit will actually do. I think the lawsuit addresses the cost-benefit part of the 5 day versus 1 day, and the CFTC has done sufficient work. We have a very strong view as to what these margin requirements represent, and generally speaking, we believe that CCP should be left to set margin levels that they deem appropriate given the risk management or the risk characteristics of the products that exist. I'll ask Kim to say a few things about what the 1 day and 5 day actually mean.","Kimberly S. Taylor","Yes. I think we're very much on record as pointing out that both of these product sets are evaluated by us in setting margins on a risk basis, and they pose a different risk profile, mostly with regards to the visibility and accessibility of liquidity in the over-the-counter spot and the ability to liquidate those products very promptly. And we feel that they are margined completely in the same fashion, even though the results end up with one product having currently a 5-day margin and the other product having currently a 1- or 2-day margin, depending on which product it is. The other thing, I think, I would want to point out is that the -- I totally agree with Gill that we feel that clearinghouses should be allowed to set margins based on the risk profile that they see in the product. The risk profile of the swaps may change over time. The other problem with the way that the issue's being addressed is that even if the CFTC were to change its rule, the need for the 5-day margin period of risk for swaps is embedded in a lot of other international best-practice standards, and the Basel capital framework, in such a way that I don't think that things would change even if the CFTC had a different rule.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Bedell, ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just to go back to the interest rate complex and the swaps, maybe, Derek, if you can comment about the activity around that June 10 deadline. Obviously, a lot of clients are catching right now. Is there any testing going on in the live environment or do you expect that to really inflect upward as we get very close to the date? And then your sense of usage subsequent to that -- the June 10 date and if you can comment on, do you think that will be a better infection in terms of adoption of futures usage, again subsequent to that date? And then also just on the September time frame, how important that is relative to the June date? And then just lastly on the rate complex, the member, the lower RPC, was that completely driven by the member-nonmember mix? Or were there other things going on?","Derek Sammann","I'll try to answer your 4 questions in one answer if I can. Let me start with your last question very quickly because there is a point in here that I wanted to mention when this came up before on the rate side specifically that where there had been some shifts that have been trending and pushing rate per contract lower in some of the member-nonmember mix, we have been offsetting portions of that downward pressure by actually putting customers into higher rate per contract products. So if you look at the interest-rate complex as a whole, a higher percentage of our rates complex is in Treasuries right now and that's a higher rate per contract product. So we've offset some of that customer shift mix, which is a downward pressure, by shifting into higher-rate product, which is Treasury. So I just wanted to get that off the board.","James E. Parisi","And if I could just comment on the member-nonmember mix impact on the interest rates, yes, it weighed on the average rate there, but remember, it's a mix issue. Both member and nonmember volumes increased versus the prior quarter. It was just that the member increased faster than the nonmember.","Derek Sammann","And I'll come back on the kind of the swaps and futures side very quickly as well. So you've heard us talk about these 270 firms. The firms that are in pipeline in debt with us is a much broader number than that, and some of these have been testing with us for 6 months, explicitly letting us know that they need to be ready for the points at which the switch would be flipped. So I think that a fair number of these guys are ready to go. In terms of the mix of the customers we're seeing right now, we've got a very high proportion of our business that's IRS, so it's the longer-dated products. We've recently put out some increased product specs that provide a broader set of OIS clearing capabilities as well. So we think we'll be able to capture a larger piece of that OIS dollar business particularly for the Phase 2s and Phase 3s. So you have about 84%, 85% of our mix right now is OIS, very good because that's longer, kind of stickier open interest for us. The OIS is shorter but a higher turnover business for us. And as I said, we're doing about 65% of the dollar business right now, and a big chunk of the Phase 2 June and Phase 3 September clients are primarily dollar based, so we're very well positioned to pick up a larger percentage of that dollar-based product -- user base as they come online about June and September.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So we're really not seeing the pickup yet in the volumes, and obviously, we should be seeing that in June.","Derek Sammann","Yes, we're going to see this come through in the same way that we saw with the March date, where we're seeing a lot of preparation, but you could see deceleration in and through that date. So we're anticipating not necessarily the ramp-up before but through and following on into the third phase as well. But one last point on that, we have seen an increase in our volumes, our April -- our numbers this past month are up -- almost 100% from last month. So 88%, I think, is the precise figure in terms of our monthly flow. So we are seeing the increase. We expect to see that accelerate post June 11.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gaston Ceron, Morningstar Research.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Jamie, I know you mentioned the Indexes JV a little bit during your prepared remarks. Just curious if you could give any additional color on how that business is going. And then also, if you could say anything about co-location?","James E. Parisi","Sure. The Index JV is operating very well for us. You can see a small increase in our -- in the line -- in the operating income or the nonoperating income driven by -- partly by better or improved economics there. And in terms of co-location, we did guide last quarter to a decrease in that business as a result of the shrinking footprint on a per-customer basis, though the number of customers has actually grown a little bit coming into co-lo. We're on target for that guidance. We were a little bit below it this quarter because we didn't have the full quarter impact yet because the new contracts came into effect mid-quarter. So we'll be down around that -- the number that we had, the $20 million or so that we had guided to last quarter. We'll be down around that number going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akhil Bhatia, Rosenblatt.","Akhil Bhatia","I'm sorry if I missed this, but what were the total OTC revenues in the quarter?","James E. Parisi","They were about $2.8 million.","Akhil Bhatia","Okay. And then just on the other revenues, you had the delivery fee from BOVESPA this quarter. How much was that? And what -- how do we think about that going forward?","James E. Parisi","Yes. I don't want to call it out specifically because it's a contract between us and them, but I would just say going forward that it's not something that we would consider a recurring revenue. There's one more phase that's due -- I believe one more phase that we're working on that's due with them, and so I wouldn't anticipate that hitting us coming into it this year.","Akhil Bhatia","Is it fair to say we get back into the high teens of millions going forward as you did the last few quarters?","James E. Parisi","For?","Akhil Bhatia","For other revenues.","James E. Parisi","For other revenues?","Akhil Bhatia","Yes.","James E. Parisi","It's hard to say. I think, yes, it'll come back down relative to that progress payment.","Operator","And our final question comes from Alex Kramm, UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to get a quick follow-up on the capital side here. One, first off, like, I think you said earlier, Jamie, that given that the fourth quarter special dividend in the prior fourth quarter was really just because of the tax reasons, and now you should go back to beginning of the year. I thought when you and I have talked in the past that you thought in the fourth quarter you have enough visibility already that you can actually start paying at the end of the year now than the beginning of the year. So just wondering if there's a change of thinking here to move that back in the first quarter or if I missed something. And secondly, I think there's been some discussions on building sales and things like that, that could clearly impact the special dividend. So I think there's been some discussions around NYMEX and also KCBT, so any more color you can give there in terms of timing, magnitude? I think NYMEX was priced at like $500 million last time I saw a number. So any color you can give here would be helpful.","James E. Parisi","Sure. In terms of the timing of the dividend, we never committed to continuing in the fourth quarter. One of the considerations as we thought about, should we continue pulling forward in the fourth quarter or just waiting until the end of the year. Obviously, waiting until the beginning of next year, you have a very clear view of what the prior year is. And the other factor for individual shareholders is you're not pulling the tax on that dividend into the current year, so a few months' timing, in our mind, made all the sense in the world to put it into the next year. Sorry, the other question was on?","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The buildings.","James E. Parisi","The buildings, yes. So as we said, we're not in the business of -- our core is -- our core competency isn't owning and operating and leasing out the office space. So we're always taking a look at our real estate portfolio to see if it makes sense to sell any of those buildings. You saw us do it with the Board of Trade with the sale leaseback, so it's certainly something that we'll analyze around the building in New York, and with the building in Kansas City, it's much smaller in scale. But that, since we're moving operations back here in time for July, I believe, that building will very likely sell this year.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So -- but no color on NYMEX in terms of time or value or anything like that? Too early yet?","James E. Parisi","Nothing at this point. It's too early.","Operator","That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I now would like to turn the call back to management for closing comments.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you all for joining us this morning. We will look forward to talking to you as the next 3 months go on, and see you all in about 3 months. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."],"5491":["CME Group Inc.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Peschier. Please go ahead, sir.","John Peschier","Great. Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm going to start with the Safe Harbor language. Then I'll turn it over to Terry for brief remarks followed by questions. Other members of our management too will also participate.","Statements made on this call and in the other reference documents on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.

We appreciate your interest in CME Group. My comments today as John said are going to be very brief, so we can get right into your questions.","We released our Executive commentary this morning which provided extensive details on the first quarter. During our last call, I mentioned that we had strong tailwinds to finish the year. We had made the most of it also. Market conditions changed significantly from the prior quarter, and volatility did drop across virtually every asset class.","Despite the change in the trading environment, we were able to post our third highest futures and options quoted in our history, while we kept our expenses relatively flat.","More importantly, we continue to execute on our long-term strategy to attract new clients and to launch new innovative products. We had significant customer engagement. We ran strategic targeted campaigns educating market participants and new non-core products and product extensions as well as cross selling through all our product lines and into new cash markets and optimization services.","During the first quarter all six product areas had an increase in their business from outside the U.S. We continue to launch innovative new products, tools and services to support customer needs and to create capital and operational efficiencies from market participants.","In Q1, we had multiple volume and open interest records including Sulphur futures, FX Link, Bitcoin Futures, Treasury Futures, Invoice Spreads, Copper Options and our New West Texas Intermediate Houston product.","Within the NEX market business, the combined EBS and BrokerTec monthly revenues in Q1 came in fairly close to the Q4 results. This is despite as I said earlier, much lower volatility.","On the core futures and options side, our open interest rose from 118 million contracts in mid-March to more than 134 million contracts last week. And today, it sits just north of 132 million contracts, which is not too far from our peak in 2018.","We remain very excited about the opportunities in front of us. With that short summary, we would like to open the call for your questions. And based on a number of our analysts covering us, we'd ask you to limit yourself to one question, and then get back in the queue. Thank you. And we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto","Yes. Good morning Terry. Good morning John and team. I guess the first question has to do with the contribution from my NEX and when we're looking at the rate per contracts, the revenue per million for EBS and BrokerTec, we're back into what appears to be declines quarter-over-quarter in the mid -- you know double digits around 15%. I just want to see whether that's accurate? And just general color on the -- on the NEX integration as well, but first the -- the revenue per million please?","John Pietrowicz","Yes, hi Rich, this is John. I think what you would you need to look at when you look at the rate per million is in the BrokerTec business, the two primary drivers of the revenue are treasuries and European repo. The U.S. repo is a small portion of the overall business at this time. So that's one thing to take a look at. Also, the sensitivity to volume at BrokerTec is less than it is say at EBS or CME Group.","But when you look at as Terry mentioned in his prepared remarks, when you look at the volatility environment in Q1 versus Q4, it is substantially lower in Q1 than in Q4. But when you look at the revenue for the quarter, for the markets business, it held up remarkably well and it was down only 3% sequentially. Sean?","Sean Tully","Yes. I mean in particular you need to get the product mix, right. So you saw a growth in the first quarter in European repo in particular and the repo RPCs are much much lower as John mentioned, than the outright treasuries for example.","John Pietrowicz","In terms of the integration question Rich, we're very pleased with how the integration is progressing. We're on plan to achieve this year synergy targets. We have a staffing event related to integration mid-year along with a plan cut over for some administrative systems, which will support the consolidation of the internal functions.","And we're also on track to combine office space in New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong and London by the end of this year, which will free up some leased space. And as we mentioned on the last call, we are targeting customer migration to glow backs with BrokerTec in 2020, and EBS in 2021.","Rich Repetto","And anything on the, the question was on the EBS capture as well?","John Pietrowicz","In terms of the EBS capture, I think when we -- when you take a look at you know when you take a look at the activity, again it's a mix issue between the G10 activity and the rest of business. So the more activity that occurs in spot G10 that tends to have a lower rate than CNH and the NDFs","Rich Repetto","Got it. Thank you very much, John.","John Pietrowicz","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Moving on. Our next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. I guess a follow up on just kind of the overall expense profile of the first quarter showed some concern -- some slow start versus your guidance. It sounds like the synergies are more back end loaded. So we should just expect a ramp here as the year progresses, and I guess characterizing the volume environment in April is still not being all that robust. I guess how should we think about kind of that build of expenses?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks Dan. I think the -- when you take a look at our expense profile for the year, we are expecting to have a staffing event in the middle of the year. So we will be you know we'll be updating our synergies target at that time. I and also like I have mentioned previously, we'll have some cut over, some systems, and we're going to be consolidating some office space left. I have better clarity in terms of the synergy capture for this year. As the management team looks at synergies, we're looking to accelerate the synergy capture as much as we possibly can.","In terms of the expense guidance, yes we you know when you take a look, we did have, you know the first quarter was lower relative to the rest of the year, but we will be having some ramp up in in work done on systems for these -- for the rest of the year. So it's really more timing around projects and as they as they get launched. But we'll be able to provide some more color on with the second quarter call.","Dan Fannon","Got it. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","All right. Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Herbert from Citi.","Ben Herbert","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Could you maybe just give us an update sticking with next year. Just an update on the cross-sell efforts through particularly their non U.S. channels?","Bryan Durkin","Hi, this is Bryan speaking. The thing that we're really excited about is the ability to cross-sell the multitude of product offerings that we have bringing together the strong markets capability along with the optimization services that we provide. I think what I'm most proud of right now is through this integration process, we are working together. We're not skipping a beat in terms of the seamless performance of these new platforms that we've acquired and as we're going through the integration process.","The client base is very enthusiastic about what we have on the horizon in terms of the new capabilities and functionalities that will be associated with the cut over and migration onto Globex from the market's perspective. But I think even more important is we're able to solve issues and challenges today by bringing together the combined forces of what we've had under the historical CME Group adding on the NEX components. As we look at improving capital efficiencies and addressing margin efficiencies post trade challenges that firms have been encumbered with using and leveraging the capabilities that we have across the CME Group is having a very positive impact with our client base.","Ben Herbert","Thank you.","Operator","And moving on we'll hear from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning.","John Pietrowicz","Good morning Brian.","Brian Bedell","Thanks. Just to go back to the expense guidance. The -- I guess right now it implies about a 3% to 4% quarterly increase in run rate from the very good 1Q level. Maybe if you could just touch on which areas you expect that to move up and I know John you mentioned the staffing event at midyear. If you can just talk about in addition to that, what type of flexibility you might have if the volatility environment stays really late?","And then also just one clarification on the new fee program on noncash collateral from 1 bips to 5 bips with the revenue impact on the quarterly run rate?","John Pietrowicz","You've got a lot in there Brian. So let's talk about expenses first and then we'll break down. We'll break down your other points. So, in terms of, in terms of where we see the expenses coming in a little bit, a little bit heavier in the quarter, really it's around, it's around when projects get implemented. So we've been staffing you know some contract workers so you see professional fees will tick up.","Our professional fees if you look historically tend to be lighter in the first quarter. And then they tick up as projects get under way during the during the year. So I'd expect professional fees to go up a bit. On the compensation line, you'll see that tick up a little bit, but then, like I mentioned, we'll be having a staffing event which will occur mid-year so then that would come back down.","And then, also, depreciation will be rolling in as systems get put into production, then it rolls out of work and process and gets amortized into depreciation. So that's another, another line.","And then obviously in our CME, legacy CME expenses tend to be heavier in the fourth quarter as we've got a lot of customer facing events that occur in the fourth quarter. So you'll see a tick up in the fourth quarter. So that kind of gives you an idea of some of the breakdown.","Then, when you look at the levers for us, should there be a prolonged downturn in volumes. You know, well first off I think, if you take a look at CME Group over the last several years, I think it's safe to say that the entire organization has done an excellent job in managing that, the expenses and that mindset is continuing. You know obviously if there's a prolonged downturn in volumes, you will double down our efforts in terms of managing our expenses. We do have some discretionary costs that we can put a sharper lens to things like travel and entertainment, marketing spend that may not drive near-term results. But, we obviously are not going to do anything that impacts the future growth, the trajectory of the business.","As I mentioned before, as normal course of the integration, the entire management team is looking at ways we can accelerate the synergy capture where we where we can. So that's another thing that we are, we're focused on. But to put it in perspective, we did have our third best volume quarter in our history, so I think it's a bit premature to talk about potential, potential reductions in costs at this point although we do have a strong view on cost containment cost control.","Then you mentioned the change in the collateral fees. Yes. That the change the collateral fees will go into effect July 1st. We're increasing the non-cash collaterals fees from 1 basis point to 5 basis points. We have approximately $100 billion in non-cash collateral, excess non-cash collateral and guaranty fund contributions are not impacted by the fee increase. And that's approximately $20 billion.","Now non-cash collateral will fluctuate based upon trading activity and also based upon the mix of non-cash collateral to cash collateral. But that kind of gives you some ideas around of what we're looking at there.","Brian Bedell","That's about it. It looks like $40 million annualized if it's 4 basis points increase on $100 billion?","John Pietrowicz","Well, it's \u2013 you\u2019ve got to take out like I mentioned before, you got to take out the guaranty fund contributions and the excess collateral. And as I said, that's $20 billion.","Brian Bedell","Got it. Great. Thank you so much. Super helpful.","John Pietrowicz","All right. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Alex Kramm from UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning everyone. Just wanted to come back to the NEX opportunity set that you addressed earlier. I mean, obviously we've talked about this in pretty big generalities for about a year now, and but now that you've owned this asset for six months or so and clearly you're doing projects and talking the groups that target each other maybe you can just help us by giving us maybe the single largest individual opportunity that you see and what the timeline is, so we can get a little bit more concrete here? Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Alex, thanks. I\u2019ll ask Bryan and Sean both to comment on that, because, we think there's multiple opportunities that we're yet to talk about but they can give you a little bit of a color what they're looking at today.","Bryan Durkin","I'm going to take the optimization side and Sean can speak to the markets if that's all right. On the optimization side of the equation, as you all well know our marketplace and particularly our banking institutions have been challenged consistently with maintaining costs and capital efficiencies through the acquisition and the combination of our optimization services along with our excellent clearing services in post trade capabilities. We're already as we speak, you know as I alluded to earlier, operating as an integrated team of people working with our clients to find solutions for greater capital efficiencies.","We're offering them streamlined connectivity and processing capabilities through the complement of the optimization services of triReduce, triBalance, triResolve, Traiana [ph] and bringing those things together as a combined force and not necessarily operating them as independent businesses or silos. Just having the combined efforts along with Sunil\u2019s [ph] team to be able to work with and identify solutions for our firm's real time has been it's been a strong positive force and is being very well received by our clients. So when you think about having the potential for centralized risk management capabilities across, the cash across the listed futures that we offer and OTC products, our clients today are very excited and enthusiastic about the services that we're going to be able to provide by these combined forces.","John Pietrowicz","Yes, I totally agree. Fine, I might actually say a couple of things in the optimization area. First and foremost, you have the uncleared margin rules right, which has hit the largest banks, but have not hit all the participants yet. So on September of this year, we expect to see on the order of 50 new participants. They'll be hit by the globally. They'll be hit by the unclear margin rules. And then in September of the year after it could be close to a thousand different participants that are potentially impacted.","You see any group with its optimization businesses and its existing clearing services can address every single aspect of client\u2019s needs around those problems. You've got triResolve, which can look at the margin of uncleared -- of the uncleared margin. So in other words, the sending out of the messages, the reconciliations of margin etcetera. You can calculate, let's try calculate, the sim or those uncleared margin requirements.","You can try to avoid, having to post uncleared margins, or reducing the outright margin that they have needed between the parties, by using the triBalance service. You can also use triReduce in order reduce your notional outstanding in order to try and reduce the you know the need to actually post margins. On the other hand, just like it was the Dodd-Frank. You can then move people from uncleared space into cleared space, and you can move in particular their FX options, as well as you know the NDFs from unclear space to cleared space or you can move them directly into our futures complex.","So we have the totality of solutions for the marketplace as you approach the increasing demand for solutions to the unclear margin rules. In particular, relative to services that we have launched previously and you've heard a lot about, in terms of our portfolio marketing between futures and swaps.","In the fourth quarter, the savings that we were \u2013 or where the efficiencies that we were offering the marketplace was about 2.6 billion. Currently, we're saving the market about 4.3 billion, so clearly about 4.3 billion where the efficiencies relative to portfolio margin. This has led to growth in things like invoice spreads, so invoice spreads for example, the ability to trade CME Treasury Future as the spread to a swap and to clear them both the CME creating huge margin and capital efficiencies. That's grown from 89,000 contracts today last year to exactly 134,000 contracts today in the first quarter and 118,000 contracts a day so far this year at $1.92 RPC, a very nice add to our futures business.","If we move over to the market side, we're very excited. It's very early days in terms of our ability to do a couple of things; first of all, cross-selling. You know the future clients into the OTC products that we have as well as the our OTC clients or the EBS clients for example into our futures products. We see those two marketplaces as highly complementary.","If you think about total cost analysis and you think about what investors and the buy side, sell side accounts are all interested in. They're interested in the lowest possible total cost. And if you can to the extent that you can, and we are going to be focused on it, you give access to both liquidity pools right, or even in some sense combine the liquidity pool experience and the FX market for example. Think, think about what we can do? Your total cost, the largest cost is your bid off a spread. So to the extent that we combine the liquidity pool of call it the 80 billion, 90 billion a day on EBS with a 80 billion, 90 billion a day in our FX futures.","While you recall last year, we launched FX Link, which links those two marketplaces with the base history. When you start to combine those liquidity pools what do you do? You\u2019re taking that bid off the spread. You\u2019re taking that bid off the spread because those two markers are quoted differently. Number one and number two, you deepen the book. So by tightening the bid off the spread, and deepening the book, and cross-selling into a larger marketplace is a much more compelling, better value proposition than we've ever had before in a foreign exchange market. And we're going to be able to access a much larger client base. It's early days, but that's the vision.","Alex, hopefully that gave you a little color on the optimization of markets businesses and why we're so excited by it because of the opportunities that we see. And again, I think what both Bryan and Sean outlined is operational and the cost efficiencies which is exactly what you need to grow any marketplace and that's exactly what we're doing by those acquisitions so hopefully that gives you a little more color for what we're trying to achieve.","Alex Kramm","Yes. Thanks. It was a little bit more than the one single largest opportunity but I do appreciate the color. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Well Sean is very thorough, so is Bryan.","Alex Kramm","Thank you.","Operator","Michael Carrier from Bank of America has our next question.","Michael Carrier","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the current environment and the current backdrop, when I look at the open interest you know overall, you show some of the data and some of the growth in the product areas. It seems like a lot that it has been driven by the rates, complex. We look at say like equity, energy some of the other areas you're seeing a bit of a -- some softness. Just wanted to get some color, obviously you've got tough comps in 2018 into and we put that in perspective.","But just in terms of the environment, what you're seeing in some of the product areas. Just given the divergence in an open interest trend?","John Pietrowicz","Mike, it's a good question, and instead of spending more time on the growth of the rates business, we\u2019ll let Derek talk about, Derek Sammann talk about the energy markets and the agricultural open interest and we're right there today, Derek?","Derek Sammann","Yes, thanks Michael. It\u2019s Derek. And I appreciate the opportunity to talk about the \u2013 some of the other businesses. You're right. It's kind a challenging first quarter recognizing coming off an all-time series of records in Q1 of last year. In energy specifically, you're certainly looking at a softer market. You're seeing that market generally drift higher even in light of the news of the Iran sanctions coming, the waivers coming off. You saw only a couple of dollar increase in the price, and the market quickly digested that and moved on. We are seeing softness and volatility. We're seeing a slight reduction in open interest, both on our WTI contract as well as what we're seeing in Brent on the other side. We're both down to right about 2.2 million contracts open that down for about 2.5 for each of us in May of last year.","So not surprising to see low volatility environment I think we're seeing a resumption of the shortfall carry trade. Folks are realizing that selling volatility in this environment has actually been positive for the returns. So we're seeing that being a little challenging for a breakout and volatility right now. But when you look at the overall macro environment being challenging, we still posted our third best quarter ever. And on top of that, we're actually seeing, we're outperforming the other folks in the space right now.","On the energy side, specifically WTI we increased our market share from about 58% to about 59% of the combined crude market. If you shift over and you look at the balance of the crude and refined space, our gasoline business are up was actually up 10% Q1 this year. People get lost in looking at the numbers and kind of look at the crude piece. The overall strength of the overall portfolio is driven by the supporting pieces of the balance here on or above as well. So really good story on gasoline with volumes up 10% this year.","The other side of the shop on natural gas, another story of just continued low price environment. This was, we had a spectacularly volatile gas season last year. This year was relatively quiet. We're seeing prices stabilize back lower again. That's another market and challenging macro trends. We're actually seen us outperform in that market. That's a market where we're still we are actually up to 82% market share of the Henry Hub Futures market. So we're pleased that in a challenging market, we're continuing to grow customer base and outperform and manage to retain those businesses, where we are seeing strength and this has been a continued theme.","The overall narrative of a structural change in a globalizing crude oil market and now increasingly globalized and natural gas market, that narrative is still strongly in place. You see that in our energy volumes are actually up 3% in Asia in the first quarter. You've heard us talk about the increased demand and the expansion of exports of the U.S. about 43.5 million barrels a day of crude oil, and you're seeing that reflect both in the Asian demand for our products and the growth of the innovative new products that we put out there, for example, the Houston Physical crude contract to reference at the top of the call. That's a market that we launched just back in November and we've got about a 72% market share of volumes and about a 65% market share of open interest hitting regular volume and open interest records along the way.","So in a challenging environment, we're focused on the end user, customer focused on the global participation. That's where we're seeing the opportunity, that's where we put in our resources and we're pleased with the results on the energy side.","On the Ag [ph]. Yes on the Ag side, again that actually while we're seeing all the markets down in the asset class in Q1, the Ags was our best performer down the lease. That's also a market when you look at you know our comps, our CBOT, a weak complex when compared to the combined funds of Euronext and Minneapolis Grain Exchange.","We also increased our market share there from 88% to 91%, where we are seeing a lot of volatility. And Terry mentioned this at the top of the call, is livestock. You saw hogs, cattle reacting very strongly to what we're seeing in terms of the continued trade talks and sanctions China and the swine fever are on the livestock market.","So when there are events and when there is risk, we continue to be the place that draws customers to manage their risk. And we saw a number of volume and open interest records in both cattle and hogs, futures and options over the course of the first quarter. So we'll continue to build and focus on our commercial customers there, and do some innovative work around broadening our participation globally. Did that answer your questions, Mike?","Michael Carrier","Yes, thanks a lot.","Derek Sammann","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey guys good morning. Quick question around some of the licensing expense, I mean, it looks like because of the investment you guys are making, would you take that, that as a percentage of kind of overall equity transaction revenues continues to tick up. I'm not sure if that's the best way to sort of think about the margin on the equity business if you may, but, maybe help us think through how that will play out over the next couple of quarters maybe a year or so out as your equity business evolves there?","John Pietrowicz","Sure. Thanks. Thanks Alex. So when you take a look at our licensing fees, we don't give out specifics in terms of our license agreements and each agreement is unique. So when you take a look at the license fees there tends to be an annual adjustments to the fees paid to our IP providers. So that gets adjusted at the beginning of the year.","Also it's important to note that, while the majority of the license fee line relates to equities, it also includes fees related to other asset classes like energy and interest rates. So about 80% to 85% of the license fee line is related to equities, the balance is related to other asset classes.","So when you take a look at the relationship between the equity revenue and the license fee expense, you got to take that into the -- into account. Also, when you look at the interest, the interest rate component, the interest rate product component in that line. We did see a step up in terms of the revenue share that we have with our -- with our partner banks. And it was our best volume that we've had in the interest rate swaps since 2015. So that impacted that deadline as well.","Alex Blostein","Got it. That's helpful color. Thanks.","John Pietrowicz","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thanks. So want to follow up on the commentary regarding the Energy Complex. The price differential between Brent and WTI has widened out now about $10. It's not as wide of a disparity as it was back in 2011 and 2012 were pretty wide. And I guess, what I'm wondering is, does this create a potential problem for the complex. And the reason I say that is, in the past when you when we've seen a wide disparity like that, it end up being a negative for WTI volumes relative to Brent and just, just wondering if there's a risk of that going forward if this price disparity continues.","Derek Sammann","Yes Chris, this is Derek again. Thanks for the question. Now, I think when you look at the market structurally back in 2000, kind of 11 to 14 versus where we are now there are a number of different factors, both in our own business, and our own commercial focus as well as the broader market. I think, what you saw back in 2000, kind of pre 2014 on our side, we had had more of a focus on the financial players and we didn't have as strong a footprint of the commercial community that was reflected in kind of the open interest levels that we saw in WTI. We made a very specific focus in it in 2014 to make sure that we were focused on the end user commercial customers, and that we were very much, very much making sure that if we were focused on the end user commercial customers, the open interest producers and the holders, and that meant that we're in the best position to drive the financial players along the way.","The significant change and the structural piece I referenced just a moment ago, was in December 2015 when Congress lifted the export ban. That as you've heard us say continually has put in place the narrative for a global oil market with WTI at the center of that.","So, when you look at the response to the participation and commercial participation in our market now at just under 2.2 million contracts open interest versus where we were kind of pre-2014 significantly higher and a significant amount of our sales resources had been focused for the last four years now on those end user commercials and participants.","We also had a much smaller proportion of our business that was taking place in Europe and Asia, driven by both our commercial focus and the structural shift that has really positioned WTI the global benchmark. So, those are probably the two biggest drivers. The structural shift coupled with our commercial focus and the resource that we put into place. And Bryan, I think had talked about some of the very specific areas on our international front, that's driven that kind of outpaced performance in our energy business in Europe and Asia. Asia specifically, that\u2019s up this quarter.","Terrence Duffy","Just to reinforce Derek's point, and I think you've been hearing me speak to this over the last probably year, year and a half. In terms of the tremendous growth we're seeing in the energy complex, particularly out of the Asia Pacific region. We're very proud of that continued trend this past quarter, so Derek alluded to the crude oil being up. I think, it's approximately 15% alone, and that's its third highest record out of Asia-Pacific. We're seeing nice growth coming out of Hong Kong, South Korea as well as China driving the demand for that product. He alluded to earlier also, the growth that we've seen in our futures. It's up about 9% and we're seeing again nice growth coming out of our commercials. Commercials are up for our crude oil, up about 9%. Commercials are up about 22% for RBOB.","So as we're driving to those end users, reaching out to them, we have you know the benefits of the export capabilities coming into these regions. This will be a continued area of emphasis for us and growth.","John Pietrowicz","And just let me -- just pile on a little bit here for good measure. Derek said something earlier, which I think is really important. When you look at the open interest of the different crude products, they basically are down identical numbers. So, if in fact the volume numbers would be different, you'd see a bigger skew in that particular number and you're not seeing it. And just to reemphasize that, I think that when you're calculating volume from spreads that happened several years ago and the factors that have changed from today as being a global market is really hard to make them applicable to today's marketplace.","So I think hopefully that was a good color for you to see that you can't use the same measures that you used a few years ago when your spreads widened.","Chris Harris","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Allen from Compass Point.","ChrisAllen","Morning guys. Just want to ask real quick on other revenues if you back out the NEX related revenues. It's about a $5 million jump in kind of the 40ish million dollar run rate, we saw at the CME for the 2018. And then the NEX revenues had a nice jump for 4Q annual \u2013 if you annualize 4Q levels to the $51 million this quarter, almost like five million as well. The -- as a lot of moving parts in there, wonder if you give us any color on that?","John Pietrowicz","Sure. Chris, this is John. I'll start. In terms of the -- if you take a look at NEX was up about $5 million, CME Group was up about $5 million in that line. There were two items that I wanted to point out. One was on the NEX side. There was about a $2 million relocation of rent revenue. It used to be netted in rent \u2013 netted with rent expense, and now its being \u2013 that rent revenue is being booked in the other revenue line. And that's about $2 million. And then when you take a look at the CME side, every year we've got an adjustment to the -- our contract with BM&F and inflation adjustment it gets recorded at the beginning of the year and it resets the baseline for the following year. And that was about $2 million. So that's about $4 million to $10 million adjustment that you're seeing, increases that you're seeing on that line.","The balance of the increase really is amongst a whole host of different businesses that are in there. We're particularly excited about the way the optimization businesses have performed excluding the market the transaction fee related businesses which are in the market line. So, I\u2019ll turn over to Brian to make a comment there.","Bryan Durkin","I would just say on the optimization side of the equation we had very strong performance across our triResolve, our Reset and Traiana businesses which again goes to the commentary that both Sean and I referenced earlier. There's a strong demand for these capabilities and we're excited about the robust diversity of product that we offer. Go back to John.","John Pietrowicz","Yes. So one thing I did want to point out, Chris and Bryan talked about it. I had a question earlier in the call and that's a collateral fee line, the collateral fee change. I didn't want to make a point that the collateral fee change that's going to go into effect in July will be booked in other revenue not in investment income. So, I just want to make that point. So you'll see this line, you'll get adjusted mid-year.","ChrisAllen","So this is a good run rate going forward from here and then adjust for any growth we expect in kind of the optimization business and obviously the collateral change coming in 3Q. Is that fair?","John Pietrowicz","Yes. I would say, the one thing, the adjusted I talked about from the inflation, that's an annual adjustment. So that would increase the run rate about $400,000 per quarter going forward rather than $2 million. That was adjusted this quarter. Does it make sense?","ChrisAllen","Makes sense.","John Pietrowicz","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kyle Voigt from KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good morning. There's been some\u2026","Bryan Durkin","Good morning, Kyle.","Kyle Voigt","Good morning. There\u2019s recent some recent press in Bloomberg and other publications regarding the reduction in capital allocated to trend following strategies. And some meaningful outflows from CTAs in 2018; do you believe that this is having any impact on the softer volume start to 2019? And then secondly is there any way you can help frame the approximate size as CTAs and trend following strategies in context of seeing these total volume or total revenues?","Terrence Duffy","I would just speak to the breath of the products that we offer as we look at the buy side community in particular and the opportunities and challenges that they face with their strategies. It's incumbent upon us to be able to provide them with the products and solutions and the opportunities from a liquidity perspective that they need to ship there their trading strategies into other venues and having the broad swath of product that we represent. I mean, I continue to look at. We see growth continuing across all of our regions particularly across that buy-side community within our hedge funds as well as our asset managers. So it will be a continued focus.","Bryan Durkin","Let\u2019s say, on the commodity side one of the important is most important way that we can attract business that are looking to get fund inflows into the commodity side is making sure that our businesses as we grow our volumes in open interest that has a direct impact on the weightings that they have in the various commodity indices at the Bloomberg commodities Index, MSCI et cetera. So as those get re-weighted every year the continued growth here is talk about not an absolute but equally importantly for the indexes on the relative side as well that reweights our products at a higher percent of a total proportion of those indices.","So the trend followers and then from the CTA you're talking about that might not be directly in futures the pile in the index as that index back to the arm footprints in those respective products. So the growth and focus and growing our volumes in open interest puts us in a higher weighting proportion of CME group products in those indices which ends up giving us those traded hedges volumes back into our future. So, we can't directly control for it, but as we see those flows increase we put ourselves in the best position by getting our products reweighted at a higher percent in each of those indices.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Good morning. In terms of the investment income can you indicate how the SGM and clients are changing allocations in collateral between cash and non-cash at CME? Maybe also highlight which is more profitable for CME cash or non-cash. It seems like cash, I think is much more profitable. And then can you talk about where the spread earns on customer collateral stood this quarter versus last? Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Sure. Ken, this is John. I'll walk you through kind of what we've seen over the last couple of quarters in terms of the average cash balances that we have at the clearinghouse. So, we saw in the first quarter of 2018 about $39.6 billion average. Balances, it's gone down to around $28 billion in the first quarter of 2019, so it trended downwards. The return that we receive on those average cash balances has gone from about 28 basis points in the first quarter of 2018 to about 33 basis points in the first quarter of 2019.","You are correct, the non-cash collateral we earned less on the non-cash collateral than we do have on the cash collateral. So that -- but that when you take a look we are making that adjustment in July which will have an impact on the amount that we earn on that collateral, so if you take a look at our take on the return in the first quarter of 2019 it was about $23 million, that's the net earnings that we received on the cash collateral. And as we talked about previously the non-cash collateral be adjusted in July.","Ken Worthington","Great. Thank you very much.","John Pietrowicz","Thanks Ken.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just a couple of questions on product. So, just in the equity indices obviously that's been weak with low volatility in the market. Maybe some perspective of to what extent you think these [Indiscernible] that are starting to launch meaningfully impact \u2013 or meaningfully boost the equity indices trends if volatility remain light?","And then within interest rates just some perspective on what kind of RBC capture you're getting on the new Sulphur volume and also the invoice spreads obviously really rich capture there whether you see that continue to trend up. I know you made some comments earlier in the Q&A?","John Pietrowicz","Sure, Brian. Great question. Thank you very much. We're very excited about the May 6 launch of our micro e-mini futures. For as a reminder to folks this is across the four major indices. So across the S&P, Dow, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 indices, and why we\u2019re excited about this. And we currently have about 50,000 accounts utilizing the e-mini futures. So this will give them greater granularity. So contract is one-tenth o the size of our existing e-minis. I\u2019ll give them greater granularity in order to optimize their exposures to the futures contracts relative to CTAs.","And the question earlier this will also allow them to optimize their exposure to those marketplaces with a much finer contract size than they've had in the past. If you think about the e-minis that were launched in 1997; so since then -- since the indices have grown dramatically the size of contract has grown and this allow us to better penetrate those counts. In addition to those 50,000 existing e-mini accounts there are approximately 250,000 currently dormant CME Futures accounts.","We do believe that some significant portion of those users that contract site may have gotten too large for them and this will allow us to better penetrate them. Much more importantly if you look at external numbers in the marketplace that are available in terms of active retail traders there are on the order of 10 to actually We've seen numbers as high as 40 million active retail traders globally. So we are very hopeful that dividing the countryside by 10 that we will see very good uptake.","We've had very positive feedback from all of our retail distribution channels. We are working with eight zero different introducing brokers as well as retail brokers. And we believe that on the order of 90% of them we'll be ready in week one to start offering their product to their clients. So we are very excited about the opportunity. I won't size it right now but we think it's a great idea. We're seeing very very positive feedback from those distribution channels and we're expecting a very positive launch.","Now in terms of other innovations that we've launched, we're about to hit our one year anniversary of our Sulphur futures, very excited there about that contract. We recently had a record of 83,000 contracts traded in a single day. And if you look at the one year anniversary this is one of the fastest growing products we've ever had in the interest rate complex and I think anywhere at CME Group. So putting it in perspective we've had about 3.2 million contract trade in the first 12 months. That equates to about 6 1 trillion worth of notional.","And in the month of March we reached a new all time monthly record of 38,000 contracts with more than a 130 different participants. So we're very excited about the continued traction there. I could keep going on right relative to renovations, total return futures we adjusted those products on the equity side back in December, right. So total return futures you may recall, this is \u2013 company focused on margin capital efficiencies, the changing regulatory environment and how to help clients. So those are being offered to the marketplace as an alternative to total return equity swaps especially under the uncleared marginals, it was considered the third largest category of pain point after rates and foreign exchange.","We've seen very good uptake there and we saw a record recently 280,000 contracts in open interest. And we -- in addition to that the growth this year we had about 1600 contracts a day. Last year it was about 2600 contracts a day. This year, so very nice growth I think actually the actual growth rate is 47% year over year. And in addition to that with the extensions that we made in December particularly we took the S&Ps and we only had in our five quarters. We now go out five years. And when we go out five years their RPC is over $5 as a contract.","So, we're constantly innovating. We're constantly looking at attracting new clients. Another thing I might bring up is not just the new product innovation, but we\u2019re continuously optimizing the existing contracts. Now nothing I just might note is our two-year note futures as well as the two year note cash. So back in November, BrokerTec reduced the minimum price increments in the two year note cash. And in January we took a similar action in our two year note futures. Why is this important? This is important because while we're in a difficult volatility environment actually there is a Fed research paper that was published about a week and a half ago saying that the reduction in those minimum price increments massively increase the health of those marketplaces and increase volumes.","So if you look at the increase in volumes on both the BrokerTec side as well as the CME side the two year notes went from being about 13%, I\u2019m approximating here about 13% of the overall Treasury complex on each platforms to about 16% on the future side that equates to an additional about 122,000 contracts a day. So, a very positive result there Invoice spreads, as I said earlier I'm seeing very good growth from 89,000 contracts a day last year to 180 \u2013 118,000 so far this year a $1.92 RBC and this is really again taking advantage of the portfolio margin. As I also mentioned earlier we're seeing huge growth and people adopting and taking advantage of that.","Brian Bedell","Thanks John. Very helpful. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Thank you.","Operator","And we have another follow-up question from Alex Kramm from UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hey. Thanks again. Just very two quick follow-ups with the things that were asked before. On the other revenue line just to clarify, you said the run rate is good, but we don't have any sort of quarterly history. So is there any seasonality in that kind of optimization business that we should be aware of, customers doing more in a certain quarter or the beginning of the year, so just anything to call out there?","And then on the expenses, I think that was asked earlier. Do you actually -- I don't know if you gave the kind of incentive comp or bonus target for the year? Can you just give us a little bit of the range there and what it would take to be at the low end and the high end given that volumes obviously can bounce around and then performance can bounce around? Thanks.","John Pietrowicz","Yes. Thanks. In terms of \u2013 and just to be clear, we talked a little bit about the other revenue. The information or the revenue that goes into that line on the NEX side tends to be more subscription based. So, it should be less volatile than the transaction based revenue. So, when you're thinking about that line it tends to be a much more stable line. As I did mention there are a couple of things that are going to be rolling in there. One is the change in the collateral fee which will impact that line.","Also there is -- as we move our staff into a consolidated office space we\u2019ll be sub leasing that office space. There will be some impact in that line as well. So that's a couple of points to think about as you model out the other revenue line. In terms of the expenses when you look at the compensation specifically on the CME side there is a range of outcomes when it comes to the bonus, really when we look at it, we look at bonus plus stock-based compensation is being kind of performance based comp. So to the extent that there is a cap and there is a cliff in terms of our bonus, so we don't hit a certain targeted we call it AIP or cash earnings target that bonus can go all the way down to zero depending on how we do.","And we don't you know obviously we don't disclose that range. Although in the proxy you can see what it has been in the past. So that is -- that's what can happen in terms of the bonus. Obviously the stock based compensation is relative to our margins compared to a pure set and also our total return compared to the entire S&P 500.","Alex Kramm","All right. Thanks for clarifying. Take care.","John Pietrowicz","Thank you.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions today's. Speakers, I'll turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks.","Terrence Duffy","We appreciate very much the opportunity to answer your questions today. We look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5493":["CME Group Inc.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Peschier. Please go ahead, sir.","John Peschier","Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I am going to start with the Safe Harbor language. Then I will turn it over to Terry and John for brief remarks, followed by your questions.","Statements made on this call and in the other documents on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance can be found in our filings with the SEC which are on our website. Also on the last page of the earnings release you will find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, John. And as John said, I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. My comments will be brief so we can get right to your questions. We released our executive commentary this morning, which provided extensive details on the third quarter.","In Q3, average daily volume grew to more than 20 million contracts per day, up 30% compared to Q3 last year. Normally the months of July and August are slow. So we\u2019re pleased with the activity this year. We delivered record quarterly average daily volume in metals products, which rose 32%. Average daily volume and interest rates and equities were each up more than 35%.Our options business continues to perform very well. During the third quarter, our options volume reached 4.1 million contracts per day, or up 32%. We drove significant growth from customers based outside the United States. During the third quarter, volume originating from Asia reached a record level of 1.2 million contracts per day, up 61%. Volume from European based customers increased by 34% versus Q3 last year and was the third best quarter overall with records in metals and equities.","Lastly, the activity from Latin America has accelerated. We had 152,000 contracts per day during the quarter, the second highest in our history. We continue to deliver successful new product rollouts, our popular Micro E-minis ADV grew 35% sequentially from Q2 to Q3. We reached a monthly record in our new SOFR contract in September with 58,000 contracts traded and a daily record in mid September of more than 150,000 contracts traded. New products announced recently include the E-mini S&P ESG futures, US liquefied natural gas export futures and also we developed the bilateral pricing agreement between CME and the Shanghai Gold Exchange.","Turning to the NEX integration, we are pleased with how it is progressing. We have made great progress, leveraging the joint sales teams to enable cross selling and to offer the full portfolio of products and services. We are also beginning to combine the office space around the world, which should assist with generating revenue synergies at a lower cost. We remain laser focused on this very strategic transaction and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.","With that, let me turn the call over to John to provide you with some additional comments.","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Terry. It was a tremendous quarter. Revenue reached almost $1.28 billion the highest level we have seen this year during what is typically a seasonally slow quarter. Terry touched on the strength in our futures and options franchise. We also saw sequential growth in the NEX business including at EBS, BrokerTec and triReduce. During the third quarter, our adjusted expenses excluding license fees came in at $409 million, up slightly from the prior quarter. We remain highly confident that we will come in between $1.64 billion and $1.65 billion in adjusted expenses for the year which we reduced by $10 million last quarter. One final note earlier this year, proposed federal regulations were released related to the US tax legislation enacted in 2017. These regulations clarified whether a deduction would be available related to foreign customers service from our U.S. operations.","As a result of these regulations and the nearing completion of our 2018 tax returns, we have revised our income tax calculations for 2018 and 2019 to reflect the new guidance. We recorded an $89 million tax benefit in the current quarter. Of this, approximately $52 million related to 2018 and was taken out this quarter in adjusted non-GAAP results. The remaining $37 million relates to the first three quarters of this year, resulting in an adjusted effective tax rate of 20.5% for the quarter. Adjusted Q3 diluted EPS including this entry was $1.90. We expect the annual 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 23.5%.","With that short summary, we would like to open up the call for your questions. Based on the number of analysts covering us, please limit yourself to one question and then feel free to jump back into the queue. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Richard Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Richard Repetto","Yes, good morning, Terry. Good morning, John. I guess my...","Terrence Duffy","Good morning.","Richard Repetto","Good morning. Everybody is asking about the volume picture and I know, not to focus on what you call short-term things, but the volumes have across asset classes have dropped over the last 2.5 weeks. So I guess any insight there? But I guess more importantly is the longer-term picture of interest rates are so much of the drive, so much of the complex and then transaction revenue. How would you think about the outlook for the interest rate volume and the interest rate transaction revenue in a low rate environment going forward as well?","Terrence Duffy","Well, Richard, I mean I think a lot of us would like to kind of jump in a little bit and give you snippets of what we think, but we\u2019ve got to be careful because as you know, it\u2019s very hard for us to predict future volumes of what they may or may not be. That being said when you look at the volumes across especially the last period that you referenced last couple of weeks. They have been across \u2013 they have down significantly in the ETFs and the cash markets and the equities all across the board you\u2019ve seen a tightening of volumes going on. So it\u2019s not just CME and then when it comes to interest rates. You look at all the \u2013 we\u2019re at 90% service economy in the United States, 10% manufacturing roughly and there are a lot of different borrowing cost at different levels that I think people continually need to manage that risk and regardless of what the, the Fed funds rate or the borrowing rate is by the Fed. There is a lot of people that don\u2019t give that and we are going to continually look to have people manage risk throughout the curve. So I still think that there is uncertainty as it relates to what those rates are going to be and I think that the businesses that we know we\u2019re set up in a very good position to capture additional volatility. There is no question. And then is undeniable that it has slowed down, it will be interesting to see what the Chairman, Paul says coming up. So I\u2019ll let Sean to comment more, but I would not try to base a 12-month period on a 2-week cycle.","Sean Tully","Yes, hi. Rich, this is Sean jumping in. So for the last two weeks, certainly the volumes have been lower than they had been for the previous couple of months, but really not surprise relative to the ebb and flow of economic information and markets. If you go back a month or so ago, the probability of tightening at the Fed meeting, which is occurring this week was less than 50% and I\u2019m sorry, easing, excuse me, the probability of easing was less than 50%. If you look at the probability today, it\u2019s running around 94%. So the market has gone from a highly uncertain situation relative to the FOMC meeting, excuse me, to a certain situation at least from a market standpoint. When you do that, when you remove the uncertainty, then the marketplace volumes tend to fall, that\u2019s the volatility tends to fall because marketplace has come to a conclusion. So I think that that\u2019s a part of the drag in terms of the last couple of weeks. But that\u2019s the ebb and flow, no doubt, there will be high levels of uncertainty at FOMC meetings that are upcoming later this year as well as into next year. It\u2019s just a short-term event. In terms of the volumes themselves as well, if you look at our volumes, Terry indicated, If you look at the largest ETFs in equities, for example, comparable to our products are down much more in terms of volumes than our products and they\u2019re running down around 50%, ours are down substantially less than that. We continuously look at making sure that our products are the most attractive of any products available in the marketplace and market participants come to us for managing their risk. So we are continuously as you know focused on adjusting our products in order to make them more attractive as well as innovating new products. For example, you will recall, we lowered the minimum price increments in our two year futures in January of this year and those are \u2013 volumes are up substantially relative to the rest of the marketplace now versus where they were a year ago. So our 2-year futures running at around 16% of our overall volumes of our treasury futures, whereas previously, they were running it more like to 12.7%. So an additional 150,000 contracts coming out of \u2013 out of the two year notes on the back of that. We have also seen outside growth for example in our 10-year \u2013 Ultra 10-Year futures, which you know are new just a couple of years ago. Recently, doing 267,000 contracts a day. I am very excited about SOFR. You\u2019ve heard in terms of innovation. I\u2019ll talk about SOFR. In the month of September, the SOFR futures as Terry mentioned earlier had a record day of 152,000 contracts in a single day. Putting that in perspective, 670 billion notional equivalent. It\u2019s an enormous day for the repo market, the fact that there is volatility in the repo market, repo traders now coming to CME to manage their risk. Recall that we only launched that product in May of the previous year. We now have more than $1.7 trillion in open interest in that product. So we are continuously innovating. In terms of the Micro E-minis, Terry mentioned that earlier on the call. We\u2019re currently at 565,000 contracts ADV more than 50,000 contracts trading, sorry, more than 50,000 accounts trading. So huge growth in the contract, a huge number of new participants trading it, the average trade on that I will also mention is 2.65 contract, so far smaller than the E-minis and so very additive to our products, so whether it\u2019s the SOFR futures whether it\u2019s adjusting existing contracts, whether it\u2019s the Micro E-minis, we\u2019re continuously looking and make sure that we\u2019ve got the absolute most innovative, most attractive price possible for our clients and we look to grow our complex in any interest rate environment or any market environment.","Terrence Duffy","And Rich, let me just add one more thing, so I think there is a bit of confusion sometimes when people look at rates. Our business is not driven off of making money, off of money. We have a very small part of our business that does that unlike some other businesses, our business is to manage risk for a whole host of interest rate fluctuations that have to come to our marketplace to mitigate that. So I think, when we look at rates at historical low levels that affects people who are trying to make money off of money versus what we do for a living.","Richard Repetto","Understood. Very helpful guys. Thank you.","Terrence Duffy","Thank you.","Sean Tully","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Hi, thanks. Good morning. So, Terry, you mentioned the NEX integration and the potential kind of the meetings and potential revenue synergy opportunity. I guess could you be specific about kind of what\u2019s happening in the success you\u2019re having or meetings and progress. I think at the start, it was around some of the intermediary in the banks in Europe and Asia. So I guess if there could be some more tangible kind of comments around what the progress you are having would be helpful?","Terrence Duffy","Yes Dan, that\u2019s a great question. I want to ask Bryan to chime in on this. To talk a little bit more about, because you\u2019ve been leading this effort along with John. So Bryan, maybe you can chime in a little bit.","Bryan Durkin","Thank you, Terry. We are not skipping a beat since our last chat on our last earnings call in terms of integrating the businesses. I think a very formidable part of this is the sales effort. So you heard Terry allude to earlier, how we really integrated our sales teams. We\u2019re speaking with one voice as we\u2019re able to go out and engage with our client base and help them drive solutions to meet their risk management needs across both the cash, the futures as well as the optimization services that we offer and that\u2019s resonating very strongly. What\u2019s very exciting for us is the introduction into some other quadrants within the banking community, particularly in the regional banking sector, which is an area that we\u2019ve not quite have the engagement on the core futures side of the business and that\u2019s offering up more opportunities, again across our entire portfolio. So we are very excited about how the sales efforts have come together and how we\u2019re able to cohesively represent the offerings that we have.","Terrence Duffy","John?","John Pietrowicz","Yes, thank you, Terry. Dan, it\u2019s interesting, we had a call just yesterday with the sales team. To give you kind of a tangible example, triResolve which is working on providing our clients help in terms of the initial margin calculations that they\u2019re going to have to do about 300 come due at this current year and followed by the following year with about 700 more clients between \u201820 and 2021. They were educating all the entire sales team about what this offering is so that our entire sales force and can help sell that product to all of our clients. So really, it\u2019s being able to sit down and talk about the entire suite of services. As Terry mentioned, we\u2019re about managing risk and we\u2019re able to then sit down and offer them whether it\u2019s, whether it\u2019s on the futures side providing risk management through the clearinghouse or whether it\u2019s on the cash side, offering risk management on the with our optimization business. So it\u2019s really, it\u2019s kind of interesting as a great example. In terms of being on the call and having the \u2013 them walk through this campaign that we\u2019re working on across the entire sales force, Sean?","Sean Tully","Yes, I mean one specific, Dan will be helpful. So SOFR, I talked briefly earlier and Terry talked briefly earlier about our great success in terms of SOFR futures, 58,000 contracts a day in the month of September about 50,000 contracts a day, so far this month. If you think about the BrokerTec business, it\u2019s a $260 billion worth of U.S. Repo every day. So our BrokerTec repo team is on the phone with those repo desk literally everyday. Those are the same traders who needed to hedge their risk in SOFR during the month of September. So it was very easy to have that BrokerTec team who has the largest U.S. repo business that exists, talk to their clients and sell them into our SOFR futures, which are now I think a very significant success. If you look at the SOFR futures today, during the month of September, we ran at around 83% of the average daily volume and we\u2019re currently running 93% or 94% of the open interest of the marketplace. So it\u2019s a clear opportunity where we\u2019re already getting those opportunities in the synergies.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Dan for your questions.","Dan Fannon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi.","Ben Herbert","Hi, good morning.","Terrence Duffy","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Herbert","I was just hoping that you could touch on the non-US volume strength in the quarter and kind of help us think through organic efforts to expand the high customer base versus just overall macro and geopolitical uncertainty.","Terrence Duffy","Ben. Thank you for that question, I\u2019ll ask Bryan to again address that as he does head up the International business. Bryan?","Bryan Durkin","You know, as we noted, this is one of our top quarters in terms of producing activity, volume, and revenues out of international. Our international activity grew by 40%. We\u2019re generating from this past quarter 5.3 million contracts of our total volume. EMEA represented about a 34% increase of 3.8 million contracts a day and Asia, which we\u2019re very excited about 1.2 million contracts, their activity was up about 61%. As I\u2019ve mentioned in past visits with all of you. We\u2019ve really chartered our focus on our country planning, so that we can more deeply penetrate the activities across the quadrants within each of these regions and it\u2019s definitely resonating with the marketplace. I can break it down by product within financials, equities, commodities, where that activity is coming up. And so, through those sales efforts, as we\u2019ve indicated, having the boots on the ground, being able to offer is the broad array of asset classes. We are continuing to see great growth coming out of all of these regions, new clients coming into our existing products. One of the major drivers for the last quarter was our interest rates. And so when we talk about our two year treasury complex for example, there is different segments that are driving that growth coming out of Europe versus coming out of Asia and that goes to the efficacy again of the sophistication of our sales team being able to reach out to those very specific segments and bringing them in, to these markets.","John Pietrowicz","Just talk a little bit about the international growth as it relates to the tax deduction that we\u2019re taking. Really, it\u2019s another benefit to the strategy we have of growing globally. Our ability to take this tax deduction really is because we\u2019ve chosen to service our foreign clients from the United States. So to the extent that we\u2019re continuing to grow globally and as Bryan indicated that that growth is faster outside the U.S. and the \u2013 then within the U.S., we are able to take advantage of this tax deduction. So it\u2019s another benefit to growing globally and also we\u2019re able to, as we grow globally, we\u2019re able to utilize our systems 24 hours a day and provide our clients better and better liquidity 24 hours a day. So it really \u2013 it\u2019s able to leverage all the infrastructure that we have and really allow us to create that liquidity, so when an event happens any time day or night, we are the place to manage that risk.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks for your question, Ben.","Ben Herbert","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. If I may kind of link the combination of the sales forces question with some organic growth initiatives that you have got and the question is your outlook of the potential for improving volumes from things like the FASB rules on MBS hedging, traction with your portfolio or I guess how the portfolio margining savings are resonating with clients? And also the international traction, so linking that together with the combination of sales force, can you sort of potentially see sort of a, you know, an elevated, an improvement in volumes from those initiatives combined with the now combination of the two sales forces?","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Brian. Let me turn that to Sean and then Bryan can add in a little bit. Sean, why don\u2019t you add them starting?","Sean Tully","Yes, I mean if you look at insurance companies overall there has been increased usage of our Treasury bond futures in particular over the last couple of years. And as you know, we\u2019ve seen great growth in our treasury futures complex and as well our treasury options complex. In addition to that in terms of the portfolio margin, we are very excited about the significant increase in uptake over the last year. In October, we reached a new all-time record in terms of portfolio margining saving market participants, $5.7 billion worth of margins. That will help us to lead to very strong growth, as well in our OTC clearing. If you look at our OTC clearing volumes for example, this year, overall, total volumes across all currencies in all products running about 136 billion a day, up 29% from last year. So a very significant increase and again with a very large set of participants \u2013 increased number of participants taking greater advantage of portfolio margining. On the portfolio margining front as well, we have recently announced that we are enhancing \u2013 enhancing our portfolio margining efficiencies. We will be doing that in the month of November. In terms of that, that will make it even more efficient than it is today to trade Eurodollar futures as a spread \u2013 as a spread, excuse me, to U.S. dollar interest rate swaps. And so we continuously enhance all of our services. We\u2019ve enhanced the efficiencies on OTC clearing, it is showing through as much greater growth and it takes time for participants to sometimes take advantage of all of the new products and services, all of the new enhancements that we create, but over time they do, and that\u2019s an example of where they are.","Bryan Durkin","I will just comment from the international perspective. Capital efficiency is of paramount importance to our user community, particularly on the banking sector as well as the buy side. Our activities throughout, EMEA and Asia, particularly looking at the interest rate quadrant, we have seen tremendous growth coming out of the banking sector as well as hedge funds. A lot of this has been driven out of Singapore, Japan and Australia. The same thing holds true in terms of on the EMEA side so throughout Europe. We are seeing triple-digit growth coming out of the hedge fund community in our rates and almost triple-digit growth coming out of the banks that\u2019s being driven out of the UK, some areas, the Czech Republic, something very interesting. You\u2019ve heard me talk about the country planning and highlighting the Netherlands and Switzerland. Those areas right now are number two and number three in terms of our drivers of growth coming out of EMEA. And again, that\u2019s driven out of the interest rate sector.","Brian Bedell","Okay, thanks very much. I\u2019ll get back in the queue for another one.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Brian.","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question. John, just given some of the near-term volume concerns, yet obviously a solid quarter. Maybe can you just give us an update on how you are thinking about expenses in the near term, maybe areas of more flexibility, some of the weakness continues. And then any investment needs on the horizon? Thanks.","John Pietrowicz","Thanks Mike. I think, as we have always talked about, there is a couple of line items that really kind of fluctuate based on business performance. One of them is obviously our bonus fluctuates based on business performance, and then our license fees, you really are about three quarters of our license fees are attributable to the equity complex. So sustained downturns in business performance and in the equities will impact our expenses, you know, as I said in when we had this call in April, when we had a bit of a slow period at that point, this is not a lever that we want to pull prematurely. So you know there is always ebbs and flows as we\u2019ve talked about on this call in terms of volume. So we want to be very careful that we don\u2019t squeeze too tightly and impact future growth. So we are always very focused on managing the business extremely efficiently. So we are always very careful with every dollar we spend but we don\u2019t want to impact future growth by prematurely squeezing even harder. You know, in terms of, in terms of our go-forward investment we\u2019re constantly investing in the business. We\u2019re investing right now in the build out of Globex to migrate from the legacy NEX infrastructure into our Globex infrastructure. So we are right now having a double carrying costs as we build out the test environment, build out the capacity and capabilities in Globex while running a production system for NEX and then once that ultimately is completed then, we\u2019ll be able to decommission the legacy NEX infrastructure. So we are constantly investing in the business. We\u2019re investing in providing our customers the best experience, you know, as we move BrokerTec and EBS onto Globex, we can capture some of the revenue synergies that we\u2019ve been talking about and also make sure that we\u2019re constantly giving our clients the very best trading and risk management experience.","Michael Carrier","Alright. Thanks for the color.","John Pietrowicz","Thanks Mike.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Mike","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Maybe just one on this joint recommendation that was written by some large banks and asset managers last week, with respect to CCP management standards and one of the suggestions that was in the paper was around skin in the game. It feels like a topic that comes up every couple of years here, but the paper suggested, I think CCPs should put up 20% of the default fund, I know that number keeps fluctuating around. But can you just talk about, can you just talk about the regulators and thinking about this topic and whether or not you think that the regulators have appetite or like how far up on their priority list would be releasing some new CCP management standards going forward?","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Kyle. It\u2019s Terry. I\u2019ll comment little bit. And I\u2019ll ask Sunil and maybe Bryan to comment as well. We are \u2013 we were a little surprised obviously to see that paper dropped the way it did. There\u2019s a lot of things in there that we\u2019ve been discussing for a number of years going back probably to 2011, 2012. There are a couple of new issues in there that we had never heard from the signatories about this before, especially on that the skin in the game percentages the way they put it in two different levels, as you know, CME has skin in the game and Sunil can explain it better than I, but we are first in the waterfall. One of the things about skin in the game, we have to be very, very careful from \u2013 we believe that people who introduce risk to the system should be putting in the money for the system. We are here to manage the risk, we don\u2019t introduce the risk. And so, those that are bringing the most of risk should be putting in money for the default fund. We don\u2019t want to have smaller participants that are trying to hedge their crops and do other business throughout the world. Production, so get into a situation where they could get hurt because they\u2019re the smaller participants and the bigger ones introduce too much risk to the system, but don\u2019t want to put the money up. So that\u2019s a bit of a concern for us, but it\u2019s also a bit of a moral hazard for lack of a better term, when you are the first line of defense with a large number of people could look at you as a moral hazard knowing that full well that you are the first line of defense on the default as the CCP. We don\u2019t think that is good for risk management practices. So we don\u2019t subscribe to that. There were some other provisions in there, one on new products that I found very disturbing. I think when you look at new products. If there is not a new product candidates exchange without some kind of zero in front of it. We create liquidity, we nurture it, we build it, we risk management quite differently. So I was surprised to see some of the, the rhetoric that came out in that paper associated with that. The last thing that I\u2019ll comment on is as it relates to a vote that the participants would have to see if they want to participate. Once a default happens, we are very concerned because of their positions that they could have in the market and then having a vote associated with it. We think that it can be definitely an inherent conflict of interest for the other participants which I referenced earlier.","Your other question was do the regulators have an appetite to address this. It\u2019s not for me to speak for the regulators. You have to talk to them to decide what their appetite is. I have been in communication as has Bryan and other members of my team working with the Commission, explaining the \u2013 the issues that I just explained to you or otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have said them to you right now in this call, so I have discussed everything I\u2019ve said to you with the regulators and our concerns associated thereof. And I think they are very well aware of them, and that\u2019s all I can say, but I cannot speak for the regulators.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you.","Bryan Durkin","Sure.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Kyle.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hello. Good morning, everybody. Question for you guys around the equity futures business, definitely strong traction from some of the new products. Can you talk a little bit about when the incentives are set to expire here and as we sort of think about the more normalized capture rates in these buckets again kind of holding maybe the mix of volumes constant, kind of where should the capture rate for the equity franchise, what should that sort of look like once these sort of fee waivers go away?","John Pietrowicz","Sure. Thanks, Alex. This is John and then I will pass it over to Sean. We have been very, very pleased with the performance of the micros far exceeded our expectations. In Q2, we had about 8% of the total trading volume was in our equity complex was related to micros that increased to about 16% this quarter. So what does that mean in terms of the rate per contract and net that we had about a $0.05 downward pressure on our rate per contract related to the Micros in the second quarter and about $0.10 impact this quarter. But the good, the positive thing is that this is all additive to our revenue, we don\u2019t think that there is any cannibalization of our business. So this is really kind of new revenue for us, so very, very pleased with the performance. Sean?","Sean Tully","The only thing I would add is that we did have a very aggressive incentive program initially, and that is waning off. And the incentives will be a bit lower starting next month. Even lower than this month, but only a bit lower. So but we will keep some incentives in place in order to retain the very strong liquidity. So you\u2019re seeing probably now and you\u2019ll see in the next quarter, something more like the RPC or the net RPC that we expect in that product. Nothing to remind you of in terms of the cannibalization or and \u2013 again, we believe that it\u2019s, it\u2019s not cannibalization. We\u2019re 50,000 accounts as I said earlier, trading the product, the average trade is 2.65 contract, so much smaller than \u2013 and E-mini, recall that micros are one-tenth the size. So the average trade is about 25% of an E-mini. So that tells you that this is in addition to that, on the pricing, just as a reminder. For members is $0.04 a contract. So on a E-mini equivalent that\u2019s $0.40 versus a rack rate for a member in our E-minis is $0.35, so a nice premium. In addition to that for non-members our E-minis trade at $1.18 per contract. Whereas these are $0.20 so multiply by 10, that\u2019s $2. So they are also priced at a significant premium on a risk adjusted basis.","John Pietrowicz","Yes, Alex, this is John. So just to give you an idea, the average RPC for the E-minis has gone up from about $0.05 to about $0.08 currently. About Micro, I\u2019m sorry, not the minis, but micros.","Alex Blostein","Right. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Alex.","Terrence Duffy","Thank you. Good question, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning . There was a Wall Street Journal article out this morning with regard to Eurodollars in data. Does quoted \u2013 the quoting size issue highlighted impact all asset classes or was this just a Eurodollar phenomenon and does the data phenomenon have any impact on volumes. If so, which direction I couldn\u2019t quite tell. And if you could. Could you take a guess on magnitude.","Terrence Duffy","Yes, Ken, thanks. I assume like \u2013 we\u2019re answering a lot of questions from the press these days, and there are articles they\u2019re written off. Bryan, why don\u2019t you go ahead and address the Eurodollar.","Bryan Durkin","I\u2019ll address the messaging program and policy perspective in terms of you had asked if we have programs in place to address how our users utilize the technology and the access into our Globex platform. We do have a messaging policy that applies to all of our product complexes and it\u2019s calibrated based upon how these markets trade. We are very sophisticated in terms of our understanding of messaging and messaging ratio is to transactions. So it\u2019s a very transparent policy that we\u2019ve had in place. We did see a \u2013 a dynamic occur over the course of the last few weeks in terms of messaging increasing significantly. We got on top of that. We addressed our policy, we had introduced an enhancement to the policy dealing with excessive messaging and that has addressed the conduct that we have seen. So we\u2019re pleased with the actions that we\u2019ve undertaken to ensure that behavior that\u2019s coming in, messaging that\u2019s coming into our system and our infrastructure is appropriate for the overall marketplace in general.","Terrence Duffy","Ken thank you for your question. And I think Bryan summed it up very, very well . I couldn\u2019t add much more to that, but I can\u2019t underscore enough that the policy change that we have made, including our market REC division is very important. We\u2019ve talked with the participants in the marketplace, we\u2019ve addressed these issues. They understand our concerns. It doesn\u2019t benefit anybody by people trying to circumvent with the messaging traffic. So I think that we\u2019re in a much better place than we were before. I don\u2019t believe our procedures, our policies in the past were flawed. I just think that we \u2013 you need to amend these things once in a while. And that\u2019s exactly what we did. So I think that\u2019s what the article was reflecting. So hopefully that answers your question.","Ken Worthington","Great, thank you.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey, thanks, guys and thanks for the color earlier around Rich\u2019s question around the absolute level of rates and the reset of volumes, but I\u2019m also getting some more specific questions from accounts about the impact of the Fed\u2019s Open Market bond purchases on OI and volumes in the rates business. Now I know that the recent kind of Quasi QE has been named at more stabilized in the repo market and there\u2019s been obviously a lot going on seven years to 10 years ago during the short grounds of QE from a regulatory macro context as well. So, Terry and Sean, you talked earlier about risk management in the rates business, but at the current level of QE or if we get like an escalation of QE in the next couple of years. How should we, one, think about the need for risk management in a QE-driven lower rate evolve world. Two, maybe what the impact could be on OI and volumes and I guess, three, if there is any parallels, we can draw by looking at \u2013 at what CME\u2019s kind of prior experience was during prior QE cycles.","Terrence Duffy","Yes it\u2019s great question, Jeremy. I want to turn it to John and then I\u2019ll jump in, when he is done.","John Pietrowicz","Yes, thank you, Jeremy. In terms of the Fed\u2019s most recent activity, is purchase of T-bills as well as its entrants into the repo market. Clearly that is in order to stabilize the amount of liquidity available for overnight borrowing and lending, relative to the jump that the Federal Reserve, the marketplace experienced in September. So the Federal Reserve, if you recall, prior to the financial crisis was very active on a daily basis in the repo market in order to make sure that it has the right level of reserves in order to target the Fed funds rate. If you look at all of these recent actions in terms of Federal Reserves entering the overnight repo, the term repo and the purchase of T-bills. This is also they can target the overnight rate. That\u2019s not changing and it really does not impact the long part of the curve. It doesn\u2019t impact anything but their ability to target the overnight rate. If you think about it. With the advent of the financial crisis and the huge quantity easing that they did during the financial crisis, it grew their balance sheet tremendously and a lot of uncertainty from the Federal Reserve on how to get that overnight rate into the time zone that they want it. So these are additional tools that they\u2019re using, just to make sure that that overnight rate is about where they want it, it doesn\u2019t change the volatility in the FOMC in terms of changing their target rate, it doesn\u2019t change that whatsoever, which is really what a lot of our products go to. So I don\u2019t see it having a big impact. In terms of previous experience. If you look at. Yes. From the very early part of the financial crisis and the early part of Zero Interest Rate Policy, our volumes were challenged, no question, probably from \u201809 to \u201812 relative to the implosion of bank balance sheets. For example, however, if you look at our experience since 2012 even during Zero Interest Rate Policy, we grew our interest rate business tremendously and I think, I can underline tremendously. If you look at today. For example, we\u2019re running and this is statistic, you\u2019ve heard me talk about on earnings calls for last few years back in 2012. We were running about 45% of the average daily volume of the US treasury cash market in terms of our treasury futures. Today, I\u2019m happy to say, we\u2019re a new all-time record of 121% in terms of our treasury futures relative to the cash treasury bond market. So we, we\u2019ve shown right that we can continue to grow, we grew our open interest. We grew the number of large open interest holders. We grew our volumes relative to the underlying cash market throughout Zero Interest Rate Policy. And will \u2013 and again, I think I said earlier, my job and I know Derek. Derek feels the same way. Our jobs are to grow our complexes in any market environment, now through innovation are making our products more attractive.","Terrence Duffy","You know, I will just add a little bit. I think, Sean summed it up very, very well. But, I think when we look back at \u201808, \u201809 and \u201810, when we were creating and Sean and his team were creating new products to mitigate risk and rates, a lot of people, so what are you doing? Everybody else thought the geopolitical fundamental factors in the marketplace, they waited for that to change for their business to grow. That\u2019s not what we did. So even during all the quantitative easing and these rates going to historic lows, we grew the business that Sean pointed out with all the new products he introduced. So I\u2019m quite confident that with the trillions of dollars of exposure that\u2019s out there and the whole host of different durations associated with lending today that we have to continue to innovate and that\u2019s exactly what we did the last 10 years, to give the numbers that Sean just raised a moment ago. So that\u2019s the way I look at the next several years. We\u2019ll continue to look at what the needs of the market are to mitigate their risk, no matter what the price of the Fed lending rate will be because we know there\u2019s trillions of dollars out there that needs to be managed. So I\u2019m quite optimistic about that business. Thank you.","Jeremy Campbell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.","Owen Lau","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. So you announced the divestitures of some businesses like NEX Exchange, NEX Treasury and so could you please size the revenue and expense impact of those businesses for us. And do you have any timing of the sale or you are still in the process to look for buyers. And additionally, you also expect to realize $30 million expense synergy this year up $5 million, but maintain the run rate at $50 million. What was driving that acceleration of the expense synergies realization. Thank you.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks. Thanks, Owen. I\u2019ll let John go ahead and address that.","John Pietrowicz","Yes, thanks, Owen. Yes. Let\u2019s talk about kind of the businesses that that we\u2019ve acted on. ENSO closed at the beginning of the \u2013 of October. NEX Exchange and NEX Treasury, we anticipate closing in the fourth quarter and then we have [indiscernible] which is a platform in Italy that we are winding down. So when we look at the forecast for 2020. The impact on revenue was about $15 million. The impact on direct costs were about $25 million. So those are at a forecasted loss of around $10 million. So those are \u2013 those we\u2019ve all, we\u2019ve acted on \u2013 on all of those businesses. With regard to the \u2013 with regard to the synergies, we did increase our \u2013 the amount we realized in terms of synergies this year and really, it\u2019s a function of the great work that you know that the management team has done in terms of managing the integration. We were able to make some of the office moves faster than we had originally anticipated, which allowed us to capture some of those synergies earlier than we anticipated. So we actually realize more synergies this year and we\u2019re well on track for achieving the $50 million run rate synergies by the end of this year and that\u2019s net of, as I mentioned previously, we do have a double carry in terms of infrastructures, where we have a, the NEX legacy infrastructure as well as the Globex infrastructure running in parallel in anticipation of that migration of BrokerTec in and EBS. So really as Terry indicated in his prepared remarks. very, very pleased with the way the integration has been going and really excited about kind of the future of our business with NEX.","Owen Lau","That\u2019s very helpful, thank you very much.","John Pietrowicz","Sure. Thanks, Owen.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Owen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thanks guys. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for the next-gen EBS platform and then how is this platform different from Globex?","Terrence Duffy","Right. Why don\u2019t we have Sean and Bryan discuss that real quick, Sean?","Sean Tully","Sure. Very briefly in September, we did announce that we will be launching over the next 18 months, we\u2019ll be migrating clients from the current EBS Direct platform to what we call EBS QDM 2.0. The primary differences are much, much faster speed and much greater bandwidth. So these platforms are direct trading platforms between counterparties. And so the faster speed, the greater bandwidth gives \u2013 that gives much more efficient trading at much lower latency, which is very attractive to market participants. The other thing I will remind you. And so, again that\u2019s a rollout over 18 months, it\u2019s going to take time, but at the moment, participants are consuming the data over the platform. They\u2019re not actually transacting and they\u2019re doing that in order to test the performance of the system before it is used for actual trading and the performance results so far very pleasing relative to both their and our expectations. The other thing on that platform that we have that you should be well aware of is the analytics that allow customers to continuously revise the way they execute their trades and to optimize it for lower costs. So we\u2019re very excited about the enhancements that we are making to the EBS technologies as well as the other technologies that we are \u2013 that we inherited from the NEX businesses. Bryan?","Bryan Durkin","Major value driver of all of this is moving all of these markets and to Globex without a doubt and engaging with our client base and the most active users of EBS. There is a great deal of enthusiasm and the migration to the Globex platform. I think, it\u2019s fair to say that the EBS platform was due for some substantial upgrades prior to our acquisition and so the ability now to have the benefits of infrastructure that they\u2019re already used to being able to migrate now these markets onto that platform and as we\u2019re doing it, we\u2019re enhancing functional attributes that they need it and want it for some time. We\u2019re also reducing the complexity in terms of how order messaging comes into the platform and how those orders are received by the matching engine. So it\u2019s very important for us to be actively engaged with the client base as we\u2019re going through this integration process. The feedback that we\u2019re getting so far is extremely positive.","Chris Harris","Thank you.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks for your question, Chris.","Operator","Thank you.. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with the Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks for taking my follow-up. Just one clarification on the tax rate. John is that 23.5% is that a good run rate to consider also for 2020?","John Pietrowicz","Yes. Great, great question, Brian, it\u2019s a function of what we think the business is going to be looking like in 2020. But really, the tax benefit that we\u2019re getting this quarter, we anticipate that continuing until \u2013 until 2025, where it gets you know, decreases by about a third. So we\u2019re anticipating a tax benefit of 40 \u2013 between $45 million and $50 million per year, obviously subject to any potential tax law changes is subject to the finalization of the regulations, which we don\u2019t anticipate changing. So this benefit that we\u2019re getting in terms of servicing our international customers outside of the US from within the US is an ongoing benefit for us and we\u2019ll provide the effective tax rate guidance going into our fourth quarter call in February. So very, very, very pleased with our international growth and international expansion. Our strategy of growing globally again is benefited through our tax situation.","Brian Bedell","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe if I could just throw in on one aspect of my \u2013 of my first question and that was just the, your guys view or maybe Sean could comment on this, on the FASB hedge accounting rules. And I think Bryan, you mentioned, regional banks are now, you\u2019ve been able to penetrate the regional bank community, a little bit better with the combined sales force. So just thinking about what banks may do in particular. Now that the hedge accounting has been relaxed, which I think allows MBS hedging \u2013 more MBS hedging, if I\u2019m right on that.","John Pietrowicz","Yes the \u2013 certainly the action that the FASB has taken has really made it certainly much more easier and efficient from a financial reporting perspective to for utilization of our products. I think really, this is really I think more on the margins than it is a kind of a major driver of activity because at the end of the day, it\u2019s really the economic impacts that people are concerned about rather than the financial reporting, which does have some impact, but I think, it\u2019s more on the margins. I don\u2019t know, Sean, do you.","Sean Tully","Hi John, I don\u2019t think I have much to add there, I mean in addition to that Brian, it\u2019s, we wouldn\u2019t be able to track what impact that\u2019s having very closely, probably, again a small positive marginal benefit.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Terrence Duffy","Thank you, Brian","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, thanks for taking my follow-up, just curious if you could, if you could give us an update on the net investment income line. Just the total cash collateral like average in the quarter and your basis point fee, you\u2019re generating on that. And then if we get another cut from the Fed, and just how that net fee rate will likely move going forward.","John Pietrowicz","Yes. Great. I\u2019m glad you asked because I have been studying this so. So anyway, Kyle. So taking a look at the non-operating portion of our section, you could \u2013 of our income statement, you can see that, it\u2019s gone up about $5 million and really, it\u2019s a function of a couple of primarily two things, one is we did have a sequential increase of about $2 million related to cash on deposit at the \u2013 at the Clearinghouse and that was partially offset by lower returns that we got on those balances and the balances increased about on average, the average balances increased about $3.8 billion, so it went from about on average $25.6 billion in the second quarter to about $29 billion, up $29.5 billion in the third quarter, the amount of return we got went from about 34 basis points to 32 basis points from Q2 to Q3. So in total, it was a sequential increase of about $2 million. We did have a change in our \u2013 in the amount we charge for non-cash collateral, which is in the other income section of our \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the other revenue section of our income statement and that increased sequentially about $10 million. So that\u2019s not in the other income section but up of another other revenue. The other main driver of the non-operating section of our income statement is lower interest expense. That\u2019s down about $2.3 million and that\u2019s really a function of, that\u2019s really a function of lower \u2013 lower balances, lower debt balances, we\u2019ve been focused on paying down our debt. So those are the two main drivers in the other non-operating income section of our income statement. I do want to point out, we did have a reclass from investment income of about $3 million to equity and non \u2013 equity earnings and non-consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries and that is really related to legacy NEX investments. So that will now be recorded in equity earnings and unconsolidated subsidiaries. So those are the main drivers.","Kyle Voigt","That\u2019s great, thank you. If I could just ask one more, just on your balance sheet. I think you have about $400 million of CP outstanding right now. If I\u2019m calculating that correctly. Do you anticipate paying down that commercial paper completely by the end of the year, or maybe just timing there. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much of your \u2013 your cash flow would be available for the annual variable dividend this year. Thanks.","John Pietrowicz","Yes, sure. Yes, we don\u2019t. We don\u2019t give out guidance on that. So just to kind of walk down our capital structure, we had about $1.3 billion cash on hand \u2013 was comfortable with the $700 million minimum cash balance, we\u2019re comfortable at that \u2013 that level. We have $1.3 billion cash on hand. We\u2019ve got $3.9 billion in total debt of which we have $435 million in commercial paper and we\u2019re currently sitting at a 1.2 times debt to EBITDA as we paid down about $0.5 billion in debt since the first of the year. In terms of when you look at modeling the fourth quarter, generally. We do have one of our larger cash builds. Obviously, it\u2019s subject to business performance in the fourth quarter. We don\u2019t have pension funding as we pre-funded that in 2017. So if you look at historical cash trends, we usually have a pension funding, but like I said, we mentioned \u2013 we pre-funded that in 2017. So we will not have one in 2019. We anticipate lower than historical tax payments as a result of the tax change. So that will have a fairly significant impact in terms of the cash flows in \u2013 then in the fourth quarter, which will be a benefit in terms of cash generation in the fourth quarter. We do have a bond interest payment in the fourth quarter and AP tends to be higher in Q4. And we also have a dividend in December. So those are some kind of puts and takes to help in terms of modeling the cash flow in the fourth quarter. In terms of the actual pay down of the commercial paper, we\u2019re not giving any guidance on that.","Kyle Voigt","Okay, thank you.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Kyle.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Richard Repetto","Yes, hi, Terry and John, just one quick last follow-up. The retail e-brokers went to zero commissions on the equity and ETF trades, and I know the futures trades are still a premium. I guess in retail, I think it\u2019s been a good part of your volume and you mentioned that before. I think it was 10% or somewhere around there. But anyway, do you expect to see any impact, I know, you offer some, what you call benefits to futures trading on for that retail account. You can\u2019t get in equities as well. So how do you see the balance and that the zero commission impacting your, the retail side of your business.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Rich. I\u2019ll let Bryan touch on that and then I\u2019ll give a comment.","Bryan Durkin","Thanks, Rich. Our retail partners continue to look to us for products, education, sales and our marketing efforts to help them grow and expand their client opportunities, we\u2019ve developed some very strong partnerships in this regard over the last several years and it\u2019s been very fortuitous in terms of a growing segment, as you well know business for us. They look to us for one, liquidity in the products that we offer. The margin efficiencies and leverage offered in our futures versus the other alternatives. And then our 24\/7 global access to our liquidity that in concert with the education efforts that we\u2019ve undertaken with them has allowed us to help them grow their user base significantly in terms of focusing them toward certain asset classes and products. Through these efforts, I appreciate through Julie Winkler\u2019s sales team and her marketing effort. We\u2019ve been very dedicated to our retail growth efforts. We\u2019ve been successful in generating over 90,000 new retail futures traders in this year alone. Just to break that down a little bit. Our retail average daily volume today is about 734,000 contracts in Q3, which is up 34% and out of this. We\u2019re very excited to say 49% growth coming out of EMEA and 26% of this is coming out of Asia. When you look at the product innovation perspective, we rely heavily on this Group as well in terms of addressing their increased demand for example for the Micro E-minis and the efforts that have come out of that. It\u2019s one of our most successful product launches as Sean and Terry have outlined. And on the education front, we continue to work very collaboratively in providing education and marketing efforts to grow that knowledge base of our products and our most recent success area. It\u2019s been an area of consistent focus for the last two years is in options. Our options growth through from this community has been tremendous. So when you take a look at the total cost of trade from perspective given all of the above that I have just outlined, we are very confident in our retail clients and our partner firms and that will continue to look to our offerings.","Terrence Duffy","And Rich, just to add to that. I think Bryan summed it up quite well. But if you look at what some of the biggest retail brokers are saying that use our products today, they are saying, they are with some of their most valued clients that they have today. I think that that\u2019s an important statement that they\u2019re making, that\u2019s not us making it, it\u2019s that them making it, I don\u2019t want to reference it, in case, I don\u2019t mean to say their name, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want. I would not want to see retail brokers trying to push people into derivatives or futures that don\u2019t have a good understanding of them. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re all about when we talk about retail, we talk about sophisticated participants. And I think, that\u2019s a lot what these discount brokers have. So we\u2019ll continue the educational process, working with the retail brokers into our product line, but at the same time, because their business model may have shifted a little bit on zero commissions. We don\u2019t want to just pushing them into our markets so that they are not accustomed to.","Richard Repetto","Got it. Very well prepared answer, Terry and Bryan.","Terrence Duffy","Thank you.","Bryan Durkin","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. At this time we have no further questions, so I will turn it back to management for closing comments.","Terrence Duffy","Well we thank you all very much. We look forward to talking to you over the next several weeks and we\u2019ll see you in next quarter. Those were my questions today.","John Pietrowicz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Peschier. Thank you. You may begin.","John C. Peschier","Thank you for joining us. Gill and John will spend a few minutes outlining the highlights of the fourth quarter and then we will open it up for your questions. Terry, Bryan and Kim are on the call as well, and will participate in Q&A. Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language.","Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you, John, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our team's efforts and our performance during 2014. Further, the Q4 results we are going to talk about today were outstanding, and I'm proud of our staff for their hard work during some pretty difficult times. During the fourth quarter, our ADV reached almost 15 million contracts, up more than 30%, and it is our second highest volume quarter in our history during a normally slow time of the year. We saw significant growth in every product area, ranging from 14% growth in metals to 41% growth in interest rates. Record options ADV increased 38%, and futures rose 29%. Q4 revenue of $841 million was the second highest we have ever had. Most importantly, our earnings per share on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was up more than 50%.","Over the last 3 to 4 years, we have been investing organically in a very targeted way to broaden our global reach and to drive more core volume growth as trading conditions improve. I've spoken about this on every earnings call since I became CEO, and we are making progress.","During the quarter, we traded 3 million contracts per day from outside the United States, by far, the highest level we've ever seen. Revenue from outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 30% of our Globex revenue and 24% of the volume. Our liquidity is building around the clock. You certainly saw that on our record day in October, when a much higher proportion traded from outside the U.S. than an average day.","Fourth quarter electronic ADV from European clients was 2.4 million contracts, up 45% on a year-over-year basis, outperforming North America, which rose 31%.","In Europe, we saw growth of 61% year-over-year in our interest rate business, and 32% growth in equities during the quarter.","About 3 years ago, we made a concerted effort to reach out to educate European clients about the product suite client-by-client. In 2014, we spent considerable time talking to these clients about our OTC rates offering and marketing how our Eurodollars, treasuries and other products can be utilized. We also pointed that the interest rate curve was more dynamic in the U.S. and provided more opportunity for them than other alternatives. Based on our efforts and market conditions, both hedgers and speculators from this region have ramped up the activity in our markets. The portion of our interest rate swap business coming from outside the U.S. is increasing, particularly from European-based clients. This is surprising since the European mandate for clearing is still several quarters away. We have successfully transitioned some businesses from these clients into futures, driven by superior capital efficiency relative to swaps.","In Asia, our volumes rose 51% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Our equities volume grew 96%, energy jumped 56% and the interest rates were up 54%. In Asia, in our view, we are at very early stages in terms of awareness and education and, ultimately, the conversion of new clients. Many of our client meetings are about expanding the full breadth of our product offering and when we make progress, the discussion turns to connectivity through our training platform and establishing clearing relationships. Once we successfully engage, the ongoing trading activity tends to be fairly sticky. Based on where we are at this point and the large number of potential clients, I anticipate this region will be the fastest-growing area for CME Group over the next 3 to 5 years.","I will now shift to talking about a few of our product areas, starting with rate futures, options and cleared swaps. Our OTC efforts continued to progress in the fourth quarter. We had the highest clearing revenue to date in Q4, which John will touch upon. In interest rates swaps, during 2014, we overtook our competitor in D2C dollar-based clearing, moving from 32% market share in 2013 to 49% in 2014, including 55% in the fourth quarter. We recently have picked up market share as well in nondollar swap clearing, which you can see on Slide 9.","In addition to significant customer engagement, our unique portfolio margining value proposition is clearly drawing more U.S. and European clients our platform. As an update, we are now up to 36 firms utilizing portfolio margining, double the 17 we had at the end of 2013. We are currently providing $3.9 billion of savings versus $1 billion at the end of 2013. We added 2 additional FCMs who are live with our clients and increasing the total to 9 FCMs. Trade count market share, which is most closely tied to revenue, jumped from 47% from 2013 to 51% in Q4 2014.","Lastly, we are currently at 64% of the open interest in terms of the global OTC clearing houses. We continue to market our interest rate futures and options to our more than 500 OTC clearing customers. Clearly, this is one of the drivers of our 40-plus percent growth in rates volume during Q4 and almost 20% growth in 2014. Comparatively, the FICC businesses at banks, European rates, volumes and cash treasury volumes were all under pressure.","I wanted to share a couple of updates on statistics that we follow very closely. Large open interest holders in rates jumped by 15% during 2014 to 1,615 firms spread over our rate futures complex. About half of this increase was in our Eurodollars, 2-year treasuries and Fed fund contracts, so we are seeing more focus on the front end now.","Our treasury futures notional volume was -- as a percent of reported cash treasuries jumped to 75% for full year, up from 67% in 2013.","Lastly, block volumes are up 80% in 2014 for rate products, outperforming other venues. This is an indicator of large participants entering our markets and using futures for OTCs now trading.","Our focus is to continue to aggressively draw attention to the advantages of our products, and I would expect the debate about the Fed decision-making to remain in place. Because we list contracts up to 10 years, one of the nice things for us is we benefit financially prior to the actual first increase and then beyond. Within treasuries, we have seen an increased volatility in market events recently. In January, treasury futures were up 25% and treasury options were up 31%. Activity that is clearly hinged to both domestic and global events has us interconnected.","Lastly, we are working to leverage our connectivity and relationships with credit trading clients to increase activity in our credit default swap business. During Q4, our revenue exceeded $1 million for the first time and was up 67% sequentially, as we achieved the highest revenue market share yet. While the current revenue is fairly small, this is worth watching in 2015 as we expand our offerings.","Turning to FX. We had a challenging time during the first 8 months of 2014, with extremely low volatility and turmoil in the cash FX market. Volumes averaged around 700,000 per day during that time. From September to December, we averaged 1 million per day, up 36% versus the prior year as volatility returned to normalized levels. In January, our FX business rose more than 20% from the prior year. Our expectation is that market participants will continue to be drawn to the deep liquidity we have in FX and the safety and soundness of a cleared market. Our trading and clearing processes functioned very smoothly during the Swiss Franc event that occurred a few weeks ago. We are pleased that we are at near-record open interest and continue to grow the number of large open-interest holders, which in a higher-trending volatility environment should support our volume growth. We have seen a pick-up in our energy business, and our market share grew during the year in natural gas and crude oil.","Volatility hit an all-time low in energy in the second and third quarters last year, and we have seen outsized activity as that has changed. WTI prices were range-bound between $80 and $105 for a few years, and we have clearly rebased, which very few experts projected last June. Volatility now is back near historical norms. And as we know, these markets are difficult to predict. Our team is heavily engaged with energy customers about our full suite of products and the unique possibilities in the marketplace. We are increasingly focused on the European energy markets, where a large percentage of the business remains uncleared.","As you all know, innovation has been a hallmark of our exchange, and we have certainly not slowed down on that front. Recently, we calculated the volume and revenue from products launched since closing our mergers. In total, since 2010, we have driven 450 million new contracts traded and $380 million of incremental revenue from these products. Over the last quarter, we have announced many other new product expansions, including palm oil swamps, iron ore futures, European natural gas, kilo gold futures and physically settled cocoa futures in Europe. We are working as closely as ever with both domestic and non-U.S.-based clients I mentioned, and they are looking for more alternatives from us. In particular, our new European natural gas activity has exceeded our oil expectation during the first few weeks of trading, driven by commercial user participation.","Finally, we made some important decisions in October to rightsize our company and to reorganize our structure. The new accountability and structure has worked well and will help as we execute our goals in 2015 and beyond. We are completely focused on efficiency throughout the organization and meeting the demands of our customers in practically any environment. Our focus is on driving operating margins, earnings and free cash flow higher, which is currently how our compensation targets are set throughout the firm. I thank my colleagues for their significant effort and engagement.","With that, let me turn the call over to John Pietrowicz to discuss the financials.","John W. Pietrowicz","Thank you, Gill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with how we finished 2014 with a strong fourth quarter performance. We continued to demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our business model.","Looking at the adjusted results, revenue increased by $154 million or 22% compared to Q4 last year, and expenses increased less than 1%. Most importantly, our adjusted earnings per share rose more than 50%.","Now I'll turn to some revenue details. The rate per contract for Q4 was $0.731, up from $0.725 last quarter despite higher volume. The main driver for the increase was a shift in the product mix, with an increased proportion of total volume from higher-priced commodity products.","OTC swaps revenue totaled $18 million for the quarter, up 16% versus last quarter. In Q4, we captured $148 per IRS OTC trade due to positive customer mix shifts this quarter. We cleared approximately 1,780 trades per day in the quarter, up from prior quarters. In January, that has jumped to more than 2,000 per day. Market data revenue is up 17% versus Q4 last year, driven primarily by our pricing change, but also bolstered by new paying customers.","Lastly, other revenues is up sequentially, driven by approximately $3 million related to platform development with our partners in Brazil. Also, we had higher compliance fines compared to the prior quarter, which was offset in other expense.","Adjusted expenses in Q4 were $341 million, close to Q4 last year when we had elevated technology-related costs. Based on the very strong volume in Q4 and higher-than-expected revenue, our license fees and bonus grew more than we projected during the last call. Total compensation was down $2 million sequentially despite the higher bonus, driven by recent staff reductions. At the end of Q3, we had 2,825 employees and we ended the year at approximately 2,685, which is down approximately 5%.","Turning to taxes. The effective rate for the year ended at about 37% on a pro forma basis, down from last year's 37.6%, with the effective tax rate for this quarter of approximately 36.4%.","And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the year, we had more than $1,550,000,000 in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. In January, we paid out $671 million in our variable dividend of $2 per share. Following the dividend payout and the impact of strong fourth quarter as well as cash flow timing, we started the year with approximately $880 million of cash. We are extremely focused on providing a significant return of capital to our shareholders, including our recently announced 6% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share.","During the fourth quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances totaled $42 million, and for the year, we came in at $138 million. This is below guidance provided the last quarter, and the difference was driven largely by a shift in real estate-related timing.","Now I'd like to turn to our forward guidance for 2015. As you know, we don't provide volume or revenue projections. We said last quarter that we would go through our budgeting process and that we expected to be able to keep expenses flat in 2015. After a thorough review, our expense guidance for 2015 is flat at $1.31 billion. Based on the fact that variable expenses increase as transaction fees grow, we will be extremely focused on our discretionary and fixed infrastructure expenses to support this guidance at higher revenue levels than we saw in 2014.","I'll provide some assistance in terms of the expense line items. Compensation is likely to be higher in 2015, as normal merit promotion increases and some selective hiring more than offset the reduction from our October announcement. Our bonus at the target level in 2015 is approximately $70 million, which is similar to the actual payout this year, with obviously higher targets. As information, the ceiling on the bonus is $105 million, and we would have to exceed our cash earnings target by 20% to reach that level.","Turning to the license fee line, there are 3 product groups that contribute to virtually all of the expense. The largest impact is in our equity business, where we have a profit share with our indexed joint venture, so as that business line changes, the payout will fluctuate. We capture approximately 7% of this in nonoperating income and expense due to our ownership stake in the joint venture. The other 2 product areas which drive license fees are energy, based on ClearPort broker incentives; and our interest rate swaps revenue share with founding members. Volume in our core interest rates, FX, ags and metals futures products have very little impact on this line. This means our license fees as a percentage of transaction fees is impacted by product mix. For example, in 2014, the ratio ranged from 4%, when interest rate volumes dominated in Q3, and that jumped to 4.8% in Q4, when we saw a surge in equities and energy volumes alter the mix.","In addition, in 2015, we plan to reduce marketing and other expenses by approximately $10 million. I know it is difficult for you to triangulate where our expenses would be at various revenue levels. The management team is very focused on delivering expenses at $1.31 billion in 2015, and we all realize that variable expenses may be impacted at different revenue levels. We will do our best to reduce costs without impacting our growth plans, if volume grows significantly. The bottom line is that if our expenses end up being materially higher than our guidance due the variable expenses because our revenue is so high, I will be happy, and I suspect our shareholders will be too.","One final point on expenses. We have traditionally guided to mid-single-digit expense growth for the company, and we were at that level during the last few years, even as we invested in new growth areas. With much of the infrastructure in place now, we are revising our expense outlook to low- to mid-single digit range for the next few years. We will methodically look at our business to drive efficiencies. An example of that is the announcement last night concerning the closure of most of our futures pits and 2 of our options pits, which we anticipate completing in July. As a result, we will reduce annual expense by approximately $10 million. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million in 2015, in line with where we have been the last few years, and that includes some of the real estate carryover from last year.","Our tax rate is expected to be 37%, assuming no change in Illinois income tax laws or any corporate tax changes at the federal level.","In terms of market data, we are working with our intermediaries to help them appropriately categorize subscriber usage, and we will complete our first billing process in late February for those that operated under our now-expired market data electronic trading waiver. Therefore, we will provide more color on the expected financial impact of the change on our Q1 earnings call.","As a reminder, beginning in January 2015, we started to charge 50% of our monthly rate per screen to previously waived professional subscribers, which equates to $42.50 per month per CME Group exchange. We have been working closely with our client base and provided the market a 2-plus year transition period before charging the full rate, which will take effect in January 2016. At that point, we will be in line with other exchanges that eliminated the market data waiver several years ago. For now, the consensus estimate of $375 million of market data revenue is an appropriate placeholder. I look forward to providing you more clarity in a few months.","Finally, we adjusted transaction fee pricing across all 6 products in a targeted way, which went into effect earlier this week. We expect the transaction fee revenue to increase approximately 1.5%, assuming the same mix levels in 2015, and the largest percentage change will be in interest rates, primarily in treasuries.","Now for a brief comment concerning our transaction with GFI. As you saw, CME and GFI mutually terminated our merger agreement. The battle that unfolded over the last few months was over the IDB business and was not our fight, which led to our decision to ultimately take a step back from the transaction. However, we will still have an agreement with JPI, GFI's largest shareholder, that limits their ability to sell their shares or vote their shares for an alternative transaction for 12 months.","Looking forward, we have been a part of the Trayport platform for some time, and we have a long-term commercial agreement with Trayport. We will continue to build our energy business through the platform. As Gill mentioned, we recently launched European natural gas products, which are off to a good start. Activity in January continued to be robust. We averaged more than 15.6 million contracts per day for the month, up more than 20%. Similar to Q4, we saw strength across the board, with all product areas up double digits and outperforming other multi-asset class derivatives exchanges.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And I guess if I got one question, it's going to be on the options. And you devote a number of slides on that. You're also closing the pits, except for the options. And I guess, Gill, the question is, if we hit that and -- how close are we to this inflection point? And I guess there is still a message that by keeping the options pits or certain option pits open that that's still vital in certain product areas anyway.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thanks for that question, which I will ask Bryan to add some specifics to what I'm going to say. But as far as this inflection point is concerned, I think you have reached there with respect to those contract that tend to trade in a front-month type of configuration. But for those option contracts where the trading spreads across a curve or across multiple months, those are the options that continue to trade somewhat on the floor. So while overall, our options percentage is 52%, some of the pits have far exceeded that amount. And for those that have not, those are the pits that will remain open. Now the option and the choices of many other folks that have shut the floor was to just force the thing onto a box. That's not the way we have been running this because the integrity of the marketplace is paramount for us, and we want to make sure that when it transitions, it transitions in a way that we saw the futures do so. Bryan, you want to add?","Bryan T. Durkin","And just from an asset-class basis, we're really pleased with our aggressive penetration of the development of the options market across all of our asset classes. We've seen anywhere from a growth rate of 20% to 36%, and that's across all asset classes. We're seeing that nice pickup occurring, both domestically and across all of our regional offices. So the expansion of distribution, the access to product, the development of product, particularly in the area of weekly options, is all adding to this growth trajectory.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And I mean, you're certainly doing everything you can here by closing the pit -- pits, as well as the price increase seemed sort of targeted at the pit -- what do you call it -- trading as well. So anyway, that's all I had.","Phupinder S. Gill","Yes, Rich, just one point of clarification. The price increases that we put in place did not target the pit. It was basically we targeted certain asset classes.","Operator","Dan Fannon from Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, just a follow-up on that, on the price increases. Can you talk about the philosophy behind the products that you chose? And if we go back to the last round of price increases, is there anything left that you haven't adjusted in the last couple of years with regards to the transaction on the futures side?","John W. Pietrowicz","Dan, this is John Pietrowicz. The largest increase this year is in interest rates, with the increase above the aggregate 1.5% level, with the main impact in treasuries. We did make a move with Eurodollars, but they're already priced higher than many products, based on a price per unit of risk. FX was the second-highest percentage, with ags the least impacted. And last year, when we did a 2% to 3% price increase, ags were the most impacted. So over the last couple of years, we've hit all of the asset classes, and we're always constantly looking at our pricing schedule.","Operator","Alex Kramm from UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, real quick on the market data. I mean, I am -- I appreciate that you want to update us in a couple of months here, but can you at least give us some of the tools so we can run some scenarios? I mean, like how many waive terminals do you have right now? So if we assume 50% are gone, we can do our own math here.","John W. Pietrowicz","Sure, Alex. This is John. We think the ending of the market fee waiver program is an exciting opportunity for us, but to size the opportunity is difficult to predict. We have several hundred thousand waive terminals, and it's difficult to calculate how the customers will rationalize it when they have to pay for a service that was previously free. And also, as I mentioned on the prepared remarks that we plan to charge the full fees in January of 2016. So that's -- so after we go through our first billing cycle, we'll be able to provide more clarity in -- on the Q1 earnings call in April.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That several hundred thousand was all that I was looking for. If you can get a little more specific, that'd be great too, but I can leave it at that.","Bryan T. Durkin","Just to keep in mind, early after the announcement, we started getting an uptake in new registrants as a result of that waiver. We're continuing to see an inflow of new subscribers that, in the past, had fallen under the waiver. It's a very good trajectory for us. We're seeing an increase of about $40 million in our revenue, and a good 1\/4 of that is coming from new subscribers as a result of the elimination of this waiver.","Operator","Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So quick question on the oil complex. You guys highlighted market share gains you had in WTI relative to Brent. I guess I'm wondering if you could give us a little color on what's happening in the market, what's going on there. And then in the past, there had seemed to be some evidence that users were switching from using WTI to Brent. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any of those customers coming back now to WTI.","Phupinder S. Gill","I certainly think that you are, and I think a lot of the answers to your question can be seen on our Slide 14 that we put out there, where you see the growth in TI average daily volume. As importantly, the open interest is up more than 1 million contracts from the end of the year. So to your point about who's adding the positions, if we look at the fundamentals of the contract itself, the gap between TI and Brent has been closed. If you look at the gradual easing of the band of exports, if you think directionally, I think TI has essentially solved a lot of the structural issues that they have. And while the supply issue is still going to dog Brent for a while, we are very excited with respect to what we see, not just on the TI side, but both with respect to TI as well as Brent. I'll ask Bryan to add some specifics here to round up your answer.","Bryan T. Durkin","Yes, I would just add to that by saying the build-up in activity in Brent, at which we've now attracted close to 15% of the market, has definitely complemented our overall energy complex. WTI has been a beneficiary of increased open interest as a result of that build-up across Brent\/WTI as well as our refined products. You'll see quite an uptake and growth in our crack spreads, in particular. And it's the components of all of those that has added to this strong build-up in open interest across all of those products.","Operator","Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just -- I guess, a question, both on the rates and then also on FX. You guys show some of the new users that you're seeing in the market on the rate side in terms of OTC. Just curious in terms of the outlook. On the FX side, are you seeing like a similar trend? And then on rates, it seems like -- I don't know if it was like last quarter, it seemed like you got the transition in the U.S. and then the expectation was that volume would kind of level off to some extent, in terms of on clearing side. And then you would get the transition in Europe and that would pick it up again, but it seems like the growth continues. So I don't know if it's being driven by new users, the products that are coming on that are non-U.S. I just want to get some color on the outlook there, both on the OTC side, but then also on the FX.","Bryan T. Durkin","This is Bryan, and it's a combination of factors. I think, first of all, if you referred to what -- Gill's earlier on comments, 40% of the activity that we're seeing in the interest rates was actually coming from Europe, right? And so when you look at the composition of that, those are new users that are coming, specifically out of Switzerland and London, that have not only started entering trades into clearing for interest rate swaps in a significant amount, but they're also bringing us business into our Eurodollar and our U.S. treasury products. I think another thing that has added to the complement and the tremendous growth in interest rates is the uncertainty of what's happening in the marketplace in general. And by us having that full breadth of the yield curve, you're seeing a nice capability for the marketplace to be able to build up in terms of their expectations and closer to the front end of the curve. If you recall, a couple of years back, we were really building up in the back 32 months of Eurodollars, and we've done a lot to build that activity, create open interest, and volume has occurred in respect to that. But we've also now seen some movement into the front 1\/8 [ph] of that contract, which is also corollary to what we've seen in growth in Fed funds, tremendous growth in Fed funds, our 2-year treasury notes and our overall front-month of euros.","Phupinder S. Gill","To -- just to add to what Bryan just said, and I said this a short while ago. In Europe, we saw a growth of upward of 60% in our interest rate business in the last quarter. And I think that can be attributed to a lot of the things that Bryan said. And also, we are seeing flow coming in, as Bryan told you, before the clearing mandate kicks in Europe. And we think among other factors, the lack of opportunity for the trading community in Europe is bringing them here.","Bryan T. Durkin","And then on the foreign currency side of things, you had asked about the pickup in volume there. We were averaging around 700,000 contracts throughout 2014. That has really up-ticked to over 1 million. We saw that at the fourth quarter, and that's carrying its way through into the first quarter of 2015. What's particularly encouraging is the pick-up in the open interest, 2.4 million contracts. So that's indicative of new users, again, coming into those products.","Operator","Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A question on -- actually, a question for John on the -- what you're seeing -- or what you're thinking about for margins on -- operating margins on the incremental volumes. You mentioned, obviously, the $1.31 billion expense base that you're going to try to keep. Obviously, if revenue's coming in or if volumes are tracking better than your forecast, expenses would go up. If you could maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing through -- or what you're thinking about for incremental margins across the different asset classes.","John W. Pietrowicz","Well, when you look at our incremental margins over the last couple of quarters, we've been averaging around 95%. Previous to that, we've been in the ranges of 80% to 90%. Obviously, we're striving to get as close to 100% as we can. But that said, when you take a look, we're planning on keeping our expenses flat, and you have to kind of run your scenario around the revenue on that. But we're feeling very good about how we're positioned in terms of our revenue. And then, when you keep your expenses flat, like we did this quarter, we're driving EPS growth of about 50%. That, then, obviously leads to our dividends. So the management here is really focused on driving as much revenue to the bottom line as absolutely possible.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And any major difference between asset classes? Or pretty much across the board?","John W. Pietrowicz","No, they're -- it's pretty much across the board.","Phupinder S. Gill","That would -- dated [ph] growth we are seeing across all asset classes.","Operator","Niamh Alexander from KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just over to the capital for a little bit. I think we asked last quarter as well, but just to get an update, there seems to be still some noise about maybe the exchanges putting a little bit more capital upfront in the waterfall system, or skin in the game, as some of the members are calling it, or dealers. Help me just think about it. Is there something we should be thinking about? Maybe more capital getting allocated here? Or you're pretty comfortable where you're at, and the debate doesn't really change anything?","Phupinder S. Gill","We are comfortable with where we're at. I'll ask Kim to address the rest of the question.","Kimberly S. Taylor","Yes, thanks. Niamh, the debate around skin in the game is certainly an interesting debate. We believe -- we're big believers in the importance of people who bring risk into the system putting up the skin in the game to cover that risk. So we're really a little bit troubled by the way the debate is being handled in the industry now. It seems to be defining skin in the game so very, very narrowly as just funds that the clearing house puts at the front of the waterfall. And if you think about the reason that the regulators pushed OTC clearing mandate after the crisis, it is for the very reason that clearing houses exist, to ensure that all participants who bring risk into the system appropriately pay for the risk that they bring. So the skin in the game that market users and the clearing members bring to cover the exposure that they bear is the most important element of the system and an issue that we're very, very focused on, managing the concentration risk. We encourage you all to actually look at our paper that we put out about this to help to kind of broaden out the debate.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess, just to -- is there anything from the regulator perspective? There's no ongoing discussion or open comment period or anything like this that we should be watching or anything like that. Is that fair?","Kimberly S. Taylor","No, there's nothing -- there's no active regulatory action about this at all.","Operator","Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So following up on the announcement of the closing of the pits, you mentioned that there was $10 million in annual savings. So if I read correctly, I think there's 1,200 traders in the pit. I assume there's a lot of support. $10 million doesn't seem like there's a lot, maybe that's an initial number. Does that $10 million in expense reduction kind of grow over time as maybe more support and infrastructure rolls off? And then, without the trading pits, do you need to be in your current building? I think you lease some of the trading floor space. You own some trading floor space. I was just looking at some rents there, but it would seem like the cost savings from the reduction in real estate would well exceed $10 million of savings. So what happens to the real estate side, and maybe the ties to the heart of Chicago without the trading floors?","John W. Pietrowicz","Ken, this is John Pietrowicz. When we take a look at the cost to run the trading floors, it's approximately $50 million annually. We ended up reducing the number of pits for the futures side and 2 options pits, which accounted for approximately 5% of the volume, and we're taking out close to 20% of the costs. To give you an idea, the options business is a pretty good business for us. Not pretty good, it's a very good business for us. We generate about $120 million to $150 million per year in revenue, so it's a very good margin business. In terms of infrastructure, we own the trading floor building in Chicago and, obviously, we'd look at ways to monetize it as we've done monetizing other buildings that we've owned, should we ever reach that point.","Phupinder S. Gill","And Ken, just to address the heart of Chicago issue, what is at the heart of Chicago is innovation, not the places where innovation is actually put out. So what CME has been doing, have been very focused on meeting our client needs, very focused on organic growth. Some of the contracts that we launched, some of the things that we've talked about in the past like swaptions are going to be new in the cleared world. Repo clearing, as you probably read, is an endeavor that CME Group, among others, are pursuing. So our philosophy has always been -- and we've talked about this in the past, is on need, meeting our client needs. And we believe that if we met those needs, it will drive our earnings higher. That's the heart of Chicago, though.","Operator","Christian Bolu from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christian Bolu","Just a quick question on the balance sheet. That continues to grow pretty significantly. Performance bonds are now over $40 billion. Can you remind us exactly what kind of economics -- or how you are to charge economics for those assets? And how much more you can get in a higher rate environment?","John W. Pietrowicz","With regard to the growth in the performance bonds, last year at 12\/31, we had about $21 billion in performance bonds that grew to $40.6 billion of performance bonds. That's split between $22 billion in cash and $16.7 billion in treasuries, and then we have some other funds in there. In terms of how we charge for that, we are working on ways to -- we're working on it and we're analyzing the situation. So right now, there's not much to talk about with regard to how we're charging for the performance bonds. I would say that the significant increase is primarily related to our OTC business.","Phupinder S. Gill","Yes. And a lot -- as more and more cash comes into the clearing house, we have been having active conversations with our clients with respect to how to go about investing in those funds, and we will have something to talk about, hopefully, in a short while.","Operator","Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So question on some of the anecdotes. We're starting to hear more and more around growth in the ETF arena and how some of the investors are trying to use more and more of those as opposed to the futures, given some of the costs that the banks are passing onto them. Just curious to hear, do you guys consider that as a reasonable -- as a meaningful threat or not? The equities futures business, obviously, the one that comes to mind where that's most relevant. But just kind of curious to hear, broader, whether or not that is a potential threat for your business model, and what you're trying to do to address that, I guess.","Phupinder S. Gill","Alex, thank you, I've -- we have seen some of the so-called white papers that have come out from some of the buy-side firms as well as the sell-side firms. What's interesting to note among the papers is they make a note that is not a -- they're not taking a fact-based approach. And the entire approach as to the cheapness of ETFs seems to be driven by the cost of carry, which is embedded in futures. And so on an apples-to-apples basis -- I believe it's a Goldman analyst who points out that S&P E-minis are still a far more efficient product than the ETF. So now I bring everybody back some years ago, when both JPMorgan as well as Goldman Sachs issued some papers to their clients talking about why, on a fact basis, ETFs are more expensive than futures. Those facts have not changed. And so we are in the process of educating our clients or, in some cases, reeducating our clients with respect to all of the facts. And case in point, we have been -- we are up 20% this year, itself, on the S&P, and we had a very high growth rate last year. And if you look at the liquidity in the contracts themselves, it's 6x more liquid in the S&P than it is in the ETF and the corresponding ETFs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, makes sense. Thanks for that clarification. And then, the second question I have for you guys is just around energy business. I think in the slides, you mentioned that you're reducing the rebates on Brent by about 20%. At what point of time do you think you'd feel comfortable around the volumes that you have been able to track to, sort of turn that into a profit area for you guys? I know you look at it as more as a kind of bundled approach with WTI, but do you ever envision yourself going into a more profitable zone with Brent?","Phupinder S. Gill","Absolutely. This is one of those things and it's -- Brent is not unusual in this sense. We do this with the -- with any launch of a new contract that we have. And what you see us do is we encourage the volume to come on in. The value proposition that we have because of the DME is a unique one. And so what we have seen then is some active trading. And if these were truly just simply guys making market and being flat at the end of the day, you would not see the 760,000 open interests that we have grown. And the most important point here is something that we have stressed to our clients. And the open interest back [ph] -- that's backed out. That they are now -- we are committed to this approach, and it is an energy-complex approach. I mean, not selective. We just want to meet all of our client needs.","Operator","Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, just a follow up. On the closing of the floors, do you expect any revenue impact, either positive or negative for that? And then, the $10 million, just to be clear, is that -- that's an annual number? And is that in the cost guidance for 2015?","John W. Pietrowicz","Sure. This is John. I'll take the second part of that question. The $10 million is an annual number, and it is included in our $1.31 billion guidance.","Phupinder S. Gill","I didn't catch the first question, the first part of the question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The first part was what -- do you expect any revenue impact from closing the floors, either positive or negative from a, say, volume shift over to electronic?","John W. Pietrowicz","Oh, sorry.","Phupinder S. Gill","We -- the volume that's in the pit is very small in 1% -- is 1% and, in many cases, less than that. And so we -- another fact is many -- most, if not all, of the traders that are trading on the floor also have access and use the electronic platform. So you would expect some of them to continue to trade on the platform alone and you -- some of them might decide not to trade anymore. But I stress again, it's so small. It's less than 1%.","John W. Pietrowicz","Yes, and also, we'll be having terminals on the floor for them to access as well, so we don't anticipate there being any revenue leakage.","Phupinder S. Gill","Keep in mind, the floors are not closing. It's just some of the pits that are closing. So all members will continue to have access to our floor.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, okay. And maybe just one last one. Just on the market-maker incentives on the Brent, the 20% reduction. Do you expect that to improve the energy RPC in the first quarter versus 4Q?","Bryan T. Durkin","Slightly. This is Bryan. But I think you just need to keep in mind that, over time, we have reduced the level of those incentives. We're seeing the nice pickup in activity in -- particularly from the aspect of commercial users coming into the product. That has added to our strong buildup of the 600 -- 760,000 plus in open interest.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to our presenters.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thank you, all, for being with us this afternoon, and we look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. Thank you, guys.","John W. Pietrowicz","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Peschier. Please go ahead.","John C. Peschier - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Terry and John will make some initial remarks and then we'll open up the call for your questions. Other members of our team are also here and will participate during the Q&A.","Before they begin, I will read the Safe Harbor language.

Also, on the last page of the earnings release, you will find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, John, I am going to make some initial comments and then I'm going to turn the call over to John Pietrowicz. So, as we look at our average daily volume during the second quarter it grew by 9% to 16.5 million contracts per day. This is extremely impressive growth, especially considering the tough comps we had last year.","During the quarter, our total open interest hit record levels. We also experienced large, open interest holders at record levels in several key products. We had double-digit volume growth in Q2 in our two largest segments, interest rates and energy. We believe we are well-positioned long-term in these products.","Within rates, we delivered strength across the board in Eurodollars Treasuries including the Ultra 10 and the Fed Funds futures. This was driven by exceptional liquidity, capital efficiencies, and continued innovation. In Q2, the Fed elaborated on their plans to reduce their balance sheet over time. This will create another dimension for the trading community to consider.","Energy markets have been particularly dynamic. The U.S. has become the swing producer in the global crude oil market. It has been driven by increased domestic production and rising exports of WTI. This continued structural shift in the global crude market helped us achieve record levels of WTI trading, averaging 1.5 million contracts per day during the quarter.","We are also pleased with the continued growth of natural gas options on Globex. It' has been one of our major initiatives this year. Electronic volumes grew 156% in June. We reached a record 52% electronic in June versus just 1% in June of 2015. Like WTI, over the past two years, we believe our Henry Hub contracts will continue to rise in global relevance. This should be driven by increased U.S. shale gas production and increased U.S. exports of LNG, or liquefied natural gas.","There is a clear trend. WTI and Henry Hub are being adopted as global benchmarks. This is reflected in the fact that 23% of our energy volume came from outside the United States, up from 18% in Q2 last year.","Within FX, we are performing well. We are starting to reap the benefits of our approach to expand our offering to one of the largest asset classes in the world. You see in terms of recent volume growth. We have also seen expanded participation from bank clients. In Q2, we saw continued outperformance relative to the other two largest FX platforms in terms of trading activity. Large, open interest holders in FX are up 11% year-over-year at CME Group.","We are seeing early traction on our recently launched FX monthly futures, targeted towards the $2.4 trillion per day FX swaps market, and so far, we have had 200 unique participants since launch. In addition, in late June we achieved an important step in our ability to provide clearing services for over-the-counter FX options by receiving a notice of non-objection from the CFTC for our margin model, which will enable us to supplement our non-deliverable forward offering.","Our metals volume continues to expand. We had our third consecutive record quarter in retail. It was driven by precious metals average daily volume up 14% and copper up 15%. Both products substantially outperformed volumes on our peer exchanges.","Turning to options, we continue to gain traction with important business. Options are particularly useful for customers in low-volatility environment. This is shown by strong growth in our equity options despite depressed levels of equity market volatility. Total options grew 21% to the same quarter last year. We saw surge in electronic options, up 30% to 2.2 million contracts per day.","From a global perspective, we continue to see strong growth. We had record quarter in terms of ADV from both Europe and Asia. This led to a sizable jump in the percentage of total volume from outside the U.S. It also showed increased participation during non-U.S. trading hours. If you look across the 24-hour day, we saw 33% growth during European hours to 1.4 million contracts per day during Asian hours and we saw 22% growth to 430,000 contracts per day in that region. Our focus continues to be on maximizing our results. There are certain parts of our business we feel confident that we can control to accelerate growth, such as continuing to provide superior customer service and outreach, providing a robust, reliable technology platform, and consistently adding relevant new products.","In closing, earlier last month we launched the Russell 2000 futures. We are pleased with the participation so far, and are well positioned to expand that market. The Russell benefits our clients who want to manage risk in the important small-cap segment. Combined with our other equity products, it gives our customers access to all the major equity indexes on a single platform.","Before I turn it over to John, let me go back on one thing I said about the metals. I said that it was continuing to increase in retail. It's not. That wasn't retail, it was continuing to increase overall. So, I apologize for that misstatement.","And with that, let me turn it over to John.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Terry, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter. Our consistent steady results reflect the benefits of our balanced portfolio of diverse products and our continued efforts to operate our business as efficiently as possible. Our solid clearing and transaction fee revenue was driven by record activity in energy and metals and more than 20% volume growth in interest rates. That, coupled with strong expense discipline, resulted in another quarter of record adjusted net income and earnings per share.","Overall, our rate per contract for the quarter was $0.749, up 2% from the prior quarter. This was primarily due to a product mix shift towards our higher priced commodity products. Market data came in at $96 million, relatively in line with Q1. As indicated on the last call, this will be the general range for 2017. Our additional data products and services beyond real-time sales are more of a 2018 driver.","Other revenue was down $4.6 million sequentially, the result of a few non-recurring one-time items in recent quarters. Also, our interest-earning facilities investment income, which had previously run between $2.5 million and $3 million per quarter and is included in the other revenue section, dropped to almost zero in Q2 as the vast majority of cash margin deposits have been migrated into the Fed facility which has a higher rate of return. The revenue and expense is reflected in non-operating results.","Moving to expenses, our second quarter expense was $261 million, down 3% compared to the prior year, excluding license fees and adjustments: We are maintaining our 1% full-year expense growth guidance, which excludes license fees, based on expected back-half spending. Our adjusted compensation expense was up 3% compared to the same quarter a year ago, but down about $2 million sequentially. Our compensation ratio in Q2 was 14.5%, relatively in line with Q1 and the full-year of 2016.","Looking at the non-operating income and expense line for the second quarter, our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture is what drove the $32 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries. This was the highest quarter we have seen and up 18% from Q2 last year. The compound annual growth rate on this contribution has been 13% since 2013. Our returns from investing cash on behalf of our customers increased sequentially to $21.2 million, up from $12.2 million in Q1.","The tax rate in the second quarter was an adjusted 36.5%, up sequentially as we had guided to last quarter. Given the recent announcement of an increase in the Illinois State income tax starting in July, we expect our tax rate to increase by 0.4% annually and 0.2% for the current quarter. For modeling purposes, I would suggest you use 36.8% for the second half, or 36.5% for 2017.","And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.45 billion in cash and marketable securities. We paid out $223 million in June through our regular quarterly dividend. It is worth noting we have returned approximately $8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends since the implementation of the variable dividend policy in early 2012. Finally, during the second quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $16.5 million. For the year, we now expect $90 million to $95 million of CapEx.","In summary, we continue to execute well on our plans in an efficient and effective manner, no matter the underlying environment. We continue to work closely with our customers. We aim to improve their experience and provide them with solutions to their challenges. We also are positioning ourselves to attract more new users from around the world to our deep liquid capital-efficient markets. For the quarter, our efforts resulted in record adjusted net income and earnings per share. We intend to continue moving forward along this proven path to drive long-term value creation for both customers and shareholders.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question so we can get to everyone. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Speaker","Operator. Thank you, sir. And we will take our first question from Michael Carrier with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.","Sameer Murukutla - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Sameer Murukutla on for Mike Carrier. So just a quick question on the expenses. I know you maintained operating expense guidance, which would lead to a meaningful increase in the back half of the year. Is this all going to be related to marketing comp? Or are there any other line items that we can expect to see the increase?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Hi, Sameer, this is John. As you know, we guided to (12:13) for the year, excluding license fees, and that's at a level below our 2014 spend. As you know, most of our expense lines don't move very much. The two lines I would expect to increase in the back half of the year are professional fees and marketing. Our professional fees fluctuate with timing around projects and project spending, and they were light in the first half, running about 17% below last year. And I don't expect that to continue. And marketing, as you know, is back-end loaded with our customer-facing events in the fourth quarter. We are continuing to manage our cost very carefully and, as you indicated, we are not changing our guidance at this time and we're going to strive to do better than it.","Sameer Murukutla - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah, good morning. I guess, first, good to hear you, Terry, and I hope you're the same kick butt guy there feeling well.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Anyway, my question is, I guess, a little bit more detailed. But on the other revenue, you called it out, John, in the release talking about how some was in the investment income line. I guess my question is, when you talked to us last quarter about $6 million to $7 million incremental non-operating income from the Fed increase and the Fed deposit program, did that include the $2.5 million to $3 million or $2.5 million to $3 million now on top of it, that $6 million to $7 million? And also, how it applies to the June increase, I guess?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure, and thanks, Rich. Yes, the other revenue line was down about $4.6 million, and there's a number of small miscellaneous items that flow through that line. We had, in the first quarter, had some work that we were doing on the clearing side and services side that we had in revenue and there's some adjustments related to that again in the second quarter. But the key thing is that our interest earning facility fees, which historically have been in the $2.5 million to $3 million range and booked in other revenue, is now down in the other income and expense line because folks have been shifting to the \u2013 we have shifted to the Fed accounts. So it's down $2.5 million to $3 million in other revenue, but more importantly, it's better for our customers to have access to the Fed. And that's down on the other income line, which now is running about $21 million, up from about $12 million last quarter.","In fact, when you look at the other income and expense portion of our income statement, for the first half of the year it's around $44 million and in 2014 for the first half of the year it was zero. So we've been very pleased to be able to offer this to our customers. It's been very good for our customers and good for CME Group.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","But, I guess, the question was, is that $2.5 million to $3 million is moving down, is that incremental to the $6 million to $7 million guidance that you said for the second quarter \u2013 and going forward, you said it would be $5 million for the next Fed increase.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yes, yes, thank you, Rich. Yes, it was a $9 million increase from $12 million in other income and expense to $21 million, right? So, it was an increase of $9 million. I would expect going into next quarter an additional $4 million on top of the $21 million, because we'll have a full-year impact of the Fed increase that was done in June. Full quarter impact, I should say.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, hey, good morning. More bigger picture, I guess. There's obviously been a lot of discussion and articles recently around what both the U.S. and Europe is proposing around alternatives to LIBOR. I think you may have talked about this a little bit before, but, given that there is some real timelines now, you're involved with some of that process, maybe you can just give us your bigger picture thoughts, what are the opportunities, what the risks, how you see it today playing out? Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Alex, we're going to turn that over to Sean Tully who is on the committees for this, so, he'll walk you through where we are at today. So, Sean?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, so, thanks for the question. A very good question. CME Group has been very, very closely involved with the marketplace for the customers and with the regulators and with the oversight bodies. Just to note, CME Group is a member of the LIBOR oversight committee over at ICE. CME Group also is a member of the alternative reference rate committee that actually recently voted and determined that a broad Treasury repo rate would be the best alternative reference rate.","In addition to that, Kim Taylor is on the board of directors of ISDA, and CME Group has been working closely with the benchmark fallback working groups at ISDA in order to make sure that we are part of that process and make sure that we are fully in line with the rest of the industry. We actually announced last week, on Wednesday of last week, we had a press release that we are going to be very closely engaged with our customer base in the entire marketplace over the coming weeks and months in order to design and launch the new futures contracts as well as the new interest rate swaps that would be driven by the new alternative reference rate.","We'll be having a webinar on October 4 and we plan to launch futures on the new rates as soon as they are available. This should allow us to provide for the marketplace the natural home for these new products. The CME Group, as you know, we've got the largest U.S. dollar interest rate futures complex in the world, across our Fed Funds, Eurodollars and Treasuries. That home offers enormous benefits for the new index in terms of the margin offsets, the guaranteed fund offsets, and the efficiencies they can have from a capital basis.","In addition to that, we planned, as soon as the rates are available from the Federal Reserve and the Office of Financial Research, we plan on launching the new products. And, in terms of execution, we will also offer inter-commodity spreads with our existing futures. So we see CME Group as the natural home for the new index. We see the opportunity for basis trading of that new index against the rest of our complex, and we see CME Group as the most efficient home for it.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Very good. I might follow-up later. Thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Kyle.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Just I guess one more follow-up on the net investment income and the increases going forward. I think you pass along about 80% of the benefit to your clients, at least in the customer segregated funds. Is that a good way to think about the pass-through rate on all future U.S. hikes? And maybe you could just describe kind of the competitive dynamics or just the \u2013 more just the discussions with your clients around what the benefit that CME sees versus the clients.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Sunil?","Sunil Cutinho - CME Group, Inc.","You know, the way we think about this is, as far as our futures and options complex is concerned, we pass through around 100 basis points and we keep a little bit to cover our costs of the credit facility. So we still maintain our credit facility for the clearinghouses at 364-day facility that we renew every year, and it is meant to cover our liquidity needs in the event of a default. So in order to cover those expenses, we keep a little bit. So as we go forward, we will keep a little bit of the earnings to cover our costs and pass through the rest for our clients.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. But, I guess, is that 80% rate in terms of the pass-through rate, is that a good way to think about the next few Fed hikes?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","You know, I think what we'll do, Kyle, is -- we haven't announced exactly what we're going to do going forward in terms of what we'll pass through. A way to think about it is these customers have alternative locations as to where to invest their money. And so, we want to balance the amount that we return with their alternative choices in terms of investments. So, really what we want to do is to make sure that we offer them an alternative in terms of a risk-free Fed position that is good for them and also, we would then earn on that as well. So, it's really \u2013 it's a function of, as Sunil indicated, covering costs, it's also a function of alternatives that our customers have in terms of where they can invest their funds.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Kyle.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Just a follow-up on the market data. Just wondering if you could kind of update us on what you guys have done, whether it's hiring or some of the investments you're making to kind of make the 2018 opportunity a reality? Or kind of put some -- maybe think about the numbers or the growth for that going forward and what you've kind of done year-to-date to prepare for that.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Bryan?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","We're continuing to execute on our strategy to drive revenue through improved execution in our core market data business and updating our programs and policies accordingly. We've made really good progress in the resourcing of the team focusing primarily on a newer revenue stream for us, as I have alluded to in the past, which is derived data. What we are finding is not only have we made good progress in the development of this business, but it definitely represents an important revenue stream to us and our team is well on its way in responding to and executing on the growing demand for our data IP.","We've also instituted a strategy team, and this team is responsible for expanding our product offerings, and this is largely being driven by business intelligence efforts that are underway today so that we can have a better insight as to the consumers of our data and how that has changed. Data is not being utilized just strictly as we would think for trading terminal usage. It's being utilized for analytics, development of other products, and we're in the process of ensuring that the products and services that we offer are best positioned to commercialize those opportunities. We've also instituted our audit program to ensure that our consumers are actually consuming the data in accordance with their licensing arrangements with us and that we are receiving the appropriate fees. So, we're pleased with the progress we are making in that regard","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up on LIBOR and eurodollars. So, where might the risk be to CME kind of being able to successfully develop a new contract? It seems like you're by far the best positioned, given your existing presence, but where might a savvy ICE or Deutsche Boerse be a possible threat? And then with that in mind, how might the pricing of the new product look? I don't know in the past, but like when you launch new products, do they tend to be priced lower or do they get a premium price because they are new and unique? Great. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Okay, Sean.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yes, Sean chiming in again. So, I would presume that other platforms will launch alternative reference rate contracts. We will also launch alternative reference rate contracts. We will, as always, be very, very close to our customers in terms of designing the contracts. If you look at our Ultra 10, for example, we were very close to the marketplace in designing that new contract, and I'm happy to say just 18 months in that contract has traded over 30 million contracts, over 400,000 open interest. And, at the same time, we continue to grow the open interest of our entire treasury platform. In fact, since we launched the Ultra 10, the total open interest in our treasury, futures and options has increased by 2.73 million contracts. So we work very closely with the marketplace.","In addition to that, we have enormous offsets against our existing futures and options. So, I don't think that another platform can offer the efficiencies. If you look at the Russell 2000, the reason the Russell 2000 is back at CME Group is because of the massive offsets that we offer against both the NASDAQ and the S&P futures. The Russell launch going very well so far. Actually, last week. In third week in, we're already trading 12% of our competitor's volumes. So we're very pleased with the results there.","So, again, kind of in summary, I would assume that other platforms would offer the rate; however, we have the most efficient home in terms of the offsets against our existing products. And I'm talking there about the capital and the margins. Without question, I would expect we will have very high offsets, in particular, against our Fed Funds futures. It's an overnight index will be the index that's chosen again. It's an overnight broad treasury repo index. Very closely correlated with our Fed Fund futures.","If you look at our Fed Fund futures at CME Group, they're up 71% this year in terms of the average daily volume. We had a record volume day recently of over 900,000 contracts. Putting that in perspective, that 900,000 contract day, that's a $5 million contract. We did over $4 trillion in Fed Funds futures on that day. The Fed Funds futures very highly correlated with the new index. So, we expect to be the natural home. We do expect competition. Competition is good, but we will be extremely closely engaged with our customers and we're quite sure that we'll have the right product.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just on pricing, how does that look? New products price premium or price discount?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","In terms of the pricing, I'm not going to comment on the pricing yet. I'm going to be designing the product, closely engaged with the marketplace and making sure that CME Group has the single most efficient, lowest total cost offering available anywhere in the market.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, good morning. Just a quick follow-up.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Alex.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Just a quick follow-up around the Fed window. I think last quarter you guys gave us balances, and wanted to circle back on that. I think it was $34.5 billion, which was sitting with the Fed in customer balances last quarter. Possible to get an update on what it was averaging kind of over the course of 2Q, and if there's anything sort of left to move over into the window or from here, this is going to be largely a function of the effective Fed Funds rate?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure, I'll give you the two points, and I'll turn it over to Sunil on what he's seeing in terms of kind of the averages. But, at the end of the first quarter, the total amount at the Fed was $34.7 billion. The end of the second quarter, it was $38.6 billion. Broken into three components in the second quarter, roughly $5 billion in OTC, about $4.6 billion in house, and $29.1 billion in customer funds were at the Fed. Sunil?","Sunil Cutinho - CME Group, Inc.","In terms of average for the quarter, I think the amounts were around $35.8 billion. What John referred to as end of the quarter. As far as the forward looking, we don't see broad fluctuations, but it is all the decision of the customers and it is driven by their activity and other alternatives they have at their disposal for cash.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, if you take a look through the month of July, it's been roughly between $37 billion and $38 billion. As Sunil indicated, it's a function of trading activity and how much margin needs to be put up at the clearinghouse. It's also a function of where they can get better returns, and right now the Fed is offering the best returns for our customers.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yep. Great. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, folks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Could you maybe comment on your views on what some of the impact from some of the FASB hedging rule changes might be? If you can talk about early conversations with your customers and the potential and sort of timing of the increased MBS hedging. And also, you know, the ability to hedge commodities more precisely. What kind of impact do you think that could have on your volumes, maybe as early as the back half of this year? And then moving into 2018, do you think that could actually have a bigger impact than the Fed balance sheet wind-down overall in your complex over the next couple of years?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Brian. I'll comment on the hedging and turn it over to some of the guys here who can comment on the customer impacts. But, basically, the current hedge accounting rules, it's just fairly technical, but the current hedge accounting rules are very prescriptive and onerous. So, the new rules aimed to reduce that complexity and allow for more hedging and risk management strategies to qualify for hedge accounting. So, this flexibility should potentially make our products more attractive for those that want to use hedge accounting. So, we would expect that the rules would go into effect going into 2019 and the rules, from what we understand will be coming out in the back half of this year.","Derek want to comment on kind of on the customer impact on the commodities in particular?","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think there's an opportunity here potentially to work with our dealer partners in terms of allowing the use of standardized futures and options to be included in the packages of the bespoke hedges that were typically only part of OTC solutions for very, very bespoke reasons. As John referenced, the hedge effectiveness test under the FASB rules disallowed a lot of hedges that were standardized because of the basis risk. So it does give us an opportunity to partner with our dealer customers and enable them to use our products to actually service their customer needs.","As you remember, there was a shift in the banking model from principal to agency. So dealers are actually increasingly facilitating access to futures and options markets of products that we offer. So, being able to partner with our banks and marketing to their customers, CME Group products and solutions, given the benchmark liquidity that we have, is exciting for us as an opportunity. This will take years to play out, but to the extent that it really opens opportunities to probably the big corporate customers out there, we're excited, but it's a longer-term play.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sean, you want to add more?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. In terms of the rates of foreign exchange and equities complex. In particular, I talked about rates. Greenwich Associates published a study now a few years ago, where they looked at the total costs, total cost analysis of implementing risk hedging in CME's interest rate futures. They looked at, in particular, the Eurodollars and Treasuries relative to the OTC swap market, and they found across the board CME's future products are always the lower-cost way to implement any hedging strategies.","So, that's allowed us to do an enormous amount of futurization, in particular, relative to the requirements to clear. If you look, just as a reminder, in 2012 CME's treasury futures, for example, traded 55%, approximately, of the cash government bond market volumes. Now, today, actually I'm happy to say that we are now at new record levels at almost 85% of the cash government bond market. That's on the back of, again, our futures complex being the best, lowest cost, total cost alternative relative to the OTC marketplace.","So a lot of folks, as Derek mentioned, corporates, in particular, who have been constrained by these accounting rules and have been forced, in some sense, to use the OTC market will now be able to use our entire interest rates complex much more easily for their hedging purposes. So, we do expect a continued increase and we will be working closely with participants in order to facilitate that.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just on the timing of that, I know you can adopt it, I think, much earlier than 2019. Are you having, in your conversations with customers and clients or, is there a sense that they'll do that and you will have more immediate benefit from that or is this much more of a longer term than that?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","You know, I think that's uncertain. I'm not going to give any predictions around that, but we're working closely with participants in regards to it.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think -- there is an option to early adopt the requirements ahead of the requirements. I think for us, it is going to take some time for corporates to adopt it, to learn about our products, and as the team said here, they're working very closely with their clients and obviously this will be nonmember activity for us.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. And if you had to frame this versus the Fed balance sheet reduction in terms of magnitude, which would you say is the better opportunity for you?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, I'm not going to compare the two. I mean, both highly uncertain. I mean, in terms of balance sheet issue, as long as you brought it up, right? We know the current Fed balance sheet around $4.5 trillion. And the marketplace believes that starting September likely -- I mean who knows when it's going to happen, but likely September the Fed will begin to reduce the size of its balance sheet. The Fed, as a reminder to folks, has been buying about $600 billion a year worth of securities. They are price insensitive. And once they start to reduce the size of their balance sheet, those securities will have to be bought by price-sensitive participants which use our futures in order to hedge their positions. So we're looking forward to that opportunity. In fact, actually, if you look at that, in the month of July, our treasury options ADV was up 53% year-over-year, we think in reflection of the greater interest in the Fed balance sheet activity.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's great color. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. So, you're showing continued progress in growing volumes from Europe and Asia. Can you just talk about the types of uses driving the growth this quarter?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. This is Bryan. We're particularly pleased to see the growth in liquidity that's happening during the regional hours. As we alluded to earlier, this is definitely drawing more and more participation from the broader segments within those zones. When we talked a bit earlier about the growth in energy in interest rates that we've seen throughout Europe, that growth is being driven by a variety of sectors. We're seeing nice growth from hedge funds, asset managers, in particular, as well as some of our corporate clients. So that's a very good trend from that perspective.","On the Asia Pacific side of things, again, the growth trajectory is being driven largely from our hedge fund community and our asset managers. Another area that we are pleased to see is a pickup in the activity that we're seeing from the banking sector. So I think the efforts that we've undertaken to make sure that that activity is really building up during their regional hours, for example, 33% up in Q2 in Asia, representing -- I mean, in Europe, representing 1.4 million contracts, that's a substantial growth trajectory that is driving that local demand and that interest. Same thing in Asia, we're up 22% representing about 434,000 contracts out of around 650,000 in total.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Vincent.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ben Herbert with Citi.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Could you just provide maybe some more color around the CapEx guide and then what we might look for in 2018 or 2019?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure, this is John. Our CapEx expenditures are on track for same -- about the same amount of spending that we had done in last year, and over the last several years, you've seen our capital expenditures go down for two primary reasons. One is we've reduced the amount of our real estate footprint in terms of buildings and the like. So that's reduced our capital expenditures. Also, we now had sold our data center and our leasing netbacks. So that's reduced our capital expenditures relative to our data center, and it also took us out of those investment cycles that we need to do with fixed real estate. Also, with the ability the lease has given us, it has given us the ability to flex in terms of our real estate footprint.","Then on the technology side, really, we've done a couple of things. The technology team has done a great job in terms of moving more to software-as-a-service, which no longer is a capitalized expenditure, rather it flows through our expenses. And the way we've designed the systems, we're constantly upgrading our systems. And so, as you can see like on large days like Brexit or the U.S. elections, we are able to handle these large days, and it's because our technology team has done a great job in terms of keeping our systems up and providing that kind of capacity and that kind of speed.","So, again, it's the reducing of our fixed real estate footprint, it's utilizing new technology, and it's constantly upgrading our systems. So, we've been in this $90 million to $100 million range over the last couple of years and we would expect -- I would expect to do something similar in the future.","Ben Herbert - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Ben.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, guys.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","On the data revenues, they're coming in right where you guys had said. So, it's not really surprising as it relates to that. But, I guess what is a little surprising is to see them down so much on a year-over-year basis. You guys have good volume growth. You're presumably attracting a lot more customers internationally. Can you guys talk a little bit qualitatively as to what's driving the decline in data? And I know we're a little bit more optimistic for 2018, but just some thoughts around this year. Thanks.","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","So, as I represented earlier, we're really actively engaging in our business intelligence efforts to have a deeper understanding of how that data is being consumed, and we're looking at this a bit differently in the context of data terminals for real-time versus other reasons for how that data is being consumed. As we gather more of that information, I feel that it's going to help us better position our value and our commercial proposition as we continue to grow that business. In essence, the data is being utilized and consumed in a broader array of purposes than what you would traditionally think of as terminals.","Operator","Mr. Harris, does that answer your question, sir?","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","It does, yeah, thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","All right, thanks, Chris.","Operator","And we will take a follow-up question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, yeah, hey. Hello again. Just, I think one topic real quick that we haven't discussed. Since the U.S. election, I think there was a lot of excitement about financial services regulation, may be easing a little bit. I think, Terry, this is primarily for you. I think we've heard some things like the Treasury has put stuff out, obviously, the CFDC has their project . (42:48) The President has an executive order, but obviously nothing tangible yet. So, Terry, I assume you are involved to some degree in some of these discussions. So, anything you can add that we may not be seeing around things like SLR, Volcker that you are focused on and maybe any sort of timing updates.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","You know, I think, like everybody else, the timing is very difficult to predict, especially with the administration right now. As far as the agencies go, they seem very engaged to get things done on the regulatory front. So, when you looked at the Treasury Secretary's comments that he put out just recently, especially on supplemental leverage ratio, we thought that was very beneficial for the clients that use our products to take that away from the supplemental leverage ratio.","The Volcker rule, I've testified on that multiple times, and have spoken to people in the administration recently how that rule was a flawed rule from the beginning, only because it excluded certain products when it never should have. So I think that rule definitely will be revisited. The question is on timing.","But, as I said before, when this President got elected, I think we had deregulation just by no more new regulations coming forward. So that in and of itself was deregulation. Right now, I'm looking at tax policies that the administration is going to push hard for between now and the end of the year. That could be a great benefit for a lot of the corporations, especially since we got our taxes raised here in Illinois. So, that's one of the things that I'm following closely right now. But some of the other rules, especially on Volcker, supplemental leverage ratio, I do think those will also get done.","But, outside of that, it's kind of a jump ball right now. We need to get a full complement of commissioners at the regulator. We're sitting there with two and he's an acting Chairman. Obviously, he's been nominated to be Chairman, but we still need to get him confirmed in that position and hopefully he can work with other agencies that will create benefits for our business. But I think it's pure speculation right now, Alex, about what's going to happen and the timing thereof, just because of the players. So, what I'm focused on, also, is not only the U.S., but watching what's going on throughout Europe to make sure that business doesn't get impacted and I'm very confident that we're doing all the right things there.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Very helpful, thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","And we will take a follow-up question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just on the expenses, if we are in a weaker \u2013 obviously, we're starting the summer off with a weaker volume backdrop, but we would expect that to increase as we get later into the fall. But in the event that we do have a sort of a tepid volume backdrop in the second half, what's the kind of flexibility to say keep expenses flat or certainly reduce that 1% increased guidance? And then maybe just sort of a view on 2018. I know you're going to do your budget later in the year for 2018 expenses, but if you can just sort of give us a flavor on what you view as sort of normalized expense growth for 2018, inclusive of the -- I think you're saving the $10 million plus on the Euro Clearing closure. Thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yes, thank you, Brian. We're constantly looking at our expenses and managing them as efficiently as we possibly can. When you take a look at July, yes, we've had a tougher volatility backdrop, although we've got a good mix in terms of products going into in the month of July. So we feel that that will be positive from a revenue perspective because, obviously, the commodity products are a higher-priced product for us.","In terms of managing our expenses, obviously, license fees is an area where we'll see it come down a little bit due to lower volumes. Also, from a bonus perspective, that would be impacted as well if we have a long protracted low volume scenario. But I think we'll also be focused on a lot of the kind of adjustable expenses or discretionary expenses, as any company would when they are in a challenging environment. So things like travel and marketing and the like. It's a little too early for guidance for 2018. I think kind of a longer run guidance, excluding license fees, would be in kind of the low-single-digit area in terms of expense growth.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then the Euro Clearing helps that \u2013 the closure if that helps that a little bit for 2018, is it correct?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yes. Yeah. The closure of our European operations will be a 2018 primarily impact.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And can I ask another follow-up question or should I get back in the queue?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Go ahead.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Go ahead, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, so, just one more on the LIBOR benchmark change. If you think about the timing of that switch, obviously, you've got hundreds of trillion of dollars that are linked to the LIBOR benchmarks in both securities and loans. It's not expected to be shut down until 2021. How do you see the customer shift happening over sort of -- is it a multi-year development mostly? Or do you think it will be sort of front-end loaded or back-end loaded? And then, I guess, just the difficulty of changing the securities and loans to different benchmarks, if you think that's going to cause any friction.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, this is Sean chiming in. The transition, I think will take a number of years. To be very clear in terms of Andrew Bailey last week at the FCA, the Chairman of the FCA, he indicated that \u2013 that the banks have indicated that they are going to be very happy and willing to submit to the LIBOR process through the end of 2021. So that's at least four-and-a-half years. That also, at that time, the banks may decide to continue to submit. So there is no end date whatsoever. But, we do know that LIBOR will be very healthy and robust for at least four-and-a-half years. And, again, we're working very closely with the marketplace. In particular, we are working very closely with ISDA on potential fallback.","One thing I will also mention, maybe, Eurodollar futures many years ago were actually not determined by LIBOR, but instead, CME Group itself determined its own benchmark rate, that derived or drove the settlements of the Eurodollar futures. So, there are many potential outcomes, but we, again, we believe we're the national home relative to the margin and capital benefits, the ability to have inter-commodity spreads looks extremely efficient, spread trading between all existing LIBOR products and the new indices. And we're engaged with every aspect of the community, again, including the regulators, right through the alternative reference rate committee, ISDA, through the benchmark fallback working group, as well as on the board of directors, and the ICE LIBOR oversight committee. So, we're very close to the situation and we will be launching new products on the new index.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And do you think that might be more -- I mean, maybe it's tough to predict, but more sort of front-end loaded in terms of the transition or more people will wait sort of more like the last minute?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","I'm really not going to predict that. What I know is that we will be very closely working with the community and we will be the best home for everyone, to the extent that folks decide to use the new index.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks Brian.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","And we will take another follow-up question with Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my follow-up. Just another one on the back-half of the year, just as a quick question on the annual variable. I know you previously stated that the closure of the European operations, or the clearing house, would free up, I think, about $150 million in capital, which you will repatriate either at year-end or early 2018. Just wondering now that we are a bit closer, do you think it is going to come back in time to be included in the annual variable that will be paid out early next year, or is that going to be in a future annual variable? Thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","You know, thanks, Kyle. The progress we're making in terms of the closure of our operations, the CME Clearing Europe and CME Europe, is moving along as scheduled. It's a little early to know whether or not the funds will get back in time for the annual variable dividend. Plus, it's a board decision with regard to how much that we will be issuing in terms of the dividend, but it's something we definitely will be taking into consideration as we get closer to the end of the year, and we usually determine that in kind of the November timeframe.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","John W.

Please go ahead, sir.","John Peschier - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today.","I'm going to start with a safe harbor language, then I will turn it over to Terry and John for brief remarks, followed by questions.

These statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance can be found in our filings with the SEC, which are on our website.","Also, on the last page of the earnings release, you will see a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you. And thank you as John said, thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in CME Group.","I hope you got a chance to read through the Q2 earnings commentary document we provided earlier this morning. We had a very strong second quarter. We had record volume quarter in our agricultural product line, and four additional asset classes grew double digits.","Average daily volume was up 12% to more than 18 million contracts per day in Q2, following the record volumes in Q1. We reached a peak trading day of more than 50 million contracts on May 29.","At the end of the first quarter, we announced the transaction with the NEX Group. As you know, the first order of business was the NEX shareholder approval which was completed on May 19 (sic) [May 18] (01:52). We have begun our high-level integration planning process and are working closely with the teams at NEX. We continue to target a closing in the second half of this year.","Global markets trading activity has slowed down during the month of July. July is historically one of the slower months of the year. Total ADV month to date at CME is down roughly 5%, but during this time period three of our product areas have actually grown while the other three are down.","When you add in the uncertainty of geopolitical issues and lower volatility which we are seeing, on top of a traditionally slow month, the 5% down isn't a surprise to me. As we all know, there are always ebbs and flows this time of year.","It is worth noting that our open interest as of this morning is roughly a 123 million contracts, which is up 10% versus this point a year ago, and has built nicely during the month of July. In addition, large open interest holder data across the six product areas remains very strong. And, to me, this is a better measurement.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to John to make a few financial highlights and we'll get into your questions. John?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Terry. Revenue was up 15% this quarter driven by higher transaction fee revenue which was up 14%. We saw a positive product mix pushing the total RPC higher to $0.757 during the quarter. Market data rose 18% primarily driven by the screen fee increase, which went into effect in April. By maintaining our expense discipline, we delivered adjusted operating margins similar to our record first quarter of this year.","On an adjusted basis, total non-operating income increased 37% from $29 million in Q2 last year to $40 million during the second quarter this year, driven primarily by the performance of our joint venture with S&P and the earnings on cash held at the clearing house. However, sequentially, we saw a lower average cash balances held at the clearing house by participants in the second quarter, as customers rotated into treasuries, which offered a higher yield than holding cash. The net amount earned through managing cash was up 18% compared to Q2 of 2017, but was down from Q1.","With strong revenue growth and careful expense management, adjusted net income and EPS both grew over 40% during the quarter.","With that short summary, we'd like to open up the call for your questions and we'll start now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, John, my first question is on market data. You highlighted in the prepared remarks about attrition as a result of the price increase. I guess, can you help us think about what historically that's been and maybe how to think about growth in that line item for the remainder of this year?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Dan. We don't break out the components of our market data revenue. As you can see from our 20% sequential increase in revenues, the majority of the revenue comes from real-time fees and was impacted by our price increase that went in to effect in April. It's early to assess the impacts of attrition, the team has done a good job of telegraphing the increase, bringing the audit function in-house has helped to ensure compliance with our agreement and has helped mitigate those impacts. The team continues to work to soften any impact of the attrition. However, historically, as you can see from the times we've done price increases, that there is some rationalization that occurs.","Turn it over to Bryan to comment on what he's hearing from customers.","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Quite frankly, this was a key period for the introduction of that fee increase, and as John alluded to, the attrition rates are very stable. We didn't see sizeable shift based on what we experienced in the past which is positive news to us. I think what's very important to note is the effects of the audits that we have been conducting, because what we are seeing is increased compliance. We're seeing more subscribers coming into play as a result of those audits, so we're correcting wrong behavior which is a positive. Also, a notable observation is significant increase in subscriber usage in the APAC region which, again, is another positive.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Bernstein.","Christian Bolu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. On international, you've seen really, really good growth out of Europe and Asia. I understand that some of this is pay off of investments you made in distribution, but could you just speak specifically as to what has changed structurally in those regions to drive growth? Are you targeting a new customer segment, is it regulatory driven? I'm just trying to get a little bit more meat behind the what are very good numbers.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Christian, a little bit \u2013 it's Terry \u2013 got a little bit of all of the above. I'm going to let Bryan touch more on it since this is under his, the people that report to him. Bryan?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you. I mean, first of all, as you note, our international average daily volume now is up 14% year on year to 4.4 million of our overall contract volume, it's very positive from our perspective. We've seen a 30% increase in activity in Asia. We're averaging close to 900,000 contracts a day coming out of Asia. We're getting about 3.4 million average from EMEA. Really this has been a story of investment and focused activities from sales and marketing and having the people on the ground as we've represented in the past. You've heard me speak about country-specific planning and being able to target our focus across countries within each of these regions.","And just to highlight, our customer segment year-on-year growth throughout international was led by the asset managers up 42%; commercials were up 35%; banks were up 23%; retail, nice growth, up 23%. Our overall non-member growth was up 60% year on year in international.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","And, Chris, let me just add to what Bryan said. You mentioned regulatory. We don't think that's always a sustainable way to look at a future growth. But I will tell you that when there is regulatory uncertainty, people migrate to where the certainty is at. In the United States, with this Dodd-Frank Act already being passed and implemented many years ago, and people understanding what the rules are, whether they like them or not is a different topic for discussion, but the point is, it's been done. And when you look at some of the European regions, obviously they're not there yet so that regulatory uncertainty does breed less for volume there which brings (09:35).","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","The other point I would want to note is our focus on growing the volume during the regional hours. This is a story that we've been telling all of you for many, many quarters now. During Q2 2018, we saw a 34% increase in our activity, during European trading hours, 45% during Asian trading hours. So if you look, and I know you have those appendices, if you look at the overall volumes that's occurring during their regional hours, a substantial portion of these activities are occurring during your domain hours, it's very important to the growth story.","Christian Bolu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. One quick follow-up question. Terry, you mentioned volumes have slowed in July. I do agree that it's somewhat seasonal. The one that's a little surprising is just the ag volume. It seems even weaker than one would expect. Curious if the tariffs and things like that are having any impact or maybe any color on your end as to why you think volumes are slow, really slow there.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Chris, and I'm going to let Derek go ahead and talk a little bit about the ag complex. He has that up and then I'll give I think a small opinion afterwards. But I'll let Derek go ahead and talk about it.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Christian. It's Derek. We actually had a series of records over the course of this year. In Q2, we had a monthly record, total volume, we had record, open interest record quarter on track, so we're continuing to push those, the directions. What we're also seeing is record large open interest holders in our market. And what's important, tying back the question that Bryan just answered, is our non-U.S. growth story with Trump announcing tariffs that have come on board that has created a significant concern about price risk. That drove a lot of the volume into participation in our contracts. This is very much a risk-on environment, as represented by the record volume and record open interest and large open interest holders.","We're also seeing on the day that we saw record volumes overall in the complex back in June, most importantly we saw record levels of participation from non-U.S. participants. So as regulatory concerns come on board relative to tariffs or not, we're actually seeing people pile in. For example, with the announcement yesterday, Trump-Juncker meeting, that had a very positive impact. We've seen our ag volumes overnight roughly come in at twice the amount. As of 7:00 this morning, we had about 220,000 contracts in our ag contracts.","We typically see a slowdown going into the summer months of Q3. We're coming from record highs in Q1 and Q2, and our ag volumes also set a record over the course of Q2. So we're seeing some seasonal basis of slowdown, but right now, we're, as Terry mentioned before, starting from record levels to open interest, and global participation. So we think we feel good about what the balance of the year is going to bring, and we see immediate positive impact in our volumes based on the questions that have arisen so far.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","And I think just to add...","Christian Bolu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just...","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Just to add to that, Christian, I think that the real story here is not so much on what the volumes are, because as Derek said, we are the benchmark pricing mechanism for the agriculture throughout the world. I think it's just the overall price, that the impact on the regional partners here in the U.S. versus globally, so the difference between Brazilian soybean prices, U.S. soybean prices, that's really where most of the story is being told, but I do think that will be ironed out; hence when you saw what Derek just referenced with the conversations between Europe and the U.S. we're hopeful \u2013 I'm hopeful for the U.S. farmers that it will go the same way with Asia.","Christian Bolu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much for all the color.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","John Peschier - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Christian.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe just \u2013 good morning. Let me just start with a couple of clarifications for John. If you could talk about the net rate that you're earning on those client cash balances held at the clearing house. They were down on an average basis in 3Q so far. Maybe if you could talk about the net rate earned after the June hikes to the 3Q earning rate. And then just a clarification on the market data. I think you guys raised the pricing on April 15 if I'm correct on that. And to what extent audit fees impacted that market data number in 2Q?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. Thank you, Brian. I'll walk you through kind of the Fed accounts and what occurred this quarter; and then I'll hit the market data question. So in terms of the impact on the Fed accounts or the amount that we earn for managing cash, in the first quarter we had average cash balances of about $39.6 billion. That includes funds held at commercial banks as well as funds held at the Fed. In Q2 they went down to about $32.2 billion, so they were down, on average, $7.4 billion versus Q1.","The main driver for the lower cash balances is that the U.S. Treasury has been increasing net issuance of treasury bills, which has pushed yields higher and made the T bills more attractive than the returns that could be held holding cash. So for example, a one month treasury T-bill yields the neighborhood of about 190 basis points. So that reduction in the overall average balances has reduced our take from managing the cash from about $28 million in the first quarter to about $25 million in the second quarter. So that should give you some color as to what occurred there.","In terms of the audit findings, in the second quarter, audit findings were minimal. We had about little less than $2 million in audit findings in the second quarter impacting market data. I think what Bryan said is the most important and that is bringing that audit function in-house has allowed us to ensure that there's compliance with our agreements which is, in turn, gave us more confidence in terms of the numbers that are being reported, which obviously impacts the go-forward amount that we bill associated with market data. So some pretty positive from a go-forward perspective with audits.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And I'm sorry, was it April 15 that you started the price increase? Is that the date on that?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","I think it was April 1.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Oh, it was April 1. Okay. So it is a full quarter. And I'm sorry, then, just the net rate for the third quarter on the client cash balances that you have at the Fed?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","So at the Fed, we \u2013 our \u2013 what we give \u2013 so basically the overall rates of 195 basis points, 164 basis points go to the customers, 31 basis points we retain, and that's solely on the cash that's put up at the Fed for our F&O, for our futures and options. We have a different rate associated with the OTC, what is put up for the OTC, which is basically the Fed effective rate, less 10 basis points, which is about 181 basis points currently going to our customers.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's perfect. And then just maybe on the development of the SOFR contract, it sounds like that's developing quite nicely. Maybe just your opinion of how you see given the potential changes in LIBOR, how you see that developing versus your Eurodollar franchise over the course of the next several months and quarters?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, this is Sean jumping in. So our Eurodollar futures and options have done very, very well this year, right? We continue to see growth in open interest, growth in volumes and a very strong performance there. So we're very excited about that. In terms of SOFR, as you know, we've been one of the industry leaders, now for the last few years. In terms of the new rate, working very closely with the Alternative Reference Rate Committee and the entire industry. And we launched as you know, the SOFR futures back in May and the uptake so far has been good. We've had more than 60 participants. We have more than 21,000 contracts in open interest and we're seeing only about 3,000 contracts a day, but that's normal for a new contract. People are using our functionality in terms of using commodity spreads that we've built between our Fed Funds futures and our SOFR futures but also Eurodollar futures and our SOFR futures.","So we are excited about it. We continue to market. We've had a number of marketing events, actually almost one a week in the last three weeks and they are very well attended. Yesterday, we held a webinar on SOFR in terms of the futures as well as interest rate swap clearing for SOFR and we had more than 400 participants.","In terms of the interest rate swaps, we do plan on launching SOFR-based interest rate swap clearing in September and we're very excited about that as well. So we look forward to it.","The next step for the industry is really to see issuance from corporate issuers, and we did have an announcement from one of the government agencies yesterday that they are going to begin issuing SOFR-based floaters soon. So that should help the marketplace to develop.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just from a substitution perspective, I guess, versus the Eurodollar, do you that as a very futuristic event or do you think there will be some of that in the intermediate term?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So Sean, do we see \u2013 we lost you for a second.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","I apologize, can you repeat?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Did you say it was from the future...","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, just...","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","From the future past, I think is what he asked is will LIBOR still be a part of the Eurodollar complex or will SOFR eventually migrate? Is that correct, Brian?","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. That's right. Yeah.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Well, we expect LIBOR to remain right in terms of our Eurodollar complex for a long time. So as you know, right, the FCA has gotten agreements from the panel banks to continue to post until the end of 2021, right? So we've got a long time for that transition to occur. But we do expect SOFR to grow at an alternative rates to LIBOR. And as issuance begins to develop, there will be more need to hedge, more need to trade and we expect to see much more volume.","So again, we continue to see very good growth in our Eurodollar futures in terms of volumes and open interest, and we are the natural home for the SOFR complex relative to being the lowest cost in terms of transacting with our intercommodity spreads between Eurodollars with the LIBOR-based product that exists in the marketplace, as well as the huge open interest that we have in our industry complex across Fed Funds, Eurodollars, and Treasuries, which allow the marketplace the optimal kind of post trade margin and capital efficiencies. So we are the natural home. We are excited about it. We see the two different rates coexisting for a long time.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voight with KBW.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. If I could ask one follow-up or clarification on the net investment income, I think in your regulatory fee filings after the June hikes, we calculated an incremental cap rate of 5 bps from that 25 bp June hike. Is that correct or was it something lower on a blended basis? And then if nothing else changes, I guess, would you expect continued pressure on those balances near-term? I mean, it just seems like they're ticking lower in the third quarter already.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Hi, Kyle. This is John. In terms of what we passed back to our customers, we kept zero and passed the entire rate increase to our customers. So in the first quarter, and this is at the Fed, it went from 144 basis points to 164 basis points, so that entire increase was passed to our customers.","Sunil Cutinho - CME Group, Inc.","So the Fed did make a change in IOER. The IOER rate increase is not the same as the Fed Funds target. So the Fed increased the IOER by only 20 basis points and we passed all the 20 basis points through to customers.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yes. So in terms of \u2013 Kyle, in terms of current balances, they're roughly in line with last quarter. It's about \u2013 between $30 billion and $31 billion on average in terms of total cash balances here at CME Group through the first weeks of July. In terms of whether or not the cash balances returned to historical levels, really, it's up to the customers, and there are many factors that impact their decisions, including what collateral the customer has, the risks, exposures at the clearing house and the yield on alternative investments all play a factor in terms of whether or not the customers use cash or an alternative. And as we've mentioned previously in many of these calls, there are alternative investment vehicles for the customers to put their funds to work.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thank you for the clarity. And just one follow-up for me. Maybe a question for Derek on the oil markets. A competitor of yours recently announced a crude oil futures contract deliverable in Houston. Just want to hear your thoughts on the dynamics here and whether you've been hearing from customers that there's demand for a Houston-based oil contract? I know you offer some spread contracts today, but love to hear some updated thoughts on strategy. Thanks.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, Kyle. It's a great \u2013 thanks for your question. We're actually excited about Houston as a marker. As you mentioned, we actually already launched a Houston crude oil contract back in Feb of 2016, both an outright contract and a spread contract back to our WTI contract. We're actually very happy with the growth of the contract, that's trading between 3 and 4 million barrels a day and I actually continue to set open interest records, where we've seen about 145 million to 150 million barrels worth of open interest right now, sitting at the Houston point. So we're actually pleased with the performance so far, and we think it's a high complement to the Cushing contract.","The reason we set that up, we actually launched an outright and a spread contract at the same time, letting the market choose what it's wanted to adopt, and what the market has adopted is actually the spread contract back to WTI. So the market is very happy with the deep liquidity and the WTI contract on go-backs, the cash on spread contract back in Houston has provided exactly what the market wants which is a cash equivalent of the barrel delivered to the coast. So we're excited about the opportunity. We think it's actually validation of what we did two years ago and the market's got the best of all worlds which is deep liquid markets and the WTI and go-backs and then the ability to cash all that spread out to Houston with barrels at the water.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point.","Chris Allen - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","Good morning, guys. I just wanted to maybe get an update on how you're thinking about NEX Group and the opportunities there, talking to treasury market participants, the opportunities are clearly centered around margin and clearing and market structure evolution. I know you've kind of made some comments, there was no change to how you are thinking about that moving forward. I wondered if that's evolved at all as you move closer to deal closing.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","On the market structure, Chris, as it relates to BrokerTec, we are not changing that one bit. So that won't change, our thinking hasn't changed, and it won't, so the market structures related to BrokerTec again, it's a very lucrative model and it's a very efficient model and we'll let the participants make a lot of those decisions as we move forward. As it relates to the other benefits of the margin, I'll ask Sunil and Sean to comment.","Sunil Cutinho - CME Group, Inc.","Hi, Chris. This is Sunil. We currently have a cross-margining program with a fixed income clearing curve, and we continue to work with the FICC to actually improve that model. So we believe we can bring a lot more benefits to market participants who trade both cash increase and our interest rate futures products.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. This is Sean jumping in. In terms of the excitement over NEX and it's as high as ever, we're constantly focused on making sure that we've got the most attractive products possible and the most attractive platform possible with the most efficient way of taking risk for market participants. So we're very excited about allowing market participants to more efficiently access both the cash markets and the futures markets across the rates and the foreign exchange world. And in addition to that, we are looking (26:44-26:50) combining these, the cash markets and the futures markets together and seeing, what we can do there to provide new efficiencies for the marketplace.","And in addition to that, as you know, (27:00) and that optimization business is all about the same thing that CME is, so creating new margin capital, total cost efficiencies for clients. (27:11) years for the global client base as uncleared margin rules go from affecting 26 participants today to expected more than 1,000 in a few years' time. So very excited overall in bringing the two firms together, very excited about the integration, and I'd say it is going very well.","Chris Allen - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Did that answer your question, Chris?","Chris Allen - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","Yeah, thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah, hi, guys. Can you hear me?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, Rick.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah, I like the system here. So anyway. I just want to first ask about volumes. Your overall volumes were up 12% year over year, but option volumes were down 2%. So I'm just trying to understand what the dynamics have changed that would cause option volumes to drop off so much on a year-over-year basis?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So let's break it out into the two major sectors with Derek and Sean and then I'll kind of give you a little flavor to that. So Derek, why don't you start?","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, Rich, appreciate the question. Overall, year-to-date volumes were up 14%, so little bit outpacing what the year-to-date overall franchise is up 12-ish-percent, 11%, 12% overall. We're actually seeing continued really strong growth in the electronification efforts. You've heard us talk about the investments we're making in our front end, relative to being able to capture more complex spread trading directly on go-backs, I'm happy to say that we've got our electronic percentage up at 64% year-to-date. There's somebody on the line?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're getting feedback through the line from the other operator. Go ahead.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Okay. So our electronic options traded about 64% of our total year-to-date so this year, that's up from 59% last year. The biggest gains there are with interest rates going from 45% to 51%, energy and metals each going up 5% as well. So we're continuing to make investments, to make it easier for customers to trade complex spread options on the box electronically.","We are seeing that energy options is the one place where we're seeing a downdraft five of six asset classes are up, energy options right now we're seeing record low \u2013 back at record low volatility levels in nat gas options so we're seeing a full back there, strong healthy growth across the board in the other five asset classes. It's been a return to lower levels of volatility in three of our asset classes and we're starting to see some seasonal dip back down in Q2 in some of the volatility levels.","So with that, we're seeing good strong growth across most of the franchise, nat gas option is the one outlier, WTI options are flattish with nat gas down a bit. So I can hand over it to Sean on some of the details on the financial side.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yes, on the financial side, I'll break it up in to two pieces. I'll talk about the Eurodollar options and then the long-dated or the Treasury options. In terms of the Eurodollar options, as you know over the last four or five years, we've seen enormous growth so the comps relative to last year are very, very difficult. If you look at our Eurodollar options complex is doing more than 1.5 million contracts a day. So with the massive growth that we've seen, it's a little bit tougher to grow as fast as we have been. But still, the Eurodollar options is up about 3.8% year-over-year. On the other hand, our Treasury options doing much, much better at up 27% year-over-year and basically in line or slightly ahead of our futures complex. So I think on the Eurodollar options side, specifically a tough comp.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","And I think what we're most excited about is kind of on the theme of electronification and globalizing our business is our \u2013 non-U.S. options growth year-to-date is up 19%. We're seeing outpaced volumes, Europe was up 19%, Asia and U.S. were up 13%. That's the reflection of the growth investment we're making in our infrastructure and the ability to put complex spreads on the boxes, allowing us to capture net new clients trading electronically in their time zones. So we're excited about the growth and the trajectory of the options business overall and, again, the theme here is we are globalizing the business and increasing participation from outside the U.S.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","One last thing I might add is I should have mentioned it earlier, we are innovating, we continue to innovate. So we did launch a fifth quarterly Mid-Curve option on our Eurodollars earlier this year. We also recently launched new Term Mid-Curve options, so that allows you to take very short-term, one, two, three-month options on our whites or front four contracts. So those even though they were recently launched, we've traded well over 400,000 contracts. So we continue to innovate. We continue to see growth. But tougher comps.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So Rich, I hope that answers your question, but I think you got a good flavor. So a little bit tougher comps on the financial side and a little bit of cyclical and just ebbs and flows as it relates to the gas side of the business. So all in all, a healthy, healthy complex.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. And I guess another question is, this question on attrition and market data going forward, I guess we've had four months of the price increase here now, so could you tell us what the attrition is now, like, to get a feel for what it potentially \u2013 and why do you feel it will pick up after four months of the price increase?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Go ahead, Bryan.","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Rich, we do track this very closely and I can just say that our subscriber counts have maintained a very stable level over these last several months since the price increase took effect. What I think is more interesting and more indicative is we've seen a deceleration actually in the banking sector which was an area where we were seeing a lot of attrition in past years. I think a lot of that is tied to the audit function, again, that we've been performing. As we're in the field and we're building up those relationships, we're seeing a correction in behavior in the reporting of the screen counts. So we're going to look at this obviously very closely. And in terms of audits as well, that's a lumpy area, as I mentioned. What we're most interested in is making sure that we have correct behavior. And that's reflecting itself in these numbers.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. I got it. I guess last thing is, Terry, a prominent publicly traded company out there has talked about just exploring strategic alternatives for its post trade services business. This service, basically wraps trades and then they legally wrap it and then they report the trades to exchanges, clearing houses; I'm sure you're well aware of this service. I guess the question is how interested are you in these type post trade services?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Rich, from our standpoint right now, as I said earlier, the announcement of NEX, the shareholder vote of NEX being completed, the integration process on the way, waiting for the authorities to go ahead and approve both in the U.S. and in Europe, in the UK. Until we get that done, our focus is on NEX and nothing else right now, and that's the way our strategy is. So I really don't want to comment on anything further, because for that we have to look at the post trade services as we start to integrate the NEX business, but we can't do that until we close, so that's the only answer I could possibly give on that.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Hey, guys. So the growth in Asia has obviously been very good, yet we've seen the stock market in China correct. Economic growth in that part of the world seems to be slowing but obviously still quite good. My question is I guess, is there a risk to those volumes, do you think, if the economic situation in China gets worse or do you feel like the volumes you're getting from over there are going to be pretty sticky?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","This is Bryan. I'll start. We really do feel that the volumes that we've been able to generate are going to continue to perform as well as they've been these last few quarters, and it's really attributable to the outreach and the targeted planning across each of these countries.","China does represent a significant portion of our Asia-Pacific revenue, but I think it's important as well to keep in mind that we target our efforts across a multitude of countries. We're able to look at, for example, the top 10 countries within Asia-Pacific. We have plans in which we do outreach across the product sectors and the client sectors and those numbers are continuing to bear fruit.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","I think if you're jumping on the product-specific side, what we're actually seeing is where we have structural changes that provide unique opportunities for us to service a client base that is now open to us with structural changes like the energy market, WTI is now a waterborne global benchmark. So when you look at the growth in our business in just volumes alone, our Asian business is up 43%, and a large piece of that is the energy business that we're pushing out in terms of WTI utilization. So part of this is yes, tied to economic cycles, but we're paid to make sure that we can build franchises and portfolios that are going to thrive, regardless of the shape of the yield curve, volatility curve or industrial cycles.","What we are seeing is when products become more relevant to global participants we're in the best position to make sure that we're addressing that opportunity and that growth. And so we're happy about the product selection and to Bryan's point, we've put a lot of effort into training, education, and the ability to access our markets through intermediaries, and that's showing through in some of the strong growth, 43% revenue growth in our energy's franchise in China, for example. So we think the product set and client mix are coming together and we think that that's a \u2013 a structural shift is positive for us in the long-term.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","And it's really difficult to say, as Derek just outlined about any particular part of any one's economic growth around the world, but I will tell you and they touched on this, but I don't think to enough extent, is the sales effort that we're putting into place globally.","Historically, CME has never been much of a sales organization. We have bolstered the sales organization. We've got new initiatives globally to get new clients that we believe are completely on untapped that have never used our markets, that will be able to use our markets so we're excited by that. The infrastructure that we're putting in different parts of Asia such as market regulation, are the things to make sure people really understand our markets. So we're sending people over there to again educate and make sure people understand what the U.S. marketplace is all about and we're finding quite an excitement, and I do believe that the client base is really untapped over there. So even though there could be economic downturns, I think we have an opportunity to go after additional subset of clients throughout the Asia community.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Sameer Murukutla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Sameer Murukutla on for Michael. Just a quick question on the expense guidance and the second half expenses. Usually you would expect expenses to grow faster in the back half of the year, but given the unchanged guidance, it kind of seems like the second half would only grow around 2% to 3% year over year. So I just wanted to get details on maybe what expenses you might have put forward into the first half. I think you guys called out compensation and bonuses. And maybe what other segments you might hold expenses back there. Thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Sameer. Thanks for the question. Yeah, let's put this into a perspective here for the first half of the year. So compensation, as you indicated, is our largest growth in terms of expenses. It's up about $28 million first half of this year versus first half of last year. 60% of the increase in the compensation line is incentive comp, so that is bonus and stock-based compensation. The balance is \u2013 in base compensation is primarily driven by cost of living increases and we did have some increase in head count.","So if you exclude incentive-based compensation, our total adjusted expenses grew only 1.5% for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis adjusted expenses were flat with last year if you exclude incentive-based compensation.","So looking into the second half of the year, so rolling it forward, I would expect the pattern of our spend to remain similar with the fourth quarter heavier than the first quarter, but I would expect the fourth quarter to be less than 3%, 3% growth, compared to last year. And so what you're seeing is for the first half of the year we've been able to offset our incentive compensation growth through really, I think, great expense management across the entire organization. And rolling into the second half of the year, I would expect professional services and other expenses and marketing to be lower which will still allow us to achieve our targeted expense guidance of up 3%.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Is there any other questions?","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the conference over to company management for closing remarks.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Well, we want to thank all of you for the opportunity to address your questions today and your interest in CME Group.

Gill and John will spend a few minutes discussing the results and then we will open up the call for your questions. Terry, Bryan, Derek, and Sean are on the call as well and will participate in the Q&A session.","Before they begin, I will read the Safe Harbor language.

It was another solid quarter for us, average daily volume in Q2 rose by 13%, the same close rate as our record first quarter. We had double-digit growth again from each of our bankside client groups, including asset managers, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, corporate and retail. Despite the recent slowdown in volatility post-Brexit as measured by the VIX, we are trading up 10% compared to last year.","We were pleased to set an open interest record in the second quarter of over 115 million contracts, and we are near peak in our large open interest holding data in several product areas. ","This morning, I will start with our secular drivers and then I will shift to a few product highlights. We have consistently expanded our global participation in spite of the challenging macro environment. We saw robust electronic trading activity outside the U.S., with Asia up-trending 1% versus Q2 last year. Latin America rose 16% and Europe rose 12%. Following the Brexit announcement, we had significant activity from outside the U.S., with 5.3 million contracts traded in Europe, and 1.9 million contracts traded from Asia the day after.","In Q2, the electronic volume from outside of the U.S. was 24%. In July, that had jumped to 27%, and the day after Brexit 29% of the activity was outside of the U.S. In Europe, volumes in five of our product areas grew by more than 20%, with the strongest growth in energy and equities, and the year-to-date ABV up 38% and 35%, respectively.","In Asia, Q2 ABV and energy rose by more than 140% and metals volumes jumped more than 80%. Latin America growth was also led by energy. In addition to the country of origin information that we share with you, we also track electronic volume for our 24-hour trading day. In Q2, volume during the Asian rounds grew by almost 40%, from 260,000 contracts per day last year to 360,000 this quarter. During European rounds, from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM Central Time, volume grew from 750,000 per day to 1.1 million per day, up almost 45%. ","Turing to our efforts in options, we remain the leader relative to other global exchanges, with Q2 options rising 15% and electronic options average daily volume rising 23%, to 1.7 million contracts. In Q2, the percentage of options that traded on Globex reached an all-time high, of 57%, up from 51% in Q1. We saw the highest electronic percentage to date in interest rates, energy, and metals. Electronic options reached a record quarterly AVB of 345,000, up 26% from the prior year. Lastly, in June, we are at the highest month ever in total VP options products, with 495,000 contracts per day, up 57%.","Moving on to our commodities portfolio, we had a very aggressive quarter, with energy, eggs and metals each up more than 20% in revenue. We also set new records for large open interest holders in metals and eggs, reaffirming that global customers continue to manage their commodities market risk exposures at CME Group. We track substitute products very closely, and we have out-performed peers in crude futures, crude options, natural gas futures, natural gas options, gold and copper so far in 2016. Energy was particularly strong, with Q2 average yearly volume of 2.3 million contracts, and July has continued to be robust, with volumes up 20%.","In Q2, crude was up 38%, natural gas rose 17%, and refined products increased 18%. The European and Asian activity in energy mentioned earlier highlights our extremely focused attention on our customers globally and the growing relevance of our product set. Growth in energy options has been meaningful, WPI options volume rose more than 20% to more than 180,000 contracts per day, while natural gas options were up almost 20% as well. Within energy options, we have grown from 49% electronic in Q1 to 53% in Q2, and after 57% so far this month, energy ABV in the second quarter was the second highest quarter ever, behind the record first quarter this year.","Our metals business during the quarter was phenomenal. Volume was up 41% and transactional revenues rose 35%. Our precious metals average daily volume was up 43% while copper rose 33% versus a year ago. Options activity was strong, up 32% compared to last year. Metals had the second best quarter ever, and we have outperformed substitute products at other exchanges by a significant amount. We were also able to achieve multiple all-time open interest records in copper, as well as set the all-time record for large open interest orders in both gold and silver in July.","Last but not least, our agricultural business had its highest volume quarter in our history. Ag options rose 26% and futures were 22%. Soybeans led the way, up 49%, while corn soybean meal, and hard-grain winter wheat, each grew more than 20%. It is worth nothing that there are increasing expectations of the likelihood of La Ni\u00f1a. We would expect that to impact both agricultural volumes as well as benefiting our natural gas markets.","Turning to financial products and starting with interest rates, average daily volume in Q2 was up 3% and year-to-date, we are up 7%. Within Europe, our options volume increased 28% during the second quarter. Recently, we have had progress developing liquidity and trading on the screen, with electronic percentage increasing from 23% to 25% from Q1 to Q2. Also, the electronic volume during the U.S. hours when the pits are open continues to increase significantly. Tech front futures continue to be robust as we have seen that expectations move around -- during and after the Brexit vote. Tech front futures averaged more than 142,000 contracts per day in Q2, up almost 140%. In addition, we spoke about the successful launch of the Ultra ten-year product last quarter, and volume has jumped from 35,000 contracts per day to over 60,000, and July is tracking at that same level. We've launched Swaptions clearing in the second quarter, with five approved clearing members now cleared dealer to dealer and cut from the trades.","In addition to Swaptions, our recently launched Brazilian real clearing offering began clearing in June and we are now at 24 participants who have cleared their product thus far. We continue to out-perform other related markets, indicating the proportion of activity shifting to our interest rate futures and options. For example, while we are up 7% year-to-date in interest rate volumes global dealer to client swap of clearing volumes were down 10% in the dollar fixed to floating market. We continue to capture market share in treasuries, which we talked about before, as cash treasuries are down 5%, while our treasury futures are flat. Our open interest rates continues to hit record elevated levels, with up to 50 million contracts in March and June, while rate-related open interest at most of the exchanges peaked several years ago.","Turning to equities, AVB was up 25% in Q2 to almost three million contracts. And as I mentioned, we are seeing great participation from clients around the world. We had solid activity in equity options, which drew 24% during the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the record of more than 440,000 equity options that traded post-Brexit before the U.S. market even opened. In addition, last week we announced the launch of S&P 500 total return index futures and the S&P 500 carry-adjusted total return index futures. These innovative products are intended to mimic the economics of total returns swap in futures form, allowing swap dealers and their clients to avoid higher costs as a result of new swap margin rules that are expected on September 1. This is another example of CME Group's ongoing commitment to meet the changing needs of our clients in an evolving global marketplace. The S&P 500 total return index futures will be available to trade by BTIC which is dated trade index opposing, and will further expand the U.S. major index BTIC offering, which traded a record $32 billion in Valley [ph] during Q2.","Lastly, our FX business was down 7% in Q2, as the trading environment was challenging due to Brexit. So far this year, we have outperformed the two largest FX platforms in terms of trading activity versus last year. Our FX markets performed very well during the post-Brexit day, but the markets were active and we had record British-spun activity, with more than 500,000 contracts traded that day. ","Speaking of Brexit, we were very busy after the results came in, particularly before the U.S. hours. We had a record 350 million messages to process and as the slide in our previous presentation shows, we handled it without any issues. This is a tribute to our hard working colleagues, who were ready to handle strong activity when volatility spiked. We have had a tremendous opportunity during the last few months to deeply engage with our global clients as market rules continue to evolve, with uncertainty post-Brexit, and also the upcoming implementation of margin for uncleared swaps. We have been talking to folks about the great regulatory uncertainty and the U.S. regulations and, based on the results of this quarter, it is clear customers on every continent are comfortable with the U.S. regime. This was further solidified by the recognition and permanent QCCP status in Europe that we received in June.","The next potential catalyst for increased exchange trading and swaps clearing is in about five weeks, when the first phase begins to the market requiring daily initial margin and variation margin to the exchange of the bilateral non-centrally cleared portfolios in the U.S. There will be a 10-week margin of risk that will be put in place for uncleared swaps and there will be less netting available, compared to the five-day period for cleared swaps and generally one to two days for futures and options.","Based on many client discussions, we are accelerating internal product development to try to create a solution that can provide relief for participants, including intermediaries and end clients. I mentioned the S&P 500 total return index futures launch prior to September 1. Within our interest rate of FX areas, we are examining multiple new product ideas and looking at product construction. Within FX opportunities we are working on include clearing for OTC FX options and nondeliverable forwards. In addition, within rates, we believe this could be a catalyst for our Swaptions business and we're getting inbound calls from customers about ideas.","Lastly, I mentioned Repo clearing last quarter and we continue to make significant progress on the operational side in terms of technology and clearing and we're working closely with large banks, asset managers and hedge funds. In addition, we are planning to be operationally prepared to launch very soon after regulatory approval.","In summary, we continue to expand our global footprint and product offerings to create opportunities for our clients and our shareholders. We have worked hard to position the Company for success in a world that needs transparent, clear solutions for risk management now more than ever. ","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to John to discuss the financials. Thank you.","John Pietrowicz","Thank you, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Our team has been intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible, and returning excess capital to our shareholders in a consistent manner.","As Gill mentioned, we had another excellent quarter. Total revenue was up 11% compared to a very strong quarter in Q2 last year, with four of our six product areas delivering more than 20% revenue growth. Our adjusted expenses, excluding license fees, were flat with the second quarter of last year so almost all of the incremental revenue drop to the operating income line. Our adjusted operating margin extended by 3 percentage points from a year ago, and adjusted EPS was up more than 15% for the second quarter in a row. ","This quarter we removed amortization from our adjusted results, and we provided a summary of the impact on prior quarters, both in our earnings, presentation deck, as well as in the income statement print file we post on our website. This change puts the reporting of our adjusted results in line with our U.S. exchange peers. ","Our rate per contract for the second quarter was $0.782, up from $0.756 in Q1, due primarily to a positive shift in product mix, which was slightly offset by the member\/non-member mix.","Market data revenue was $103 million, up slightly from the prior quarter.","Moving to expenses, excluding license fees and adjustments, our total expense was $270 million, exactly where we were in Q2 2015, which I am pleased to report, along with a solid topline growth. For the first half of the year, on this basis, we were at $534 million, up about one-half of one percent. For the second half, I would expect expenses to be about $548 million. The increase from the first half is based on our heavier spend on customer-related activity in Q4 and the acceleration of product development, which Gill alluded to. We will be lower than our initial guidance at the beginning of the year, which included amortization and excluded license fees by $4 million. Instead of being up 1%, we are guiding to a half percent increase on that basis.","We are ending the quarter with approximately 2,640 employees, up 40 from last quarter, driven primarily by entry level hires and hires in lower-cost locations. Our compensation ratio for Q2 came in at 14.5%, and is down from 17% in Q2 of last year. Looking at the non-operating income and expense line; our ownership in the S&P-Dow Jones joint venture drove more than $27 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries, up slightly from Q1.","Turning to investment income, we received $2.6 million in dividends from BVMF [ph]. In addition, our investment returns rated through reinvestment of cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions during Q2 decreased sequentially, to $5.2 million, from $7 million in Q1. This is a result of lower average daily investment balances from the prior quarter and our net return during Q2 was 9 basis points. While we have been approved to establish an account with the Fed for house cash, it is not live yet and we continue to work through the operational details. ","Turning to taxes. For the quarter, we ended at an adjusted 36.5%, which is where we guided. And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.34 billion in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities. ","During the second quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $20 million, as we continue to leverage more software and infrastructure as a service, which is included in expense. We originally guided to $115 million to $120 million for the year. I'm going to reduce that by $15 million, to $100 million to $105 million based on efficiency efforts and timing.","One final item I want to outline today is the new program we have available for equity members. These firms are required to hold shares in CME Group Class A common stock in addition to seats to receive equity membership privileges. Under the terms of the program, participants may substitute the assignment of their required shares by paying us a monthly subscription.","Currently, there are 370 institutions that are required to hold CME Group Class A common shares as part of their equity membership. A typical equity member's required to hold 20,000 shares per exchange in addition to seats. For most of the equity members, the subscription rate will be $7,500 per month per exchange. This will provide choice for the firms and potentially allow them to free up capital to deploy in other ways. Each of the 370 firms will have full discretion on whether or not to participate in the program. The timing on their evaluation and decision to participate is expected to lead to an orderly share lease over time and should be easily absorbed by the market.","As it is unclear on the participation level, we will update you next quarter on the uptake. At a 50% participation level, we would generate an estimated $20 million of incremental annual revenue and up to $40 million if all equity members switched to the monthly subscription.","In summary, I'm very pleased with the hard work this quarter across the entire business. Our secular growth drivers continue to deliver results, with or without volatility, our efficiency on expenses has been excellent, and since the first of the year, we have returned $1.4 billion in dividends. ","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question, so we can get to everyone. Please feel free to get back into the queue if you have any further questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning, thank you for taking my question. I'm still very interested in this account for house cash concept. So can you share maybe some of the operational details that you're working through? I can't really tell if they'll be interesting or not, but thinking they may be. And then when would you expect that to go live? This year? Next year? How quickly does that go fully operational?","Kim Taylor","Hi Ken, it's Kim. The operational details are not very interesting, actually. What we're working with the Fed on the setup for the account. I think we would anticipate that we would have the account active before the end of this year, probably in like a two- to three-month time frame. And right now it's available for house accounts only, and so that would be the amount of cash that we would have available to invest in it potentially.","Ken Worthington","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Rich Repetto","Yes, good morning, Gill. Good morning, John. Thanks, Gill, for the -- you know, you did an extensive product volume and even geographic review of how you're doing, how well you're doing. I guess my question is, do you guys target or -- what new products can actually impact your volume or your revenue, in a year's time frame if you assume -- I know this isn't reality, but if you assume a similar environment, what do you try to expect to get from these new products as a company, as an exchange? And then I guess the follow-up would be -- which are the big ones, which products are most impactful for that?","Phupinder Gill","Rich, I'll start and then ask Derek and Shawn to comment if they want to. I think when you talk about product innovation here, you are always facing the uncertainty if it will be successful or not, but what we have started doing, particularly in the last six to seven years, and they've had a comprehensive plan, and part of that plan is talking to clients on a very broad basis. So in previous calls, we've spoken to you about the number of folks that tune into spend seminars that we put on, and that's an indication to us. And one example is the Ultra 10 ten-year bond that we launched and enthusiasm behind the bond and the corresponding volume that we got since launch has been great. And so we've got a pipeline on both the commodities side and the financial side, and our guys are pretty excited about some of the prospects there, so, I'll tell you, though, if Sean could comment on some of those things and then Mr. Sammann can talk about others.","Sean Tully","Sure. In terms of the bottom line -- Gill on that since we were doing 60,000 contracts a day. So you can look at our rates, our PC, which will be available, and see that we're running at currently as several million dollars a year in terms of revenues, in terms of the run rate. If you look at Mexican pesos, so in our interest rate swaps clearing business, we now offer 19 currencies relative to the large competitor offering 17 currencies, so we've got two now unique value propositions in terms of currencies, both the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. In terms of the Mexican peso, we have 1.5 million a month, is our current run rate. So while it is a small-time fee, it's actually having a significant impact on that business. If you look at the Brazilian real, as Gill mentioned on the call, we're hitting critical mass in the month of June.","To put it into perspective, a launch takes time for the new products to gain traction relative to building a critical mass of participants. In the month of June, we had a $5 billion equivalent total volume cleared. In the month of July -- sorry, that was in the month of May: $5 billion in the month of May. In the month of June, we had $35 billion. The Brazilian real, again, is a unique value proposition relative to our large competitor, it's a larger currency than the Mexican peso, so we do expect eventually to make more on the Brazilian real than we are currently making on the Mexican peso.","We've had big success in our equity products that we launched in November of last year. The dividend futures, which we've spoken about, are running about 1,000 a day; the bigger and more exciting thing there relative to future growth is we've got over 50,000 contracts in open interest. In terms of BTIC, we're trading this on the S&P 500; in particular, we're trading over 5,000 contracts a day.","If you look at new products, we hope that they drive to 3% or so of our topline growth. We have other new products that we're launching with Swaption; as I've said, it takes a while to build critical mass; with the Brazilian real, it took us from August of last year until June of this year to start getting at critical mass. We do expect with U.S. dollar Swaptions to hit critical mass hopefully in fourth quarter and begin to see significant growth starting then.","So we see strong growth across each of our product areas with topline of 3% plus. Derek, do you want to jump in?","Derek Sammann","Yes, I think it's -- from a product launch perspective, you know, Rich, we try to look at this in terms of either client need, market structure shift, and what is changing in the environment that provides an opportunity for us to provide a service that is not offered by someone out there. Another thing about product development opportunities is where there are global benchmarks that might be in disrepair or broken benchmarks, the client's not able to manage the risk the way they could. Those are market entry opportunities for us. ","For example, our move into aluminum 18 months ago was a result of customers not being able to access their structural aluminum, get it out of their warehouses. So the growth in market share and revenue generation in our copper business has been largely helped by our entry in the aluminum market. In fact, Miller Coors announced just last month that they're going to be shifting their price benchmark from their North American aluminum procurement to the CME-based product that we launched 18 months ago.","Looking forward, another area of product opportunity in development is where we can add products to our overall portfolio. So as Gill mentioned, we expect record revenue generation in our agricultural products business. We announced last month that we will be launching European wheat contracts this year, and that's filled out what is already a globally utilized contract with a product that addresses any shortcomings in the current product. So great opportunities there getting into our product portfolio services, making it easier from a capital perspective or a corporation operational aspect perspective for our customers to manage all their risks, that's been our focal point for product development.","Rich Repetto","Okay, thanks for that 3% time, Sean. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Allen from Buckingham. Please go ahead.","Chris Allen","Good morning, guys. I'm just kind of curious. I see some great strength in agriculture and metals this quarter, and I think, Gill, you alluded to some of them driven by weather. I was trying to also kind of think about moving forward: where the growth is likely to come from here? Does it come from here, from current levels, and there's been some articles about Chinese retail investors getting involved in metals future trading and agricultural future trading. I just wonder -- is there any sense for what is sustainable moving forward, or what's been cyclical, and what gives you confidence maybe to grow from current levels?","Phupinder Gill","Chris, as you pointed out, there's a regional growth starts story here, particularly outside of the U.S. and on the commodities front, it's been particularly strong coming from Asia, in both the energy and metals front.","John Pietrowicz","Yes, I think we're particularly excited about the numbers we've been sharing with you guys about the commodities still current that we're growing in Asia. If you look at the energy revenues regenerated year-to-date, energy revenues is now representing almost 35% of the total revenues we're generating out of China and greater China as a whole. Our business in greater China being Hong Kong, China and Taiwan is up 227%. The metals, that specifically is our second biggest revenue source in the same region, and that's up 61%. So the opportunities that we've got when we own the -- on the metals side, our ability to position ourselves as a global benchmark in region with the sales efforts Brian and his team have been putting forth in region to make sure that we're attracting a customer base with global liquidity by time zone as well. That's how we see the opportunity continues to build international community.","I'll also add that if you look at the importance of the commercial customers to the commodities complex as a whole, we continue to focus on them being a primary driver of our access, because as you address those end user customer needs, that brings the other market participants across the bank, the others don't want to be where the end user customers are. So whether you look at the revenue growth of the franchise as a whole, the record level of large open interest versus the record level of the open interest as well, layered on top of the China growth, it tells a story of globalizing participation in our markets and globalizing access to those global participant bases on the commercial side.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Just a question on the cash. So if we look at it unsequentially, it seems like -- as much. I know that dividends increase in a year or two. I just wanted to get a sense if there's anything from a timing standpoint, or maybe from the CAPEX standpoint. It just seemed a little bit less than expected.","John Pietrowicz","Sure, Mike. It's not unusual for our cash balance to grow slower in Q2. The primary reason is that we have two tax payments in this quarter, and for this quarter, it was $416 million. And we also have our regular dividend of $202 million that happened this quarter, so it's not unusual for Q2 to be slower on quarter in terms of cash bill. So we have tremendous leverage in our business model and we've been able to return $1.4 billion in dividends year-to-date, so obviously that is a cash impact.","Michael Carrier","Okay, that makes sense. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","All right, thanks. Just anything you can cover about market data in terms of what the prospect is for some more pricing increases in that for 2017 and then other programs -- and then also the program that you talked about, John: is that revenue included -- would that revenue fall into the market data declines?","Brian Durkin","Hi, I'll take the market data; this is Brian. First of all, we've been monitoring closely our subscriber base since we implemented the full fare back in January and we're pleased to see we're not seeing any substitute reductions or consolidations in that regard. With that in mind, we've really been focused on developing new opportunities for revenue. One of the areas that we have increased emphasis on is our development of dry data and it's representing a very nice revenue stream for us. So you can expect to see more activities on that end. While we haven't announced any time of price increase in 2017, we will be expecting an increase that will impact certain segments and offerings associated with our market data.","John Pietrowicz","So Brian, in terms of the new subscription plan, the purpose of the program is to provide our members flexibility. So the members either can hold our shares or they can free up those shares and pay us a subscription fee, so this gives our members a choice on how to deploy their capital and ultimately may make it easier for potential new members, especially those international members who may find holding CME shares prohibitive. So it's good for our current members, it's good for our potential new members, and it's good for CME because we will be generating recurring revenue from that payment and it's likely going to show up in our Other revenue line, not necessarily in the Market Data line. And obviously this is all incremental to our bottom line.","Brian Bedell","And the range is $20 million to $40 million, based on your estimate.","John Pietrowicz","Yes, is about a 50% take-up. It's about $20 million, and if all members chose to do this program it would be $40 million. We don't have a clear line of sight in terms of what uptake will be, so we'll be able to update you next quarter, or as it rolls out.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Warren Gardiner of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Warren Gardiner","Great, thanks. Just going back to the last question on market data; derived data. I was just curious how interested you guys are, or to what extent you kind of explored adding to that business and, organically, just additional analytics or other clues that some of your peers have? Just maybe broaden and maybe improve your overall value added to that offering?","Brian Durkin","We're certainly open to any opportunities that can augment or enhance the strong and robust business that we have with respect to market data. As I've indicated, there are tools that we have at our disposal right now as we're developing new products internally that we really haven't leveraged to the degree that we believe that we can. Part of that is in the derived data space and developing new products as a result of that. So we're certainly happy to look at any opportunity to map the great robust business that we have today.","John Pietrowicz","Just to add to that, one thing to remember is we do have a data investment in RJV with S&P. So that's an area that is also looking to grow and we're looking at nonorganic opportunities as well. So we're not only participating directly through, as Brian indicated, our data business here, but we'll also be participating with our S&P partners with the joint venture.","Warren Gardiner","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a question on pricing. So it looks like you began charging for brand trading in July for non-market makers. Can you give us more color on why you thought it was the right time to make this move? Whether or not you see any material difference in client trading activity since you made the change? And lastly whether there are any plans to end the incentives for market makers in the future? Thank you.","Brian Durkin","Hi Kyle. I think we've been building our market share in Branson [ph], really building our global participation in Branson. When you build markets you enter where the companies are, already present, you need to answer by providing incentives to make it easier to access and make it not too economically painful. So what we've done over the last probably 24 months or so: we've looked at the traction we've gotten, 10%, 12%, 13%. We now actually wrote out our brand options market as well last quarter. And we're at a point now where we said we think we've got a sustainable participation level across the pie chart as a whole. ","Energy's up 25%, we've always said breadth [ph] is an important part of the story. The market is telling us it wants to trade on UTI. And we look at the differential fortunes between what's happening between what happens on the WTI side of the fence where our business is up about 45% to 48% and now breadth is up about 19%. The market's telling you it wants to trade on the WTI side of the ledger. So we've been successful in the commercial side of participation, and we believe at this point we're happy to be able to start to scale back some of those incentives, that liquidity itself is sufficient to maintain participation in the market. So any time market incentives are in place, they're always by nature temporary. If you have a successful value proposition that will hold, once you remove the incentives. And I think the overall performance of franchise speaks to the success and value we're bringing to the commercial participants.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Rob Rutschow from CLSA. Please go ahead.","Rob Rutschow","Hi, good morning. I believe the other exchanges in the excluded amortization of purchased intangibles argue that they're acquisitive and doing acquisitions as part of their business model. So I'm wondering if the change in the disclosure for you guys is a reflection of the change in your outlook on doing deals, or if it's just a change -- or just a belief that the market's not appropriately accepting the earnings. And if it's the latter, I believe the former CEO said that large deals are very unlikely. I don't believe we've heard Gill say that, so is large scale still very unlikely or are you looking to do some more acquisitions moving forward?","John Pietrowicz","Hi Rob, this is John. Our view on M&A hasn't changed. We will be looking at all potential M&As to create shareholder value and grow in our strategic point of view, so we'll evaluate all opportunities. With regard to why we changed PI amortization, all our other U.S. exchange peers have taken amortization out of their earnings. Bath[ph 39;55] came out last quarter, excluding it, TIVO removed it from their results. We thought it was important to exclude it so the investing community can have an apples-to-apples comparison with the other exchanges.","Rob Rutschow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Bond from RBG Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Andrew Bond","Thanks, good morning. So when we look at your energy business, there is obviously a lot of positive takeaway that is fundamental and innovation on your part. The gross income that you're now seeing in competition from hedge pack and effect will continues to grow with interest rate lower priced. I'm wondering if you can give us your take on the factor as well from what you're hearing from customers, do you believe they're more likely to becoming more significant direct volumes or pricing generally?","Derek Sammann","Hi Andrew, it's Derek. I'll take that. I think if you start to look at the franchise as a whole, energy's business up 25%, we're seeing significant growth uptake on the WTI side. You're also seeing significant growth on the electronics side of our business. So when you're coupling that with the huge growth we're seeing in the core franchise we're seeing large open interest order, record levels, were seeing commercial participation and revenues generation from the commercial participants at record levels. We actually find that our business as a whole is beyond just any singular particular product slice. But when we talk about individual views on natgas itself, our natgas franchise year-to-date is up 12% and revenue is actually down 4% to natgas and we'll go to a pre-natgas launch, we are about 65% of the natgas auctions market natgas is about 35. If you look at the rolling 60-day average, we've actually increased our market share since FX was launched, with 68% isis and 20%, and FX is about 12%. So when you actually look at in our two-man race, we were 65% of the market and in the three-man race, we're 67% of the market; that's a bigger market.","So when you talk to our customer, what's important to them is a full range of products and services inside the asset class. So when you think about it at 76% market share, we have in the natgas futures the growing percentage of market share, which we're getting paid by our customers to deliver, on top of this fact that our overall franchise and TI -- I mean, if you talk about the footprint we're generating in China right now: that's what our customers want access to. They want access to global prices, they want access to a promised rate of global participation from the commercial side and the international footprint side, and we're in a process of electronifying the natgas options business because that's what makes you sticky. I want to remind everybody that when you look at the natgas value prop, they said, we're going to do a terrific rate and we're going to do it on a block basis. But you've heard us build markets for 15 years by electronifying them.","So we take our natgas options from 5% in electronics to 25% electronically over the past 18 months. That's why you're seeing this grow outside the market share in revenue generating products like natgas options, and you'll see us continue to push that, with the overall revenue story as well. So our revenue growth is up 21% in energy as a whole, isis revenue growth is up 14% in energy, and natgas is either flat or negative based on the incentives they're paying out.","Andrew Bond","Thanks, Derek.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take a follow-up question from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Richard Repetto","This is for John. In your CAPEX guidance, I guess $105 million, you've only done $36 million in the first half, so this definitely implies a big ramp in the second half. I just wanted to see where -- what that's targeted at and -- I know there's the treasury refill platform etc., is that a significant component, can we get some more detail on it?","John Pietrowicz","There's just a couple of things to point out as it relates to CAPEX. On a year-over-year basis, CAPEX is down but that's primarily driven by our New York City staff's space buildout after the sale of the ninemax [ph] building. So if you exclude all the real estate, our technology expense for the first quarter is slightly at or higher than the second quarter last year, and about $4 million higher than the first half of last year. So we're continuing to invest in our technology footprint and I think the second half, we are making investments and continue to make investments in our technology platform through guidance we may refer to things like Repo, things like improving our capacity. So if you take a look at our slide -- Slide 8 in our deck, you see that the day after the Brexit vote, we had the highest message traffic in our history and it was -- it did not impact our speed whatsoever. So I think keeping our platform robust and keeping our platform improving with technology and improving its functionality, so that guidance that we'll be investing in in the second half of the year as we continue the trend.","Richard Repetto","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm","Good morning, everyone. I came on late so I apologize if this was answered already, but I wanted to just touch base on Brexit for a minute but, not so much in terms of the risk here, but wondering if you're thinking about any opportunities coming out of it. I guess the way I would think about it is, you currently are the best house in the neighborhood right now with regulatory certainty in the U.S. whereas in Europe, there might be as lot of changes down the line. So is there an opportunity for you to engage with clients, say like listen, we are launching some new products here, you know exactly what you're going to get, for two, three, five, ten years. You could do more business with us or, is that not really the way to focus this?","Phupinder Gill","Alex, there is opportunity. As you know, Europe is a very large part of our French and global basis. Yes they are, and yes we need -- there are opportunities and we are in full engagement mode with our client base regarding deeper participation into our marketplace and some of the opportunities that can market themselves fit very nicely in what we are seeing to be shifts or evolving client demands and client needs. And so one of the things we refer to in the earnings call and my former remarks was the opportunity that lays ahead of us. So Derek, Sean, Brian and their respective staffs are talking very intently to our clients to understand what their needs are. As you point out, the certainty of the U.S. regulation is a very large driver there, too.","Alex Kramm","Excellent. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our speaker for any closing remarks.","Phupinder Gill","Thank you for joining us today. The entire team at CME is focused on driving the topline for the future and operating the business as efficiently as possible. Let me illustrate that for you. When you compare the first half of 2014 to the first half of 2016, we have organically grown the topline by $332 million. At the same time, our expenses, including license fees and amortization, is down $14 million.","So thank you very much for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our program.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jennifer George. You may begin.","Jennifer George","Thank you for joining us. Gill and Jamie will spend a few minutes outlining the highlights of the second quarter, and then we will open up the call for your questions. Terry, Bryan and Bob are on the call as well and will participate in the Q&A.","Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language. Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are historical -- that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gill.","Phupinder S. Gill","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm going to highlight CME Group's second quarter, and then turn it over to Jamie to review our financials.","I'm pleased to announce strong results for the second quarter, highlighted by multiple records across our industry-leading diverse portfolio of products.","Within our core futures, we are seeing a glimpse of how our complex will perform as our economy improves and government intervention recedes. There's a lot of interesting activity happening within our interest rates, OTC and energy complexes, which I'll spend some time discussing this morning, along with a few other areas.","Second quarter average daily volume was 14.3 million contracts, up 16% from the second quarter of last year. In addition to robust activity from U.S. customers, we had strong growth in electronic trading volumes outside of the U.S. Asia volumes were up 28% on our Globex electronic trading platform. European volumes were up 18% compared to second quarter 2012, and our emerging Latin America business rose 40%.","Open interest also jumped 26% year-to-date, up to 88 million contracts, driven by broad-based growth across our product complex, including euro dollar and treasury options, E-mini options, WTI futures, natural gas, gold futures and corn.","Additionally, the second phase of the OTC clearing mandate was completed successfully on June 10, and we are steadily picking up market share versus LCH SwapClear.","Turning to the highlights of our core. Our interest rate complex continues to perform well. Second quarter average daily volume was 6.8 million, up 33% compared to the same period last year. Treasury average daily volume was 3.8 million overall, up 38% compared to last year, with strong growth in options, up 82% versus the same period last year.","We set an all-time treasury futures volume record in May, which exceeded the prior record in February.","Euro dollars futures and options averaged 3 million contracts per day, up 28% versus the second quarter 2012. July volumes there remain strong, relatively speaking, up 28%.","Turning to OTC clearing, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a nice increase in activity following wave 2 of the Dodd-Frank clearing mandate that started on June 10. Category 2 clients have overwhelmingly chosen CME Clearing, and Category 1 hedge funds and international dealers are shifting more of their volume to what they consider to be the most capital efficient clearing solution, which is CME. At this point, over 300 institutions have cleared trades with us. We had 29 new clients in July, who had not previously traded on our platform.","This momentum has led to strong sequential growth in the daily notional amount cleared in interest rate swaps. Second quarter averaged $41 billion per day, tripling activity during the first quarter. Third quarter to date is currently at $62 billion per day. Our dealer-to-customer market share has grown from 5% in Q1 to 23% in July.","In addition, open interest increased by more than 100% during the last 2 months from $2 trillion to over $4 trillion, with over 3,600 client accounts currently holding open positions, while our competitors' open interest grew by 6% during the same period. Since May 31, combined IRF open interest between CME and LCH has increased by $2.5 trillion, and we have accounted for $2 trillion or over 80% of that amount. I believe this indicates we have done very well attracting Phase 2 clients, made up primarily of asset managers, insurance companies and GSEs to our platforms.","We plan to build on this momentum and continue to focus on our entire suite of rate offerings, including core futures and options, the Deliverable Swap Futures, as well as cleared swaps.","On August 26, we are launching 4 additional currencies of IRF, bringing our total to 17. At this point, our global interest rate swap product scope will be completely in line with the competition.","In addition, one of our significant value propositions is portfolio margining. Four clearing members are now live with our solution, and we expect an additional 2 to 3 to be live by the end of this month. We made progress with our Deliverable Swap Futures contract, which increased in average daily volume from 3,100 in Q1 to 5,500 in Q2.","We set a daily record volume of 30,000 contracts traded on June 5. It is still early in the process, but this product stands out as an early success story on the futures side post-Dodd Frank, with near 64,000 contracts of open interest currently in place.","Turning to FX. Second quarter volume grew by 13% to a record of more than 1 million contracts, equating to $127 billion per day of notional. This was driven by a quarterly record in the Japanese yen product, in addition to several other currency pairs. FX options also continued to be strong, up 36% in Q2 versus the same period last year.","It is important to note that we saw particular strength in terms of trading from Asia during the quarter, which grew 48% year-over-year. This continues to speak to the continued FX market share gains we are achieving on a global basis.","Equities have also performed well. Second quarter average daily volume was 3.1 million contracts, up 5% versus second quarter 2012, and June was up 10%.","E-mini options were up 67% in the second quarter versus last year, supported by expanded participation in our weekly and monthly options.","In addition, we had record quarterly volume in our Nikkei 225 yen-based product, and volume tripled in our Nikkei 225 dollar-based compared to the prior year. Lastly, open interest is up 22% year-to-date, which bodes well as potentially more assets flow into equities.","Our metals complex also continues to benefit from recent volatility. This led to a quarterly average daily volume record of 471,000 contracts, up 27%.","Driving this result is strong growth in our gold and copper bond contracts. In addition, open interest has grown 29% year-to-date.","Turning to agriculture commodities. The complex continues to perform well following a year of record volatility, driven by last year's extreme drought-like conditions in the Midwest.","Lastly, I will touch on our energy complex, where a lot has changed since our last call. Overall, energy volumes strengthened during the second quarter, and in July, we were up 11% compared to the same period last year.","Focusing on crude, during 2011 and 2012, we were very consistent in our discussion with our investors and the media about the issues at Cushing and the impact on our TI business and our view that ultimately, the spread between the TI and Brent would tighten as infrastructure changes took root. That has occurred.","Supplementing that, early in the year, we made a concerted effort to intensify our dialogue with important energy-related participants in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. We have had the opportunity to discuss the infrastructure impact and our strategy of offering a full suite of crude products, including TI, Brent and our growing Omani product with many clients. In addition to crude, we engaged in dialogue about natural gas, refined products and the other 5 CME Group product areas.","Terry and I have been spending a lot of time on the road, along with other senior executives, and helping our sales force. Indeed, 2 weeks ago, we were in London, Geneva, Singapore, Shanghai and Tokyo with many important energy participants, including large integrated trading houses and producers.","In terms of performance, we had open interest records in both the TI and the Brent futures contracts during the month of June. Given the heavy focus of energy participants on the current shift in crude oil share, the marketplace has taken notice of our WTI, regaining a leading position in June and July as the spread has shrunk.","Average daily volume in our Brent Futures contracts has growth from 24,000 in Q1 to 37,000 in Q2 to near 54,000 in July. Importantly, we are seeing excellent commercial participation and rising open interest. The main driver of commercial participation in our Brent contract is the fact that these clients are leveraging the capital efficiencies across our full suite of refined products and crude. In particular, with significant capital efficiency in certain crack spread trades.","Finally, our DME product continues to build from a smaller base and has averaged 8,000 contracts per day in July, up from around 6,000 contracts per day in the first half of the year. In other words, we are close to hitting the inflection point.","In summary, there's a lot of work left to be done in the energy sector, and we are committed to help our clients with a wide range of solutions.","One final note on the core derivatives business, we had record total volume and revenue from Asia during the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we saw 28% second quarter volume growth, with average daily volume exceeding 500,000 contracts per day for the first time. Transaction fee revenue jumped 30% to $42 million during the quarter. Interestingly, all 6 product areas grew, with particular strength in FX, Ags and interest rates.","In summary, although we're very pleased with the strong result from the quarter and the momentum we have experienced during the first half of the year, we are not satisfied. We still have plenty of work to do to keep the company well-positioned once we get past the headwinds we have faced over the last few years.","However, what you saw during the quarter is the strength and capability of our core futures complex and ones we do with multiple records across the product portfolio.","Our global growth strategy, which includes launching the exchange in Europe later this year, pending the completion of regulatory review, will further build on our potential, and we are extremely excited about the future of CME Group.","Now I'll turn over the call to Jamie to discuss the financials.","James E. Parisi","Thanks, Gill, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was a excellent quarter in many respects. Volume was up 16% compared to second quarter last year. Sequentially, volume was up 15%, and total revenue was up 14%.","While revenue was up almost $100 million sequentially, expenses were up only $9 million, reflecting an incremental margin of 90%.","Let me start the Q2 discussion with revenue. The rate per contract for the first quarter was $0.748, down from $0.785 last quarter. The largest driver was product mix. While we saw volume increases across all of the product lines, lower average fee products, like our interest rate contracts, saw a 21% volume growth versus 10% for all other products.","The next largest driver of the lower average rate in Q2 was volume discounts, which impacted us in rates and FX, with the volume surge from March to June. And lastly, we continued to aggressively incent growth in our energy products.","Second quarter other revenues was $24 million, which included $5 million of business interruption insurance claims related to the coordinated market closure due to Hurricane Sandy last year.","Moving on, total second quarter operating expenses was $308 million, including a foreign exchange benefit of $1.6 million. Additionally, as a result of volume and revenue growth, we saw sequential increases of $6 million in license fees and $5 million in our Q2 bonus accrual.","Breaking down operating expense in more detail. Compensation and benefits was $129 million, down slightly from the prior quarter. Lower payroll-related benefit costs and vacation accruals followed the normal seasonal pattern, dropping from Q1, and were offset by the higher bonus expense I just mentioned.","Headcount at the end of the quarter was approximately 2,680, up 65 during the quarter, primarily driven by customer-facing hires in products and services and clearing, along with additional technology employees added in Northern Ireland.","Overall, our teams are committed to being as efficient as we can on the cost front, even as macro conditions improve. We saw our operating margin during the quarter improve to more than 62%, up significantly from Q1.","Turning to nonoperating income. As we indicated on the last earnings call, we recorded 2 dividends from BVMF, totaling $15.6 million.","Equity in gains in unconsolidated subsidiaries was $20.2 million, with $21.4 million coming from the S&P Dow Jones joint venture. The uptick was driven by our increase in ownership, as well as the increase in equity volume and completion of the integration of the 2 businesses.","Turning to taxes. The effective tax rate was consistent with Q1 at approximately 38.7%.","On the balance sheet, we had more than $2 billion of cash and marketable securities following 2 tax payments during the quarter. $750 million of this cash will be used today to pay down maturing debt that we had pre-funded late last year. As a result, we expect interest expense to drop approximately $3.4 million per month as we eliminate the double carry.","During the second quarter, capital expenditures, net of leasehold improvement allowances, totaled $36 million, bringing us to $55 million so far this year.","In terms of guidance, we expect 2013 expense to range from $1.25 billion to $1.26 billion. The expansion of the range is being driven by volume performance, which impacts the variable expenses I mentioned earlier.","In terms of specific line items, I expect compensation to be higher in the second-half, driven by new hires, higher professional fees based on growth-oriented projects we are working on and higher other expense due to back-end loaded marketing and customer events.","Turning to CapEx guidance. We are lowering our guidance to $140 million. That's the lower end of the previously provided range.","In summary, we continue to focus on investing for the future. In particular, we have positioned ourselves to fully take advantage of the changing regulatory and competitive landscape, as well as the medium-term favorable cyclical trends. As always, while investing in our future, we also remain intensely focused on generating excess capital and returning it to our shareholders.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. As we did last quarter, given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Please feel free to get back in the queue if you have further questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Yes, Sandler O'Neill. So my question, Gill, is on OTC. If you back into -- and Jamie. If you back into the rate per million cleared, it looks like -- it was -- it looks like it could have even be lower than the first quarter. We were expecting it to jump with Phase 2. Can you give us a little bit of color what's going on there and sort of the rate that you exited the quarter? And then just a little bit more broadly, the whole OTC strategy. Now that you've got the SEF starting to approve and your DSF contracts sort of gaining some momentum as well.","James E. Parisi","Sure, this is Jamie. I'll start. In Q1, the interest rate average rate per million was about $2.75. In the current quarter, it's about $2.38. Remember, we're going through the whole transition as we're going through Phase 1 and Phase 2. The mix of the high turnover volume in that was variable between those quarters. So it's going to take some time for us to get to a steady state to see what that's going to be. And if you look at the July -- July, we're probably -- we've picked up some. Volume in the area of $2.60-ish in July on interest rate swaps. So we're starting some tick back up in that rate.","Phupinder S. Gill","Rich, with respect to the second part of your question, we have been extremely consistent, in that our focus was going to be on the clearing of swaps because it was going to be very beneficial to our client base with respect to margin offset. And to the extent that the client had additional needs, such as the Deliverable Swap Futures, we will roll such products out too. So what we are doing and what we are executing on is extremely consistent with what we have been saying.","James E. Parisi","And sorry, Rich, I meant to say June, not July, for that $2.58.","Operator","And the next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","One of your competitors was recently named the administrator of the LIBOR contract. You've been really active in building index services over the past few years. So I was just hoping you could discuss why a role like that might not make sense for you. And any level of concern that you have that a new administrator of that contract can alter licensing, expenses and exclusivity agreements over time.","Phupinder S. Gill","Sure. Howard, I'll take a crack at that. We did significant due diligence on this when the opportunity first arose. And we made the determination there was not much of an opportunity there to serve as an administrator. The existing license that we have from the BBA, that will continue to be in force, even under the new administrator. The new regulation in the U.K. around LIBOR that was implemented earlier this year, it's clear that all the entities must have open access to the benchmark. So we don't expect the non-exclusive license for either Euribor or LIBOR to change that will provide any kind of advantage to any administrator. So there was no -- there did not seem to be any particular upside for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just want to talk a little bit about energy. You mentioned the aggressive discounting on pricing. And obviously, that's held back the revenue expansion over the prior 2 quarters despite some very solid volume growth. I'm just wondering how to think about that going forward. Any timeframe on when the discounts may fade? The sustainability of Brent volumes without those discounts? Any color on that will be great.","Bryan T. Durkin","Chris, it's Bryan. You need to take a close look at the progress that we've achieved. Recall the representations that we've made over the last couple of earnings reports, which was, our goal has been, all along, to continue to grow the portfolio of energy products that we represent. We've achieved great growth and recovered a majority of percentage of the WTI activity overall. We're seeing very nice trends with the Brent volume, as you've indicated. And then if you take a more holistic look at the other products, particularly heating oil, RBOB, gas\/oil, and the ability to spread amongst those products, we're seeing a nice uptick across each and every one of those products, as well as the open interest. And we're looking to continue growing that involvement. So one of the key things for us has been incorporating greater growth within Brent from the commercial participation side of it, and we're seeing nice involvement there. So the goal here is to continue building up the market share across the quadrants.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I think initially, when we -- the first 2 mandates kind of rolled out, you saw customers more focused on the blocking and tackling, kind of getting operationally ready. And then you mentioned kind of recently, you've seen the Category 1 customers start considering the solutions based on capital requirements. So where are you kind of with the Category 2 folks? Have they started going through that process right now? And what are you guys doing to facilitate some of those discussions?","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. I'll start, and Bryan or Bob might want to add. I think we're actively working with the Category 2 clients, who are coming directly to us from a non-cleared solution that they were currently in. For the Category 1 clients, they are the ones that are moving their open interest from the LCH to us, principally because of the capital efficiencies that they see, and other product development opportunities that they might have down the road. Keep in mind that even though this is an OTC-cleared solution for both LCH and ourselves, LCH simply accepts OTC swaps as they come in to them. CME actively also launches futures products that will add to the capital efficiencies that most of our clients need. That's a very important differentiator as we go down the road between what LCH will provide to their client base versus what CME can provide to the same clients.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMC.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'd like to get more information to help us understand the outlook for the OTC clearing revenue ramp. So with that in mind, what percentage of the market do you think has kind of signed up and is clearing at this point? Maybe what portion of the marketable products have you yet to list? And I don't know if I can ask this, but how do you expect the pricing to ramp over time as the initial incentives, I guess, expire or roll off? So any flavor on any of those would be very helpful.","Phupinder S. Gill","This is Gill. I will start. I think once August 26 comes along, we will have the full suite of products that are out there. There are some products that are -- have traditionally been labeled as not clearable swaptions, is one such product that is out there. We are working very actively with both the banks, as well as the buy-side, to try and solve these issues to see if they indeed can be solved so they can -- we can bring in more capital efficiencies to our client base. In the meantime, in terms of the size of the product that come on in or the amount of product that we have cleared, I think by the time you get to the end of the second quarter of next year, the vast majority of the products would have been cleared. And then the only remaining question at that point is what is the most capital-efficient place for you to pass the open interest that you might have? So you have the euro dollar portfolio that we have here. You have the treasury complex, you have the billable swaps, huge futures that we have. You have all the product development opportunities that lie ahead of us versus the OTC swaps that we are now beginning to actually clear. So you would get a clearer sense of what that universe looks like by the middle of next year, I believe. In terms of pricing and random pricing incentives would actually go away and fade, and we can start to look at this on more of a normalized run rate basis, I think it's fair also to wait until we have the vast majority of all the swaps in to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neve Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","NYMEX, the building sale, you announced that you hired some consultants and then some brokers. Just help me think about it. Is it realist to think if you do net some cash, and there could be significant cash from this, would this be part of -- would it be feasible to think of this maybe making up part of the annual variable dividend next year? Or is -- would the timing be too early for that? And if you could help me quantify how to think about this at all, Jamie, that would be helpful.","James E. Parisi","Sure, Neve. When you think about the NYMEX building, it's probably about half the size of the Board of Trade building. So that's one thing to think about in comparison. Obviously, it's in a market where values are a bit higher. So you can put those sorts of things together as you think about the value it could be. And I think we will hopefully have an answer by the end of this year in terms of whether or not we're going to sell it. And if the decision is to sell it, then I believe it will be done by the end of this year. So it would be in that -- the cash would be available for the variable dividend. The other thing to keep in mind is that it has a very, very low basis on our books from a tax perspective that we inherited from NYMEX, so there would be some taxes -- tax impact on it as well.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the SIPA Building, was that around 150-ish in the mix?","James E. Parisi","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a question on volume tiers and how often you guys are evaluating them. And how should we think about that as volumes potentially rise going forward, we might see the threshold for those discounts go higher.","James E. Parisi","Dan, this is Jamie. If you look back historically, prior to the economic crisis, it was probably roughly every 18 months or so that we would look and evaluate the tiers. But it's driven by market conditions. So going forward, it's something that we'll continue to keep our eye on. If we're -- the tiers are getting to a point where people are meeting them when they wake up in the morning, then we'll look to see whether or not we should be adjusting them. So this is something that we actively keep an eye on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to the whole Brent energy discussion. I think you used a couple of very big words here today, like excellent adoption and nice tick up and stuff like that. So obviously, the market share is really looking good. I just wanted to get a little bit more color on how you're really doing that. And you talked a lot about the commercial. So when I look at the commitment of trader report, I think you have like a handful of players that are showing up as commercial today. So maybe you can give us a little bit more color what the pipeline is and how many you really have. And then same thing when I talk to energy desk, it sounds like lots of fundamental players don't really think about Brent when they -- or think about you when they think about them Brent, so they are not really seeing the volume. So just maybe talk a little bit more of how you're engaging with even like the trading desk on Wall Street and when you think that they could really embrace the product. Because we're not hearing it yet, I guess, is my point.","James E. Parisi","I'll start. One of the things that we're really able to sell as a very strong value proposition, and I tried to allude to it earlier, was the spreading capabilities. And what I didn't focus on is the capital efficiencies and the margin savings associated with those spreads. And so now that we have a fairly strong critical mass in terms of volume and open interest, particularly on the Brent side of things, you're really able to latch into those spreads and be able to bring that value proposition to those end users. And yes, we are absolutely seeing those benefits pay off in the context of utilization and pickup in the spread and the capital efficiencies. And we believe that, that's going to just continue to take on more traction.","Phupinder S. Gill","Alex, this is Gill. If I can add to what Bryan said. I think Bryan also talked about this a short, while ago. The key driver in getting more Brent is that it helps the entire suite that we have. If you look at a classic product launch that is new, I think a reasonable threshold of open interest and volume would be about 30,000 to 40,000. The point that we are making is we have achieved that. We have surpassed that in a very short period of time. The more important piece of this is the products around just the pure Brent, that has also seen a lift, the crack spreads, the TI, Brent trades, those things are actually growing. So we did use those so-called big words because it's a big deal. This has been occurring. It's been lifting the energy complex in a very significant way, and it's only the beginning. One of the questions that has been asked in the past is, when are you going to start charge for Brent? That's not a focus to us in any way, shape or form at this time. Building the entire complex, the energy suite across-the-board, across the 3 benchmarks that I articulated a short while ago, which no other exchange has, that is what we're trying to push for, between Omani, Brent and crude and the derivative products that are created from those, that is going to be the focus of our energy guidance.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sorry, not to have a follow-up. But to my earlier question, do you have an exact number of how many commercials players are involved? Or is it too early to really...","Phupinder S. Gill","The number of commercials we have are actually growing and we will not share that number at this time.","Operator","And the next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to shift gears and talk about the metals business for a second. It seems like there's incremental focus from the regulators on some of the broker dealers, and just kind of curious to hear your thoughts on the potential implications of that on the business for you guys near-term, as well as the longer-term.","Unknown Executive","This is Bob, Alex. We don't think that there's immediate implications relative to a lot of the scrutiny that's going on there. But we are looking very closely at how the ecosystem can shift and what that might mean for us. We don't have any specific comments on what has been in the press today, but we are watching the situation very closely.","Terrence A. Duffy","It's Terry Duffy. Let me just chime in because I think this is an important topic that a lot of people aren't picking up on right now, and that is a lot of the dealer community that are being under a lot of scrutiny as it relates to the physical trading of commodities and metals and things of that nature. What they have said is that they're going to use other derivative products, such as futures and others, to get the exposure to the market versus what they used to use in the cash market. So I actually see this as potentially a net positive for us to continue to offer up deep liquid markets for them to do their risk management needs. So I don't see this affecting us in any way, shape or form.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question is on the swaps business. We're all pretty focused right now on swaps clearing revenues. But I know you guys have historically said in the past that volume migration will probably be the bigger opportunity than clearing alone. So just wondering whether your thesis on that opportunity has changed at all. And I know it's really difficult to tell, given the data, but in your futures volumes, are you seeing kind of any users switch to that complex that would ordinarily be trading in swaps?","Bryan T. Durkin","This is Bryan. As we've indicated in the past, we've had some new users come into the market on the futures side, particularly as you look at the asset management community, the corporate community, who had a portfolio of interest rate swaps that they needed to clear. They have been taking a good look and being active and more active in our futures markets. And something that I would like you to kind of look at is we've seen a real pickup in our DFR transaction. So that's an indicator in terms of, again, giving these users facilities to be able to hedge their interest rate swap exposure by also doing equivalent business in our treasury, which we view has had a nice uplift. When you look at the open interest and the volume over the past quarter, there's definitely a correlation basis when phase 2 kicked in and the activities that we're seeing in our uptake in interest rates and increase in our treasuries, in our euros. So we're looking at that as well as an indicator and obviously using that as a strong selling proposition.","Phupinder S. Gill","It was swaps that have been traded against treasuries.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jamie, just a question on 2 things that you pointed out. Just on the RPC, just curious on the equity side. What's been driving maybe the upward trend over the past couple quarters? We've seen a pickup in volume, but just wanted to see if there was anything going on, on that front. And then just on the expense guidance, the $1.25 billion to $1.26 billion. I think in the past you've said if you were in a weaker environment, sort of what the low end could be, like meaning where you can pull back. Obviously, the volume environment has improved and so we don't need to focus too much on that. But just curious in terms of the expense flexibility that you have, particularly on the comp side, versus like the new initiatives that you see ramping up in the second half.","James E. Parisi","Sure. On the first question, in terms of the equities rate, what you're seeing there was a little bit of upward pressure on rate. It's just a member, non-member mix issue. So you're seeing non-member growth faster than member growth in that category in the last quarter. So that helped push that rate up a bit. So that was the key driver there. On the expense guidance side, it's really -- that change in the guidance putting the range out there, it's very much tied to the variable expenses that are out there, our license fees and our bonuses. Now obviously, if there was a situation where volumes fell off, those things will also decline and would help move us back down to the lower end of that range. And depending on where the volumes were, potentially down through that range. Now saying all that, we've been very diligent around expenses, so there's not a lot of additional room there to continue to pare. We've done everything that we can and we continue to look for areas to become more efficient. But I wouldn't say that there's some large pools of expenses that are out there that we could easily reduce if volumes came in. So as we've said before, we want to be careful not to cut into the muscle because we do believe that there's a lot of growth opportunities in front of us, and we don't want to shortchange those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just following along on that over-the-counter interest rate swap question on to futures. Maybe, Bryan, if you can expand your commentary on what your outlook is for, say, the next 2, 3, 4 quarters in terms of the sales effort to build upon the futures volume and the collateral benefits of futures, whether you think that's an active ramp as we move through that process or that the new clients that came on is sort of static. And then just a quick follow-up on Asia versus Europe in terms of the growth opportunity, the timing of the launch of the European exchange and whether you're sort of more optimistic about growth in Asia that you alluded to, Gill, versus the new launch in Europe.","James E. Parisi","So on the first one, our approach, from a sales perspective, is to be able to offer the totality of product for the client to be able to manage their risk. So as we're in talking to those that are traditionally non-users of the futures markets but they have an interest rate swap portfolio that they need to clear, it's an opportunity and an entr\u00e9e for us to, first of all, take care of the main issue at hand and provide them with those clearing facilities, but also introduce them to the efficiencies and liquidities of our interest rate portfolio from the exchange traded side of it. And we've done a lot to build tools that is very -- that we leave for these clients to really reflect on after we spend our time with them, helping them understand how they can better utilize their capital, capitalize on margin efficiencies. And they can run their portfolios through these varieties of tools so that they can see very tangible evidence on their side to say, \"Yes, this definitely does make sense for us and for our portfolio.\" And then we follow up, and we bring them in. And so I can't give a perspective in terms of what the volume growth will be on the futures side of it, but I can absolutely say that we're seeing greater usage on the futures side, not only from new clients, but from pre-existing clients that, as they're bringing those OTC products in for clearing, we're seeing an uplift in their activity on the futures side.","Phupinder S. Gill","With respect to the question that you had on the growth outside of the U.S., keep in mind, Latin America is also an area of focus for us, although currently, the meaningful income is coming from both Europe and Asia. Europe, as you might know, has been a mainstay revenue base for us, and that has grown particularly in the last 5 to 6 years. That growth, with respect to the current products that are being offered, will continue both on the OTC front as well as on the core futures side. With respect to the new exchanges, we expect to be up and running sometime in the fall. It represents a different opportunity for a client base that would otherwise not trade in the U.S. With respect to Asia, we're talking about new clients that have not come into trading our core products yet. And in particular, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and a couple of other places will drive that growth. A couple of days ago, Nanhua Futures, one of the futures brokers in China, joined us as a full clearing member out of their office in Hong Kong. That is something that we have talked about over the course of the last 18 months with respect to Chinese FCMs looking to join us. Nanhua joins Bank of China International as the first 2 Chinese FCMs that have joined us, with a pipeline of more firms behind them. That is going to be part and parcel of the growth drivers of our products in Asia. A short while ago, I talked about the growth of the Nikkei 225. A lot of that liquidity is not just in the North American time zone, but also in the European and Asian time zone. With the addition of these additional FCMs and their client base, you can expect to see tighter liquidity spreads, both in Asia, as well as Europe. So there's different opportunity sets in Europe, as well as in Asia, both of them targeting the core, and Europe having the additional element of folks looking at the OTC clearing solution that we have, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mikael Vadia [ph] with Rosenblatt Securities.","Unknown Analyst","Just a question on market data and access fees. Is there anything to highlight that might change the trend that we've seen in these 2 lines? They've been declining a little bit over the last few quarters. Just any update on trends there?","James E. Parisi","Yes, we've seen some continued pressure on the terminal count, basically due, as we said before, to tightening of employment on Wall Street and the efficiencies that firms are looking for there, but also tied to incentives that we -- legacy incentives that we've offered over time. So we're taking a look at the full picture going forward to see where and how we can drive more value out of that business.","Unknown Analyst","And that would be market data?","James E. Parisi","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","Do you have any timing on when some of these incentives might roll off?","James E. Parisi","Not at this point.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, anything to note on access and communication fees?","James E. Parisi","Just on the access and communication fee revenue line, it's behaving as we said we believed it would at the end of -- when we gave the guidance at the end of the last -- at the end of Q4. So nothing of note there.","Operator","And next question comes from Gaston Ceron with MorningStar Equity Research.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Jamie, I just wanted to go back to the OTC pricing issue. I don't know if you mentioned this and I missed this, but I think stabilizing -- you look out over the longer term, I mean, are you still looking for that $5 to $6 range that I think you guys mentioned in the December call? Or is the ultimate kind of settled base a little bit more unclear at this point?","James E. Parisi","I'd say it's unclear, because remember the $5 to $6 base was for the customer set -- the pure customer set that aren't the higher turnover folks, the high turnover folks we put that incentive pricing in for. And obviously, the mix is going to be something less than the $5 to $6. And as we said earlier, it's not clear yet when and if we'll take those incentives off. So still an open question. But the $5 or $6, as we moved through the process and learned more, it was really tied much more to a particular customer set versus those high turnovers.","Operator","And next question comes from Ken Leon with S&P Capital IQ.","Kenneth M. Leon - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","The question I have is on regulation. And with a change of the profile, the CFTC at the commissioner level, what do you think are the 1 or 2 burning issues that are going to be in front of us for the next 6 to 9 months?","Terrence A. Duffy","It's Terry Duffy. I'm not quite sure what changes at the commission we're going to see yet. There's been a lot of speculation as to whether the Chairman will maintain his position or not. There's speculation that other commissioners, whether be there or not. We do know that Commissioner Summers is the only one that's announced to date and has left. So that's the only one for sure that we know is going to be changed. So the rest of it is purely speculation on the makeup of what the commissioners is going to look like. I think some of the issues that we're going to look going forward over the next several months are on some of the cross-border issues that we have still yet to be resolved. They were, as you know or may not know, they were punted for 70 to 75 days as of last July 15. And one of the big issues is 1-day margin in the United States versus 2-day margin in Europe. We do twice daily mark-to-market where Europe only does it once a day. So essentially, we do have 2-day margin. I think there's a misdirect on margin and people are using it as a political scapegoat in the regulatory environment, because our margin is based on risk-based according with the product, not just on days. The days is just a minimum. But I do think that, that is one of the issues that will take center stage. The other issue could be the residual interest issue for some of our smaller FCMs, which could be a problem for them. So we're working very closely with the smaller FCMs and the commission to make certain that they don't get into a situation where the cost of doing business with the American agricultural community and others is going to be impacted. So I think those are 2 of the big pressing issues over the next several months.","Kenneth M. Leon - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","And was the cross-broader issue a big part of the conversations in the travels that you guys have -- I imagine you've done overseas?","Terrence A. Duffy","Yes, I just came back, and so did Gill. I was in Europe and Gill was in Asia. One of the pressing things that I heard from all the clients was a concern about access to U.S. markets and to make certain that they would have that ability to do so. I do believe that the participants in both Europe and the United States will have enough pressure on their regulators to make sure that there's a harmonized regulatory environment so everybody can use these global markets to do their risk management. So I do think that cooler heads will prevail and the regulators would come up with a solution that makes sense for everybody. I think, right now, we're still, I hate to say it, but we're in kind of a silly season in Washington right now and people are getting ready to go out, and there's not much going on. So we'll get more clarity as we get into September.","Operator","And our final question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just have one quick follow-up. Just on the volume trends into summer. Obviously, we're getting to the weak seasonal season. But to what extent are you seeing a pare-back in high-frequency trading affecting volumes? I think we're seeing it in some other asset classes as well. Maybe if you can comment on that for CME volumes and to the extent you think the -- sort of the weak July volume trends also continue into August, given seasonality and\/or HFT?","Phupinder S. Gill","Brian, this Gill. Clearly, there are more people that want to talk to you about the house, and I'm going start. The volume drop-off that you are seeing is very typical and not driven by any one client type. It's just a typical drop across-the-board. But keep even that in mind, taking the rates, for example, where many people are focused on. Our July rate volume is actually up 25% versus July last year. And the volume level of 4.9% in this past month is not unusual as you compare it to the early part this year. And even April of this year, there's only a 4.8%. So we're seeing volume levels that I would say are very typical for this time of the year and not at all attributed to any one client class. Bryan or Jamie?","James E. Parisi","Very well said.","Operator","At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back over the speakers.","Phupinder S. Gill","Thanks very much, guys. As I said a short while ago, there's a lot of work left to be done, and we look forward to talking to you guys next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead.","John Peschier","Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I'm going to start with the Safe Harbor language and then I'll turn it over to Terry for a few remarks and then we will open it up for your questions. Other members of our team are here as well and will participate during the Q&A session.","Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest in CME Group.","We made great progress during Q3 broad-based volume growth coupled with expense discipline drove double-digit net adjusted EPS growth. We also have several new initiatives in the works. We know many of you are incredibly busy during the earnings season and also often are juggling multiple calls. We are coming up on our 15th anniversary of becoming a public company and we decided to assess our earnings delivery process.","We decided to create a quarterly highlight document that we made available 90 minutes ago with the press release. This will replace the normal scripted remarks. Hopefully you had a chance to look at it.","One of the notable financial metrics I would like to mention is when comparing year-to-date this year versus 2014, our revenue was up $473 million, our total expenses remained flat, and non-operating income is up $80 million. These results reflect a lot of hard work across the whole company as we focus on acquiring new global customers and being efficient. We intend to continue with this mindset.","With that we would like to open up the call for your questions. Given the number of analysts who cover us, we ask that you start off with one question, so we can get to everyone. If you have another question feel free to jump back into the queue.","Thank you and we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question today is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Thanks, good morning. Terry and John I guess my first question is on M&A. There has been some activity within the industry, seems that remains ongoing, so want to get an update on your kind of outlook for that and your participation if at all. Then also you\u2019ve been exiting kind of non-core businesses, so curious are all investment securities if there is anything else that you're looking or that's continuing kind of a valuation process.","Terrence Duffy","So I'll take the latter part of that question first, Dan, and when you look at what we've done over the last year especially taken down our investment in Europe getting out of the credit market -- credit business and getting out of the investment we had in Brazil just to name a few. I think that we're pretty much just where we need to be right now by taking down those investments. I'm a big believer and they don't work after while you eventually have to call the question and it wasn't where Europe wasn't completely working, it\u2019s just we built the liquidity here in U.S. here and Chicago round the clock which made it much more efficient for the company to run. So that's really the reasons behind that.","And the other investments especially Brazil, I'm a big believer if shareholders want us to invest their money, they can do it themselves, they don't need us to do it for them and as it relates to credit that was just a losing proposition for us and eventually needed to call the question. So those are a couple of the main ones that I think you're referring to and I think that's pretty much where we want to be right now. We're analyzing some smaller incentive plans things of that nature but nothing that would move the radar.","As far as other M&A activity, John, I would like you to comment on.","John Pietrowicz","Sure. Our view on M&A really Dan hasn't changed. We still believe that large scale cross-border exchange M&A is very difficult to get done especially in this current environment. But we do keep our options open as it relates to mergers and acquisitions, if we find something that we think can create shareholder value and advance our strategy, we'll certainly execute on it but we're right now sitting at a really strong position. So we can be -- we can approach things from a position of strength. So that's our view on mergers and acquisitions.","Operator","Moving on, our next question comes from Chris Allen from Rosenblatt.","Chris Allen","Good morning guys. I just wanted to touch quickly on the expense guidance for the full-year and how to think about the sequential movement on -- in terms of 4Q. I know you should expect the big bump up in marketing spend, but when we get some of the other lines professional services, you have done a good job of managing down this year. So I'm just wondering how to think about the sequential growth there. And then moving forward your CapEx has continued to decline every single year for us like three or four years, you brought it down again. How you're able to maintain the continuous decline and how to think about that from the longer-term perspective?","John Pietrowicz","Sure Chris, this is John. Yes, you're correct; when you take a look at kind of the sequential growth in our expenses it's a pattern that be consistent over the years. Our fourth quarter tend to be significantly heavier than our third quarter. We do get a bump up in marketing and other because we got some customer-facing events that occur in the fourth quarter. Also when you take a look at the increase from Q3 to Q4 this year, we do have some catch-up on projects, so we do expect our pro services fees to go up a little higher.","When you look at Q4 of last year versus Q4 of this year, it's really about a $4 million increase. When you look at our average compensation cost over the first three quarters it's up about $6 million a quarter. So our non-compensation related expenses are actually going to go down a little bit, we're anticipating going into Q4.","In terms of our expense guidance this has been an entire CME wide effort and the team has done a fantastic job of really managing our expenses well. As Terry kind of alluded to in his remarks to start, our expense level is below what it was in 2014, with regard to our total expenses excluding license fees. So the team is really has a really strong mindset around managing cost.","When looking at our CapEx on a year-by-year basis, the capital -- our CapEx spend is actually over the last several years has decreased -- I'm sorry has actually been in the range of between $70 million and $85 million. So our capital on tech only in 2015 was about $72 million, in 2016 is about $86 million, the guidance we've given is between $80 million and $85 million. So it's roughly been in that range in 2016.","What\u2019s really important is that we've been the tech team has done a tremendous job in terms of managing and engineering our systems and utilizing new technologies like cloud-based services which has allowed to scale our business and handle significant market events with high availability around the clock, while being very efficient in our spending. We can handle two to three times our current volume levels as needed. And that was really demonstrated when you took a look at the U.S. Elections and Brexit as examples. So we've got a very robust system. The team is leveraging new technologies and is really done a lot great work in terms of engineering our systems.","Operator","Our next question today will come from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto","Good morning guys and thanks for the new process here. So I guess the question -- one of the question is $150 million in capital from Europe, I believe that's the number and I\u2019m not sure whether that's completely freed up and it is, is that earmarked where would you -- is that likely to go to the annual variable dividend at year-end?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks Rich, this is John. We're very pleased with the amount of cash we've been able to build. We've got about $1.63 billion in cash and cash equivalents coming into the fourth quarter. Our typical Q4 build is between $175 million to $250 million excluding one-time items like Brazil and building sales. So we're very pleased with our -- with the way we've been able to generate cash, our expense controls and organic growth are really driving those balances higher.","I think when we take a look at the level of the annual variable dividend that's a board decision. Certainly the point of discussion will be around the capital freed up from our operations out of Europe. So that $150 million will be point of discussion we talk with the board in the fourth quarter about the annual variable dividend.","Rich Repetto","Okay, thank you. I will get back in the queue.","John Pietrowicz","All right. Thank you, Rich.","Terrence Duffy","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","And Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank has our next question.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks. Thanks very much. I also appreciate the new format. You guys talked a little bit about in the presentation on the uncleared margin rules for FX futures and how you're working with swap participants. Can you talk a little bit maybe you about your sort of growth outlook on FX futures? We're seeing a little bit of better volumes certainly on the roll months. But I was just trying to get a sense of whether you think that will create a pretty big step function in FX futures volumes from that activity alone over the next few quarters?","Terrence Duffy","Sean?","Sean Tully","Sure, this is Sean jumping in. We are excited about the FX business and we are working very closely with the marketplace in order to solve the markets problems much in the same way that we did rates market over the last several years. The rates market over the last several years' right we facilitated recurring interest rate swaps and then the movement of a lot of folks from OTC space into future space, as the rules hit market participants and we've shown that futures grow with the best way to lowest-cost way to represent risk.","So working with participants again in the FX market, we're very excited about that, we do offer non-billable forward hearing in the OTC space and we are looking to launch in the near future OTC FX options hearing as well.","In addition to that we recently launched a monthly FX futures, which we're really excited about. The monthly FX futures gives the marketplace an alternative and kicks on the FX forward market as well as the FX swaps market and we actually had a day about a week-and-a-half ago, where we did more than 21,000 contracts in our new monthly contract -- in our new monthly. That's an important number. If you think about our FX contracts does 900,000 contracts a day, 21,000 day in a new product is a significant portion that day was almost 3% of our FX volumes. So we are seeing additional participants come in and we are seeing the uptick of these products.","We also announced recently the launch of CME FX link which we expect to launch actually January of next year. With CME FX link you're going to be able to trade on Globex, the spread between an OTC spot transaction and our futures contract. So this will be against our start from three contracts, the monthlies as well as from quarterly. So we're very excited about that, for the first time we will have a listed standardized equivalent for FX swaps and FX forwards.","Why is it so exciting? Relative to the margin rules, the GSIT rules, and even under MITHID 2 the impact on market adjustments that will have to post margin on these products, the standardized futures will be a lower cost alternative. And if you look at the FX forwards market and the FX swaps market combined according to the most recent study from the BIS between the two of them it's about $2.1 trillion available volume. So we're offering a standardized equivalent and we're excited about working with market participant on that.","Brian Bedell","And just from the pace of that momentum did you see that building more sort of now, I guess in the fourth quarter and for next year or is that do you view this as much more of a longer-term project?","Sean Tully","Probably longer-term. I mean really not going to -- obviously longer-term not going to put our predictions very hard to predict, how much transfer will be, but we want to be there to offer the lowest cost, most efficient alternative for the market.","Terrence Duffy","Brian one of the things I will say it's Terry Duffy is when you have a mandatory law such as Dodd-Frank that implements on the certain particular day people care for that. When you have what\u2019s under the uncleared margin rules as it relates to FX it's economics that dictates the behavior of the participant, when the economics come under actually almost much more powerful than a mandatory date. So without us trying to give any timeline of when we think that\u2019s going to have an uptick one way or another I think that you have to look at the differences and economics around these particular rules always seem to live up.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Maybe just one on the regulatory outlook, the treasury put out the capital markets report there are a ton of recommendation in air cost it\u2019s pretty much all areas, it seems like a lot of the comments on either the futures market declaring the CFPC in the industry is already been working on lot of that stuff but just wanted to get your take on any new launches that you saw in the report and how you see that progressing over the next few years?","Terrence Duffy","Mike, I'll take -- I will make comment on that. I had the opportunity to meet several times the treasury along with Kim Taylor and other people in the organization and got a chance to go through the report and got a good summary as if you've seen the report it's rather lengthy but there is a couple of things in that that I will point out that the supplemental leverage ratio that the stance of the treasury is taking in that report is very positive, we think that they're spot on with the way of looking at that.","As it relates to some of the other things in the report, I think for the most part it doesn't have any adverse impact on CME Group or the businesses that we run but from that standpoint we're going to -- we're fine with the report. So the one thing that is in there again even though it\u2019s that supplemental leverage ratio and Kim if you want to comment any further on that report but we --","Kim Taylor","The capital implication for our customers is the most important.","Terrence Duffy","Right. So that's kind of how we look at that report, Mike.","Operator","And moving on our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","I'm going to sneak in two half questions. One on data, data seems to have turned the quarter so much on some modest sequential growth, any comments there and then clearing revenues teams to be going the other way continuing to decline modestly; can you give us an update there? Thank you.","Terrence Duffy","So Bryan why don't you go ahead and start off the data?","Bryan Durkin","With respect to data, we\u2019ve been working hard to add new resources to support our core market data efforts in business mainly focusing on new resources in international commercialization of our data products and also audits and derived data.","With respect to our progress and in-sourcing the audit function, we completed our resourcing efforts and we're overseeing this function now internally and we have commenced a numerous market data audits couple of which are in the completion stage.","On derived data we continue to be pleased with demand for that pipeline that we have to-date. We closed a number of licensing arrangements and are in track to deliver more agreements over the course of the next several months. And I want to note that well a number of agreements for renewals of existing licenses, we're really pleased to see the strong pipeline of new request that are under review and are in the process of being executed.","We also recently announced an increase to the annual redistribution license from 12,000 per annum to 24,000 per annum. The real time data in 12 to 18,000 for delayed data. With respect to the non-display market data registrants, we have also announced an introduction of a new category and requiring all of our licensees to provide information on these categories to identify more specifically the field of use, so whether the trading is principal facilitating clients business using for order routing management systems et cetera.","Getting this business intelligence will enable us to optimize our pricing structures and will provide our customers I believe with more future products and services aligned to their consumption and usage needs. So these reporting requirements will take effect in January.","To note as with other data providers while we continue to see some attrition with respect to our professional data terminal usage base, we have also observed an increase in the non-display, non-professional retail, and Asia categories. So we're currently reviewing those user profiles to confirm the appropriate pricing structures going forward.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Bryan. So Sean you want to deal with the clearing revenue question he was talking about?","Sean Tully","Sure. In terms of clearing revenue on the interest rate side, we expect to be flattish this year, so revenues to be fairly flat. As we mentioned earlier right we have decided to close our CBS Clearing activity. And while the revenues were small, the net income was negative. So that also would have an impact on those numbers. But if you look at the interest rate swaps flattish but slightly higher. We are -- I\u2019m excited about the new offerings that we have, we had very good traction over the last 12 months particularly in Mexico Peso and Brazilian Real. In those two currencies we\u2019re running over $20 billion a day and we have now over 170 participants and in fact to get an additional 50 participants in our Latin American interest rate swaps, so far this year. We\u2019re also excited to say that we launched the Indian Rupee and KRW, so the Korean Won interest rate swap clearing. We\u2019ve already done and those currencies are around 30 trades with 16 participants, which is very good traction for the very beginning.","If you look at the Brazilian Real, the Mexican Peso, the Korean Won and the Indian Rupee these are where we had a unique value proposition especially with the Mexican Peso when we first launched it and the traction we got. So in these currencies we expect to be the value proposition relative to addressing the margin rules and earning that efficiency to the marketplace that we will do much better than we have in the past. To add to that, actually, we recently had more than 30 trades executed in our Swaptions clearing. While we had relatively small business, we are getting traction in new product.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Sean. Ken does that give you some color on your questions.","Ken Worthington","A lot of color. Thank you very much.","Terrence Duffy","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","We will hear next from Kyle Voigt from KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi good morning. Maybe one for John. Just wondering if we get some updated thoughts around transaction pricing, you\u2019ve seen really strong growth in the number of product complexes this year and typically you have the ability to adjust the pricing volume tiers in the growing volume environment as you\u2019ve done over the past few years and I think we\u2019ve gotten prior pricing announcements on or before that -- after the quarter earnings calls, just wondering if you could read into that CME doesn\u2019t file making new pricing changes for 2018 or is there still time left here? Thanks.","John Pietrowicz","Thanks, Kyle. We are -- we take a look at pricing continuously and we are going through our budgeting process right now. So pricing is something that we do, we do take a look at relative to creation of the budget. We did have some pricing announcements recently in our Euro dollar options area that you might have seen in the report and we think this is going to be important in terms of attracting more customers into that marketplace. Sean, do you want to comment on that?","Sean Tully","Sure. Over the last few years everyone, we thought this number of times work very hard in terms of investments in our technology and investments in the ability to have very fast responses to strategies and our options marketplace in order to facilitate the electronification.","So the Euro dollar options as John mentioned we leveled the playing field between the different venues in particular for members we did increase the fees from $0.09 to $0.15 if you're trading in the fifth. And then we lowered them on Globex in terms of the fees with CME it gets $24 to $22. So you can see there we have reduced the differential leveling the playing field in order to get more particularly international participants and to continue our growth of our electronic market.","If it is the success we\u2019ve had there over last two years, we\u2019re currently running at 40% electronic in our Euro dollar option last year we\u2019re about 25% electronic a year before that about 15% electronic, so very significant growth in our electronic market.","In addition to that actually around the treasury side, we're currently running at around 80% electronic versus closer to 70% last year. So we're excited about the increasing electronification and the increasing volumes.","If you look at those marketplaces while our overall rates business is up about 15% year-over-year, our options business is growing much, much faster. Our Euro dollar options in particular are running up 19% year-over-year and our treasury options in fact are up 41% year-over-year. So we see increasing participation, increased participants, increasing volume, I think John and I have spoken many times in the past about as we electronify we typically see much higher velocity of trading and that's definitely coming to fruition here.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeremy Campbell from Barclays.","Jeremy Campbell","Hi thanks. Just as we kind of look ahead here in potentially for getting another kind of rate hike at the December Fed meeting, can you just remind us about what do you guys might have looked to kind of pass-through to clients as far as kind of rate increases and what you might be able to keep with yields?","John Pietrowicz","Thanks Jeremy, this is John. We haven\u2019t announced how we\u2019re going to handle another Fed move but to give you some color about how we\u2019re thinking about it, we want to be competitive with the returns our customers can get with other investments versus what they can get at the Fed. And we want to do this in order to attract the cash balances to the Fed. So we haven't announced that but the way we\u2019re thinking about it really is the company though is our returns that we can offer by putting money in the Fed versus alternative investment vehicles, so more to come on that once the Fed moves.","Jeremy Campbell","But I think is it safe to say that you\u2019re going to get a little bit of an effect pass-through 100% on that?","John Pietrowicz","We\u2019re not going to comment on it, it\u2019s too early and it\u2019s unknown exactly when the Fed is going to move. So we don\u2019t want to -- we will comment on that once the Fed makes the rate change.","Operator","And Ben Herbert from Citi has our next question.","Ben Herbert","Could you just provide some color on market share gains in metals kind of competitive dynamic there and then what you\u2019re doing to protect recent gains?","Derek Sammann","Sure it's Derek here. We're very excited about the growth in metals; we have been able to put forward. What we have developed over the last specifically three years was the diversification story to ensure that our COMEX metals franchise extends beyond the precious metals business where we have a global 95% market share which has actually increased year-on-year primarily due to our Gold and silver business but Platinum, Palladium as well.","What we have done primarily in the metals side on precious is to continue to electronify our options business extend liquidity out of the curve and we\u2019re seeing significant participation outside the U.S. between WTI and gold are the two most popular products with the retail population particularly in Asia. That's help us through I think Q3 metals non-U.S. volumes up 45% year-on-year Q3 2017 versus 2016. So global participation in our market of electronifying our options market we actually had a record level of electronification in metals options, I think we went from 39% to 46% of electronics there so we are continuing to see extensive gains on the electronics side.","On the other side of the franchise, we put a specific focus in place in 2014 to build the industrial metal side of the business. So the market share gains you see us make primarily in copper, take that business from about a 12%, 15% market share in 2014 to close to 27% year-to-date this year.","So the way it has gone about that is really talking to our customers and making sure that we\u2019re building not just participation globalized use in our copper business but ensuring that we have the balance of the portfolio for the other industrial metals product they need primarily around aluminum, lead and zinc. So these are very different client bases, precious metals tend to trade more like a financial products we see growth trends that are on the lines of FX and fixed income is really financial products, the industrial metals side of the business came at a point in time when we are saying infrastructure conversations in the U.S. which is a direct correlation to growth in bonds and participation in our copper contract and globalize the participation.","So we\u2019ve seen strong market share gains there. We have been able to do that without any pricing cuts, we\u2019re competing with better products, better liquidity, and electronic access in the European Nation market. So we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made, we will continue to build on those market share gains and certainly the industrial metals portion of that business as and when we see global recovery we believe we will continue to see growth we have developed and built the base for and we think we will continue to grow participation globally there.","Operator","We will go next to Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey good morning. So we have seen the nice reacceleration of your international volume growth and it looks like a lot of that is European customers trading your energy products, what is it specifically that is really catching on, is a focus on WTI is it broad-based and why a lot greater European growth and U.S. growth in that product group right now?","Terrence Duffy","So Patrick we\u2019re going to have Bryan comment a little bit about the growth and then Derek talk about the products. So Bryan?","Bryan Durkin","So this just underscores the efforts that we've undertaken in the last few years in terms of our sales efforts and outreach and it\u2019s showing its impact across these asset classes. Energy in particular and Derek can get into the mechanics more so but in terms of the activity, the volatility, the recognition of that product as the benchmark has definitely taken major traction within EMEA across I would say all of our clients segments by the way huge uptake on the commercial side particularly driven out of EMEA, solid commercial participation continuing out of Asia which is a new dynamic that we\u2019ve seen in the last year-and-a-half and it\u2019s continuing to build that we\u2019re just there a couple of weeks ago and the reviews in terms of our energy suite and robustness of energy suite have resonated loud and clear with that community.","So you can expect more efforts in that regard because I really don't even believe we have scratched this surface in terms of opportunity, asset managers, hedge fund banks all are very aggressively trading these products. Multiple asset classes, biggest drivers in terms of cross product is asset managers, hedge funds, and corporates and commercials.","Derek Sammann","Patrick a little color from the product side. If you look at the top of Page 2 in the document that we circulated for the earnings call particularly you will see we call the asset class growth or we see the energy non-U.S. business is 65%. We attribute that largely to the continued growth and globalization of the U.S. Crude benchmark and WTI now that it's a waterboard and benchmark. We are seeing participation in our markets skyrocket. You\u2019re absolutely right pointed the European and particularly the Asian participation growth there as well.","What we\u2019re excited about there is not only the fact that we\u2019re seeing volumes growth but in Appendix material we sent you on Page 20, you will see the large open interest holders we set records over the course of this year and we're setting just below a new large open interest holder record there as well.","So the point Bryan made we are seeing broad-based participation, accelerated growth in Europe and Asia that's on the crude side. What we are really excited about is actually we are starting to see a natural gas market that is beginning to follow a similar path in globalizing that we\u2019ve seen in WTI over the last couple of years. So we\u2019re starting to see Henry Hub which has always been the U.S. benchmark rise to be global benchmark status, as you are seeing Henry Hub continue to expand, that's a market we've taken from 68% market share to 80% market share in the last 24 months. As you\u2019re starting to see liquefaction facilities come online in the U.S. which is actually a transportable version of U.S. natural gas connects natural gas markets that places Henry Hub as the center of the global gas market. So we\u2019re starting to see a early uptake and we are seeing broader participation and increase in action to -- from European participants particularly in light of some of the regulatory changes they are facing locally, being a path that we\u2019ve been able to develop for the growth in WTI. We see a similar path unfold over time relative to the NAT gas development.","We see this as multi-year process; we don\u2019t see this happen in overnight, there is one liquefaction facility online now the Sabine Pass, but three more facilities come online in the next two to three years. So you will see they take growing building the participation base, you will see this follow a similar path of globalizing use of WTI and we thought this 80% market share in the Henry Hub futures market, we think we are well positioned to serve that global use and make sure that our energy business as a core of the global NAT gas business going forward.","Operator","And we will take a follow-up question from Rich Repetto from Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Rich Repetto","Yes. I got a real time question here would the CME be interested in the Deutsche Borse now that Carsten Kengeter is stepping down by year-end. I'm kidding Terry, but definitely I\u2019m not going to ask you that question but that is a news that just broke. But I do have a question around M&A you\u2019ve been focusing generally on CFPC regulated entities, futures your large acquisitions have been with CBOT and NYMEX. As you look forward Terry would you necessarily need the state within those boundary, would you look at some of the entities out there now have -- are regulated by both, are you more open to stuff like that going forward given the majority of the markets et cetera.","Terrence Duffy","Rich, the only thing I will say and I'll kind of follow-up with John said earlier and that is we\u2019re going to look and continue to look and because we put ourselves in a position to analyze so many different transactions of what's going to add value to the client, I said a year ago when I took over as CEO my major focus was building the end user clients and that's what we\u2019re continuing to do. So we freed up a lot of capital, we\u2019re continuing to do new client acquisition and if there is a potential transaction that makes sense that will add to the bottom-line for our clients, I truly believe that's the formula that we will in return to deliver value for our shareholders. So that\u2019s the path that I\u2019m going down and as far as the regulation goes and who regulates that particular product that we go after it, we will take that under consideration but I will not shy away from something that I think will deliver value from the company just because of who regulates it.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session today. At this time, I will turn the conference back to management for additional or closing remarks.","Terrence Duffy","Well we want to thank you as I said at the outset for your participation in CME and your interest and we hope you have a good day and thank you very much.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5428":["CME Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 27, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","John C.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to John Peschier. Please go ahead.","John C. Peschier - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Terry and John will make some initial remarks and then we will open up the call for your questions. Other members of our team will also participate during the Q&A.","Before they begin, I'll read the Safe Harbor language. Statements made on this call and on the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are on our website. Also on the last page of the earnings release, you will find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, John. And thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm going to make some initial comments and then I'll turn it over to John, who will share the financial highlights. Our overall volumes remained high during the first quarter, even though there were pockets of low volatility in equity and energy markets.","We delivered record average daily volume of more than 17 million contracts. This includes all-time highs in interest rates and metals average daily volume. Activity from outside the United States remained strong. The volume averaged more than 3.5 million contracts per day. Within fixed income, we had broad-based strength across Eurodollars, Treasuries and Fed fund futures during Q1. This has been driven by recent outsized growth from our buy-side customers. We continue to see strong performance in our Treasury futures relative to the cash treasuries market.","Our metals portfolio, which was our fastest-growing asset class in the first quarter, delivered outstanding activity with more than 510,000 contracts traded per day, driven by growth in both precious and base metals. Our performance in copper was particularly impressive with 23% growth to almost 95,000 contracts per day during the quarter, even more impressive considering that our primary competitor in copper saw their business decline 8% in that same timeframe.","We continued to gain traction with our options business. Here, we have taken an enterprise-wide approach by enhancing our technology, better equipping our sales force to engage with clients, and launching some innovative new products. Last year, we generated a combined $552 million of transaction revenue in options. This makes us the world's largest options exchange by that measure. During Q1, we reached a record average daily volume in both interest rate and equity options.","In March, our Eurodollar options average daily volume grew 73% to 1.7 million contracts per day. Of that, 29% was electronic, the highest monthly percentage yet, and the April electronic percentage to-date is even higher. And in natural gas options, we grew our daily volumes 20% during the quarter, 40% of which traded electronically, helping us to achieve a market share of 70% in March.","New products and product extensions continued to perform well. Our Ultra 10-Year Treasury futures and options exceeded 100,000 contracts per day in Q1. This was nearly triple the activity from a year ago. We launched monthly FX futures recently and have had some early success there. In metals, we saw record volumes and open interest in our suite of aluminum premium products, which we launched last year, confirming global demand for these innovative risk management tools.","In equities, we have seen some traction in our S&P Select Sector futures. In early April, we launched weekly E-mini S&P 500 Monday options. On the first exploration, we traded over 53,000 contracts during that day alone. Additionally, the E-mini S&P Wednesday weekly options we launched in September 2016 have achieved 51, 000 contracts per day in 2017 so far. Combined, the Monday and Wednesday's are recently producing more than 10% of our total equity options trading. We think these short data products are very appealing and valuable to customers, especially given the geopolitical concerns and an uncertainty around European elections.","I mentioned last quarter that we are heavily focused on expanding our customer base by focusing on end user customers. Our main objective is to identify potential clients that may be using less efficient products and convert them to CME Group offerings. We are making progress. For example, we have record open interest, our large open interest holders in three key areas. One is in our interest rate business where we achieved an open interest record of over 74 million contracts including records in Eurodollar futures, Treasury futures, fed fund futures, driven in large part by asset manager.","The other is in our energy futures business where we achieved new record levels of open interest during Q1 in our WTI, gasoline and heating oil futures. Additionally, we hit an approximate four-year high in natural gas futures open interest and grew our ADV by 24%, while our competition shrunk 3%, allowing us to increase our year-to-date market share to 78% versus 75% in March of 2016.","While our trading in FX was down during the quarter, we significantly outperformed the two primary competitive venues, and we are pleased to reach a record level of large open interest holders toward the end of February. More important, we saw banks reappear as our fastest-growing segment during the quarter in FX.","The other thing we are focused on is operational efficiency. We continue to ensure that we are allocating our time and resources in the best way possible. A few weeks ago, we announced that we will be closing our European exchange and clearinghouse by year-end. Our customers have clearly shown that they prefer to use our U.S. infrastructure to access our global products, deep liquidity and capital efficiency. We will maintain a significant operation based in London. However, it will be focused on direct sales of our core products.","While there are several positive trends in our business, one area I wanted to briefly touch on is market data. We outlined an ambitious plan last quarter to supplement our traditional real-time data business with several new data offerings. We referenced increasing the data sales team focused on derived data, offering a new cloud-based data platform along with building out an audit function rather than outsourcing it. We are currently augmenting our organization to capture these opportunities. Frankly, we underestimated the complexity of resourcing our team, which will not allow us to achieve the guidance we previously outlined. Therefore, we do not expect these initiatives to drive any incremental data revenue for this year.","Lastly, our April trading volume has remained strong during what is usually a slower time of the year. Volume is averaging approximately 16 million contracts per day, and we are seeing 20% growth month to date. We intend to build on our strong momentum by providing outstanding value to our customers.","In closing, I'd like to thank our employees for all of their hard work this quarter. With that, let me hand it over to John.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Terry, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to start off the year with a strong quarter. Our team continues to be intensely focused on driving global revenue growth, operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders. We had an exceptional quarter, as we did in the first quarter of last year. As Terry mentioned, we had the highest quarterly ADV in our history, and we also had record net income and earnings per share on an adjusted basis.","Our overall rate per contract for the first quarter was $0.731, the same level we had the prior quarter despite an almost 3% product mix shift toward our lower priced interest rate products. Market data came in at $97 million, down from Q4, as several larger customers consolidated trading operations and their terminal usage.","Moving to expenses, excluding license fees and adjustments, our first quarter total expense was approximately $267 million, in line with our original guidance. Earlier this month, we announced our intention to wind down a portion of our European operations by year-end. We expect the annual savings to be between $10 million and $12 million, which will primarily impact 2018, as it will take us some time to fully complete the process. Eventually, we also expect to free up over $150 million in capital related to these entities.","Additionally, because of the transfer of the Russell products in July, as well as aggregate changes in our licenses, we would expect our license fees in the second half of this year to increase 10% to 15% versus the same period last year, assuming similar trading patterns. Our adjusted compensation expense increased by 4%, primarily driven by normal cost of living increases, as well as hiring additional technology staff in India and Belfast, which over time we expect will reduce higher cost professional fees. Our compensation ratio in Q1 was 14.7%, about the same level as we had for the full year of 2016.","Looking at the non-operating income and expense line for the first quarter, our ownership in the S&P Dow Jones Indices joint venture primarily drove the $31 million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries. This was the highest quarter we have seen and up 15% from Q1 last year. The compound annual growth rate on this contribution has been 13% since 2013.","Our returns from investing cash on behalf of our customers increased sequentially to $12.2 million from $8.4 million in Q4. Considering current cash positions, we expect the investment returns to increase again in Q2, as we will have the first full quarter impact of CME Clearing's approval to hold customer cash performance bond deposits in a Federal Reserve Bank account.","The tax rate in the first quarter was an adjusted 35.5%. We expect the rate to be higher in the second quarter, and we expect an effective rate of 36.3% for the full year.","And now to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.37 billion in cash and marketable securities, which includes $240 million of cash from our final BM&FBOVESPA stock sale in January. It's worth noting we also returned $1.1 billion in January through our annual variable dividend and approximately $220 million in March through our regular quarterly dividend. Finally, during the first quarter, capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were $15.5 million.","In summary it's been a great start to the year. We reached a peak level of volume, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. We intend to remain very focused on efficiency, coupled with enhancing the value proposition of using our markets to attract new customers.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you sir. We'll take our first question from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Terry. Good morning, John.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I guess the question is on the market data, Terry, because just trying to \u2013 so are you saying it was the guidance 5% to 6% up and is the new guidance more flat for 2017? And could you give us a little bit more detail about the resourcing that you talk about that you need to augment?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think, Rich, I'm going to let John discuss that a little bit and then I'm going to have Bryan walk through some of the resources that I outlined in my opening remarks. And I think you'll get a little bit more color on that, so hopefully we can answer your question. If not, go ahead and follow up with it.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Rich. This is John. Yeah, as we indicated in the prepared remarks, the opportunity associated with some of the items we outlined in the fourth quarter call are being pushed out into 2018 from 2017. I would say that the market data for this year is going to be range-bound, and we'll be able to provide some more color as we get closer to launching the opportunity in 2018.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So, Bryan, why don't you give a little color on the folks that were looking to step up on.","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Terry. Quite frankly, Rich, we underestimated the level of time it would take us to get the staffing in place, particularly to help us with the opportunities associated with derived data. I think you've heard us speak quite a bit about where we see those opportunities and we have much in our pipeline that we're getting through right now, but it is very labor intensive and a very specialized source of talent that we're looking for to help us navigate through and capture those opportunities. Same thing with the audits. We are working right now aggressively on augmenting our capabilities with some \u2013 bringing in some outsourcing staff to help us as we ramp up our staffing for the auditing function.","And then I'd say lastly in terms of the development of our business intelligence efforts which will allow us to capture some of the other opportunities that I've outlined in the past, the highly specialized skills that we're looking for right now and quite frankly we were very aggressive in terms of what we thought our ability was going to be to get that staffing in place.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","And let me just add a little bit to what Bryan said, Rich. We first came out with historical and derived data and new opportunities to capture revenue. I think frankly we might have even underestimated the value of some of this market data. And I think in order for us to roll this out properly to the benefit not only of our shareholders, but the users who want to have this, we need to make sure we price it adequately, properly and distribute it adequately and properly through the direct channels and give Bryan the resources with his team to move it forward. So to me I know it can look like somewhat of a negative on the guidance, but overall we are very committed to the strategy and we're looking forward to delivering on this.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Understood. And then one quick follow-up. John, you said that the interest would likely increase from the \u2013 I believe it's the Fed deposit program in 2Q. Can you give us a little bit of feel on how much that might be?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. I think we're really pleased with being able to offer this opportunity to our customers. If you recall, the access to the Fed account for customers was kind of middle of March is when it became available. So if you look at the next quarter assuming that the same balance mix and the same level of balances as the end of Q2, which we've seen remain steady through April 24 of this month, so we should have at around 6 million to 7 million additional dollars in Q2 assuming those balances and mix remain constant.","Richard Henry Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks. Thanks, Rich. Appreciate it.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","I guess my question is a little bit more broader on market data. You guys have raised prices last year and implemented pricing or cost on things you're giving away for free. Now you're looking to roll out enhanced components of the data. I guess generally, how are your customers feeling about paying more for these services and the longer term opportunity you think in market data as a revenue, are you still as bullish about it or think it can be a growth area for you on a longer term basis?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Let me start a little bit. Then I might turn it over to Bryan, Dan. It's Terry. Yes, we are bullish on market data. You got to realize we are coming off of a zero basis. We gave this away for many years to attract liquidity, which was critically important to the future of this company. So then we are still a low-cost provider as it relates to our competitors as it relates to market data.","So with our new offerings, this is not just the core business of trying to charge them more for our core offerings. This is new derived \u2013 new offerings in data. And as I said earlier in my comments, I think it's important for us to understand what that true value of that data is by putting the analytics team in place, the sales team in place globally. So we can distribute that and capture the revenue that's appropriate. So we're not willy-nilly changing the pricing on historical and derived data constantly. So I think this is a process that, as I said in my comments, we may have underestimated a little bit how it's going to take to roll it out, but I do think I would say we were still very bullish on it. I'll let Bryan comment more.","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","And to add onto Terry, we're taking a longer term focus on this. Bear in mind, we have the broadest array of asset classes, six asset classes that we represent and, I would argue, the largest customer base, and so we're taking a very holistic global picture and making sure that that resourcing and capturing those opportunities across the globe that we're best positioned. It's taking us a little longer to get there.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Answer your question, Dan?","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Thanks very much. Thanks, all.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","We'll go next to Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hey, good morning.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Alex.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Sorry to ask another question about market data, but I think you talked a lot about the outlook for kind of like the new stuff you're excited about, but can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of what happened in the first quarter? I think John gave a couple of items here, but if you just think about it holistically, right, your volumes are going up, people are more interested in your markets. They should be new people, new firms consuming your data. So why was that down quarter-over-quarter? And then related to this, I mean you gave a pretty bullish statement in February. You've been to a couple of industrial conferences and you saw a lot of us in Boca in mid-March. It seems like very surprising that that first quarter came in so light. So, what happened there? Why was there not more visibility that you could have communicated? Thanks.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks. Thanks, Alex. Yeah, our market data revenue for the quarter was $97 million. What did happen was there was several larger customers that were doing some internal efficiencies themselves and also consolidated their screens which caused the first quarter to come in lighter than we had anticipated going into the first quarter.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","And you didn't notice that until now. I mean I'm just surprised how long it took for you guys to realize that, sorry to harp on it.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","No, no, that's fine. I mean if you recall, the way this is done is we're about a month in arrears as we go through and they submit the counts to us. So we don't have clarity on that until part of the way through the quarter. So, that's fundamentally why it's something that's recorded in arrears.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Fair enough. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you. Thanks, Alex.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","We'll go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Sorry to stay in the market data subject, but just in terms of the \u2013 I guess as we move through (21:06) I appreciate you mentioned range-bound. Did you view the consolidation of some of those screens from some of those customers that's sort of a one-time event or do you see the potential for that happening again during the year? And then maybe just talk about the transition process of moving to the new data platform. I appreciate it can take a while, but is there any kind of friction as you do that or do you feel that will be a seamless handoff?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So, Brian, let me kick it over to Bryan for a second, then I'll make some comments when he's finished on the first part of your question. Bryan?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","It's hard for us to estimate in terms of how firms might change some of their dynamics or usage, but in positioning ourselves for any changes in that direction, it's incumbent upon us to take the rich vibrant database that we have and develop the new products that we've outlined to you. I think it's fair to say that we represented those new initiatives relatively recently and we are staffing ourselves to be able to capture those opportunities. So it's not necessarily the same consumer of information or data that we're going after either. You have to separate the core from the derived and the historical. All of these represent different opportunities and consumers of that data.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","You know, Brian, let me just add to what Bryan said a little bit and talk about what do we see going down the road. One of the things we've said since we took this company public in 2002 and we've always said, it's like volumes. Volumes are very difficult to predict, right, because we're beholden to a whole host of different activities, geopolitical including that and policies associated around the world. So when you look at the growth of our business on the volume side, we're doing everything we can to create capital efficiencies, bringing new markets, new people that were not participants into our marketplace, which Alex referred to earlier in his comments, and go back to that.","We're going to continue to address new clients, the big focus of mine and the management team to bring in new clients, and the longer we can continue to work hard to bring in new clients, that will then take care of the market data equation. So it's something I like to say, I can't control the price of the stock. What I can control is trying to help run the business as efficiently as possible, bring in new clients to create capital efficiencies (23:33) and I think that will have a major reflection across the entire portfolio of our businesses including market data.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And so we should view the market data as fairly core \u2013 the current market data stream is fairly core and then the initiatives that you're working as incremental to the core, because -","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Right. Yes. Yes, absolutely.","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Yes, absolutely correct.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Excuse me. We'll go next to Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. John, maybe just on the Fed account, just wanted to get a sense where maybe the imbalances are, dealers, clients and then what maybe the potential longer term opportunity and what kind of the puts and takes are, as users are trying to determine where to put their balances. And then just real quick on the European thing, it sounds like expenses that's more 2018, the cash that's there is that also most likely going to be 2018 or would that be a 2017 event? Thanks.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, let's talk a little bit about the Fed account. As of quarter end, we had about $44.4 billion in performance bonds and guarantee funds on our balance sheet. Of that, $34.5 billion was at the Fed. $6.2 billion of the $34.5 billion were house accounts, and $28.3 billion was customer-related accounts at the Fed. As a reminder, the Fed itself \u2013 the customer cash came in about midway through March, so we didn't have a full quarter impact of having that available to our customers. What we have seen, unlike in past quarters, is that the amount that's being held at the Fed has remained constant and steady through the month of April, so that's why we're mentioning that, assuming that the mix and the level stay constant as of end of Q1, we should see an increase of $6 million to $7 million more in Q2.","In terms of how customers will look at putting money at the Fed, I'll ask Sunil to comment on it. He is here as well and he is President of our Clearinghouse. The customers will do a calculation in terms of, number one, do they need the cash readily; number two, what the return is that they can get at the Fed versus other instruments they could hold in terms of collateral. So, Sunil?","Sunil Cutinho - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, John. Just to add to what John is saying, we actually provide a very flexible collateral program to our clearing firms to actually post either cash or securities to meet their margin requirements. And, as John pointed out, one of the factors may be the return that they can get on their cash balances, but that is not the only factor.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","And then in terms of your question regarding the things that we're doing in Europe, the amount of capital that we're able to free up, which is around $150 million, we'll be able to free that up once those enterprises are wound down. And so that would be a late 2017, early 2018 point when we can get the cash back here to the States.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Mike.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Chris Allen with Buckingham Research.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I just wanted to maybe touch a little bit on rate per contract. It was fairly resilient across most products in the quarter and a little bit surprising with the volume trends. I'm guessing it's maybe due to continued electronic adoption of options trading and continued penetration of customer bases. But any more granularity you can give us there would be helpful.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Sure, Chris. In terms of the RPC, yeah, it was pretty resilient at $0.731. The realized benefits of our pricing actions, plus lower volume discounts in equities and energy, were able to offset that mix shift \u2013 it was a 3 percentage point mix shift to our lower priced interest rate products. I'll turn it over to Sean, and he can talk too a little bit about the options.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. In terms of the innovation that we've done over the last few years, a lot of these new products that we've launched actually have a much higher RPC. For example, as Terry mentioned earlier, we're very focused on delivering the most capital margin and total cost-efficient products possible. So our invoice spreads, which take advantage of portfolio margining between CME cleared interest rate swaps and CME Treasury futures, for example. They traded $11 billion a day over 80,000 contracts in the first quarter, a record number, up 62% year over year, so huge growth.","Now, while in our Treasury complex, 80,000 plus contracts a day may not seem very high. The RPC is about $2. So it's approximately four times the RPC of our overall complex. In addition to that, if you look at our Basis Trade at Index Close for example in equities, Basis Trade at Index Close, remember we launched a little over a year ago. This allows participants to trade our equity futures at a basis to the cash market close. Very efficient for cash options traders, but also very efficient for index managers wanting to eliminate any slippage relative to the management of their index funds. The BTIC, we actually had a record day on February 28. We had another record day on March 1. The BTIC likewise has an extremely high RPC of approximately $3, and doing about 10,000 contracts a day. So we've had, I'd say, an extremely high hit ratio on our recent successes, and a lot of those new products, with the efficiencies that they provide, have a higher RPC.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Sean. Maybe Derek can comment a little bit on his process as well.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, Chris. And as Terry mentioned at the top of his comments, we had an all-time record quarter in our metals business. As you know, our metals contracts is our highest RPC contract, and copper has been a particular area of strength. You couple that with the large open interest holders and open interest records we're having, coupled with the fact that energy and metals particularly is where we've seen our highest participation and fastest growth in the commercial participants. You've got a combination of high-RPC products and growth in our high-RPC customer bases within those products as well. So we're helping to grow and diversify the growth across the exchange.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And just a quick one, just on the guidance for the licensing fees up in the back half of the year, when do the escalators kick in? I would've imagined it was earlier in the year and what does that assume for Russell ADV, the similar levels that we're seeing on ICE right now.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","What I guided to was to kind of give you a perspective of when you take a look at the second half of last year compared to the second half \u2013 what we're expecting the second half of this year, it's a 10% to 15% increase and that is assuming similar trading patterns. It's not only the Russell, but also other changes that occur in our license fees. Many of them, you're right, started at the start of this year.","In terms of the level for the Russell, we're not kind of guiding in terms of the amount of volume. I will say that we're very excited about bringing the Russell on, the efficiencies that we can provide our customers and the distribution that we can provide our customers is really second to none.","So, Sean, do you want to comment on the Russell?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, we're very excited about the launch of the Russell 2000. So when we're launching those contrasts, we're going to be launching both the futures and a full suite of options on July 10. We are very excited about that. There will, however, be a one-year period when those contracts are trading both on our platform and on our competitors' platform. So there is some level of uncertainty as to when participants will move their open interest from one exchange the other. We are working very closely with market. We're very excited about it. And we're doing everything possible in order to make the transfer of open interest as easy as possible, as low cost as possible, as minimum slip as possible for our participants. And so we're excited about it, but it will take some time in order to move the open interest.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, to give you some perspective, the last full year that we had the Russell was in 2007 when we were trading 240,000 contracts a day. In 2016 at the alternative platform where Russell is currently trading, it was 118,000 contracts a day. So over that same period of time, it got cut in half. And then also just so you know that they cut the contract notional in half early this year or late last year.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Late last year.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Late last year.","Chris Allen - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go to Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So follow-up on the Fed, I assume that the customer ultimately makes the decision on where customer cash is placed. So maybe what percent of customer cash do you think will be placed with the Fed over time? And maybe as the interest rate environment normalizes, would you expect the utilization of the Fed window to kind of increase or decrease? And then lastly, CME is taking a cut of that yield, and maybe to what extent are you getting pushback on the fees or the take that CME is getting on that Fed yield and is there any reason for pushback to kind of increase or decrease there over time?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So, Ken, let me kick it over to Sunil to tell you the mechanism, how clients make a decision and how they want to have their funds being held and where, so, Sunil, why don't you go ahead, and I'll address the other part of our costs that are associated with the equities and how we are just recapturing some of our cost on the back end of it.","Sunil Cutinho - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Terry. As we said before, we provide our clearing firms the flexibility to post cash or securities. When cash is posted to us, we actually \u2013 cash for margin requirements is posted to us, we actually place that with Fed accounts and we pass the return back to the clients.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","And as far as what we capture as relates to the Fed accounts, I am going to let John walk through some of the costs that we incur and what we get back to offset those.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Ken. What we've been doing over the last several years is providing our customers, number one, access to the Fed that they don't have presently. And then secondly, we do incur a substantial amount of fees to support the clearing operations, liquidity fees, bank fees, other types of fees. This helps to offset. So it's two things. One is giving our customers that availability. Number two is to recoup some of the costs which are not insubstantial for running our business.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Answered your question, Ken?","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, and just the last part of it. So in the interest rate environment when interest rates \u2013 before interest rates rose, you get a nice premium at the Fed versus what you get in the open market. I assume that may change as interest rates go higher. Is there less of an incentive to actually go to the Fed window as rates rise?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","You know what, Ken, I think that's pure speculation on what the (36:16) having margin that CME Group will do. We have no idea what they're going to do. I mean some people want to hold securities, some people want to hold cash that could change dramatically on a rising rate environment. It may not \u2013 it's a wait-and-see program for us, so we don't want to speculate on that.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then last maybe Terry for you, CME has made a push to further rationalize its business. You've exited some non-core businesses, which appeared to be really helping to boost efficiency, European clearing being good example. To what extent is there more a low-hanging fruit in terms of rationalizing the business?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","I don't know if there's any low-hanging fruit. I don't know what we're doing in Europe is considered low-hanging fruit, but we're making some tough decisions about how we optimize this business and we're going to continue to do so. I mentioned earlier in my comments that it's about the client, and I'm not saying a client in the United States is a client globally. So we are really focusing on going out attracting new end users into our products and showing the benefits that they can derive by doing the risk management here at CME Group. It's all about cost efficiencies in the world that we live in today. Sean talked about it a little bit earlier. And we're going to continue to point out those cost efficiencies, which CME Group can offer to its clients. So, that's a big push that we have over the next 12 months and we think we're very hopeful that we'll pay major dividends for not only our shareholders, but the opportunities for our clients.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We go to Warren Gardiner with Evercore.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Warren.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Maybe I missed it, but it sounded like the database was going to require some further investment beyond what you guys were expecting, but it doesn't look like there was really much change to expense guidance or anything along those lines. Can you kind of just square those two for us?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Warren. This is John. As Terry has kind of mentioned, it's really about focusing the resources within CME Group and some of the things that we talked about as we rationalized some of the operations here, we're able to take some of those resources and put them towards growth initiatives. This is an example of that. We feel that in data, there's a tremendous opportunity with our six asset classes and the value of the options data that we have within our business, and we've got a large and growing options complex.","So it's really taking internal resources and reprioritizing them to the market data efforts. There's lots of examples that I can give you on that, but it's really taking the focus of the business and putting it towards market data. Also as Terry has indicated, we spent a lot of time growing this in a global client base, driving this, accumulating all this volume and now we're really focused on capturing the market data side of the opportunity for us.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","And just to add to what John said, I'm very \u2013 what John and rest of the team, we're very focused on the cost of running this business most efficiently possible. So I don't see any incremental cost to adding to Bryan's group to go out and capture the revenue opportunities that we believe are in market data. So I don't see any reason to guide on any higher expenses as it relates to that product line.","Warren Gardiner - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Quick question on energy. So ICE and Platts announced that in May they're going to launch a U.S. LNG futures contract. Is that an area within energy that you think presents an opportunity for CME Group as well?","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Patrick. It's Derek. Sorry for my froggy voice. I picked up something in China last week. When you look at the energy business, as Terry mentioned in some of his remarks, we're coming off a year or a quarter this year of record open interest in growth in WTI, heating oil, gasoline and nat gas. When you look at LNG, it's a growing market, it's an emerging asset class where you're talking about a product that is now the result of what's changing both in the dynamics here in the U.S. as well as a global market. It's a physical market that is evolving. There's no established price points right now. When you look at the position that we got in the Henry Hub market in natural gas, we're at record levels of 70% market share. Terry referenced our outperformance growth versus ICE in nat gas options and nat gas.","So, yeah, we're looking at that as an additional piece of the growth pie relative to energy. We're very excited about that. We think the growth we've put up and given the fact that we are now seeing commercials as the single largest participant in our energy business, that coupled with the large open interest orders and open interest rates give an indication as to where we're focused on the end user need. So as the LNG market evolves, we're working with end users to make sure we're able to service them in LNG market as we have in WTI as well as in the nat gas market.","If you look at slide 11 in the deck that we sent you, you'll see the growth in open interest that we've actually been put up across each of these four major components on energy business, so in the same way that we have attacked those client segments and be able to serve their needs, we'll do the same thing in emerging products like LNG.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. I appreciate that. And then speaking of your slide deck, as we look at slide 5 and showing your growth in Europe and Asia, it does look like that growth slowed a little bit, I guess, in the first quarter of 2017 versus 2016. So from that, I infer that most of your volume growth in the March quarter came from U.S. clients and I think you made some commentary about banks kind of getting more active, so if you can maybe expound on that a little bit.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'll let Bryan and Sean touch on that a little bit about the expansion throughout the other regions. Bryan?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. Thank you, Terry. So our global business remains very strong and robust. You're correct that I'd say early on, January, February was somewhat muted in comparison to the prior year. However, as we look into March, we've seen a tremendous growth particularly in our rates, jumped 50% from March of last year which is a tremendous sign. And our European activity overall was up substantially in comparison to the U.S.","Again, it goes to the diversity of the product line because even as we saw some slowing down in the interest rate and equity complexes in January and February, that was well offset by our activities in our ags, metals and our FX complex. So again it goes to the diversity of the product line and the very surgical approach that we're taking to developing new client opportunities and bringing in new clients and the development of products that Sean has outlined.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Sean, maybe you could touch a little bit about the European interest rates versus ours and where you saw that in the first quarter.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. In terms of European interest rates \u2013 actually in terms of our U.S. rates complex, I think we mentioned it clearly in the documents, but record number of large open interest holders, record open interest, record Q1 volumes. So we're very excited about what we were able to achieve in the first quarter. And Terry mentioned in terms of innovation, our Ultra 10-Year reaching 103,000 contracts a day. So we're very excited about what we've done there.","In terms of our European penetration, specifically in our interest rate products, to put things into perspective, we did 1.488 million contracts a day out of Europe. So we did almost 1.5 million contracts a day. Think about that relative to the size of our competitors, and they are global, actually, businesses. So we've gotten extremely high penetration. We're going to continue to get increased penetration. If you look on our charts \u2013 on slide 6, you can see here how we had great actually traction in our Eurodollar futures and options, our Treasury futures and options. We had over 100% growth in our fed funds contracts, and we continue to increase penetration of the cash market. So we're very excited about our rates market.","Then actually on slide \u2013 you can see our innovation on slide 9, where we're looking at several new innovations that we've launched in the marketplace and the terrific traction that we're getting there. You can see on slide 10, for example, the record number of large open interest holders where we've had a new leg up in that marketplace in terms of banks and the growth that we're seeing in foreign exchange. We're very excited there. There are a lot of times when we're doing things that may seem extremely technical, but they actually have very big impacts on market structure and have helped us enormously. So one of things I talked about last year was the fact that we had reduced our minimum price increments on four of our large FX contracts. So we halved the minimum price increment on our euro versus dollar. We halved it on the yen versus dollar, the dollar versus the Canadian dollar, and the dollar versus the Mexican peso.","What that means now is for the electronic algorithms within the banks because we've got a much more competitive product with a much tighter bid-offer spread, much better liquidity, we're getting a much higher volume. So interesting in the first quarter, our volume with banks was up by 15% in our foreign exchange marketplace, even though our overall volumes were down because of much lower volatility. At the same time, the two largest OTC platforms that publicly offer foreign exchange, we significantly outperformed their volumes.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","So just to add to what Sean said, and I think he summed it up very well, but there's always ebbs and flows not only to our U.S. participants, but also to our European and Asian participants. So that's I think just what we're seeing a little bit here, and there's nothing more than that. And I think with the initiatives that we've outlined with the capital efficiencies, the innovation in our interest rate complex, you might see some trading in different venues, but ultimately people are migrating to our products as the numbers dictate.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one on market data again. I believe the prior 5% to 6%, the growth guidance, excluded pricing changes. So can you just give us an update on the pricing moves or potential pricing moves and maybe if you have any plan to increase pricing over the next 12 months?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, we do not have any pricing planned this year. So we are always looking at our products and adding new products and augmenting additional customers, but we don't have any planned price increases thus far.","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","And as I alluded to earlier, this is targeting other consumers of the data than what you would view as your core market data participants. So it's actually a new pipeline of activity that we're driving towards, and they'll be paying for those services.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","And this is a \u2013 let me answer this in a broader way. One of the reasons it gave us the opportunity to do the things we're doing to create the efficiencies is because we were able to build liquidity around the clock on our Globex platform. We don't want to disrupt that liquidity. So on the market data side, to Bryan's point, we don't need to tack \u2013 or add on additional costs to our core participants who are providing that around-the-clock liquidity, but we go after these new forms if people are coming to us and we're going to them. That's really where the incremental revenue is going to come from on market data.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, and then if I could have just one follow-up maybe for Sean on the rates business. You're seeing stronger year-on-year growth in futures open interest in rates than you've seen in quite some time. And one of the questions from the investment community is really around the sustainability of this growth in a rising rate environment where most of the activity in hedging and repositioning actually happens ahead of the rate moves and just as rates start to move. I guess could you help us understand what users are coming in to build the open interest really just over the past two quarters that's driven the really significant open interest growth, and then how sustainable you believe that is going forward?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. I appreciate the opportunity. So think about it. We grew our (48:46) even during zero interest rate policy with new product innovations, new product extensions. And we've been growing the open interest for quite some time. If you think here's an interesting point, for example, during the zero interest rate policy, we focused a lot on liquidity further out the curve in our greens, in our blues and further out, so the third year and the fourth year of Eurodollar futures.","One of the things that you're seeing come to fruition now is in 2011 we launched a third year of quarterlies in our Eurodollar options. In 2013, we launched, for the first time in CME Group's history, a fourth year of quarterlies in Eurodollar options. Those options that we launched in 2013 are now (49:29). So for the first time, we've been able to have four years' worth of accumulation of open interest in the existing contracts in our options complex. So I don't see anything, any ceiling of any sort. We will get penetration of the cash market. We've grown it very substantially from on the order of 55% of the cash market on our Treasury futures in 2012 to now 82%.","If you think about our S&P futures and if you look at our S&P futures penetration of the cash market, we actually trade in our S&P futures on a daily basis a larger risk amount than all of the cash exchanges combined. So there is no ceiling. In the case of S&P, our penetration is over 100%. So I don't see any ceiling on that growth.","Kyle Voigt - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","I'm sorry, sir. Go ahead.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Is there further questions?","Operator","We do have two remaining in queue, sir.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Okay. Go ahead.","Operator","We'll go to Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Sorry, maybe I missed it, but is $97 million the quarterly run rate for market data revenue for the year now?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","We haven't provided any guidance. I would say that it's range-bound.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. And you highlighted your strength in options and futures. Can you maybe talk about the attractiveness of options and futures and any sense as to why your peers aren't doing more to catch up with you?","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, Vincent, it's Derek here. I think if you look at the \u2013 we've provided some slides here and you've seen these before relative to both our growth and our penetration. The unique position that we find ourselves in is we are the largest derivatives engine in the world with a broadest asset class perspective. So we've got \u2013 this year today, I think we're actually doing over 4 million contracts a day in April. So we continue to go from strength to strength, but be in a position where about we've got core benchmark liquidity across every major asset class, what we focus on is building out the options associated with those futures and the infrastructure, the technology, the position we put ourselves in relative to extending the franchise at the enterprise level uniquely allows us to scale our technology investments in the ways that others that are maybe just an energy exchange or just an equities exchange are going to struggle to put that kind of investment behind.","So as we globalize our business, as we port our liquidity electronically, Sean mentioned before the growth in Eurodollar options electronically were up to 32% electronically. That's the growth of our global participation in Europe and Asia. Questioning what others are doing or not doing, I couldn't tell you, but what I can tell you is we're focused on client need, giving them the most capital-efficient way to trade all of their risk in futures and options in a unique way in which we can provide the electronic delivery of that actionable liquidity alongside the capital efficiency of providing the underlying hedge with the option on the same platform in the same clearinghouse is unparalleled elsewhere.","Vincent Hung - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks.","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Vincent.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you, Vincent.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Alex.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hey. Thanks again. Just one quick thing, maybe this was addressed already, but on the whole interest income from the clearinghouse with the (52:55) and so forth, can you just remind us how the mechanics will work as rates move higher? Like I think you've said something about 80% for the customer and you keep 20%. If I remember this correctly, so if there are further rate hikes, do you basically capture 5 basis points with every rate hike?","And then just in general on those line items, I think that kind of \u2013 is there any way you guys can present us a little bit better the balances and the investment income? I feel like it's kind of get lost below the line here a little bit. And I mean this has the potential to offset some of this market data weakness and I think it gets completely lost. So just wondering if you can do a better job of presenting this going forward.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Alex. Yes, a couple a couple of things. First off, we have not said what we're going to do with the next rate hike. As you look at our Fed funds futures kind of try to imply this is kind of a June move, but we have not said what we're going to do in terms of the amount we're going to rebate back to our customers. This is an important service that we provide our customers. So it's something that we want \u2013 to your point, I think something that is core to what we do and we want to make sure that we're highlighting it as effectively as we can and we probably should highlight it more, especially when you take a look at what we've been able to do, where we're taking our non-operating earnings from an expense, a $9 million expense in the first quarter of 2014 up to where we're at today of $16 million \u2013 or $15.6 million in income.","So it's this offering that we offer our customers and also it's the S&P joint venture \u2013 index business that we have with S&P Global. That's also performing extremely well and producing around $30 million in earnings for us. So when you take a look at that line, it's something that certainly the investing community should be aware of because these are two things that, although are not in our direct operating expenses, are important for our overall business. So, that's a couple of points that we wanted to highlight.","Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC","Absolutely. Thank you.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Right. Thank you. Thanks for question, Alex.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","There're no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Well, let me thank all of you for participating today. We appreciate the opportunity to address your questions. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","And that does conclude our call for today.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Peschier. Please go ahead, sir.","John Peschier - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to start with the Safe Harbor language, and then I'll turn it over Terry for brief remarks, then we'll open it up for your questions. Other members of our management team will also participate in the Q&A.","Statements made on this call and in the slides on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance can be found in our filings with the SEC, which are on our website. Also, on the last page of the earnings release, you will find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Terry.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, John, and as John said, we want to thank you all for joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest in CME Group. I hope you've had a chance to read through the Q1 earnings commentary document we provided earlier this morning. As you can see, the strength of the quarter was broad based across products and geographies as a significant number of customers actually turn to CME's markets to manage their risk.","Many of the themes that we have spoken about the past few years were clearly on display this quarter. Those include our focus on driving trading volume 24 hours a day, delivering additional innovative futures and options products to meet client needs and drive additional revenue, and remaining efficient on the expense side. The combination of those efforts led to over 50% adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share growth in Q1.","At the end of the first quarter, we were pleased to announce the transaction with the NEX Group. We are working diligently on the timeline we outlined on the analyst call. The next shareholder vote has now been set for May 18. We have begun the process of seeking regulatory approvals, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year.","With that short introduction, we'd like to open the call for your questions, and we'll start now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question from Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I guess the first question's on market data. We saw the sequential decline, and you highlighted the decline in audit fees. I guess, a little more color on the outlook there. You had the April 1 price increase. Maybe if there's any early signs in terms of attrition, and kind of how we should be just thinking about the progression for 2018 for that line item.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","John?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thank you. Thank you, Dan. Good morning. Market data came in at $95 million this quarter. We had a $1 million reclass from market data to other revenue. So including that reclass, we're running at similar levels as the first three quarters of last year. In Q4, we saw some benefits of bringing the audit function in-house with approximately $6 million of settlements. And as we mentioned previously, we expect there to be fluctuations up and down in this line quarter-to-quarter depending on the realization of those settlements. We have been building a pipeline that is being worked, so we do expect those fluctuations to continue.","Before I turn it over to Bryan to talk a little bit about what he's seeing in the market data business, as you indicated, the big change coming is the real-time market data price increase which is going from $85 per screen to $105 per screen which went into effect in April. Real-time market data accounts for the majority of the market data revenue, and since the announcement of the price increases, we've seen a stable level of subscribers. So, Bryan?","Bryan T. Durkin - CME Group, Inc.","I would just point out that with respect to the audits, the resolution in settlements can be quite protracted. There's a number that are in the hopper right now that we look forward to and hope to resolve in the next quarter. You saw what happened last quarter with the amount of settlements that took place.","What's even more imperative to us is the correction of behavior. So what we are seeing is a stabilization in the context of what you may have seen in past decline of screen counts. What we are seeing is an improvement in terms of the reporting of real-time screens. That in combination with the $20 adjustment in terms of going from $85 to $105 which took effect April 1 is something that we'll be watching closely.","Also, with respect to the derived data, you need to keep in mind that some of those contractual arrangements can be quite chunky themselves and can take some time to be able to negotiate those agreements. So I would just kind of temper that a little bit in the context of quarter-by-quarter and how those two areas hit.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","And next we will go to Chris Allen with Rosenblatt.","Chris Allen - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Morning, guys.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Allen - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","I was wondering if you could give us some color on the equity and gains in unconsolidated subs, assuming that it's related to the S&P joint venture. Wondering if you can maybe help us think about what's been driven by the record activity we saw in the quarter and what's been driven by increased AUM to give us a sense for how should we be thinking about the run rate moving forward?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, we've been very pleased with the performance of the S&P Dow Jones joint venture. As you know, the S&P JV revenue consists of assets under management, which is the majority of the revenue. But a significant portion is also based on derivatives trading, specifically here and at CBOE.","So you've seen our performance in equities this quarter up 47%. So that gets paid through a license fee from us to them, and then we then get back 27% of it through the earnings in the JV. DJO (00:07:04) also has had very good activity as well. So again, it's a lot of the dynamics that are positively impacting our business is positively impacting their business, and it's just been a tremendous business model that they have, and one that we're very happy to participate in.","Chris Allen - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Is it roughly about 80\/20 AUM to activity? Is that kind of a good ballpark to think about, or...","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","I think it's \u2013 they're reporting their earnings right now, so they'll have the most recent -","Chris Allen - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Got it.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","...the recent breakdown for you there. But again, like I said, it's been a positive with regard to our equity activity, really positive in terms of both the S&P, and also, Nasdaq futures has performed also very well.","Chris Allen - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We will now move to Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. Good morning, Terry. Good morning, John.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I guess I'll use the question on this; I don't know whether I'll get an answer, but any updated views on the NEX Group acquisition and the timeline? I know you said the timeline, Terry, but whether the mix \u2013 how are you going to keep the dividend? And how long you would extend the leverage out, I guess, or how quickly you would pay down the debt?","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","Yeah, Rich. I'll take part of that. So there's really no new update to the timeline other than what Terry mentioned. We do expect the shareholder vote on May 18. It's been scheduled. We still plan on closing on the second half of this year. Also, as Terry mentioned, we're working through the regulatory approval process now. So no real update on the timeline.","In terms of leverage and paying down the debt, really nothing more to update you on than what we put in the 2.7 announcement. And really what we did is we approached our structure to the transaction and our approach over the next couple years to be balanced in terms of investing in the business, returning capital to shareholders and paying down the debt. And as you saw, we, in the 2.7 agreement, or announcement, I should say, we expect to delever over the next couple of years down to levels that are similar to where we stand today. So that's our objective.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thank you.","John W. Pietrowicz - CME Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Rich.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe if I could just ask a little bit more detail on how the FX Link is going. I think you guys launched that on March 26, and I know you're very \u2013 you're upbeat on FX futures volumes increasing pretty significantly over time with the uncleared margin rules. But if you could just go into a little detail about how you see usage on that platform, and also while we're at it, maybe also in the new products of BTIC and TACO?","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Sean?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. This is Sean jumping in. Thank you for those great questions. So on March 26, as folks know, we launched the FX Link. We are very excited about that. We're doing several hundred contracts a day. The more important thing I'd say in there is that we've got a very good participation from the right set of clients. So this is not a couple of prop firms passing it around, but is the new clients who are using the product for the defined purpose.","With such a large innovation, I'd say, right, where you're bringing together the OTC market and the futures market, it is going to take time for volumes to build and for additional participants to fully build automated trading. We're currently seeing primarily, I think, point-and-click trading. But we do expect over the coming weeks and months to see a greater number of automated traders. We know of several firms that are building out, in particular end-users that are building out their automated trading.","If we look at the BTIC; BTIC, very exciting results this year. Last year we averaged less than 13,000 contracts a day. This year, we're averaging more than 40,000 contracts a day. So we've more than tripled the volume in the BTIC. Great innovation last year. It's got nearly a $3 RPC. So very, very positive for the RPC for the entire equity complex, but obviously a great innovation.","Thanks for asking about TACO. We've got a number of new launches that are coming up over the coming month. On May 7, we're going to launch SOFR futures. On May 14, we're going to launch the TACO on the equity indices. And then on May 21, we are launching Colombian peso, Chilean peso and CNY or the renminbi interest rate swap clearing. So we're very excited about the new product launches.","In terms of TACO, TACO, Trade at Cash Open, so it is the opening market equivalent to BTIC, which is Basis Trade Index Close. It is not as large a market as the close, so the opening market a bit smaller, but we do expect a similar set of participants with a similar set of efficiencies delivered to them, and we are hearing a lot of excitement around it.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's good color. And just back on FX, just \u2013 is that an open-architecture platform? I think that's with Citi. I guess, can you do that through any bank, or do those folks need to go through the Citi platform?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","So, Citi is the central prime broker, but we have now signed up several different prime brokers who are all available. So yeah, most participants now, because of the number of prime brokers that we have, will be able to access the trading. But again, it takes time for people to set up their own systems, in particular, on the automated trading side to take advantage of it.","Again, the good news is it takes a long time, right, to build up an ecosystem. But the really good news is we've got, again, a very solid and I'd say the right set of end-customer participants who are in there doing point-and-click who have said that they're in the process of building their automated trading. So, it's a very good start.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And we will now move to Christian Bolu with Bernstein.","Christian Bolu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, Terry. Good morning, John.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Christian.","Christian Bolu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Curious on the SOFR contracts you spoke about just a minute ago. I guess, it sounds like there's significant customer appetite for the contract you'll be launching in May. I guess, longer term, curious how that informs your view about kind of the long-term viability of LIBOR and LIBOR-based contracts?","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Sure. This is Sean jumping in. We are excited about the SOFR launch. In terms of designing the contracts, we met face-to-face with more than 100 clients, working with our sales team and our research team in order to design the contracts, and the marketplace is very excited about the launch. So in recent weeks, 80% of the calls actually in regards to SOFR are incoming from customers asking about it. So it also gives us a big opportunity to engage with clients very closely on our interest rate products.","Actually, in terms of that, CME Group is the natural home for the product. We are always looking at delivering efficiencies to the marketplace, efficiencies to our customers, because we're offering intercommodity spreads between our Fed Funds futures and our Eurodollar futures and the new SOFR futures. We will be the single most efficient place to execute those future contracts. In addition to that, on the clearing side, because we have huge open interest in Eurodollar futures and Fed Funds futures as well as Treasury futures, you're going to see the greatest possible benefits in terms of margin and capital efficiencies.","In terms of the uptake, I think that's highly uncertain. I think there's, as we know, hundreds of trillions of dollars' worth of derivatives and securities in open interest in LIBOR. And several trillion, I think the last estimate from the Alternative Reference Rate Committee was on the order of $9 trillion worth of securities in particular, and a very large portion of those go out, in terms of maturity, for many years.","So I don't personally see LIBOR going away any time soon. I think it will remain extremely healthy, and that's what we're seeing in the marketplace. But I think SOFR will be \u2013 create new complementary opportunities for trading the basis or the risk between the two. So I see SOFR as a really a new opportunity for us in addition to the existing products.","Another thing I'd like to mention is our Eurodollar complex continues to see recently record open interest, record volumes, so we see greater excitement in our Eurodollar futures and options than ever before. So I don't see LIBOR going away any time soon.","Christian Bolu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Awesome. Great answers, as always. Thank you.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Thanks, Christian.","Operator","We will now go to Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Sean Tully - CME Group, Inc.","Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I'm curious to hear your observations on the launch and the early trading of that new Shanghai crude oil contract, and to what extent you would view that to be a competitive alternative to WTI?","Derek L. Sammann - CME Group, Inc.","Hey, Patrick, it's Derek Sammann. Yeah, we've been watching the open development of that market over the last four or five years. They had some launch dates they pushed over the last three years. We look at regional benchmarks as highly complementary to global benchmarks. The story you've been hearing us tell over the last couple of years is the rise of WTI as a global waterborne benchmark.","And I think if you look at the results of our WTI franchise over the last three years, whether it's in terms of the outpacing performance of WTI versus Brent or the now-surpassed levels of WTI versus Brent, you can see that the world is demanding and international participation is proving that out to be the case.","When we look at regional benchmarks like the Chinese product launch, we're actually very encouraged by the opportunity for more a broader set of domestic Chinese participants to be trading a regional benchmark. What we are seeing and expecting is the bulk of that business that trades on that Chinese physical benchmark gets hedged out back into either Brent, WTI, or more likely, DME's Oman sour crude contract, which is a product launch of the Dubai Mercantile Exchange which we are a majority owner of.","So, we think the positive correlation between the regional benchmarks in the energy oil market likely provides a series of tradeable regional benchmarks against the global WTI benchmark. Results year-to-date so far in our Asian energy business is proving to be at record levels. Our Asian energy volume was up 43% in Q1, so that's really pacing the developments and growth of our energy business complex globally. So, we see it as a positive. We've seen that between DME and WTI, and we will see that contract evolve and the likely connectedness to the global market over time.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","And with no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Terrence A. Duffy - CME Group, Inc.","Well, we want to thank you all very much for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking to you at the next quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
