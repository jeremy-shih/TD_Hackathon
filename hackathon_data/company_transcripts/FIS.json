[Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Mary Waggoner, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Mary K. Waggoner","Thank you, Perky, and thanks to everyone joining us this morning for our third quarter earnings report. Frank Martire, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will begin today's discussion with a summary of our Q3 and year-to-date financial performance. Gary Norcross, President and Chief Operating Officer, will follow with the business summary and operations report. Then Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with the detailed financial review, including our outlook for the remainder of 2013.","Before we begin, I would like to cover a few housekeeping items. First, today's news release and the supplemental slide presentation are available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Next, please refer to the Safe Harbor language on Slide 3 of the presentation. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.","Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide more meaningful comparisons between the periods presented. These non-GAAP measures are outlined on Slide 4. Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release.","Now we will continue with the earnings report, which begins on Slide 6. I will now turn the call over to Frank Martire. Frank?","Frank R. Martire","Thanks, Mary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. FIS's third quarter performance was strong by all measures, as we delivered on all key metrics of growth, profitability and cash generation. Organic revenue growth accelerated to 5%, driven by strong performance within our International business, which grew 12%. EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points, and adjusted EPS rose 17% to $0.74 per share, while free cash flow increased to $229 million in the quarter. For the 9 months ended September 30, we delivered organic revenue growth of more than 4%, margin expansion of 40 basis points and 14% growth in earnings per share. Our cash generation and disciplined capital management have enabled us to return more than $0.5 billion to our shareholders since the beginning of the year through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.","I am pleased with our solid results this quarter. Based on our performance through the first 9 months and our expectations of a continued healthy demand environment for the remainder of the year, we are confident that 2013 will be another good year for FIS, which is evident in our updated guidance. Woody will provide more details regarding our guidance later in the call. Looking ahead, we are excited about the future of the company. We are committed to delivering value creation through continued strong financial performance, coupled with a consistent return of cash to our shareholders. On behalf of the management team, I would like to thank our clients and our shareholders for their ongoing support, and our employees for their dedication and commitment to driving our continued success.","Now I will turn the call over to Gary to share more about our performance and business strategy. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross","Thanks, Frank, and thanks again to everyone for joining us this morning. We continue to drive solid results, demonstrating our ability to deliver consistent performance and execute our strategic plan. We are particularly pleased with the growth in our International business, and we are on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. My remarks today will focus on 2 areas, the first being key sales highlights, which are driving organic growth and performance results, including in-quarter highlights from each of our 3 markets. The second area is the global market trends that reinforce our innovation investments and are driving demand for FIS solutions.","Turning to Slide 8. I will begin with an overview of key sales highlights. We see ongoing demand in all the markets that we serve. We continue to add new clients and expand existing relationships for new logo sales and cross-selling to existing clients. We are also seeing continued opportunities around large and complex deals in the international and global financial institution markets, where FIS is uniquely positioned to deliver comprehensive consulting, technology and outsourcing service and support. We feel good about the strength of the sales pipeline and expect new sales contract value in 2013 to exceed our 2012 results.","Next, I will provide sales highlights for each of our 3 key markets, North America, international and global, beginning with our International business given their accelerated progress this quarter. Echoing Frank's comments, we are very pleased with the momentum in our International business. Organic growth accelerated to 12% in the quarter, with double-digit growth across all geographic regions. We are executing against our sales plan and remain encouraged with the strength and quality of the sales pipeline. We continue to see increased opportunities around long-term outsourcing arrangements, which provide more predictable revenue and profit streams.","There is great growth potential in Europe given client demand for solutions that improve their efficiency and profitability, which play to our strengths. As an example, Barclays Bank recently renewed its existing core processing relationship and in doing so will upgrade to the latest release of our core banking platform, giving them access to a much broader solution set and functionality. In addition, we are seeing opportunities to penetrate the mid-tier market in Central and Eastern Europe, where we recently launched a new real-time, cloud-based, core banking utility solution with our hosting partner.","Turning to Asia. We continue to see strong demand for core processing upgrades, including Heihan [ph] Credit Union in China and KBank [ph] in Thailand. In addition, we are having tremendous success deploying our switching technology in new markets throughout Asia, which further signifies the success we are having to leverage our technology capabilities across our global business.","As we announced earlier this month, FIS has been selected by eftpos to build a new centralized payment hub in Australia, replacing the existing bilateral networks. This is an important signing, as approximately 70% of Australia's debit transactions are processed through eftpos. FIS will provide ongoing processing under a multi-year agreement.","Moving next to our global financial institutions market, we are making focused investments to expand -- further expand and grow our relationships within GFI. As we have discussed in prior calls, this market consists of the largest financial institutions in the world doing business across broad geographic areas. Demand is active in this market for a strong partner to help free up resources and capital to achieve transformative, profit-producing, customer-centric innovation. We are currently involved in active discussions with several prospects involving large, multi-year transformational outsourcing projects around global wealth, commercial and retail banking operations. These dynamics are also driving very good growth in our consulting business, both in North America and Europe.","Finally, in our North America market, we see continued opportunities around our full range of solutions. While there is a consistent bias towards outsourcing, we are also seeing activity around in-house platform upgrades. There are several examples of key cross-sell activity in the quarter, including the Bank of Montr\u00e9al, which will deploy our best-in-class check imaging software, and with Northern Trust and Bremer Bank, who will deploy our Mobile and Consumer eBanking solutions. Bremer, as you may recall, recently migrated to our FIS core solution. We also saw continued demand for our services and infrastructure support capabilities, including expanded agreements with SunTrust and ING Direct. Additionally, we are very pleased to announce a new call center agreement with MCX, where we will help bring their mobile commerce solution to market through a suite of FIS solutions and services supplementing our existing relationship.","Across all these markets, financial institutions continue to shift investment dollars away from internal cost centers and redirect their spending toward growth by improving integration across channels and driving new ways to interact with their customers. The desire by consumers globally to bank anytime, everywhere, is fueling important change around the delivery of financial services, which is accelerating interest in our broad range of digital channels.","This leads to my second discussion area, FIS solution innovation. We are very pleased that our investment in solution and service innovation are hitting the focal point of market demand. Driven by a consumer-centric use of mobility, social channels and the opportunity in analytics, the financial services industry is in the midst of the most significant evolution involving customer delivery in 40 years. This evolution drives financial institutions, retailers and alternative payment providers to engage with consumers in new ways and to build customer loyalty through digital channels, which is fueling new opportunities for partnership and collaboration.","Our longstanding relationships in the core banking, payments and retail space place FIS in a unique position to help move the industry forward. As a result, we are seeing very strong interest around our FIS money movement solutions, including our Mobile Wallet with Cardless Cash Access. Many of you had the opportunity to preview this solution at our investor update. It was also recently showcased at the Money2020 conference, which garnered significant national TV and syndicated news coverage and very positive feedback with conference attendees, including the newly planned launch by City National Bank, which we announced in early October. FIS Cardless Cash Access will be deployed in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City over the next few quarters.","Additionally this quarter, we introduced our new FIS Active Analytics suite, which helps financial institutions tap into new revenue streams through more precise segmentation and dynamic cross-sell capabilities. FIS Active Analytics is built using our extensive data analytic capabilities, which include market-leading merchant offers, loyalty and rewards programs, as well as segmentation and tailored pricing capabilities. This suite and our digital solution investments underscores FIS commitment to lead the industry in delivering innovative solutions that drive new revenue, expanded wallet share and expense efficiencies and create deeper, more profitable relationships for our clients.","Turning to Slide 9. In summary, we feel good about our competitive position in all 3 of our markets and our ability to generate new sales, as evidenced by our continued growth and strong overall performance. We continue to advance our business objectives to accelerate growth in our international market and invest to further expand and grow our relationships within global financial institutions. We are seeing strong market interest in our innovation, especially in solutions that are modernizing customer interaction models, such as Cardless Cash Access solution and Active Analytics suite. Finally, we are very pleased with our progress and results. Our momentum is strong. Demand for our solutions remain substantial. All of these are very good indicators that 2013 will be another year of strong, predictable performance from FIS.","Now, I'd like to turn things over to Woody for the financial update.","James W. Woodall","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results. Consolidated revenue increased 5% on both a reported and organic basis after normalizing for currency and acquisitions. EBITDA growth outpaced revenue growth, with an increase of 6% to $470 million. As a result, EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points to 31.3% from 30.8% in the third quarter of 2012, reflecting favorable revenue mix and disciplined cost management. It's not on this slide, but other income and expense was $7 million favorable to last year's third quarter, primarily due to investment gains that were realized on the sale of marketable securities and foreign currency gains. The investment gains were contemplated when we put our plan together for 2013. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $218 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.74 from $0.63 in the 2012 quarter. As Frank said, it was a very good quarter any way you look at it. Year to date, revenue increased 4% on both the reported and organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $1.35 billion, and the margin expanded 40 basis points to 30%. Adjusted earnings per share rose 14% to $2.07 per share.","Next, I will continue on Slide 12 with the review of segment results. Financial Solutions revenue increased 2% to $579 million in the third quarter and grew 1% organically, driven by the growth in consulting and digital delivery channels. Financial Solutions EBITDA increased 7% to $239 million, and EBITDA margin expanded 170 basis points to 41.4%, driven by disciplined cost management and increased termination fees compared to the prior year quarter. As anticipated and communicated on prior quarters' calls, Financial Solutions have had particularly difficult comparisons related to prior year de-conversions, which affected growth in current year processing and professional services revenues.","Turning to Slide 13. Payment Solutions revenue increased 4% to $602 million, reflecting growth in document output solutions, card loyalty programs and network solutions. Strong software license sales and higher termination fees also contributed to the revenue growth. In the third quarter, our check-related business experienced growth due to strong license sales, which resulted in an increase in revenue to $115 million from $107 million last year. Year to date, revenue from these businesses was $324 million, consistent with the same period last year. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 9% to $255 million in the quarter, and the margin increased 170 basis points to 42.4%, driven primarily by favorable revenue mix.","Now I'll cover our International business on Slide 14. Organic revenue growth in our International business accelerated to 12% in the third quarter, driven by double-digit organic growth in all regions. The growth has been driven by strong sales execution, implementation of deals previously sold and ongoing demand for consulting services. International EBITDA increased 14% to $81 million in the third quarter. EBITDA margin expanded 110 basis points to 25.3%. Corporate expense increased $18 million to $106 million in the quarter, driven by higher incentive compensation and health care costs. This is consistent with the level I guided on last quarter's call.","Moving on to cash flow on Slide 15. Cash flow from operations totaled $311 million in the third quarter of 2013. Capital expenditures totaled $82 million or approximately 5.4% of revenue, which brings us to free cash flow of $229 million compared to $193 million in the prior year quarter. We continue to anticipate free cash flow for the year to be in line with adjusted earnings. Our uses of free cash flow during the third quarter remained consistent with our capital allocation priorities of investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.","As depicted on Slide 16, we returned $189 million to shareholders in the third quarter, including $64 million in dividends and $125 million in share repurchases. We repurchased 2.7 million shares in the open market at an average cost of $46.69 per share. Year to date, we have repurchased 8.2 million shares at a cost of approximately $350 million. The share repurchase program drove a decrease in our diluted share count to 293.2 million in the quarter from 297.9 million last year. At the end of the quarter, basic shares outstanding were 291.1 million. Approximately $300 million remains available under the existing share repurchase authorization. Debt outstanding totaled $4.8 billion as of September 30. The weighted average interest rate was 3.8% at quarter end. Total debt to EBITDA was 2.7x. This is slightly above our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which is at or slightly below 2.5 turns. We anticipate reaching our target by the end of the year.","Moving on to Slide 17. We are updating our outlook for the full year. We now expect reported and organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%, an increase from our previous range of 3% to 5% for organic growth. We continue to expect margin expansion to be towards the lower end of our original 30- to 50-basis-point range for the full year due to revenue mix. We have narrowed our range for adjusted earnings per share to $2.80 to $2.87 per share, which represents growth of 12% to 15%. This compares to our prior guidance of $2.77 to $2.87. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings.","Before I open the line for questions, I would summarize a few key takeaways for the quarter. The third quarter was a very strong quarter by all measures. We are encouraged by the accelerated organic revenue growth rate in our International business. We are updating our guidance to increase the lower end of our guidance ranges for organic revenue growth and earnings per share, and we remain focused on deploying cash in value-enhancing ways, including investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.","That concludes our review of the third quarter results. Operator, we can now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess my first question is with regards to the large deals that you continue to sign and have signed already. Can you provide us with an update on how some of them are progressing? Deals like Sainsbury in India, and I know the eftpos thing is new, but on that. And related, I wasn't clear if the BMO check imaging thing is incremental to what you had, or were you just announcing a, like a milestone or something like that?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, let me -- Ashwin, this is Gary. Let me hit these, and then the guys can add anything they want. The BMO one, the check imaging deal was incremental. That was a new win for us. And we've obviously got substantial presence in the check imaging business, and so that's a very nice win by the team in North America, selling that product to BMO. Sainsbury is doing very well. We're still in the process of finalizing the agreements, but as we announced last quarter, we're actively already engaged into, with the client on deployment. And that bank will be ramping up throughout 2014, and they're already paying for the services that we're providing to them on the professional services front. So Sainsbury is going very well from a project standpoint, implementation standpoint and even sales standpoint. You also highlighted the India ATM business. That project is going very well. I was over there earlier this year. I'm scheduled to go back over there in the next month. But that project is progressing on target, on budget, on schedule. So we're very pleased with the results, and we're starting to see, obviously, some of the results of these projects flow through the financial results of our International business. The eftpos deal just got signed, so it's just getting started, but once again, will be a very significant project once we get that fully deployed throughout 2014.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And your comment with regards to 2013 bookings being better than 2012, should we expect that to have a corresponding benefit on revenue growth in 2014? Was that the implication or is there something different about the nature or term or ramps associated with these contracts that you've been signing that can affect that?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, we'll certainly talk and provide guidance for 2014 at the start of next year, but we do believe that our total contract value metric that we follow internally is a good indicator of our sales engine, and we do look for that sales engine to push more sales results than the prior year. And as you would expect, that's a good contributor force for the future. These contracts come on in different timeframes. Some of the projects are longer in nature, and some of them are short, like the BMO license deal on the check imaging. So we'll provide guidance early next year, but we think the sales engine is performing very well in the market.","James W. Woodall","But Ashwin, to restate the obvious, right, the more of the larger deals we get signed and sort of in our backlog, the better visibility we have into our revenue growth in the out-year.","Frank R. Martire","Yes, you look at that, Ashwin, and you look at the larger deals, and some of them take a while to come on completely. But when you look at the years 2014, '15, '16, they'll have significant impact.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. And I guess the segments are all doing quite well. The one that slowed down a little bit is financial. I know through 2012, it grew kind of 6% to 8% through the year, and this year, it's decelerated a bit. Maybe you could give a little more color on that and if this is kind of a short-term slowdown. It sounds like the pipeline is so good that we shouldn't really worry about it much, but just wondering kind of what's progressed kind of in the last 6 quarters or so.","James W. Woodall","Yes, I think we tried to kind of give you some color around that last quarter and this quarter on that. We had a large de-conversion last year, so we had processing through the third quarter last year around that, as well as services connected to the de-conversion. We also had a full ramp-up of another global commercial services deal in the third quarter. So it had some pretty challenging comps in the third quarter. Tried to give you guys some color around that. I think it's more short term in nature than long term in nature.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great, great. And then I guess the one other thing I just wanted to ask a little more about is I know this year -- I think the M&I termination fees were going to be in the ballpark of $40 million. Just if that's kind of on track and then that's kind of the headwind that we can expect into 2014. Is that still pretty fair?","James W. Woodall","Yes, no shift in the BMO termination fee. That $40 million and the timing of that $40 million is exactly what we've been talking about for a number of quarters now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One, as we think about -- and I know you're not giving guidance for '14, but I just want to make sure that as we think about the 30- to 50-basis-point margin expansion this year and we're coming at the lower end, I think, because of some of the mix, as we look to next year, I think everybody's trying to figure out, have we sold enough this year in the bookings to help the grow-over in EBITDA next year from M&I, but just given the margin profile this year at the lower end of the range, how should we think -- what are the benefits that are going to get us potential margin expansion next year as we look forward?","James W. Woodall","Yes, good question. I think a couple of things. One, we have been talking and seeing a good bit of change in mix. We continue to see less and less software sales as a part of our overall revenue composition compared to the relative size of professional services. Those professional services are adding overall growth in revenue and producing good profit dollars, but they don't come on at the same margin rate as the processing dollars. So we've seen sort of some expectation around the lower end of our range there. Those term fees come on at 100% margin, so they're challenging to replace that profit. But we have seen very good growth in professional services. We've seen very good growth in a number of our different new innovative type services. So we feel really good about the revenue side of the equation for next year. Margin, we continue to look at cost every year. We continue to make sure we take a turn at the dial and get as efficient as possible every year, and we'll give further guidance in 2014. But we feel good about the profile we've laid out for you guys, that sort of 4-year profile on 4% to 7% revenue growth and 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion. So we're still hanging on that guidance.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, I think that's right, Brett. I mean, when you look, I mean, obviously, we said very early on, when you start looking at replacing M&I, it's going to come on in a number of different forms and a number of different areas, whether we highlighted some of the international success of India ATMs in Sainsbury, but frankly, even some of the electronic delivery channels that I highlighted in my prepared remarks. When you look at the volume adoption there as well, those products come on at very high margins as they can continue to grow. So to Woody's point, there's going to be a different mix, but we're very comfortable with our guidance for the future, and obviously, we'll be sharing more about that in 2014.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's great. And just one follow-up. Can you give us a TCV for the Australia eftpos? I think that we were all pleased with how large the India ATM deal, and I'm trying to figure out, is the TCV sort of that size? Or can you give us any color on that?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. No, we're going to try to stay away from individual deals. It would be considered in our pipeline a very large transaction for us, but it is smaller than the India ATM transaction. But it's definitely a very noteworthy signing for us in Australia.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you update us on the growth in the Banco Bradesco joint venture in Brazil, specifically, what type of year-over-year account growth you saw in Q3 and what sort of growth you expect over the next 12 months or so?","James W. Woodall","Yes, I think as we talked about full color on international, we saw double-digit organic growth in all regions. And that would be Asia Pacific, Europe, as well as Latin America. Looking at the rest of Latin America outside the joint venture, we saw very significant growth and saw double-digit growth in overall Latin America, including right at double-digit growth in the joint venture. We continue to see good adoption there. We continue to see additional services and add-ons there. So very pleased with how the venture continues to perform. We wouldn't change any of our outlook. We continue to believe we're going to get double-digit growth out of that entity for the foreseeable future, Dave.","Frank R. Martire","And what we like is that all of the regions grew, internationally, for us, so we were pleased with that.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you sustain double-digit revenue growth in Brazil despite the slowing in the economy?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, right now, yes, I think for the foreseeable future, as Woody said, I think we do believe we can. The joint venture is bigger than just Bradesco, but all of our partners continue to operate well in that market. Payments are growing very, very rapidly. As we all know, we've got the World Cup and Olympics coming. So there's a lot of big catalysts that we think will further propel the payments market for us. And so we do, we feel good about Brazil. And all indicators are across the board for us in that market is we're not going to see a significant impact in the foreseeable future.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The check imaging business grew for the first time in -- it has to be many years. I guess if you take out the BMO check imaging deal, what do the underlying trends in that business look like? And how should we think about that business, let's say, over the next year or so?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, as we talked about in the past, David, check imaging, this is one of those businesses that you wouldn't get into in 2013, but we've been in it for a substantial amount of time. And frankly, our leadership in that group has done a phenomenal job. We actually saw growth in our processing business as well, just not the large software license deal. And as we talked about in the past, what's occurring is the volumes continue to drop in financial institutions, and they're now across the board getting to a level where people are looking to outsource that. And so our sales success has been strong in that market. Obviously, our leverage and scale is very, very strong as well. So it comes on at good revenues and good profit for us. So we think it's going to continue for a couple of years at least with being a positive contributor.","Frank R. Martire","And Dave, there's a movement towards outsourcing, because a lot of these who do it on their own, because the volume is going down and can't do it cost effectively anymore because of the unit cost. So there's a movement towards outsourcing for those who were doing it themselves, and obviously, that's an opportunity for us.","James W. Woodall","So Dave, if you go back the last couple of quarters, we had seen the rate of decline in that business beginning to slow. And we said a couple of quarters doesn't necessarily make a trend. Even if you pull the licensing deal out, that rate of decline continues to slow. So we've got 3 quarters in a row of good performance out of that business unit.","Gary A. Norcross","And that's as much as we're also bringing on new customers all the time in that business. So it's a combination of those 2 things impacting those numbers.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Final question -- quick final question for me. Woody, you kind of reiterated the long-term model of 4% to 7% organic revenue growth. You're at the lower to midpoint of that range for this year. What would it take you to get up toward the higher end of that organic growth target over the next 12 to 24 months?","James W. Woodall","Well, first, remember this year had about 100 basis points of headwind from the BMO de-conversion. So looking at it in a more normalized view, we were more than that 4% to 5% already. If we continue to see the larger transformation deals, we continue to see heavy consulting. But these larger transformative deals could definitely accelerate growth for us.","Frank R. Martire","Yes, I think, Dave, if you watch for the pipeline on the larger deals, as we watch it closely and as that continues to grow, we become more confident of our organic growth and what it could be.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I guess my first question, maybe a financial for Woody, but specifically on the financial margins, despite the somewhat soft revenue growth, which I know you sort of anticipated and called out, but maybe you can sort of help us understand how you got 170 basis points. And just broadly, I mean, you've been talking about the revenue mix not helping you, but the margins actually look really strong this quarter across segments. It seemed like the major drag was the corporate.","James W. Woodall","Yes, we saw some higher license fees in the third quarter than anticipated. We had kind of planned for, for full year, but think they may have flowed into the third quarter. We have, had seen a little higher termination fees in the course of the year, as well as through the third quarter, so we had a couple of higher-margin items that we had sort of planned for full year that flowed into Q3 versus Q4, Glenn.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Any impact to 4Q that we should thinking about as that relates to that?","James W. Woodall","Well, overall still, looking at the guidance, we kind of moved up to 4% to 5% on the revenue side of it, but we don't anticipate having that same level of licensing in the fourth quarter.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe for Gary, just a quick update on the Capco traction you're seeing both in the U.S. and Europe and maybe an update on MCX progress.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, on Capco, we continue to execute very, very well. Our consulting business, both in U.S. and Europe, it continues to perform at double digits. The engagement in the global financial institutions, as I've talked about in my prepared remarks, I mean, we're really continuing to see great traction around consulting. So we're very pleased with Capco. We're very pleased with what's in our pipeline, and frankly, some of the results we've already had through some signings there. So Capco is continuing to be a great performer for us over the last couple of years. When you look at MCX, MCX continues to grow very well. I mean, we highlighted the Money 2020 conference, there was a lot of activity around MCX at that conference as well. We talked about the new signing of the call center business, which augments our prior signing with them. So our relationship continues to expand. And we think there's still good potential for that engagement in the long term to generate some meaningful revenue and profit for FIS.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Any idea on what sort of timeframe for like a full rollout of it?","Gary A. Norcross","We're leaving that up to them. I mean, they're in control of their timeframe. We're doing some work for them as we speak, and so -- but we're going to leave it up to them to roll out the timeframe for deployment.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to start off with, first, the mix again in terms of what's growing and what's really not, in terms of how that impacts margin, sort of as a follow-up question to earlier. Obviously, in the Payments side, we saw card loyalty and output you guys called out, as well as the network solutions. I mean, are those the areas that you expect to continue showing strength? And can you just touch on whether those are really margin-accretive or margin-dilutive to the rest of the business in the Payments segment? And then similarly for financials, a little bit more on Capco and just the consulting side overall, the sustainability and growth in that area, given sometimes it's perceived to be a little bit more discretionary at times, and the margin profile, how that can impact the margins of the business over the next year.","James W. Woodall","Yes, if you go to Payments, I think the ones we called out are the areas we continue to expect growth out of. I would tell you they come on at margins at or above overall company margins. So those revenue dollars are very high-quality revenue dollars, and we're excited about the growth in those areas. We're also seeing pretty good growth out of bill pay still, continue to see growth there, which is obviously good margin business as well. Moving to FSG, we've seen professional services, both in the Capco consulting dollars, but also in what I call sort of the traditional FIS consulting dollars. The traditional FIS consulting dollars are less discretionary. And if you look over the past several years, including through the financial crisis, those type services are ones that are more mission critical to the institutions. The consulting dollars are in fact that. They may be more discretionary, but as the institutions have come out and started looking forward again, how to repair brand, how to improve customer experience, how to reduce cost in their business models. We continue to see a lot of activity with the Capco group and the expertise those guys have in that area.","Frank R. Martire","And Darrin, in the area of Capco, too, it's interesting some of the things they're doing in change management and so on, where that's become much more sticky as we would say, because when a client decides to go and use us for doing it, it's not so discretionary anymore, right? They've committed to a certain process.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, that was kind of the point I was going to make, Darrin. I mean, we use the term consulting to reference Capco. But the reality is what we've done over the last couple of years, the team's done an excellent job, while consulting is still a component, longer-term professional services, longer-term project work is becoming a broader and broader component of their book. So it gets -- it becomes a little less lumpy when you think about those, because those projects can spread 12, 18, 24 months. And then as Frank said, as we start getting into some of the change sourcing areas that we've announced in prior quarters, those are multi-years. So just like everything we've done traditionally over the years, as we've had a lot of businesses that will have lumpiness in their revenue line and we try to move those to a more reoccurring model. International is a great example of that. We've seen that at Capco. And then to Woody's point, when we think about the professional services on the FIS side, that's really wrapped around our FIS product. So it really is part of -- we've had professional services engagements that have been going on for 10 years because it's just part of delivering that product into our service for that financial institution. So we feel very good about managing the discretionary side of Capco at this point in time, as I've said, each becoming a smaller percentage of the overall revenue.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right, that's promising for next year. Just one quick follow-up on the -- back to the term fees and the timing. I know there's approximately $40 million expected and then about a 1% headwind from the overall for the year. But can you just give a sense on, again, timing on -- how much might have impacted this quarter's acceleration versus last quarter's year-over-year organic growth rate and then just remind us, I mean, all of that should roll off by the end of this year?","James W. Woodall","Yes, the BMO term fees were about $40 million, 70% first half of the year, 30% in the back half of the year, no shift in that timing at all. We did see a little bit of additional term fees in the quarter, as well as some licensing fees in Q3. And that's what kind of was favorable to the mix this quarter. That was probably -- the licensing fees were -- we anticipate a pull forward from Q4.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And again, the whole 1% sort of net impact of all the different moving parts anniversary at the end of the calendar year, right?","James W. Woodall","That is correct, absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can we just get what the actual term fee number was in the quarter?","James W. Woodall","I don't have that right in front of me. Hold on. I can get back with you on that one.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean, was it materially above, $70 million [ph]?","James W. Woodall","No, it wasn't materially above where we already guided to. We have the BMO number already in there. We had one other small term fee in there. But obviously, we're down to splitting hairs at this point. You're talking about something that's basis point of growth. I mean, you're not looking at a significant item for overall growth. The overall growth in the quarter was very solid across all markets.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. And then just wondering if you saw, in any of your Payment volumes in the U.S., did you see any impact from the government shutdown at all at the end of the quarter or into October?","Gary A. Norcross","We really didn't. We watched that very closely as you would expect, but no, we didn't see any impact.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then is there anywhere just geographically where you're seeing the economy start to improve and potentially benefiting your business as we look forward? It sounds like you're seeing pretty good demand everywhere. But is the economy a potential driver of anything significant into the end of the year and into '14?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, I think as we talked in the past, and we continue to see that steady recovery, when you look outside of the U.S., really all of our geographic regions are doing very well. We're seeing a different demand depending on the region for the type of product and\/or service that's being driven. But we continue to see good, steady recovery. Frankly, a lot of the areas in international or outside of the U.S. that are still having problems, we really don't do much in those particular countries. Then when we get into U.S., we continue to see strong growth in the large financial institution space and the global financial institution space, good interaction. Certain community markets, community bank markets, some areas of the country are actually getting down to the individual financial institutions. Some of those are performing better because they've just -- they've weathered through the market crisis better than others. But across the board, as you said, we're seeing good, strong demand and good, strong signings by the sales team.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I've got a couple, actually. Just overall, it sounds like you feel pretty good about the integrated sales approach in FI. Could you just comment a little bit broadly on the competitive environment? Are you mostly competing with internal solutions when you go to market or third parties? And have your competitors changed in a meaningful way?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, well, I mean, it's a good question. And honestly, the answer to that question depends on the type of institution and the size of the institution you're dealing with. Clearly in the community markets in the U.S., we're really not seeing a material change in our competitors, and it's been very consistent in our go-to-market strategy and our interaction with those competitors. As you get into the large financial institution space, especially in the global financial institution space, you're going to get into a different breed of competitor altogether. It typically is either going to be in-house developed or it could be other large consulting services firms, some of the large offshoring firms. So there's a very different mix of competitors in that space. Frankly, when we get over in international, I would say it's probably more heavily weighted towards in-house developed than even some of the other larger consulting firms. But the quick answer is it all depends on the size of the institution and the type of service that we're discussing with them.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if you look at your win rates, just globally, if you could generalize, would you say that they're stable or improving?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, I would say we're seeing very good win rates in the deals we're pursuing across all of our markets. We'll still get frustrated from time to time because we won't participate in a deal for some reason. And we still lose some from time to time. But all in all, given the strength of our pipeline, frankly, given the strength of our signings year to date, we feel good about our sales team's execution.","Frank R. Martire","And on balance, we feel good about the results that we've had over the last several years and going forward.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then as a follow-up also, just looking at the U.S., obviously, you read a ton about mobile solutions in many different manifestations. I'm not sure that we've seen a pricing model emerge. Could you just opine a little bit on whether you think banks are going to charge their customers for access to mobile apps or wallets, whatever the case may be? And if not, what's the long-term economic model around those offerings?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, no, it's a great question. We're seeing a little bit of all of the above at the moment. We have met with clients in the last 30 days that are charging a lot. They are charging and actually doing quite well with adoption and penetration, found customers who are pursuing a different path, where they're providing it as a service to their clients, to move some volume out of their more expensive channels. So I do think that the consumer is going to push mobile and some of these new transformative mobile channels, and so the result of that is financial institutions, like a lot of things that they've done historically around, charging for certain types of accounts or certain services, they're going to slowly move towards some type of a way to monetize that channel. And I think that it continues to be a consistent trend.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And if they're challenged, does FIS still have a viable long-term revenue stream around those solutions?","Gary A. Norcross","Absolutely. I mean, we've been paid for years for channels that they've given away as part of their competitive advantage. People don't charge to walk into a branch, and we sell products and services for branch automation every day. And so whether a client charges for a particular channel or not won't have any issue around our pricing or our ability to grow that business.","Frank R. Martire","The determination for the banks is how to do it cost effectively. They have to make the service available. And it keeps growing, and they know it. That's their challenge.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to build on Greg and Andrew's question, just I guess on enterprise sales or bank sales. Obviously, banks are facing a lot of compliance costs. I think looking at bank results, expenses were generally down. So surprised to see license sales coming through. And you talked a lot about core upgrades in general. So just curious, I mean, is there a greater force here that's driving bookings? Are you guys in the sweet spot and other places are getting cut? Just trying to understand sort of the health of discretionary spend and secular spending for banks in the business that you provide.","Gary A. Norcross","Well, I think there's a couple of things going on here. I mean, first, we've talked about it over the last several years. Our breadth of solution offering allows us to be able to sell into the financial institution given where they are prepared to spend money. So when you look at FIS, there's no one in the industry that has a broader product suite and a broader service mix than FIS. And so we get to capitalize in our sales cycle based on where the current project or current focus area is for a financial institution. So that is one backdrop. So if you want to call that being in the sweet spot, then we certainly will take that. But it's really back to the breadth of solution. When you look at some of these signings, that's why I had to mention multiple competitors in the earlier question. There's not a class of competitor out there that has everything that we have to offer, and therefore, we can maximize that in our sales channels. There's also -- keep in mind, Tien-tsin, these are mission-critical applications and services. You have to offer these type of services for the financial institution to operate. And so the debate here is not whether you're going to offer mobile or whether you're going to offer wallet or whether you're going to offer some type of other change-sourcing service. The question is when are you going to offer that. And so it's up to us to make sure that we've got the best solution in those areas and the most integrated solution and can drive the most benefit, to Frank's earlier comment.","James W. Woodall","And Tien-tsin, to follow up a little bit on that, too, one of our tenets is being able to offer our services and that reduced cost for the institution.","Gary A. Norcross","That's right, absolutely.","James W. Woodall","So as they look to us, it's helping them in that model of reducing discretionary spend and reducing cost in their overall business model.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, makes sense, the idea of cutting and investing. Just as a build on that, to Gary, the professional services side of it, I mean, now that you own that for -- you've owned that for some time, is that increasing your win share, you think, in general?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, I think it is. I think we're seeing the benefit of being able to engage early on in the consulting. This is obviously more of a global financial institution comment or a large financial institution comment. But it's allowing us the ability to really get engaged on the front end when financial institutions are trying to diagnose the problem, right, and what the solution is to that problem. And that typically leads into professional services around project and program management and selection and deployment. And we've seen, through some of our announcements in recent quarters, that's now resulting in long-term services engagements. You're also seeing it over on our product side as well. A lot of the larger financial institutions, as they came through 2008, they froze their spend. And so as they've recovered and as they've started to invest, you're now seeing them turn to FIS, to invest in services around the FIS products they have to deploy to get them up to speed. We talked about Barclays earlier. That's a big move for Barclays, to move from a solution that they hadn't upgraded in a number of years up to our latest release. And so that will drive -- that's a long-term project. It will drive a lot of services and a lot of results for FIS as part of that.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. It sounds like Capco is a good investment for you guys. Just 2 more quick ones. Just eftpos, is that -- I just want to clarify, that's a build-and-run scenario? And is there a big -- I know it was a bilateral before, but is anything unique to that from a technical standpoint in building it?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, no, we'll be taking them to a more modern switching software, more modern switching solution. And so they'll get some very strong benefits from that. But there would be absolutely an ongoing processing relationship.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, so there's an ongoing piece. I guess that's kind of -- I wasn't going to ask it, but I guess I'll ask it, because it's kind of tied to the Durbin 2.0 stuff. But with this whole dual signature possibility here, given that you guys have done some builds -- switch building in the past, I mean, could you enhance the NYCE Network to be a more competitive signature equivalent, to the extent that the signature market does open up in diversity as mandated?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, absolutely, we could, yes.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, all right. I guess we'll ask more if we know more about it.","Gary A. Norcross","Exactly. You'll monitor it just like we will.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Following up on Tien-tsin's question about Durbin 2.0, you haven't seen any changing in the banks' budgeting process or any kind of incremental caution related to this, Judge Leon's ruling and banks potentially thinking they might have to spend some money down the line on revamping the systems based on that or is it just too far out?","Gary A. Norcross","I think it's still a little too far out. The quick answer is we've not seen any material change. I mean, we're having a lot of discussions with clients about that. But as we've shared in the past, typically any type of regulatory inflection historically has always meant good things for FIS. So any change is a -- promoting work for us, either around professional services, product deployment, processing, et cetera, but it's still a little too far out.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. On your Payments segment revenue, I mean, they came in higher than we've modeled, and the growth rate really ticked up nicely there. Can you talk about -- I think there's some higher termination fees and strong software licensing revenue. You talked about the dynamics on the check side. I guess my question is, how should I think about how sustainable is this uptick in the segment growth rate kind of going forward? How do we parse out the different kind of drivers there? What should we expect from the Payments segment in the last quarter here and in more general terms just going forward?","James W. Woodall","Well, I think we were a little cautious on the improvement in the check-related businesses for a couple of quarters. We are seeing good results out of that group and some of the things we've done there and the team's working very well there. So I feel a little better on that front. We're still seeing bill pay a little ahead of plan, so seeing good visibility there. Some of the license fee, again, might have been a little bit of a pull forward. But we're feeling pretty good about where Payments is heading.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. One last one for me. Can you update us on your non-FI business? I know there's been a recent presentation, it's now about 12% of revenues. Is this mostly check-related services, some merchant processing? What else is in there? And how should we think about the sort of overall mix going forward in your business from sort of FI to sort of non-FI revenue?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, no, it's a great question. Certainly a lot of our merchant business is in there. A lot of our prepaid business sold to non-financial institutions is in there. Our government and tax business is in there. So the way we look at it, we continue to push payment products in those particular segments. I don't think you should see any kind of meaningful change in the percentage of the overall revenue of the company. In fact, I think some of the areas like International could continue to outgrow a number of those areas. But it's still a very good business for us. It allows us to leverage our processing scale. It also allows us to leverage our payment solutions in those markets. And the team is doing a good job executing in those groups.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just had a couple of quick ones. One is, Gary, you did mention branch automation, and it's kind of a theme that's building around some other companies. I'm just trying to understand, are you involved in the workflow process? Because it does sound like it would satisfy a lot of those dual mandates, bringing down cost, but investing for more efficiency. And I'm just not sure I fully appreciate your level of involvement there, so that would be helpful.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, no, Dan, we've got a full suite of solutions that are not only dealing with workflow but dealing with automation around a lot of the channels and the interoperability of those channels. And so we continue to sell our products and services in those particular areas. But back to my comment earlier about the breadth of our product suite, really, when you start getting into a retail commercial banking environment, there's really not a product and\/or service that we don't offer in that space today. And having good success and sales around and some of the things around workflow and loyalty and some of the active analytics comments I've talked about in the prepared remarks, all of that kind of ties together in some of the stuff we're doing around branch automation.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just to make sure we're not getting over our skis going into the fourth quarter, Woody, you had talked about a $7 million gain in other income that was contemplated. Is there something else that's contemplated in the fourth quarter we need to be aware of?","James W. Woodall","No, that's really one we just wanted to make sure you guys picked up on that. We did include that in our overall plan. We weren't sure of the timing of when we would actually be able to liquidate the investment, but it ended up coming through in the third quarter. So no, nothing specific.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- I'm going to go back to the Financial Solutions margin for a second. The termination fee looks like, based on our calculation, would have kept margins flattish. And so you talk about pulling forward some of these license fees into the quarter. And again, I'm just trying to keep myself from kind of getting over my skis in the fourth quarter. So if I think about it, we would have a similar amount of termination fees going into that quarter, but the license fees are probably going to get pulled down. And so I'm assuming margins have to come down sequentially, maybe materially in that division, is that fair to assume?","James W. Woodall","Well, I mean, I think you can do the math, right. If you look at what we were describing, as sort of low end of 30 to 50 basis points, at 40 through the first 9 months of the year, so I'm not really sure what's in your model, but you can kind of do the math and back into it from there. Net-net, we did see some license fee that we thought would probably be Q4 pulled into Q3.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just one other one. Gary, in the past, you've talked about -- you've kind of framed up, actually, the size of these new deals, the percentage of new deals that were coming in over $50 million or above. Can you provide that level of detail again this quarter? Or are you just kind of moving away from that?","Gary A. Norcross","No, we're trying to give you some insight. I mean, clearly some of the deals that we're highlighting are very large in nature, and we continue to see the growth in our pipeline of these very large deals. So that has been a significant change for us over the last several years, and I think that is the benefit of bringing Capco into the company, but also just the investments we're making around, even at FIS in the larger bank market. And so these results -- some of these deals we're highlighting are very large by our definition.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And are there incremental costs that we need to be thinking about as you kind of take these on, since it is a big shift?","Gary A. Norcross","The nice thing about a lot of these is it's good project work. It's good processing work. It's really right in our sweet spot around products. So we think we'll continue to see good margin expansion in these areas. So other than -- we continue to ramp up people around some of our professional services, but it comes on at good margins for us all in all. So we're pleased with these signings.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one, just quickly on PayNet. I mean, it seems to be getting an enormous amount of popular press. And one of the things that I think you said you have been working on was getting that to a same-day settlement engine. Are you there yet? And if not, what kind of timeframe are we thinking about there?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, we continue to work on that. We continue to deploy that across certain payment types. And the team continues to make advancements around that. So we're comfortable. You're right. I mean, we want to now move it now into results, right. We've signed up a lot of customers. We've got to continue to build scale through that channel. But we're in good shape, and the team has done a good job of building out the capabilities in PayNet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first was, maybe some housekeeping, but could you remind us to any degree what kind of exposure you guys have to the mortgage industry? I don't recall it being noteworthy, but I just want to make sure there's not something we should think about relative to what we're hearing about slowing origination activity or anything like that.","Frank R. Martire","That's not an exposed area for us, on the mortgage industry side.","Gary A. Norcross","We don't have any.","Frank R. Martire","We don't have any.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. I thought so, just wanted to make sure. Second is, going back to some of the stuff around Payments and MCX, and you were talking about some wallet initiatives earlier in the call. Overall, how do you see, I guess, FIS in this whole mobile wallet discussion? Do you think banks will try to sort of create their own wallets absent any real traction from sort of the first wave of players and you have an opportunity to be the engine behind that? Or will MCX sort of be probably the biggest wallet initiative you have? Just sort of trying to think multiple years out, how you guys might look in that landscape and in the Payments division.","Gary A. Norcross","We fundamentally believe, from a wallet standpoint, the wallet does need to be branded by a financial institution, right? And so we offer a very robust wallet solution that allows our banks to do just that, all right, that allows us to, allows them to brand their wallet under their name. I think a lot of people get caught up in wallet today. It's kind of the chicken or the egg scenario. And so some people are waiting on what they're going to do with their wallet strategy, waiting for it to be acceptable at the point of sale. I think that's what's very interesting about our Cardless ATM Cash Access product that we rolled out at investor update and then again at Money2020. Our message is -- and that's using the FIS wallet branded by the financial institution, our message is simple, is you need to start getting into this business and start training your customers to go to your wallet, because when it is available and readily acceptable at the point of sale, you want to go into that wallet for acceptance. So we think that's the right strategy with our financial institutions. It resonates well. We continue to be very financial institution focused. When you think about MCX, keep in mind, we're building all the rails and back-office support systems on MCX. And so it's key for us, as we've shared very early on is that allow the financial institutions to engage through that network, and we continue to work with MCX to make sure that happens.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And just one last question, I guess, on that topic there. Standards around mobile payments and wallets, I think, has probably been something that's not quite clear to the marketplace and inhibited the, I guess, the evolution. So by you working with MCX, in sort of their mission of sort of creating the standards that they want in place as retailers, do you feel like that inherently gives you any kind of a leg up around some of the other competitors in the wallet, that you're sort of right there at sort of the buildup of standards with the largest retailers over time?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, we do. We believe that the MCX signing is a very strategic relationship for us. Of course, MCX has to be successful, and that remains to be seen. But as we shared on the last call, it's certainly a very well-funded initiative by a very large group of -- a consortium of large retailers. But as they work through their standards, as they work through their rules, we do believe -- and frankly, based on the fact that we're building out all the behind-the-scenes rails for MCX and doing a lot of back-office services, we believe that fundamentally does give us a good position to work with them in the future with our technologies and to benefit our financial institutions.","Mary K.

Please go ahead, sir.","Pete Gunnlaugsson","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone and welcome to FIS's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Turning to slide 2; Gary Norcross, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer will begin today's call with company highlights for the quarter and the year. Woody Woodall, our Chief Financial Officer will continue with the financial results for the quarter and full year concluding with 2019 guidance. This conference call is also being webcasted with today's news release and corresponding presentation available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Turning to slide 3.

Gary?","Gary Norcross","Thank you, Pete. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I\u2019m very pleased to announce our Q4 and full year earnings results. 2018 was a very good year for FIS, as we consistently and successfully executed on the strategic plan we discussed during our Investor Day last May. While impacted throughout the year by revenue mix, especially in our institutional and wholesale division, we exceeded profitability and earnings expectations and met revenue expectations for the full year. ","From a strategy delivery viewpoint, we exceeded our plans on datacenter consolidation, solution modernization and sales execution, which gives us strong confidence as we start 2019. This confidence allows us to continue building on our multi-year track record of delivering solid revenue growth, exceptional margin expansion and significant shareholder returns. ","For the year, total shareholder returns exceeded the S&P 500 by approximately 17%, driven by consolidated margin expansion of 280 basis points, adjusted earnings per share growth of 22.5% and a return of over 1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. These results underscore the resiliency of our business model and showcase our ability to create both short and long term value for our shareholders, while executing on our modernization and transformation strategies.","Over the last 3 years, we have strategically tuned our solution portfolio, resulting in divestitures of over 1 billion in annual revenue. During the same period, the market has rewarding our business performance with a $15 billion increase in our market capitalization, representing almost 80% growth over that period. Our financial services focused solutions portfolio combined with our large and loyal client base have enabled us to grow through dynamic market conditions.","We exited 2018 with very strong sales momentum and pipeline. Our full year sales results were the strongest in our company's history and as typical, Q4 was our strongest new sales quarter of the year. This sales success resulted in a significant increase in our contract backlog that Woody will discuss later in the call. This not only gives us confidence in 2019, but in our long term outlook.","Across the company, we continue to see more demand for software-as-a-service deployments, which will continue to increase our overall re-occurring revenue, predictability in earnings and free cash flow.","Moving to slide 5 for a review of the segment highlights. Our Integrated Financial Solutions segment drove top line organic revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter and 4% for the year. As previously discussed, our annual revenue growth for this segment is at the high end of its range and continues to accelerate year-over-year. Margins expanded by 90 basis points in the quarter and 60 basis points for the year.","Additionally, our mass enablement strategy is accelerating product penetration within our markets, using an innovative and faster deployment model. This transformative approach leverages our investments in data center and solution modernization and is a key growth initiative, generating more than 10 million of new revenue in 2018. We expect this deployment methodology to continue to accelerate growth, as we bring innovative solutions to market.","Based on the success in 2018 from a revenue and sales perspective and the deployment innovations I just discussed, we're expecting this segment to further accelerate its growth in 2019 by approximately 100 basis points. This organic growth is highly reoccurring in nature with strong industry leading margins and very high free cash flow conversion. The IFS segment had its largest sales quarter in Q4 with over 800 million in new contract value, resulting in a growth rate of more than 25% in new contract sales for the full year.","Several of these wins highlight not only the variable size of institutions we serve, but the complexity of solution the market is looking for FIS to deliver. For example, a top 25 US financial institution expanded its longstanding FIS relationship by entering into a new multi-year agreement to outsource the bank's Wealth Management Services. With this move, the bank is reducing its cost by utilizing FIS variable cost operating model and gaining robust new capabilities by migrating to the industry leading suite of FIS wealth solutions.","In another example, a $20 billion US community bank selected FIS as its core banking and digital provider in support of the bank's goal to modernize its environment, transform its branches and make better use of business intelligence and analytics across its enterprise. This bank had traditionally run a series of discrete products on premise in a highly customized manner. FIS' ability to leverage our next generation cloud base omnichannel, digital platform, Digital One with our extensive capabilities in scaled outsourcing of core processing and back office services was the key differentiator in winning this business against the competition.","As we discussed in May of last, year our historical investment over the last 3 years in data center and solution modernization is showing value in these large complex wins throughout the industry. Our IFS payments division also continues to deliver strong growth, supported by increased transaction volume and competitive sales wins. As an example of just one of the key in quarter wins for our payments division, the US arm of a top tier global financial institution of more than 100 billion signed a multi-year payment outsourcing agreement with FIS in support of its goals to grow revenue and implement a market leading payments-as-a-service solution, supporting both business to business and consumer to business transaction. Our industry leading solutions in this space were the key drivers for this win.","Our significant investments in modernization and technology are also paying dividends with key new wins in the large US bank market. We have discussed on many calls that we think the larger regionals will start to move towards modernization of their platforms and we believe our successes in 2018 are significant indicators that transformation is starting to take place. These transformations will occur not only with our next generation capabilities, but will be consumed through our industry leading cloud deployment on a subscription basis in most, if not all situations.","Turning to our Global Financial Solutions segment, the business recorded top line organic growth of nearly 4% for the quarter and 2% for the full year. Margins across this segment expanded by 400 and 470 basis points compared to the prior year quarter and year. While we are very pleased with this continued transformation, revenue growth is being impacted by the movement to outsourcing in the recent accounting change on license recognition and therefore creating a mix issue. ","However, the profit contribution of the revenue is of much higher quality. Because of our growing scale in this market, we are now seeing EBITDA margins approach 40% on an ongoing basis and will continue to expand in the future. This expansion was driven by continual improvements in the segment\u2019s SaaS revenue, data center consolidation and leverage across all our key business functions. Given our current level of margins, which have been improved by over 1400 basis points since 2015, the profit contribution being delivered from this segment has more than doubled.","Turning to our divisions within the GFS segment. Results in our institutional and wholesale division fell short of expectations due to the revenue mix and accounting change I highlighted earlier. As we have seen throughout the industry, our trading and brokerage business has been impacted by lower volumes and slower than anticipated sales. We believe our trading business will continue to be a headwind for this division, but will continue to be offset by the higher quality SaaS sales that are occurring in our buy side in compliance and regulatory businesses. ","Our growth in SaaS deployment sales was up 25% in this division, which also was significant growth of more than 20% in new logo competitive wins, where our industry leading I&W capabilities replace many significant competitors. Our banking division saw nice growth, fueled in part by the industry's need for a clear path towards a modern banking solution. For example, a large multinational bank has selected our cloud native next generation core banking platform to expand its presence in the US. In addition to core banking, this client will also take advantage of our digital one omnichannel platform that I referenced in the IFS segment. ","Our ability to get leverage from our overall development cycle is paying huge dividends for our ongoing margin as well as growth expansion. This new deal adds a premier client logo to the long list of clients who have relied on FIS to launch a digitally focused bank in support of their growth strategies. Our GFS payments business also had an exceptionally strong quarter and full year. Much of this growth was driven by strong payment transaction volumes in Latin America and competitive new sales wins. As previously announced, we have successfully closed our Brazilian joint venture and entered into a new 5-year commercial agreement with our former JV partner. ","We are very pleased to have closed on this transaction six months earlier than planned, providing us a faster start in getting a wider portfolio of our solutions into this expanding and attractive market. I was recently in India and met with several of the largest tier 1 institutions in the country and universally they are all looking for ways to modernize their core digital and payments infrastructure. Given our market presence and historical success in the country, we are well positioned to capture these transformations in the future.","In conclusion, our GFS segment, we remain confident and continued acceleration of revenue growth in 2019 compared to the prior year period and bullish on the ongoing business transformation that is occurring on SaaS deployment and continued market share gains.","Moving to slide 6, focusing next on some of our large scale corporate initiatives that our leadership team has remain focused on executing our strategy, which we outlined for you last May during our investor conference. In summary, we continued to transform our operating environment through our cloud and data center consolidation strategy. Currently, more than 55% of our North American distributed systems portfolio is running in our cloud environment, well ahead of the 50% target that we announced at the start of 2018. By year end, we expect this percentage to increase to over 65% on a global basis. ","Due to this success, we exited the year ahead of the 100 million in run rate savings that we shared with you in our last investor conference. We're continuing to fine tune our service management capacity on demand and fast provisioning so that our clients benefit from industry leading scale, uptime performance and resiliency in a fully secure FIS environment. We've begun to see early positive reaction to our new modern banking and payments platforms. ","These new solutions are enabling our clients to run and grow their businesses more effectively by connecting with their customers through more modern and meaningful experiences. In proof points that our investments are delivering differentiating value, our new cloud based Digital One platform has already grown to serve more than 10 million consumers in the US in 2018. Additionally, we on-boarded more than 50 clients to our unified payments platform in 2018 and expect that number to expand dramatically throughout 2019.","Finally, we have once again been named a Fortune most admired company and for the fourth year in a row, we set a top at Chartis RiskTech100 rankings. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, we strongly believe that scale and solution capability is the key to driving continued growth in meeting the demands of a very rapidly changing industry. As you know, inorganic growth opportunities have been and will continue to be a key component of our long term success. ","Our approach and strategy towards these opportunities has not changed. If it fits our overall strategy, drives accelerated growth for our company and is actionable, we will execute accordingly. I'd like to reaffirm that we are pleased with our full year 2018 results and the momentum we have created. We expect this positive momentum to continue into 2019 and beyond, as we continue to execute the transformation and modernization strategies discussed last May.","\\","Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter and full year. Woody?","Woody Woodall","Thanks, Gary. Turning to slide 8, in the fourth quarter, revenue increased 3.2% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to 864 million, a 5.3% increase compared to the prior year period. Fourth quarter revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 40 million due to divestitures. EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points to 39.9% and adjusted earnings per share grew 29% to $1.60 per share. For the year, revenue increased 2.8% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to 3.1 billion, a 5% increase compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margin expanded 280 basis points to 37.2% and adjusted earnings per share grew 22.5% to $5.23 per share. We are pleased with delivering on our full year consolidated guidance.","Moving to slide 9, as expected, in the fourth quarter, IFS revenue grew on an organic basis by 2.5%, while EBITDA grew 4.5% with 90 basis points of expansion. Margin expansion was driven by growth in our payments business that has high operating leverage. For the year, IFS revenue increased 3.9% on an organic basis. EBITDA increased 4.7% with margin expansion of 60 basis points to 44.6%. We are very pleased with IFS's full year performance, which was driven by balanced demand across all divisions for the year and continued robust sales. We expect this momentum to carry in to 2019, translating into accelerated revenue growth.","Turning to slide 10, banking and wealth grew 1.5% for the quarter. For the full year, this group grew a strong 4.3%, primarily driven by our wealth and retirement solutions. Payments had another robust quarter and grew 5.2%, as our network services continue to see sustained volume growth as well as growth in new solution offerings. For the full year, this business grew 3.3%. Corporate and digital was relatively flat for the quarter. Digital growth was offset by a difficult license comparable in our corporate liquidity solutions. For the full year, they grew 3.7%.","Turning to slide 11, in the fourth quarter, GFS revenue grew 3.7% organically, while EBITDA grew 9.1%. For the quarter, this represents 400 basis points of margin expansion to 42.8%. Although revenue grew slower than expected, EBITDA grew more than 2 times faster compared to revenue in the quarter, speaking to the increased operating leverage of the segment and a positive long term revenue mix trend.","For the year, revenue increased 2.1% organically. EBITDA grew 5.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting 470 basis points of margin expansion to 37.4%. We are pleased with the ongoing EBITDA margin profile in the segment, which continues to expand in line with our previous comments throughout the year.","Moving to slide 12, for the quarter, our institutional and wholesale business declined 2% and was flat for the year. Positive results in the quarter for our buy side solutions were offset by a few items. Trading volumes were down year-over-year and were the primary driver impacting growth for the quarter. Upfront license sales were less than expected, as we continue to see sales of long term reoccurring outsourcing agreements, outpacing upfront loss in sales, which impacts the quarterly revenue growth. Upfront license sales were down 15%, while recurring revenue sales were up 25% in the quarter. This trend will continue to improve the long term quality of the revenue stream.","Finally, as we closed out the year, the positive impact of 606 was less than we originally expected. This time last year, we outlined and expected one point tailwind for GFS for the full year related to 606 and the actual impact was closer to flat. We do not expect 606 to impact 2019 in a meaningful way. As Gary mentioned, although we\u2019re disappointed with the results for this group, we remain confident in the long term prospects of the business and the markets we address and have made organizational changes to improve the growth in this business. We anticipate I&W returning to low single digit growth in 2019.","Banking and payments grew 10.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by strong demand for our digital solutions in North America along with continued growth in our international payments businesses. The quarter also benefited from revenue right at the dissolution of the Brazil JV. Absent this one time revenue, this group still grew a healthy 8%. For the full year, the business grew 5%, in line with our expectations.","Moving to slide 13, our corporate and other segment revenue grew 8.3% for the quarter to 65 million with an EBITDA loss of 77 million. As previously discussed, we did not expect any ongoing revenue headwinds from this segment. Moving forward, we anticipate corporate expenses on a quarterly basis to be $70 million to $80 million. For the full year, corporate expense declined 9%.","We finished the year with a revenue backlog of 20.5 billion, an increase of 1 billion compared to the prior year, driven by the robust sales execution we have discussed throughout the year. The increase in our backlog gives us a high level of confidence to achieve our 2019 guidance.","Moving the slide 14, free cash flow was 551 million for the quarter, representing 25% of revenue and about 1.5 billion for the full year. For the quarter, cash flow comparisons were negatively impacted by higher than expected CapEx for our data center consolidation efforts, product investment, higher sales commissions and the previously discussed tax benefit in the prior year. Debt outstanding as of December 31st was 9 billion with an effective weighted average interest rate of 3.3%. Our effective tax rate for the year was 17.5%. The decrease in our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was driven by implementation of new corporate tax reform guidance implemented in the period. We anticipate a full year 2019 effective tax rate of approximately 19%.","During the fourth quarter, we returned 255 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.4 million shares for approximately $150 million and 105 million through dividend. For the full year, we returned 1.6 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 12 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion and 420 million through dividends. $2.7 billion remain on our existing share repurchase authorization. The weighted average diluted share count was 329 million for the quarter and 332 million for the year.","Going into 2019, our capital allocation principles remain consistent. We'll continue to invest in innovation and product development to better serve our clients and lead the market. We recently increased our quarterly dividend 9% to $0.35 per share and we continue to grow it in line with our free cash flow. Finally, we will assess value creating M&A opportunities and absent any actionable deals, we will continue to repurchase shares.","Turning to slide 15, before I provide 2019 guidance, I wanted to give a quick update on the Brazil JV unwind as well as the change of our non-GAAP EPS calculation. On January 4, we announced a successful unwinding of our joint venture in Brazil. We previously anticipated this transaction to close by the end of the second quarter 2019. Consistent with the transaction announcement in the fall, this transaction will result in $225 million headwind to 2019 reported revenue growth, which is accounted for in our 2018 organic revenue base.","In addition, we now expect approximately $0.08 earnings per share headwind in 2019, driven by the earlier than anticipated closing of the transaction. As Gary mentioned, we're very excited about the next chapter of our growth story in Brazil and the broader Latin American market. As you saw this morning in our earnings release, we have revised our reporting of adjusted earnings per share. We have historically excluded purchase accounting intangible amortization from our non-GAAP earnings. ","As part of a normal review of our public filings and discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission, they expressed an objection to our approach regarding adjusted EPS. After several lengthy discussions with the SEC, which included comparisons of our peers, analyst and investor expectations, we agreed on an approach with the SEC that will exclude all depreciation and amortization from our adjusted EPS. We will continue to provide detailed disclosures of the components of D&A and the related tax benefits should you choose to calculate under the old method.","We were allotted this quarter as a transition period to make this adjustment in our reporting. And our fourth quarter and full year results are available in both methods within the earnings release. Given this transition and to assist you with your models, we have also provided quarterly and full year reconciliation for 2018 and full year 2017. Going forward, we will continue to provide detailed data points to reconcile back to our prior method of calculating adjusted EPS within the footnotes, however, we will not speak to it in future earnings calls. Our guidance for 2019 and future results will follow the new method.","Turning the slide 16, this morning we reported an adjusted EPS of $5.23 per share. The prescribed change to exclude all D&A will increase adjusted EPS by $1.70 per share. Additionally, the impact of divested businesses, including the JV unwind is approximately $0.12, resulting in the 2018 EPS base of $6.81.","Turning to slide 17, due to in year divestitures and the JV dissolution, I wanted to give a transparent walk in our organic revenue base. As we called out on last quarter\u2019s call, we have successfully completed our divestiture program and are entering 2019 with a focused and high quality set of assets.","Turning to slide 18, for 2019, we expect organic revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. This represents continued revenue acceleration and is in line with the long term growth strategy outlined last year at our Investor Day. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 150 to 200 basis points, which exceeds our mid-term outlook; adjusted earnings per share of $7.35 to $7.55, representing growth of 8% to 11% compared to a baseline EPS of $6.81 and free cash flow, as a percentage of revenue, of approximately 20%, which represents greater than 10% growth in free cash flow.","Consistent with our historical practices, we have provided supplemental planning assumptions in the appendix material. I wanted to provide some additional color on the calendarization of our top line growth. As we\u2019ve discussed on our first quarter 2018 earnings call, GFS had a very strong license revenue, which created a difficult compare this upcoming quarter. Because of this, we expect first quarter consolidated organic revenue growth to be the low water mark of growth for the year. The second, third and fourth quarters should be at or above the midpoint of our guide. Finally, first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.54 to $1.58 per share.","Turning to slide 19, we continue to believe we have a strong and resilient business model and will continue to leverage our market leadership to produce accelerating topline growth, exceptional margin expansion and robust cash flow. These strengths allow us to invest for future growth and return value to our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of David Koning.","David Koning","Yeah. And I guess first of all, just thinking through, when we think of IFS and GFS, are they both -- you expect both to be pretty similar growth through \u201819. And I would assume in Q1, GFS would be lower than IFS, just simply because of some of the license timing stuff. Is that fair?","Gary Norcross","Yeah. Given our sales success throughout 2018, Dave, we actually see both segments accelerating growth rate going into 2019. But as Woody talked about, Q1 in GFS, given the grow over, will be the low water mark for the full year.","Woody Woodall","If you look at the color between the two segments Dave, we actually expect IFS to grow roughly 100 basis points and accelerate roughly 100 basis points, so even higher than the 4% we saw this year. When you look at our midpoint being a 4% growth, that would translate into GFS being closer to 3, really driven by this mix shift in the GFS segment.","David Koning","And I guess just my follow up, free cash flow, I know for much of the year, you talked about kind of 110% or 105% or something like that conversion on cash earnings. It looked like it finished the year, I think, we have 86% of cash earnings under the old method. Maybe, you can talk through that and it seems like guidance is well a little lower than what we had previously thought on cash flow.","Woody Woodall","Yeah. If you look at cash flow, there are really 2 items that were impacting 2018 for the full year. If you look at the hurricane Irma tax relief that we got last year, in terms of a benefit and had to pay this year plus the increase in sales commission payments, both were roughly $100 million apiece. If you add those two together, we were really close to 100% free cash flow conversion. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to invest -- we're investing roughly 7.5% of revenue back into data center consolidation and modernization and product, so that might be a little higher than we originally anticipated, but certainly we're pleased with 20% free cash flow conversion as a percentage of revenue.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of David Togut.","David Togut","I\u2019d like to ask about industry consolidation. Two impacts, first, your thoughts on competitive impact from Fiserv\u2019s announced acquisition of First data and then the second impact obviously is consolidation in the customer base, SunTrust, BB&A and you've said that isn't \u2013 they\u2019re not core clients, but how do you think about kind of modeling in the impact of customer consolidation into your guidance, both near and long term.","Gary Norcross","Well, the first on the competitive front, David, we talked a lot about this. We think that the market's going to continue to need to consolidate, scale is going to be a key contributor to be able to compete and grow and certainly historically FIS has participated in those inorganic activities. We will always look for opportunities that center around our three main verticals, whether it's retail banking, payments or institutional or wholesale, we want to take good care of the capital in the company and our shareholders that entrust into us and certainly as we look for opportunities that can accelerate our growth rate and help us grow our scale, that's going to be important.","When you look at industry consolidation across the various financial institutions, we actually modeled going into 2019 a very consistent level of industry consolidation. It's very hard to predict when these announcements are going to occur. It's very hard to predict what the impact could be, both positive and negative, depending on how the institutions come together, but at this point in time, in 2019, for modeling purposes, we model consistent over 2018 from a consolidation standpoint.","David Togut","And by consistent, you mean you've modeled in a specific headwind to revenue and EPS or?","Woody Woodall","Yes. Very similar to what we've done in the past between customer losses and compression roughly 150 basis points a year, Dave, just like we have in the past. We don't see any acceleration, if you will, of potential customer losses here. In fact, one of the comments on one of the bank consolidation calls was their need to continue to expand and invest in modernization and technology to compete in the future and we think that could be certainly a benefit for us on a go forward basis.","Gary Norcross","And as we highlighted throughout the call, David, I mean, you see a number of really large wins for us across 2018 and where large and stations are doing just that modernization investment. So to Woody\u2019s point, that should be a -- that could be a positive tailwind for us.","David Togut","Understood. Just a quick final question, the 2019 EPS guidance calls for 8% to 11% growth on an adjusted basis. That is somewhat below your 3-year target of 10% to 13% growth. Is that just the math of the new adjusted EPS reporting structure or is it mostly a slow start on I&W?","Woody Woodall","I think the biggest difference is a tax headwind in 2019 compared to \u201918, David. We landed with a lower tax rate in 2018 at 17.5%. We think 2019 is going to be roughly 19%. Actually, if you look at old method, new method, we guided 7.35 to 7.55. If I were guiding old method, I would have guided 5.60 to 5.80 with a midpoint of 5.70 and really the difference between that and current consensus estimates is the early closing of Brazil, which cost us about $0.08 versus our original expectation.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to the next line of Brett Huff.","Brett Huff","Can you talk a little bit about the revenue shift that you guys have been mentioning. I think this came up a couple of times, maybe one or two quarters earlier in \u201818. Why is this accelerating so much, is it a function of your kind of pushing your modernization by modularity? Is there some big change that the bigger banks you guys serve or may be the medium sized banks, they\u2019re choosing outsourcing more, what's the acceleration that's driving this long ref rec?","Gary Norcross","I think Brad, we\u2019re seeing it in the sales cycle. I think larger institutions are looking at their total cost of ownership, they're looking at their legacy technology debt that they have in place, we're running it on premise. Frankly, as they look at our more modern solutions and being able to consume that with the investments that we're delivering in our private cloud surrounded by our robust security measures, so they're seeing higher availability, lower total cost of ownership and as we've discussed, we just \u2013 we felt for a long time, the industry is going to start moving in that direction and for years, classic community banks, what we define as community banks were all outsourcing, but now, as you move up market, you see $20 billion institutions, $100 billion institutions now looking for ways to leverage our investment and scale around technology and modernization and that's just playing out in our sales efforts, including the I&W side, as I highlighted in the call, our sales on SaaS model deployments on I&W were up significantly year-over-year and that's just an indicator of the market looking for ways to lower their total cost of ownership and leverage our scale in investment.","Brett Huff","And then Woody, I think in your guidance, I believe you said that you expect CapEx to come in at 7.5%, did I hear that right?","Woody Woodall","That\u2019s 7.5% of revenue for CapEx in 2019, which is a continued acceleration off of 2018, really around this modernization, the innovation work that we have and the data center consolidation, which is driving some of the margin expansion.","Gary Norcross","As you can see, we're well ahead of where we thought we would be on data center consolidation and the return we're getting on that investment through not only cost saves, but just availability and market recognition has been very beneficial. So, we want to continue to lean in on that program and accelerate that for the remaining couple of years.","Brett Huff","Ex the data center, should we expect a higher level, I mean, is this now an industry where we just kind of have to spend a little more to keep ahead of the technology curve, even if we look ex the data centers? I mean usually I think it's been 5% to 6%, should we expect 6 to 7 even ex data centers going forward or how do we think about the reinvestment that you guys need to do?","Gary Norcross","We talked about that last May in our Investor update. As you think about it, the industry, we've been a leader in this industry for the last 50 years and as we think about where the future is, clearly, there is a tremendous amount of legacy technology that's going to have to be modernized for the future. It\u2019s going to have to be built with cloud deployment from the ground up and so we do see a hump here, where we're going to have to invest at a level, but as we talked about in May, we see that declining back to more normalized levels once we've moved our legacy technology in application to the future and the whole industry will have to go through this process. ","You're seeing it with every call, as Woody highlighted, when you look at the BB&T SunTrust combination, they highlighted the need to be able to invest in innovation and digital. That's just really a different way of saying needing to move their technology stack from historical positions to the future and so we'll see this run in the sevens as we're doing today. But we'll see the advantages of that and then once we get through this curve over the next couple of years, you'll see it return back to our normalized 5% to 6% as we discussed in May.","Operator","And the next question or comment will come from the line of Darrin Peller.","Darrin Peller","Look, we're getting a lot of questions still on just the outlook, just to make sure that where the confidence is coming from and the acceleration of over 100 basis points on top line. So maybe just give us a little more color on whether or not how much of that is already in what you've already signed in terms of new bookings that -- you had some pretty strong growth in the quarter. And then any more granularity you can give us on the subsegments, what kind of acceleration and for instance, the I&W category, that showed some weakness this quarter, where the payments business continuing to show some strength, anymore color would be great.","Woody Woodall","Yeah. I mean, I think most of the strength comes in the sales commentary we've been talking about and the buildup of the backlog, that 20.5 billion, a significant chunk of that comes through, as we show in our 10-K disclosures and our 10-Q disclosures each quarter. We anticipated that to grow and it did, along with the sales themselves. If you look at the components of growth by segment in 2019, I think across the three groups, IFS, all of those guys will accelerate over the 2018 growth rates. If you break it down between banking and payments and institutional and wholesale within GFS, let\u2019s call, GFS roughly a 3% growth for full year, you're going to see higher growth than that out of banking and payments, slightly lower growth than that out of institutional and wholesale for the full year again with some headwind in Q1 on GFS. But broadly, that 4% midpoint for the full year.","Gary Norcross","Yeah. That's right. Darrin, the sales success was very, very strong last year and to Woody\u2019s point, the highly reoccurring nature of our business going into \u201919, we don't have any more risk than what we would have in 2018, it's just good strong sales performance and now we've got onboard those sales and get the results of that and then continue to sell through the year.","Darrin Peller","Gary, just a quick follow up, I mean I know you are as briefly about the deal, M&A environment, but I guess we're just getting a lot of questions, so maybe a little more pointedly, what are your thoughts in terms of your need or not lack thereof to get something now, it\u2019s been a little while obviously. And if so, just remind us the areas that you think about as the core priorities for M&A for FIS in the next year or two?","Gary Norcross","Look Darrin, as we\u2019ve talked about consistently, inorganic activities will play a role in our strategy. You've seen its focus on pulling our portfolio, I would tell you that work's done. You've seen us focused on strengthening our balance sheet, I would tell you that work's done. You've seen our investment strategies and the results of that with margin expansion, so we feel great about the position the company's in, we feel great about our ability to compete in the industry today, as we currently sit. ","With that as a backdrop, we would be interested in pursuing something inorganically, if it fits our strategy, we want to find something that will definitely accelerate our growth rate. We also want to find something that fits within our financial services focus. We're interested in, as I think about the company, I think about three broad categories and I think about them on a global basis, so we think about retail banking, we think about payments and we think about institutional and wholesale and there's a number of opportunities within each of those areas that could make sense from a strategy viewpoint, of course, they would have to be actionable and have to make financial sense, but we do believe that the market will continue to consolidate, both on the provider side as well as on the financial institution side and financial services side. ","So -- and scale is going to continue to drive and be a differentiator, the need to invest to continue to modernize both the technology and application layers and to innovate around those, so that our customers can deal with various disruptors in the industry are going to be important and scale will contribute to that.","Operator","And the next question in queue will come from Chris Shutler.","Andrew Nicholas","This is actually Andrew Nicholas in for Chris. So we need to talk a little bit about the recent sales activity in the institutional and wholesale segment. I\u2019m mainly curious the recent market volatility impacted the quarter and the pipeline in that business and then also how much of the revenue in I&W is priced based on assets.","Gary Norcross","Yeah. We did see some impact in some of our trading platforms due to volatility, but I also highlighted last year we had a great year of new logo wins in the I&W business where our products continue to take share from a lot of competition in that space. So we\u2019re excited about some of the results that we've seen in that. Of course, our SaaS sales are way up as well. We got a number of different products, so pricing is never answer just on a simple unit price, but most of our products are tied to, from a pricing viewpoint, tied to some type of unit price and then hosting license fees wrapped around that I&W space.","Woody Woodall","As we've talked about in the past, the amount of revenue tied to asset size is very, very smell, the amount of revenue tied to trading and volumes is roughly 2.5% of consolidated revenue, so still in the big picture, a relatively small impact from a volatility perspective.","Andrew Nicholas","And then second, I was hoping you could walk through the different factors that would drive you to the high versus low end of your margin expansion guidance?","Woody Woodall","Yeah. I think continued efforts around data center consolidation, which is really one of the primary drivers on the outsized margin expansion versus what we talked about last year, our divestiture activity, which we've completed this year are driving roughly 30 basis points of margin expansion in 2019 and then continued efforts around managing our costs and deploying one to many model type revenues that continue to provide higher incremental margins. Those are the three primary components that help us drive that margin expansion and will help us move towards a higher end there.","Operator","And next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider.","Jim Schneider","I wondered if you can maybe talk a little bit more around the IFS acceleration, specifically which products are the ones that are picking up, maybe talk about which ancillary products as well as if you're seeing any kind of core wins in that acceleration number from 4 to 5 this year?","Gary Norcross","Yeah. As Woody mentioned and we tried to cover some of that in the prepared remarks, honestly, we\u2019ve seen good growth across all of the sub segments within IFS. So we've highlighted some really nice core banking wins in 2018 on actually an outsourced maces or in the SaaS deployment, we think that trend is going to continue. Our pipeline was good there as we bring new capabilities in market. We've seen some strengthening in our payments business throughout 2018 and going into 2019, we've seen some great results around mass enablement, around that customer base and ability to really innovatively deploy products faster into that market and that's going to expand. ","So -- and when you look at the digital footprint, we highlighted our new Digital One platform that we brought to market in 2018, saw a lot of opportunity for that in the GFS segment in 2018, which helped us drive some of the banking business there, but that's actually now deploying in our IFS market, so getting good reception on that. So we're really seeing our sales effort hitting on all cylinders, we tend to skew towards the larger side of community banking historically and we've highlighted a number of examples in the script that came through in the quarter.","Jim Schneider","And maybe as a quick follow up, relative to the BB&T SunTrust environment, I guess a different angle on it, which is, what are your clients saying about their competitive response if any to that merger, kept the next level down from the merged super regionals and can you maybe talk about where they might decide to invest more versus any places you think they might pull back a little bit?","Gary Norcross","I think it's early to see what the response is. We've got to see how that combination transpires. I would say in general, if you look at the large regionals or really large community institutions, we're seeing in our sales success throughout 2018 really starting to see a strong demand to modernize the platforms. A lot of those institutions have been dealing with the level of technology and application debt for years and they're looking for how do we modernize our platforms and lower total cost of ownership. We\u2019ve highlighted a couple of examples in the script, $100 billion institution moved to a much more robust payments as a service solution, leveraging all of FIS\u2019 capabilities and leveraging our cloud base deployments. ","We had another $20 billion institution that really is moving from a series of discrete solutions that they were leveraging in-house development resources to bring together and really taking advantage of the full solution suite of FIS. And those are just indicators that while people are looking to merge and grab scale, so they can have investment dollars to accelerate their enervation and change, all of them are still talking about the need to change. So do we think there will be further consolidation as Woody talked about, we don't believe it's going to accelerate over where it was in 2018, but it's very hard to predict.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","My question \u2013 first question was, you talked already about the cadence of revenues through the years improving as you go from 1Q to 4Q. Can you talk about the cadence of margin improvement, particularly given you're saying that you\u2019re quite far along on the data center consolidation side and solution modernization, so can you kind of talk about how we should think about how the cost side flows through?","Gary Norcross","Yeah. If you think about it, we\u2019ll continue to see incremental benefits of data center consolidation along the years, so that will help incrementally grow margins from Q1 through to Q4. The divestiture components will go in line with where the timeline is on the divestitures and sales, so you'll see that flowing relatively ratable over the year and then the first quarter will probably be a little lower in terms of margin expansion because of the heavy license component that we talked about this time last year and first quarter of \u201918, so that should give you some color on how we think about where the margins will flow, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","And then the second question is, broadly speaking, as you talk about year-over-year improvement in demand, it seems to me you've touched on a few points and I just like to confirm, there seems to be higher win rate perhaps, there seems to be broadly maybe more demand for the particular product set you\u2019re now bringing and you\u2019re also with mass enablement onboarding faster, am I understanding correctly that you\u2019re actually checking all these boxes?","Woody Woodall","Yeah. I think I would add one more. I think the trend towards outsourcing or SaaS deployment leveraging our investment around cloud, so our data center consolidation is really driving two things. One, it is driving cost reductions. We\u2019ve highlighted that, but it's really elevating our technology stack to much more modern architecture and deployment with much higher resiliency. And so all of those things are feeding into people wanting to leverage that investment that FIS has made and so therefore as we've talked in the past, as we move from on premise deployment to SaaS deployment, you're going to see a much higher revenue stream, larger contracts et cetera, but I think those three things are really driving the increase in growth rates that we\u2019ve talked about.","Gary Norcross","Yeah. If you think back a few years ago, we started increasing our investment in CapEx, that CapEx is not just hard assets for data center consolidation, but it's also around product and innovation and trying to bring those new solutions to market faster. I think all those things collectively are resonating with the client base and it's resonating in the actual sales closure rates.","Woody Woodall","Yeah. The point you made about mass enablement, we\u2019re very excited about it, obviously generated a relatively small amount in 2018, but that's accelerating dramatically going into \u201819 and really how do you -- one of the things -- a lot of the things our clients are asking for is how do you get product to market faster, how do you remove friction through that process and so we've spent a lot of money on innovating to be able to bring some of those solutions, not one at a time, but how do we deploy a new capability across 100, across 500, across 1000 customers and we think it's going to make a real impact, as we continue to innovate around that and bring more and more capability to market faster.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Understood. Is it safe to say that you guys are maybe in the middle innings, these kind of transitions tend to be multi-year in nature, can take 3 years, 4 years, are you in middle innings is fair?","Gary Norcross","I think that is fair. We highlighted data center consolidation, we just wrapped up the third year of data center consolidation and we're very pleased at where we are on the run rate cost takeout whereas I highlight in the script, we\u2019re ahead of where we originally thought. So, we still have another 2 to 3 years left globally on that. We've got 2 years in the domestic, so we're going to continue to push through that and we're going to continue to drive a total of more than 250 million of cost saves out of just that one exercise, but it's more important to understand where the end state's going to be at that point in time and at that point in time, when you look at resiliency, when you look at the level of cloud based computing, we're going to have in the industry, when you look at our security posture, we're going to have a great environment for our clients and our prospects to take advantage of it and then when you build the application modernization innovation that we're bringing in the market, we're excited about the future at FIS.","Woody Woodall","And these investments are starting to translate into accelerating revenue growth from 2% to 3% to 4%, we're feel really good about getting good return on that investment.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to the next question in queue, it comes from George Mihalos.","George Mihalos","So just wanted to ask on Brazil now that you're liberated from Bradesco. How have the sales opportunities been, just curious kind of how the commentary is with other potential clients and partners and then the $0.08 of dilution, just want to make sure I understand where that's coming from, is that because of the change in reporting or is there something else that's driving that dilution?","Gary Norcross","Well, first, we've got a great long term relationship with Bradesco. They just -- we've now got a 5-year commercial agreement with them, so they're still going to be great substantial client going forward, but you're right, George, it really does free up the ability now for us to bring more product, more capability into that market. Historically, the way the JV worked, we were somewhat encumbered because everything had to come through that joint venture and therefore a lot of customers weren't interested in giving the ownership structure. So it does now free us up to move new product and capability in market. ","Woody was just down there, I know, he met with a lot of the clients in market and a lot of the prospects. I would tell you, our sales team is very excited. We're also already moving some of our capabilities down there. So I think Brazil's going to be a very good market for us going forward.","Woody Woodall","If you're specifically asking on the $0.08 dilution, it's really around the timing, we\u2019d anticipated this thing to close roughly June 30th of this year versus January 1st. So instead of having that that revenue and EBITDA roll up to the consolidated for six more months, which has got done early.","George Mihalos","And just a quick follow up Woody for purposes of calculating EPS for \u201919, more in line with how you've done it in the past, can you break out for us what your expectation is for core D&A and then intangible amortization?","Woody Woodall","Yeah. I think if you think about it, we've got disclosures in there that give you one for one. We haven't given D&A disclosures for full year yet, but you could think about roughly $1.75 of difference between the 735 to 755 versus an old method of 560 to 580.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey.","Andrew Jeffrey","You've been talking very consistently for the past year about process improvement, product delivery improvement, which I take to mean time to market and your solutions like SaaS. I just wonder if you think over a multi-year period, how do you quantify the ability to kind of bend your growth curve. I mean \u201819, IFS did a little better, maybe GFS has more trading volume exposure, but on a compound basis, is there a point where some of these investments really start to improve the sustainability of your growth, the cycle notwithstanding.","Gary Norcross","Yeah. And obviously we think so Andrew and we're seeing that in our sales cycle, we're seeing sales accelerate year-over-year, we're seeing growth rates accelerate year-over-year, we're seeing margins accelerate year-over-year and all of that\u2019s about our consistent strategy around modernization, both technology and the application layer and you're right, I mean, the industry is looking for more flexibility, they're looking for more speed, they're looking for higher availability and you're not going to get that through the historical technology stacks and obviously it's a heavy lift that all providers will need to go through. We're just moving into our fourth year of that and so we do feel good that you'll continue to see our growth rates trend up. And given the reoccurring nature of our revenue, we will continue to be very predictable and will lead the industry with regards to margin as well. So, we're very confident in investments, we've been very consistent on the strategy and we think the long term outcome for the company is going to be a much stronger growth rate, as we deploy this.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And if you could, maybe opine a little bit on geo mix. I mean a lot of the increased tech spend as you cited in the SunTrust BB&T deal seems to be driven by US imperatives, what about Europe and rest of the world, where do you think we are in terms of demand for more digitized solutions and perhaps what might change the growth parameters outside of the US?","Gary Norcross","Yeah. We've been fairly consistent. We saw Europe return slower than what -- than some of our other geos. But we had a really good year in Europe with regards to sales demand and we have a good pipeline going into \u201819 on Europe. I mean, one of the things that we're doing and I referenced in the script, not only are we making all this investment in technology, we're getting better leverage across the two segments. So we're building out an omni-channel digital -- next generation digital platform called Digital One, great success with that in the US in 2018 in the GFS market, you're seeing us deploy that very rapidly in the IFS market. ","You're going to also see us push that into other geos around the world, so we're getting more leverage out of our investment as well across the various segments. We're doing the same thing with regard to our data center consolidation and our technology stack, as we move more of our compute into the cloud, both segments are able to take advantage of that with industry leading availability and cost. So all of these things, we think, will be able to continue to expand in the various geos we\u2019re in. We highlighted some opportunities we have in Brazil, we still see good opportunities in Europe, especially in the UK and certain Western European countries and then in Asia, we continue to have good solid growth in Asia and we think all of that will continue.","Operator","And our last question on today\u2019s call this morning will come from Ramsey El-Assal.","Ramsey El-Assal","I wanted to ask, kind of following up on Ashwin's question a bit, you called out a really strong sales backlog and obviously your solutions are resonating in the marketplace, but is there a IT bank, IT spending sort of overlay here, it really feels like bank\u2019s wallets are sort of opening up in a nice way, can you comment a little bit on the broader environment, irrespective of the strength of your solutions?","Gary Norcross","Yeah. Ramsey, I do think we're seeing that. I think the recovery has been slow and I think that financial institutions broadly are realizing that they are now having to open up their span and actually start spending money on next generation technologies and we're seeing the results of that in our sales cycle. They really are looking for how to achieve a higher level of availability and risk posture, you're not going to do that unless you really embrace some of these new cloud technologies, they're really looking for what are built digitally native from the ground up, and how do we drive more open API framework, so we can build around the edges and all of those things FIS have been investing in very heavily, whether it's Code Connect, which we launched last year, which we\u2019re seeing great adoption, which is truly a new fully open API framework, whether it's some of our next generation components that we're now bringing to market. ","We highlighted a large bank that's entering the US with the digital institution that's going to take our cloud native core banking solutions surrounded by Digital One or our omni-channel digital platform. Also, as you go over into the I&W space, we're seeing a lot of demand and highlighted that with our new logo sales. That's indications of our clients now looking to move from their historically in-house developed products or even third-party products that they customized and cobbled together moving to the future. So yeah, I do think that IT spend is opening up in the market and we're seeing in our sales cycle FIS be the beneficiary of that.","Ramsey El-Assal","I wanted -- a quick follow up here. I wanted to ask about your margin \u2013 your inherent operating leverage in the business. I mean the full year margin guidance obviously came above -- came in above your 3 year range and then there's quite a bit of moving parts in terms of divestitures and mix and other factors, but when you strip away some of the non-recurring contributors like data center consolidation, expense efficiency, has your underlying operating leverage kind of improved relative to when you last gave that sort of long term guidance, just due to mix and divestitures and other factors? I mean, could we be looking at margin outperformance kind of in the out years relative to that guide or really what's driving our performance sort of non-recurring factors at this point?","Woody Woodall","Yeah. I think the quality of the assets at this point is better than it was when we\u2019ve talked about things in May last year. So to your point, I think you could see us driving midpoint or higher on that margin, even in the out years once we get past data center consolidation. So yeah, I think it is an improved cost efficiency and business mix that we have that\u2019s an ongoing benefit.","Gary Norcross","Thank you for joining us today and for your ongoing interest in FIS. We\u2019re pleased to deliver another year of strong revenue, profitability performance and earnings growth. We have a robust pipeline heading into 2019 with positive sales momentum. Combined with our business model and consistent execution of our strategy, we're confident that we are paving the way for a successful 2019 and beyond. I'd like to thank our loyal clients who depend on and trust us to keep their businesses running and growing every day and I\u2019d like to thank our leaders and employees for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients. It's because of both that FIS continues to empower the financial world. Thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you.

","With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Gary to discuss first quarter's results. Gary?","Gary Norcross","Thank you, Pete. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I am very pleased to announce that FIS' growth story continues. We delivered exceptionally strong results to start the year, exceeding our revenue, earnings and profitability expectations for the first quarter.","Turning to Slide 6. Our consolidated revenue growth of more than 5% was driven by a record year of sales in 2018 and continued strong sales and volumes throughout Q1. Our margins expanded significantly as a result of continued execution of our data center consolidation, operating growth and the positive impact of noncore divestitures. And we also announced our transformative deal to acquire Worldpay, which further drives growth in attractive faster-growing markets.","Clients' spending demand for our portfolio remains especially strong, particularly for our new and modernized solutions. These factors drove another solid quarter for FIS. We saw very strong growth in new sales, which increased more than 30% on a total contract value compared to the prior year period. These factors are accelerating the overall growth and quality of our pipeline and we remain on track to exceed our sales plan for the year. ","These early results, combined with our robust backlog, create very positive momentum and gives us solid confidence in achieving our full year expectations. Given this strong start, we raised our revenue guidance for the year.","Turning to Slide 7. FIS remains on the forefront of leadership by investing over 7% of the total revenue into modernizing our solutions and infrastructure to advance our clients' future. We have capitalized on our leadership position, bringing to market digitally-driven, open and cloud-based solutions that enable our clients to more efficiently run their operations, connect with their customers and grow their businesses. ","Industry analyst group, IDC, recently named FIS as a North American leader in omnichannel and digital banking solutions in 2 industry-wide rankings, underscoring the impact of these innovation-focused investments. Additionally, our API gateway Code Connect was also named as the most advanced API strategy among U.S. core banking providers by industry analyst, Aite Group. This recognition is proof of the solid progress towards executing on our strategy to deliver the most modern solutions in the industry, accelerate our data center consolidation and cloud strategy, and continually drive increased efficiency within our organization.","Turning to Slide 8. Additionally, to lead the future of finance and commerce, we are also very pleased with our recent strategic announcement to acquire Worldpay. As we discussed with you last month, this transaction is a continuation of our historically successful M&A strategy to accelerate growth, while continuing to optimize margins and leverage synergies through effective integration. This combination will provide significant revenue synergy opportunities of $500 million over three years. ","As a reminder, the new revenue opportunities for the combined organization include expanded global offerings for merchants with innovative e-commerce solutions; deeper and broader solutions for financial institutions, such as fraud tools, payment processing and a global merchant referral network; and enhanced and innovative payment solutions creating a faster payments community for high-volume retail and high-value commercial payments. ","These are just a few of immediate opportunities to drive new revenue streams which will accelerate our growth profile and organic growth trajectory. On day 1 as a combined company, we will have over $12 billion of revenue, growing organically approximately 6%. I am pleased to share that we have received early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period from the Department of Justice on the Worldpay transaction. This early termination and progress in our other regulatory filings gives us strong confidence in our ability to close this transaction in Q3 of this year. ","We have begun planning to meet our postclosing synergy goals. Culturally, our 2 organizations are well aligned and we are making good early progress in defining our go-forward organizational structure. Until closing, we will continue to operate as separate companies, and we will keep you informed as we move towards close.","Turning to Slide 9 for key themes. Focusing now on our segments. Our Integrated Financial Solutions segment delivered exceptional organic revenue growth of 7% and margin expansion of 160 basis points. Following strong growth results in Q4, revenue growth for this segment continues to exceed expectations as we'll accelerate year-over-year. This outstanding growth was underpinned by onboarding of new clients resulting from the strong sales throughout 2018. ","We also saw increased transaction and processing volumes as our clients continue to perform very well. Our multiyear investments in digital innovation continue to be a strong opportunity driver for us as clients of all sizes are looking to more meaningfully engage with customers and build new revenue streams for digital channels. ","For example, a national cooperative bank with more than $125 billion in assets selected our Digital One solution to bring more personalized, consistent and efficient digital banking capabilities to its small business customers in the U.S. ","In addition, a $20 billion U.S. community institution, who is upgrading to our modern FIS core platform, will leverage Digital One to enable omnichannel sales and service capabilities within its branches and self-service digital channels. This multiyear agreement is a key success factor in the bank strategy to transform and modernize its banking environment and services. ","Our IFS payments division also drove very strong growth again this quarter. This growth was underpinned by the combination of new client logos, coupled with strong transaction and processing volumes. We are also seeing exceptionally strong demand in adoption for our loyalty solutions. For example, we are successfully expanding our loyalty-as-a-currency offering into new consumer-based markets, including retail and restaurants. ","As noted last quarter, our innovative mass enablement strategy is bringing new capabilities to our clients through our one-to-many deployment model. Our robust Q1 results and strong pipeline give us confidence this will continue to be a strong growth driver for IFS.","In summary, the spend environment and our IFS segment remains healthy. We are successfully capitalizing on new opportunities which are expanding and strengthening our already robust business. ","Our Global Financial Solutions segment results in Q1 exceeded plan due to very strong sales, delivering organic revenue growth of more than 2% and margin expansion of nearly 300 basis points. These sales results will translate to accelerated reoccurring revenue growth for the remainder of the year and into 2020. Revenue growth for our GFS banking and payments division grew almost 10% organically. Much of this growth was driven by increased transaction and processing volumes from new logos and expanded relationships with current clients. For example, a European subsidiary of a global financial services powerhouse expanded its relationship with us by selecting FIS as its multiyear payment processing and loan origination partner to support its geographic expansion. ","We also expanded our long-term relationship with a global card brand, accelerating our ability to support cross-border business-to-business payments. These wins underscore our ability to leverage our broad banking and payments portfolio with local market expertise to solve market-specific challenges. Our investments in risk and compliance solutions continue to drive new meaningful revenue opportunities. We are seeing good demand to help organizations more easily comply with the new consolidated audit trail industry requirement to track orders throughout their life cycle for reporting of U.S. equities and options. As a result of that demand, we expanded our relationship with three large global financial services providers during the quarter by entering into new agreements for our Prodigit solution. ","We are very pleased with our pipeline strength and growth trajectory of our GFS business. Like the IFS environment, investment spend within the GFS markets remains healthy. We are confident in our ability to turn opportunities into closed wins at an accelerated pace. We recently hosted more than 3,000 attendees at the first of our 3 large product conferences. The drive to modernize, realize efficiency gains and grow revenue were prevalent themes for many clients. This venue provided the platform for our clients to learn more about the solutions that are designed to help them achieve these objectives using modern technologies and capabilities. ","Based on this transformation to modern technologies, we announced we are lowering our service-level agreements for business recovery times to less than 15 minutes for our digital applications in North America, driving significant benefit to thousands of our clients. Where most providers are committing to hours not minutes, we believe this is a bold offer and first of its kind in the industry, but not the last of its kind from FIS. Feedback from our clients throughout the event was overwhelmingly positive and early results of the conference show strong continued demand.","Turning to Slide 10. This feedback, coupled with our strong first quarter results and robust pipeline, underscores our confidence in our strategy and in our investment decisions. It also gives us clear line of sight into our ability to deliver our 2019 goals and beyond, which are to innovate for long-term growth, drive strong sales with competitively differentiated solutions and build on our global scale. ","We remain very confident in the value we are delivering for our clients and believe that will continue to translate into strong returns for our shareholders.","Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter and full year. Woody?","James Woodall","Thanks, Gary. Turning to Slide 12. In the first quarter, revenue increased 5.1% on an organic basis and EBITDA increased 3.4% compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 35.4%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 9.3% to $1.64 per share. This quarter was a strong start to the year and exceeded our expectations for top line growth, margin expansion and earnings.","Moving to Slide 13. IFS revenue increased 7.3% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew 10.4% with 160 basis points of margin expansion. As Gary mentioned, the strong sales execution we have highlighted the last few quarters is resulting in accelerated revenue growth.","Turning to Slide 14. Banking and wealth grew 7.2% for the quarter. Growth was driven primarily by another strong quarter for our wealth management business. Payments continues to see strong growth with 9.7% in the quarter. This was driven primarily by increased transaction processing volumes. Additionally, our loyalty-as-a-currency solution continues to see strong adoption and grew nearly 30% year-over-year. Corporate and digital grew 4% in the quarter, with new sales wins for our small business and integrated payable solutions.","Turning to Slide 15. GFS revenue grew 2.4% organically, while EBITDA grew 1.4% compared to the prior year period. For the quarter, this represents 290 basis points of margin expansion to 35.8%. Moving to Slide 16. The institutional and wholesale group declined 3%, driven by a previously mentioned difficult license comparable. These results were better than expectations and sales were strong in the quarter with the team exceeding their plan. Recurring revenue sales increased about 40%, outpacing nonrecurring deals, and the teams continue to execute well. We anticipate this group to turn positive next quarter with continuing momentum for the remainder of the year. Banking and payments grew 9.6% for the quarter. These results were driven primarily by license revenue in Brazil and continuing strong demand for our digital solutions in our large financial institution market.","Moving to Slide 17. Our Corporate and Other segment grew 4.1% organically with an EBITDA loss of $79 million. Corporate expenses for the quarter exceeded our plan by approximately $10 million due to higher accruals related to incentive compensation driven by our operating results and health care benefits.","Moving to Slide 18. Free cash flow was about $250 million for the quarter, a 10% increase over the prior year period. Debt outstanding as of March 31 was $9.2 billion with an effective weighted average interest rate of 3.3%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%, in line with the expectations for the quarter and full year. ","We returned over $500 million to shareholders in the first quarter through the repurchase of 3.9 million shares for approximately $400 million and $113 million in dividends. As a reminder, we have suspended our share repurchase program in conjunction with the Worldpay transaction.","Turning to Slide 19. I'd like to add some color regarding the synergy estimates we communicated in our recent Worldpay announcement. In the first 12 to 18 months post close, we expect to drive around $100 million of revenue synergies. These opportunities will leverage complementary solutions that are in the market today with very little limited sales effort generally required. ","Over an 18- to 36-month period, we plan to deliver on the remaining $400 million of revenue synergies. Items in these category are also in market today, but we will have to have an interaction with the client to discuss the value proposition, convert a portfolio or complete a sale. Of the $400 million expense synergies identified during due diligence, we expect approximately $200 million to come from operational efficiencies, including vendor and facilities rationalization; another $100 million should come from technology savings, primarily driven by incremental data center consolidation and related costs over and above what we have committed to on a stand-alone basis; and finally, we anticipate about $100 million to be achieved through functional corporate alignment. ","As we shared on the morning announcement, both companies have a very strong track record on delivering and exceeding synergies. As Gary mentioned, we now expect the transaction to close in Q3. We are looking at a potential debt issuance as early as May. We'll be looking to both the European and U.S. debt capital markets as we prepare to finance the transaction.","Turning to Slide 20. Today, we are increasing the low end of our revenue guidance to 4%. Last year, we began highlighting the strong market demand for our solutions and the investments we have been making in modernization and innovation. These efforts and investments have been translating into increased sales and are now translating into accelerating revenue growth. We are reiterating our adjusted earnings per share guidance. Our strong operating performance for the quarter and expectations for continued strength for the remainder of the year is being offset by the suspension of our share repurchase program.","Turning to Slide 21. This was a very successful start to the year for FIS. In addition to announcing a transformational M&A deal, our teams remain highly focused on delivering for our clients and driving operating results. We will continue to leverage our market leadership to produce accelerating top line growth, exceptional margin expansion and robust cash flow. These strengths allow us to invest for future growth and return value to shareholders. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI.","David Togut","And good to see the acceleration in organic revenue growth.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, David.","David Togut","This looks to be your strongest organic revenue growth for FIS as a whole since the fourth quarter of '16; and for IFS, the highest growth since the second quarter of '16. So my question really is the sustainability of this higher organic revenue growth rate. Clearly, you're lifting the guide for the year. But when you look at the underlying drivers: banking, payments, do you have conviction that they can remain this strong for the next year or two?","Gary Norcross","Yes. I think, David, we've been indicating that our sales are continuing to ramp up. You see this quarter, once again, 30% growth year-over-year on total contract value. So the sales engines are working very well. The market demand seems to be high for the products and services that we've been investing in over the last several years. And we think, as you know, it's a long sales cycle and then it's a long onboarding cycle. But we do think that projection to the future, very nice, strong, continued organic growth for FIS and for our existing businesses. So we feel good about where we are. We've had a great year last year in sales across multiple quarters, and that's led into Q1 as well. We've been signaling that on every call.","James Woodall","Yes, David. If you think about us coming out of the first quarter and raising revenue guidance, typically, a little more conservative as one quarter doesn't normally make a year, so this should give you some color into the confidence level of our view on revenue for the year and the continued acceleration.","David Togut","Understood. And then what feedback have you received from your regional bank customers with respect to their demand for cross-selling of Worldpay's merchant-acquiring services into their core corporate customer base?","Gary Norcross","The response from our client base has been outstanding on the Worldpay combination. It was -- it's clear they see it as very complementary to FIS. They see the opportunity for us to innovate and extend and help them address unique ways to address the ever-changing payments landscape. Obviously, as we move forward to close, we'll be putting our -- getting our sales teams together in going to market as a combined company. But I would tell you, the early feedback from all of our clients has been enormously supportive. They see it as a very strategic combination. They see it as a great company and so they're excited about what this is going to -- how is this going help them compete in the future.","David Togut","Congrats again on the strong results.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird.","David Koning","Guys, great job.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, Dave.","David Koning","Yes. And I guess, first of all, a little bit similar to David's question to just on the sustainability, was there anything in Q1 -- in GFS specifically, you called out the Brazil license that, I don't know, maybe that was unsustainable. But the I&W revenue actually gets better the rest of the year. So just when we think about maybe what was in there that might not be sustainable? And then as we think about the rest of the year, is this more a 4% to 5% grower the rest of the year?","James Woodall","Yes. I think a couple of things. We had a couple of items that came in earlier in the year than we anticipated. Those couple of items helped to consolidate growth by about a point for the quarter. So if you adjust that amount, it'd be about a 4% grower. Certainly, we're excited to get those closed out and locked down for the year, so we're not having to worry about them for the rest of the year. But you will certainly see GFS grow and accelerate their growth throughout the remainder of the year as we talk about comps getting easier. So we feel good about it. We feel good about raising the bottom end of the guidance and we want to continue to execute over the course of the year.","Gary Norcross","Yes. The sales team really did a great job in GFS this past quarter. When you look historically, we always have more in the forecast than what we expect that -- because obviously there's some always some slippage of transactions that incur between quarters. But really, the sales team stayed very focused and really closed pretty much everything that was scheduled to close in Q1 and it resulted in exceeding the plan and our expectations for the quarter. So they did a really good job as well, which, to Woody's point, gives us further confidence as we think about going into the remainder of the year with our revenue targets raised.","David Koning","Okay. Great. And a second question, I guess it's kind of a 2-part question. But sometimes, you give quarterly EPS just to give us a sense. So anything on that? And then also, did Brazil -- just the sales now that you've broken up the JV, anything interesting percolating there?","James Woodall","I'll touch base on the EPS. And really, the market consensus estimates for Q2 are very close to our expectations right now, I'll say that. So I think the models are in pretty good shape, and I'll let Gary kind of touch base on the sales in Brazil.","Gary Norcross","Yes. No, I think we continue to have good traction in Brazil. We got some good conversations. It's early. We're still sorting out the Brazil JV as we get that separated, there's some transition agreements that we're working on. But we're still bullish on the opportunities in Brazil. And with the Worldpay combination, we think that'll just further accelerate. So there'll be more coming on than that, Dave, but Brazil is a great market for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Nice job, guys. Let me just start off with -- when we look at this quarter's growth and then we go back to the pro forma targets you guys gave for the deal, you talked about revenue growth being 6% plus and then going all the way up to 8% plus as the year has progressed. Was this kind of acceleration what gave you so much confidence? Because bridging -- I think investors were still having some questions on bridging up to the 8% to 9%. So are you -- did you see this the strong FIS stand-alone growth? Was that a factor in that higher 8% to 9% outlook for you guys?","James Woodall","Absolutely, Darrin. Probably is the missing piece of -- if you add models together as to what Worldpay's expectations were, what our expectations were and the timing around that, you probably had people that were missing 50 to 100 basis points of growth probably. That's primarily the reason for that delta. We're seeing accelerated growth on our side of the business.","Darrin Peller","All right. So that sounds like you do see it being relatively sustainable, which is great to hear. And then -- and just a quick question on the deal itself, the timing of the deal. It's good to see you guys are now shoring up the third quarter timing. I guess summer is what we should be banking now. And you mentioned a little more color on the revenue synergies I mean. But does it -- it sounds like you have more conviction in the timing and the types of synergies. Just can you give us a little more detail around the conversations in terms of what's giving you more context and color on the timing of the $100 million in year 1, and then perhaps any other conversations with clients over some opportunities even above and beyond the $500 million?","Gary Norcross","Well, yes, Darrin. I mean as we go through the regulatory approval process and the early release is an important milestone for us. We've able to -- we've been able now to start getting some of our groups together and really start building a bottoms-up plan, which gives us more confidence in, to Woody's point, shoring up some of the synergy timings and how they're going to flow. As you know, we've -- we take these combinations very seriously. Like a lot of people, we have a playbook that we like to implement and really work through the plans as we get the teams together. ","The cultural alignment has been very strong between the two companies, which is exciting to see. We both think about the markets in very similar ways. We think about clients and go to market in very similar ways. So it will just tell you all that collaboration and working together has allowed us to get more confidence around the synergy timings. And then we look forward, to your point, of closing in Q3 and then running as a combined company because we think there's just a lot of opportunities between our two companies when we put them together.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens.","Brett Huff","Nice quarter.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, Brett.","James Woodall","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff","First question is a little bit -- asked about this already. Some of the questions we've been getting from investors are can you give us a little more detail on how we get to the revenue synergies. You articulated that revenue acceleration for FIS standalone is part of that and you gave us a little bit more on timing, kind of breaking things up into the end market and easier to close in end market, but a little harder to close. Can you give us more detail on those last 2 buckets? Just give us examples of the some end market stuff and kind of the differences in those 2 buckets.","Gary Norcross","Yes. Well, I mean, I think Woody tried to cover some of that, Brett, in his prepared remarks. And as you know, we're operating as 2 separate companies today, so there's only so much that we can do with regards to revenue and really talking about how we'd go to market and some of those things. But we -- as we do talk across the operating units and we look across those opportunities, I think we're getting more and more comfortable that there are just some real opportunities where assets exist on either side of the company. So a Worldpay capability that we think could have strong applicability to push through, perhaps even through our mass enablement strategy, to the FIS client base and then vice versa. So those kind of fall in the easy bucket. ","We've pointed to some of the things around debit transaction volumes and how we think about perhaps routing those and some benefits. We talked about things around card personalization and we think there's some interesting opportunities there. Just Worldpay's ability to optimize our merchant portfolio. So as you think about it, there's just a number of things that either company has extensive capabilities in that we believe the broader client relationship and our ability to place those solutions across those broader products will help accelerate revenue for us in the short term. ","Then there's also a number of medium examples that we talked about and Woody highlighted in the script, where it will take some sales engagement, it will take some client interaction for people to really understand the value proposition. If you look at something as simple as loyalty as a currency, that's really a strong growth business for us and we don't have a lot of reach. I mean from a de novo launch, that now has a run rate of well over $30 million a year, which is not huge. But as you think about now deploying that across our more than 1 million merchants potential, we think there's a lot of opportunity there. And we're seeing a lot of adoption even with our limited exposure to merchants. ","So we think there's just opportunities like that as the company's combine that we're very confident there'll be a real revenue synergies. And this is not where we're going to go on building a capability on either side, these capabilities exist, it's just really about the extension in the global reach that's going to drive the acceleration. So all of those things just give us confidence as we look at where the growth is. Of course, we'll keep highlighting our accelerated growth, and we highlighted that all throughout last year. Quarter-on-quarter just very, very strong sales for us and execution. Q1 was another really strong sales quarter for both IFS and GFS. And so you'll continue to see the FIS base business accelerate. So all those give us confidence.","Brett Huff","Great. That's helpful. And then second question is interesting you highlighted your change to the SLAs, give us a little bit of background on that. I know that your data center strategy has been important both to the mass enablement, Digital One and things like that as even bigger banks start to consolidate more on your servers. What's the industry standard? Is that a shot across the bow against other competitors out there? Kind us give us the magnitude of how important that might be for you.","Gary Norcross","I think it really is just -- I wouldn't say it's a shot across the bow, that's not the intention. What I would tell you is what we're trying to show is, look, we're investing massive amounts of capital dollars and expense into data center consolidation on modern architectures and modern technology. And we've highlighted those stats, in last year over 50% of our compute was in the cloud. We focused on digital. We think it's important for our clients to see the benefit from that. So when you're traditionally looking on how this industry is built up, SLAs on disaster recovery or business recovery services are based on hours. I mean some instances they can be 24 or even 48 hours in some instances, and those are fairly standard across the industry. And for us, that's just not where the industry is today. The industries move very rapidly. ","And so what we're showing to our customers is we're -- we understand where the industry is today, we understand where the exception -- where the standards are today and we're going to move there and lead in that direction. So I think everybody is going to have to offer minutes with regards to recovery in the future. And being able to do that it really does just show not only are the benefits of cost we're getting because we're getting some nice run rate cost reductions out of consolidation, but we're getting some really nice step functions and availability that you just can't get in traditional deployments and traditional architectures. And so now establishing a timeline at 15 minutes, less than 15 minutes, we think is a substantial step. Honestly, that's going to accelerate from there. It's going to get less from there over time. ","And so we just think it's an important testament of where our modernization story is. And our clients were very excited about that shock that we would be willing to pass that on to whom. But we think it just shows an important commitment to the industry and where we're going.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Obviously, on the revenue side, I wanted to ask you, Gary, about maybe just the spending environment in relation to other good or great quarters you've seen in the past. How would this rank in in your mind? And I know I've asked you this a ton before, I'll ask it again. Secular versus cyclical, how much of this do you think is sort of secular momentum given all this digital momentum and everything else in the market versus some macro issues maybe?","Gary Norcross","Yes. No, look, I think it was a great quarter. I mean, honestly, it was a very clean quarter for us. The sales teams across the company executed exceptionally well. Just a lot of closings and demand coming out of our conference. We've got just honestly record pipelines coming out of our conference for follow-up. So I think the industry is -- so we're starting to see an increase in demand across where we've invested historically, which I think is great. So from your secular to cyclical, I think the industry strengthening. I think a lot of our larger clients, to be honest, that held on as long as they can, in some instances they probably have held on to their technologies too long. ","And we're just seeing a lot of demand and really large financial institutions that are starting to look for omnichannel digital deployment to really modernize their entire touch points with our customers. They're looking for ways to modernize their back office with state-of-the-art cloud computing and availability. And so it gives me real confidence that this is going to continue to benefit FIS. So I feel, as I said, really good about the quarter, really good about 2019 and really good about what we're seeing in our pipeline of growth and our demand for our solutions and services across the board.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","So let me start with GFS. And I guess the clarification is on the institutional wholesale business. You've said in the past an impact from the move to outsourcing and the accounting change on license recognitions were creating a mix issue. It sounded like you were incrementally more positive on that subsegment. Is that more a comp issue? Or are you actually seeing demand pick up in spite of those other factors you've mentioned before?","James Woodall","Yes. First quarter specifically was more of a comp issue. Some of the other items we talked about in the last year in terms of moving from license to outsourcing are still going. Our recurring revenue sales were up 40% and that outpaced our nonrecurring sales, but we had a good nonrecurring sales quarter as well. But we do anticipate accelerating growth over the course of the year in I&W. And then that would be able to be in a more sustained model as those recurring sales smooth out some of the lumps that we've seen in the past there.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And then I wanted to ask if I could about the couple of products that you guys have highlighted for a few quarters now as being sort of hot. So loyalty as a service, mass enablement, those two things. Is it actually possible to maybe size those things? Because from my understanding, both of those are obviously important components on a go-forward basis as we think about synergies with Worldpay as well. So getting a good baseline and a little bit more granularity would really help us.","James Woodall","I'll give you some color on loyalty as a currency. That solution we anticipate to be just under $50 million for the full year 2019. It's growing at a rapid pace, about a 30% growth in this particular quarter. Mass enablement, a little more difficult due to granularity because it runs across a number of different areas and products, but just supplementally helps them in terms of their growth rates. But you should be seeing it flowing through all the subsegments within the IFS group primarily as when more of the mass enablement's done right now.","Gary Norcross","Yes. Mass enablement is really not a product, it's more of a deployment methodology. Our ability to deliver solutions faster in market which has been a clear demand for our clients, how do they compete with not only the large money centers institutions, how do they compete with emerging fintechs, et cetera, et cetera, and frankly, how do they just meet the demand of their customers. And so the team did a very nice job really innovating around this ability to put capability in market in a much faster pace across hundreds, if not thousands, of clients. And that then, based on whatever product they slate for that deployment methodology, that then accelerates our revenue stream. But it will drive tens of millions of dollars for the IFS segment this year in new organic growth and that'll -- you'll continue to see that as a continuing increasing way for us to deploy and get new capabilities in market faster.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos from Cowen.","Georgios Mihalos","Let me add my congrats on a very nice quarter.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, George.","Georgios Mihalos","Woody, to kick things off, just sort of two questions as we think about the rest of the year. Firstly, you outperformed in the first quarter, a tough comp quarter. Should we be thinking that, on an aggregate basis, organic growth is going to be fairly steady now from quarter two through quarter four? And then related to that, to the extent you continue to outperform, will you take any upside from the margin side and sort of accelerate reinvestment in the business?","James Woodall","Yes. On the first comment, we do anticipate revenue for the remainder of the year to be in line with the guide we just gave you, which is 4% to 4.5%., so we do anticipate that. Do I believe it's a conservative guide? I do at this point given what we're seeing in the market. But it is only the first quarter, so I am a little bit conservative from that front. I think we wouldn't see any incremental reinvestment over and above what we were already been doing. We think we've been out investing the market in terms of data centers, in terms of modernization, in terms of innovation. So I don't think we would look for any accelerated reinvestment from where we are today, George, and I think that answers both of your questions.","Georgios Mihalos","That's great. And just a quick follow-up. The $500 million of revenue synergies from the Worldpay acquisition, is there a way to kind of frame that domestic versus international?","Gary Norcross","At this time, we haven't framed that out, George. Obviously, one of the benefits to both of our companies is we're a global provider of financial services. On a combined basis, we'll be approximately 30% of total revenues outside the U.S. We obviously see a tremendous opportunity for geographic expansion for Worldpay. We've talked about that when we announced the transaction, of really helping them break into new high-growth markets that they want in that could really accelerate that timeline by as much as 3 years. But I would tell you that we think the revenue growth across the board will flow pretty much in alignment with how our revenue splits. But more of that will come in the coming quarters as we get the -- once we get closed on the business, we'll certainly come back and give you some more granularity into that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Cantwell from Guggenheim.","Jeffrey Cantwell","You've had several interesting announcements recently. There's one in particular I wanted to see if I could ask about is with Visa and their B2B Connect platform which looks like it's going to focus on cross-border. What can you tell us about that? Do you think that combination is something that could be a significant driver of new volume, new opportunities for your customers and yourselves? And if that's the case, then how so? Any color you could give us there will be very helpful and help us think about the -- your company's emerging opportunities incremental in nature.","Gary Norcross","Look, I appreciate it. Yes, look, the team is doing a very nice job of making sure that we're taking advantage of various partnerships or investment in our technologies and modernization where it makes sense to drive our future growth. We don't really give granular details of what we're expecting out of those relationships. But what I would come back and tell you is the payment landscape is changing very rapidly. The need for real-time money movement, the need for cross-border, the need for alternative payment types is all very high. What I'm really pleased with the team is through their strategy, they're taking advantage of the various capabilities that exist in the market and allowing us to meet our client demands and needs. ","So we don't enter into relationships cavalierly if we don't see an opportunity. Or frankly, if we're not being pressed by our clients, we don't enter into that. So the relationship is going to be a good one. We're excited about it. It's an extension of what we have today. And we think that as payments continue to move around the globe and take on different form factors and different changes, that FIS will be the benefactor of that given our strategy in how we're approaching it.","Jeffrey Cantwell","Great. And then you're clearly having numerous conversations with your financial institution partners. I wanted to see if you can give us a general sense of their temperature for investment as well as where they think we are in the business cycle because the service it sounds like there's still some positive tailwinds and some step-up in investment across the FI space. I was wondering if you could give us a sense, describe what your conversations are like with your partners and how optimistic you think they are about the outlook over the next 12 to 18 months.","Gary Norcross","Yes. I would tell you, over the last five quarters, given what we've seen going on in sales all throughout last year, we had the largest sales here in the history of the company last year. This quarter, another big quarter sales. And frankly, well, given our pipeline and given my personal ongoing conversations, and frankly, across the entire leadership team, their conversations, we're seeing a continuing acceleration in their desire to spend. As I commented earlier, I think many of our larger institutions, and frankly even community institutions around the world, have held on too long with their existing technologies and so there's a real sense of urgency that's been building. And I think you're seeing that in our sales results and seeing that in our accelerated growth. So I'm very optimistic that the next 18-plus months is going to be a real strong, positive tailwind for us with regards to demand and sales success.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene","Great quarter, Gary and Woody.","Gary Norcross","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Glenn Greene","I guess the first question, you've obviously talked about it a lot, but just maybe, Gary, if you could talk a little bit more about the 30% CCB growth, the key drivers from a product service perspective, maybe contrast the IFS and GFS. Trying to get a sense of how broad based the sales success was.","Gary Norcross","Yes. Look, I mean, going on IFS, they just really had a great year last year in sales, really led into a strong Q1, Glenn. We saw it really across all major product lines, core and wealth continued to do very well, our payments business continued to operate on all cylinders, a lot of our back office capabilities. As you know, that segment specifically, it's all reoccurring in nature. I mean it's all a heavy SaaS model. But just continued strong demand. Sales team is executing well and the pipeline's strong. ","And just coming out of that conference, I would tell you, like everybody, we measure our leads coming out of conferences and we had over 3,000 people in attendance. The leads that came out of the conference are very strong year-over-year. And so I feel really good about where the IFS business is positioned. I feel really good about the contribution margins that the new sales are bringing online. Obviously, the implementation, as you know, the -- you do have anywhere from a 6- to 12-month implementation timeline as sales get closed. ","When I look at GFS, similar with demand, we're really starting to see, especially in the large bank market on the retail banking side where large regionals, frankly even global institutions have held on too long to their existing technology stacks, and they're really looking for cloud-native-type capabilities to gain the efficiencies out of the cloud that other industries have been able to take advantage of. And so we've got a lot of success and we highlighted some success in the prepared remarks around Digital One with some very large institutions. We're seeing a lot around our next-generation core banking platform and demand on that platform. ","As you move into the capital markets solution, just a really good, strong quarter. It does have some grow issues, as Woody talked about. I mean the movement from licensing to a SaaS model, that's an exciting long-term opportunity for us and we're seeing that with real high growth and reoccurring revenue up 40%. But then we have very strong, solid license sales as well. So -- and you'll continue to see some of that lumpiness as that business makes its transition. ","But the good news is very strong demand. And we even highlighted a regulatory change with consolidated audit trail. As you look at those kind of changes that are occurring, that plays into our solution capability that we built. And so I'd feel good about the spend environment for the industry. We're 5 quarters into some really nice sales results, and I think that's a good indicator for the next 18-plus months.","Glenn Greene","Okay. And then just the final one is just really a clarification and it's a -- I mean Darrin asked you the question, Woody, I guess on the revenue bridge for the pro forma. Just want to make sure I'm clear on that. Does that suggest that you think sort of FIS standalone would accelerate, let's say, 100 -- 50 to 100 basis points in 2020 and perhaps grow north of 5% organic?","James Woodall","That's a fair assessment of how we modeled it. Not here to give you 2020 guidance today, but that's a fair assessment as to how we model it.","Glenn Greene","All right. Perfect. Congrats.","James Woodall","Thank you.","Gary Norcross","Thank you for joining us today and for your ongoing interest in FIS. We are pleased to start the year delivering very strong revenue, profitability performance and earnings growth. We entered 2019 with a robust pipeline and strong sales momentum and have continued to build on those strengths throughout the first quarter. Combined with our business model and consistent execution of our strategy, we are confident and have a clear line of sight into achieving our plan for the remainder of the year.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FIS' Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.","Turning to slide two, Gary Norcross, President and Chief Executive Officer, will begin with a business summary. Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with the financial results for the second quarter.","Today's news release and the supplemental slide presentation are available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Turning to slide three, today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release and in the appendix of the supplemental slide presentation.","Turning to slide four, I will now turn the call over to Gary to discuss the business highlights in the second quarter. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Pete. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm extremely pleased to open the call today, reporting that FIS had another strong quarter, outperforming our expectations. We saw growth across both operating segments and exceeded our consolidated revenue, EBITDA and EPS targets. These results build on the positive momentum established in Q1 and characterized the first half of the year with strong profitable growth delivering outstanding shareholder returns. Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive. As a result, we will be increasing our guidance.","Turning to slide five, second-quarter top-line growth exceeded expectations. Adjusted revenue increased more than 5% organically compared to the prior-year quarter. We continue to see EBITDA contribution from our organic revenue growth and also strong benefit from our synergy attainment to date. This resulted in EBITDA growing more than twice as fast as revenue at 13% and adjusted earnings per share rose 22%.","As we reported last quarter, we remain ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration and are confident that we will exit the year with $150 million in run rate synergy. We remain on track to beat our stated end goal of $200 million.","The team continues to perform well against both committed cost synergies and sales execution, which is beginning to yield results in new and existing client sales. They also have maintained a heightened level of focus on this integration with a clear line of sight to all of our targets. As highlighted previously, FIS has a proven track record of meeting or exceeding our synergy targets and based on our progress to date and proven integration processes, this trend will continue.","While the markets have experienced some turmoil, FIS has continued to deliver impressive results. Our mission critical applications, which serve clients of all sizes in the diverse geographic regions where we operate drive both revenue diversification and predictable stability and scale for our clients. Brexit is obviously creating some uncertainty in the market. At this time, we have not seen any impact to our current relationships. While this will continue to unfold over the next several years, change typically creates opportunity for FIS.","Our pipeline for the remainder of the year is robust. Market and client demand for our solutions continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies in implementing transformational solutions. Our sales teams are doing a good job of converting these opportunities to new wins and creating cross-sell and upsell programs to existing clients.","By all accounts, this is an exceptional first half to the year and creates a strong foundation for achieving our full-year 2016 goals and longer-term growth objectives. We are confident in driving continued earnings growth in the back half of the year while remaining focused on continued improvements on our cost structure and steady execution of our four-pronged growth strategy, which is to grow our base business, unlock enterprise value through strategic investments, expand our solution portfolio, all while focusing on strong financial discipline.","Turning to slide six to review our segment highlights. In our Integrated Financial Solutions business, we had a very strong revenue growth of over 8% organically. We saw especially strong growth in our Digital, Payments and Enterprise Governance, Risk and Compliance Solution businesses.","Looking to the future, our sales teams are on target to deliver on our cross-sell and new sell goals for the year. In our Banking and Wealth Management business, we signed several strategic long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks seeking the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. For example, in April, we signed a new multiyear strategic agreement with a $16 billion community bank to extend its FIS core banking solution across its entire banking enterprise. This bank, which recently nearly doubled its size, has also added new FIS digital, mobile, item capture and bill-pay solutions to its customer facing capabilities.","Our Payments business had another strong quarter with 8% organic growth driven by our high-margin, high-recurring EFT processing business and our mobile wallet enablement. This growth was also supplemented by continued strong growth in our card production business, especially from our EMV card deployments. We also signed a multiyear electronic benefits transfer processing deal with one of the largest states in the U.S., providing benefits to more than 2 million households. All of these new and extended relationships demonstrate FIS strength in serving the banking and payment needs of North American institutions regardless of size. This demand created recurring revenues of more than 85%, which is driven by our long-term mission-critical software applications deployed in our one-to-many model.","Turning to our Global Financial Solutions business, we also had solid sales performance overall leading to in-quarter and future quarter results. In the quarter, we delivered top-line organic growth of 3%. Our Institutional and Wholesale business, which consists of the majority of the former SunGard business, delivered top-line organic growth of more than 5% with strong IP-led services and licensed product sales in the quarter, representing two consecutive quarters of over 5% growth.","In May, we announced that Credit Suisse had adopted the FIS Derivatives Utility, becoming the second major capital markets firm to join. We are pleased to see continued interest in this offering where clients are benefiting from moving to a highly scalable, consumption-based solution to deliver cost and efficiency gains. This further illustrates the move towards outsourcing in the global financial markets.","Our Clear2Pay global enterprise payments delivery platform continues to perform very well. We saw strong deal closure for this solution in the quarter including new, multiyear deals with a U.S. based financial institution with more than $60 billion in assets, and with one of the world's largest global banks, Credit Suisse.","The two Credit Suisse deals illustrate the value FIS brings in having solutions across our clients' total needs, as well as proving that financial institutions of this global size and scale are making big decisions to drive their business forward, even in uncertain times.","We also saw nice growth in Brazil, mainly due to the strong client relationships we have established in our recurring revenue model. Despite continuing unfavorable market conditions, we anticipate a good second half of the year in this market.","In India, we continued to see strong progress with newly chartered financial institutions signing significant multiyear deals with three of these institutions. Our focus on enabling financial inclusion in India is making a positive difference in this under-banked country where we've driven tremendous growth.","Turning next to slide seven. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize today by re-emphasizing that we are very pleased with our second quarter results and our first half of the year where our overall results out-performed our expectations. Our performance, combined with a robust pipeline and clear line of sight to the back half of the year gives us confidence in our full year results.","To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth through new sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter.","Woody?","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Gary. I will begin on slide nine. Adjusted revenue increased 5.4% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew $696 million, a 12.7% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis, as if we had owned SunGard in the prior-year period. This represents 220 basis points of margin expansion, and now gives us two quarters of strong validation in the earnings power of our business model, our portfolio solutions enhanced by SunGard and our ability to execute on large strategic acquisitions.","Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $295 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 21.6% to $0.90 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the prior-year period. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue increased 4.8% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $1.3 billion, a 10.6% increase compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis. EBITDA margin expanded 200 basis points to 28.8%. Earnings per share grew 21.6% to $1.69 per share.","Before I move to our segment results, I wanted to provide an update on our integration efforts. We continue to execute on our integration plans, and closed the second quarter at over $100 million in run rate synergies for the year. We remain confident in meeting our 2016 goal of $150 million in run rate synergies and exceeding our 2017 target of $200 million. As Gary said, this was a very strong quarter and we're pleased with the results for the first half of the year.","Moving to slide 10, in the second quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew on an organic basis by 8.3%. More importantly, adjusted EBITDA increased to $450 million, an increase of 8.7% compared to the prior year period on an adjusted combined basis. For the first half of the year, revenue increased 6.9% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $876 million, a 5.4% increase compared to the prior-year period.","Turning to slide 11. Banking and Wealth grew 9.7% organically for the quarter. This was driven primarily by continued market demand for regulatory and compliance solutions and in particular, a large risk and compliance project that is nearing completion.","We're extremely pleased with Payments growth of 8.3%, representing one of the strongest quarters for this group in the last decade. This was driven by continued strong demand for EMV card production, continued mobile wallet enablement and an uptick in fraud processing volumes.","Corporate and Digital grew 4.8% with digital banking again posting strong double-digit growth in the quarter. This was partially offset by our corporate liquidity products, which had a more difficult comparison to the prior-year period. While we're very pleased with these results, we don't anticipate this level of accelerated growth to be sustainable for the back half of the year and also recognize that we have more difficult comparisons to the prior-year period for the IFS segment.","Turning to slide 12, in the second quarter Global Financial Solutions revenue grew 2.9% organically. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $287 million, a 9.2% increase compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis. For the quarter, this represents 210 basis points of margin expansion and speaks to our ability to integrate our acquisitions, coupled with the growth of higher margin, IP-led solutions from SunGard. A combination of these factors creates a structural improvement to the GFS segment representing approximately 650 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion compared to the prior year period on a reported basis.","As we discussed in May at our Investor Day, we expect GFS margins to continue to improve over the next several years with the completion of our integration efforts and the ongoing growth in these IP-led solutions.","For the first half of the year revenue increased 3.6% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $538 million, a 10.7% increase compared to the prior-year period. This represents 240 basis points of margin expansion.","Moving to slide 13. Our Institutional and Wholesale business, which is comprised primarily of the former SunGard assets grew 5.4% organically in the quarter. This is the second quarter in a row of greater than 5% organic growth and speaks to the consistency of the business model. Growth was driven primarily by IP-led services and strong software renewals.","Banking and Payments organic growth was relatively flat in the quarter. As Gary noted, we continue to see sales success in India by signing three newly chartered banks, as well as growth in our India ATM Payments business. These new signings and increasing adoption rates of ATM usage in the Indian market provide a long-term tailwind for GFS with recurring high-margin processing revenues. These positive wins were partially offset by a difficult comparison to the prior-year period which included a large software license sale.","Our Consulting business was in line with our expectations. As Gary mentioned, global markets continue to experience uncertainty. I'd like to give some color around our business in the UK and exposure to the British pound sterling. Revenues tied to the pound sterling account for approximately 9% of GFS segment revenue and approximately 4% of consolidated revenue. Although the pound sterling has seen a meaningful decline recently, we do not anticipate any change or effect to EPS. A significant portion of our operations that support our European clients are located in the UK and those sterling-denominated costs reduce our overall U.S. dollar expenses as the sterling weakens compared to the U.S. dollar.","Our global diversification tends to limit our FX exposure to any one currency. For example, the Brazilian real has strengthened during the year, which helps offset the effect of the decline in the pound sterling. As a result, we continue to believe the impact to revenue from foreign currency translation to be a headwind of approximately $100 million for the full year.","Moving to slide 14, Corporate and Other adjusted revenue in the second quarter was $154 million with adjusted EBITDA loss of $41 million. The Corporate and Other segment results includes $78 million of corporate expenses, which compare favorably to adjusted combined corporate expense of $95 million in the prior-year period, reflecting ongoing execution of our integration plans. The segment grew revenue 1.3% on an organic basis.","Our Public Sector and Education business is executing strongly and produced good results with continued strong organic revenue of 6.4% for the quarter. Public Sector and Education grew revenue 6.8% for the first half of the year while also increasing EBITDA margins by over 300 basis points.","Moving to slide 15, our business model continues to generate significant cash flow. For the quarter, free cash flow was $291 million and $629 million for the first half of the year. We paid down over $300 million of debt since December 31 and have an approximately $11.1 billion of debt outstanding as of June 30. We remain highly focused on cash flow generation to de-lever the balance sheet and this continues to be a priority for us in the coming quarters.","In the second quarter we returned $86 million to shareholders through dividends and have returned $171 million in dividends year-to-date. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of $329 million on a fully diluted basis. The effective tax rate was 35% for quarter.","Moving to slide 16, based on our progress to date and our current visibility into the second half of 2016, we are increasing our full year guidance as follows. Organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% versus original guidance of 3% to 4% and adjusted EPS of $3.75 to $3.85 per share versus original guidance of $3.70 to $3.80 per share.","Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to provide some additional thoughts on the second half of the year and the third quarter in particular. In the third quarter of 2015, we eliminated all incentive accruals. This year, we are funding these accruals based on higher performance in the first half of the year, which is creating an increasingly difficult comparison to the prior-year period. We also plan that the next wave of additional cost synergies will flow mainly into the fourth quarter. Given those factors, we view the market's current consensus estimates for the third quarter to be approximately $0.06 ahead of our expectations, offset by the fourth quarter estimates being about $0.06 below our expectations. We continue to have strong confidence in our operating plan and fundamentals as evidenced by our results through the first half of the year and the increase to our full year guidance.","In summary, we're very pleased with our results for the first half of 2016 and our outlook for the full year. Our business model generates predictable and consistent earnings per share growth and creates strong cash flow, allowing us to reinvest in the business and return cash to shareholders. We believe the strength of the business model will continue to drive shareholder returns for many years.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first line we will go to is David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning, and nice to see the strong results.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Could you just drill down into the Payments business? Very strong growth in the quarter, up 8.3%. Could you perhaps just elaborate on the growth you saw at NYCE? And I'm wondering if you saw any benefit from dynamic routing, which Visa called out as a headwind to their results in the quarter? And then where we are in the EMV card manufacturing cycle?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, David. We had another good quarter in NYCE. We didn't really see any impact with regards to dynamic routing. Frankly, the team is executing very well in that group across the board. Not only did our network perform well, but some of our EFT processing volumes came through nicely. We had some very nice continued mobile wallet enablement which helped drive it.","And to your EMV question specifically, we now have seen consistently multiple quarters in a row with EMV providing a very nice tailwind in that business. We're still early on in the process but, as you know, in the back half of the year, we'll start getting into grow-overs over prior years' tailwinds. But that continues to be a very nice business. And frankly, we saw our volumes in the EMV actually accelerate quarter-over-quarter.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, to add some color, David, we issued about 8 million EMV cards in the second quarter.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","That would get us to about 14 million cards year-to-date in 2016. That would compare to about 10 million cards we issued for the full year in 2015. So certainly a tailwind for us...","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In EMV.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","In EMV. Certainly a tailwind for us in terms of the payment revenue growth.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","What percentage of your customer base has now issued chip cards?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're still very early in the process. We're seeing it primarily in credit. We've not seen it move over into the debit platforms as aggressively yet. We're in that 20% to 30% range of cards being issued at this point in time.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. And then, the Institutional, Wholesale business was particularly strong in the quarter, up 5.4%. Since that is principally SunGard, could you drill down into the drivers of that growth in a little more detail and perhaps address recent bookings performance and sustainability of growth?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The team has done an extremely nice job. We highlighted a number of the wins in my prepared remarks when you look at the Credit Suisse deal, for example, in the post-trade Derivatives Utility, we continue to see continued interest there. Licensing revenues were continued to be strong, not only in renewals but also new sales really coming across the board in all of the categories. I would say the team has really come together very nicely through the integration process. We've made some changes in the go-to-market strategy under Marianne Brown's leadership and that's starting to show results in the market as well. So, really, it wasn't any one specific area. It was just good solid production across the spectrum.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. And then, just finally on Brazil, which continued to be strong despite the deep recession in that country, could you talk about the drivers of growth going into the back half of this year and 2017 and your ability to sustain double-digit growth in Brazil?","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. We talked about earlier, our largest customer in Brazil about a card portfolio. We've been working on transitioning and converting that card portfolio over. We've been seeing revenue growth associated with those conversion services. We anticipate that portfolio to convert in the third quarter and start to see revenue from that. So, very good visibility into that growth into third and fourth quarter and we believe we'll sustain that double-digit growth, David, into 2017. Still believe the macroeconomic environment in Brazil is not getting better at this point, so a little more cautious on 2017 growth at this point, but we haven't gone through the planning process yet and again, feel very good about where we're at for 2016 and the double-digit growth in Brazil.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Great job on revenue.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Dave. Thanks.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And, I guess, first of all, just on SunGard, maybe you could just talk a little bit about on a standalone basis, the total SunGard revenue pool how much that grew. And then how much do you think FIS \u2013 just being part of FIS now might be helping. It just sounds like you've signed a lot of new deals. Like is that just all SunGard or do you think being part of FIS is helping?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Dave, what we've seen traditionally when FIS does these large acquisitions obviously as we pull them together and perform our integration playbook and actually implement some of our go-to-market strategies, we do see that the combination helps accelerate revenues.","Frankly, as you know, SunGard was primarily \u2013 had been under private equity ownership for 10 years. So, I talked about on earlier calls how the clients are actually relieved seeing where SunGard landed under a publicly traded company focused on financial services. And so I do think we're seeing some lift with that. Overall, the overall SunGard business performed very well, even on a combined basis. We've referenced Institutional Wholesale, which was over 5% but even on a combined basis, this is more than 4% organic.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Dave, if you look at SunGard as if it stood alone, it's about 4%, which is similar to last quarter. Basically, you've got a stronger Institutional and Wholesale growth partially offset by a little slower growth in corporate liquidity, but right in line, if not ahead of our expectations.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Exactly.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, my second question, just on GFS, you called out the Banking and Payments segment having a little bit of a tougher comp in Q2. Does that basically mean that that has an easier comp the rest of the year? We know Consulting has a much easier comp in Q3 and then even more in Q4. Does that just mean that \u2013 like how much better \u2013 if Global Financial was 3% growth this quarter, does that mean the rest of the year it's more like 5% or better?","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","I will tell you that specifically in Banking and Payments we had a large license in Q2 last year that didn't recur. If you normalize for that license, Banking and Payments would've been in the 3.5% growth, Dave, and that would have put overall GFS growth at about 4%. We believe that's a normal number for where we're at right now and then we would anticipate, to your point, the Consulting group having easier comps in the back half of the year. So still comfortable in that mid-term guidance range, but it'll be a little better, we believe, than the 3% from this quarter.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks. Nice job.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Next is the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Let me just start off again as a follow up on SunGard, again, it's growing well. Just a little update on what you think is any type of surprise to the upside versus what you initially anticipated being a 3% to 4% grower. It's certainly coming in stronger, I think.","And then maybe give us more color around the progress on synergies in terms of what's actually been recognized so far. And any further color on timing? The comment you made, Woody, just a moment ago around third quarter having a lower synergy number and the fourth quarter having a higher. Just what \u2013 maybe some more detail, what's going on there? And then just as a follow up on that topic, the margin expansion in GFS, how much of that was driven by synergies versus organic?","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","A lot of questions there, Darrin. Let me try to answer...","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Oh, really?","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","One at a time. If you look at the SunGard growth itself, we talked about it being about 3% to 4% grower. If you carve SunGard out of the various segments, it was at the high end of that at about 4%. So, again, higher growth in Institutional, Wholesale, a little lower growth in the corporate treasury and liquidity business. So that's the first item there.","With regard to synergies, we originally talked about $100 million as our target. In the first quarter, we talked about it being about a $0.02 to $0.03 expectation and us beating that by about $0.01, or about $0.04 in the first quarter. I will tell you the second quarter was close to that $0.04 number, exiting the second quarter at a little over $100 million in run rate synergies.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","What you've got is some of the first phase items that we've gotten out relatively quickly and are seeing the benefit of that. Then you'll go into a second phase that will see more of the benefit of that into the fourth quarter. That's the biggest delta in the terms of the synergy delta between third and fourth quarter.","The other item in the third quarter, again, was really around incentive accruals. We're having a better year this year and our incentive accruals are accordingly a little higher than normal levels. That, coupled with last year, we reversed incentive accruals, which gave a lift in operating expenses that we don't expect to recur and are creating a difficult comp in the third quarter. So, a combination of those two factors are really what you're seeing in that third to fourth quarter shift.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then just the margin expansion. When I look at the GFS-driven margin upside, I guess, can you help us understand how much of that actually came from the synergies here versus just organic mix shift, maybe IP-related revenue?","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","You've got a combination of it, right? The synergies are clearly driving some of that margin expansion. The faster growth in the higher margin IP-led solutions is also driving a portion of that growth. Haven't really given math on the breakout between those, but you could probably do some math if you bust those synergies out that I just described.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the bottom line is, Darrin, the SunGard acquisition is performing better than we expected, right? I mean, the...","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yep.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The product sales are coming in very strong. Frankly, the synergy and integration, we're ahead on the playbook at this point in time and continue to see that continuing through the rest of this year.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, it's good to see. On Capco, you mentioned that results were in line with expectations. Can you just really comment on trends again and whether you see that \u2013 I know comps get easier in the second half but any type of acceleration beyond just easier comps? I mean, is it new deals? Could that have actually been flowing on or will flow on in the second half of the year?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, yeah. Now we've talked a lot about Capco in past quarters. The team is doing an excellent job transforming that business. We really have pushed back into more transformational thought leadership-type consulting engagements. Our book-to-bill continues to be very high. So, are we onboarding new clients? All of the time. And we're refilling that. As you mentioned, the back half of the year, we do have easier comps. We'll see that growth rate accelerate. As we talked about in the last quarter, we intentionally will \u2013 we don't expect that our Consulting business to accelerate growth much beyond the overall GFS growth rate...","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Historically. But the team has done an excellent job and continues to bring on new business with all this uncertainty and oftentimes that drives consulting engagements for us. So we're certainly available to help our clients as they deal through all these changes.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Last question for me is just on the sale of the business you had talked about, the Public Sector business. Any update on that in terms of progress or demand?","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","I think we've talked about continually looking at the portfolio and always being open to take non-strategic assets and monetize those assets to reduce the debt that we have on the balance sheet right now. That business has performed well \u2013 6% growth on the second quarter, 6%-plus growth year-to-date. Expanding margins, so it's performed well, but that's the extent of the update right now.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, guys. All right. Nice job. Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","When I take a look at your IFS business, you obviously had a great quarter here. I'm wondering if you can speak a little bit to the competitive environment in particular and whether or not you see, for example, a distinction between relatively larger banks and your win rates there versus relatively smaller banks. In other words, is the market bifurcating at all between you and your competitors in North America? Is that one way to think about your success?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Andrew, we've talked about it a number of times. First, I mean, the U.S. market is an extremely competitive market, right? We see a lot of competition from a lot of different providers in the space. We have also talked about in past quarters, to your point, as you move upmarket and I even referenced in my prepared remarks another large $16 billion community bank making the decision to roll all of not only our core processing across the full enterprise but surrounding that with FIS Channel Solutions across the board. So, I do believe you're seeing a clear differentiation as you move upmarket. As you get greater than $10 billion, you start seeing FIS take on a true significant leadership role in that space. But the team continues to compete very effectively across all the community and regional banks. But at the end of the day, it's a very competitive market. We know we have to serve our clients and be their champions each and every day and continue to drive the business and we're seeing the results of that through our sales team and our ability to deliver.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And is there a difference in the pace of outsourcing in your view as it relates to asset size or that sort of second tier, so maybe below the super regionals, below the top 15 but above say the top 50? Are those institutions perhaps outsourcing in more of a structural or quicker way? Is there any difference in the pace of spend?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would tell you, we've been talking for years now about the pace of outsourcing in the small community banks across North America and, as you know, that's going to continue. But I would state that we are seeing an acceleration in outsourcing as you move upmarket. We highlighted the Credit Suisse situation in the post-trade side outsourcing all of that capabilities to our Utility. You see a number of other institutions when I highlighted that $16 billion institution on an outsource basis. So the reality is the larger institutions are accelerating. They're looking for ways to take cost out. They're looking for ways to accelerate their deployment of solutions to compete across the spectrum and that's just going to naturally drive the outsourcing.","We also continue to see that accelerate in the global markets. Frankly, we saw the India ATM deal a couple of years ago. We highlighted that as really the first significant step for outsourcing in that country. We now highlighted three brand new institutions coming on to our full capabilities. That's all on an outsource basis. So we're seeing outsourcing accelerate definitely across the globe.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And one more quick one, if I may. Can you just speak to how accelerated payments, real-time settlement, for example of bill payment and perhaps other types of payments might influence your IFS organic growth going forward? I'm thinking about 2017 and beyond perhaps.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we certainly see it as a big opportunity. Frankly, we bought the Clear2Pay acquisition in many ways because it was ahead of where the market was with regards to real-time payments. But like everything, we'll continue to monitor that and settle into that market but we think it'll be a good opportunity for us going forward.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, and congrats on the results, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brett.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Can you just reiterate what you said about the GFS growth rate? I think you said \u2013 it came in at 3%. But you said ex a large license deal in the Payments business there, it would've been more like 4%. Is that what I heard, right, Woody?","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","That is correct, Brett. And I'll try to give you the color. The Banking and Payments, which is about flat 0.5%...","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Yep.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Normalize that, it would have been about 3.5%. So below what we want it to be longer term obviously, but clearly better than flat. But you heard that exactly right.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then, as we look forward, thanks for the help in the 3Q\/4Q split. Can we just go over the things we need to be aware of as we think about the 3Q and 4Q? I know the comps on Capco get easier. I know that the IFS, I think, comps get a little bit harder. Just remind us of sort of those tailwinds\/headwinds kind of in a macro view if you could.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I'll give you a few bullets. You're exactly right. The comps in IFS get more difficult. We don't anticipate this level of growth from the IFS group in the back half of the year, but we would anticipate to be higher than the midpoint of our mid-term revenue guidance. Higher than the 4.5% midpoint of the guidance that we gave.","We also have a flattening, if you will, of synergies. We would expect the same level of synergies in Q3, an accelerated level of synergies in Q4 based on the timing of activities that we have going right now. The third item that we talked about was the third quarter having a more and more difficult comp related to incentive accruals. Last year we reduced incentive accruals significantly. In fact, took them to zero as of the end of the third quarter. This year we're performing better and incentive accruals are higher than a 100% right now. Those are the three big items that you see in there.","As we look to understand SunGard better and better too, you're seeing a little bit more seasonality as we flow between the third and the fourth quarter as they have a higher level of revenue and renewal growth in the fourth quarter than originally anticipated. Those are your four big items, Brett, to look at.","Net-net again about $0.06 below expectations compared to the market consensus for the third quarter, increasing about $0.06 compared to market expectations in the fourth quarter. In the full year, I think you guys are at about $3.80 on a consensus basis, which is midpoint of the updated guidance.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question is anything we need to think about in terms of big bank M&A benefit or loss to you all? I think one of the things you mentioned, a big bank win was your system being rolled out to a piece of M&A that another bank did. That's obviously a positive. Anymore positives or negatives on that front as any super-regionals or some of your clients buy and sell items?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We've talked about this, Brett, in the past. M&A is very hard to predict. You're exactly right. The scenario you just rolled out is exactly what happened. But what was interesting is we were able to cross-sell and up-sell a lot of our digital channels around that. So that was just a nice win overall.","Frankly, the best indicator that we can point to is really term fees. We talked about on a number of calls how those term fees have continued to stair step down in our business. This quarter our term fees were certainly at a normalized rate of what we've seen traditionally. And so at this point in time we've not really seen, so far through the first half of the year, any significant impact of M&A on FIS. But we'll continue to monitor it and certainly as our clients do some buying, we'll make sure that we try to take advantage of that through cross-selling and upselling.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Last question for me. Woody or Gary, I think you both \u2013 maybe both mentioned that Capco, you could see some of that business increase or a piece of that business, because of bank CEOs needing some help as they think about Brexit. Can you remind us what happened to those pieces of business in Capco during the last recession just to give us a sense of is history going to repeat itself here in terms of demand there?","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think it's uncertain at this point, Brett, in terms of what Brexit may mean for Capco. I think it would be the sort of tip of the spear in terms of what may happen there. To date we haven't seen any pullback in consulting engagements or any losses. In fact, a lot of conversation about what this may mean on a go-forward basis. I think the other thought on Brexit specifically would be, we anticipate it's going to take a couple years at least for things to sort themselves out.","Again, traditionally we've seen upside. The more difficult time we saw with Capco was in the fourth quarter of last year, we saw a 10% decline. We don't anticipate anything like that given the nature of the consulting engagements and then refocusing on the more boutique and strategic consulting versus the larger projects. So, I feel good about it. Again, easier comp in the back half of the year for the Consulting business but we don't anticipate a lot of growth out of it this year. We talked about it being mid-single digit. So, again, aligning about where we expect it to the first half of the year.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Frankly, Brett, the team is doing just an excellent job and certainly exceeding our expectations. They are already generating a number of thought leadership pieces on Brexit, helping our clients think through it. If anything, as I said in my prepared remarks, change typically drives opportunity for us and based on what we've seen through the first half of the year, the team will execute against that.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","And next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good results. Just a follow through on that on the Brexit side, so is the uncertainty really limited to Consulting or do you think it eventually could impact revenue bookings conversion or new sales performance because I could also argue that it could help outsourcing at some point in the next one or two years.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, no. We agree, Tien-Tsin. I think that's what we think if anything \u2013 and we are seeing it, right? We highlighted Credit Suisse, we've highlighted a number of others. We are seeing these larger institutions starting to move more and more towards outsourcing because frankly, they've got to get their costs out and they've got to get into a more leveraged capability. And if anything, we think that could help create that opportunity.","We continue to see some softness in discretionary spend around people-based services, but when you get to true outsourcing with our intellectual property wrapped in it, we think it could actually be an opportunity to play out over the next couple years.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So we'll watch the Consulting side, makes sense. And then, did you quantify sort of the new sales or the bookings performance in the quarter? And I'm also just curious, generally speaking, how revenue realization or bookings conversions is performing versus plan.","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","We didn't really give a number around bookings. Sales were solid in the quarter. I would tell you, Tien-Tsin, we've got very good visibility into the third quarter for the Consulting group. As you know, we don't have as long a line of sight but we've got good visibility into the third quarter with a little less in the fourth, which is very normal and natural. Yeah.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good to know. Last one, just the free cash flow was really high this quarter. Any call-outs for third quarter or fourth quarter and how that might behave?","James \u201cWoody\u201d Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","We were very pleased with cash flow this year. We have been very focused as a team in trying to improve collections, drive costs out and generate free cash flow to make sure we can pay the debt down. I would say we would anticipate continuing to see it and outpace sort of adjusted net earnings this year.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So this is still at a premium. All right. Good stuff. Thanks.","Operator","and Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. It's the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead. Ashwin, your line is open. Sir, do you have your phone on mute? And there is no response.","Peter Gunnlaugsson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","We can move on then, will you please?

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded.","And at this time, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Peter Gunnlaugsson. Please go ahead, sir.","Peter Gunnlaugsson - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FIS's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Turning to slide 2, Gary Norcross, President and Chief Executive Officer, will begin with performance highlights of the company; Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with the financial results for the second quarter. This conference call is also being webcasted with today's news release and corresponding presentation, all available on our website at FISglobal.com.","Turning to slide 3, today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements.

Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Pete. Good morning and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Let me start today by saying I am pleased with our second quarter results. Revenue was in line with our expectations and earnings were above our expectations. Please turn to slide 5.","We concluded the first half of the year with another strong quarter for FIS and our shareholders. And because of our overall strong performance, we are raising our full-year earnings per share guidance. In the quarter, both operating segments performed in line with our revenue expectations and exceed profit expectations. Our focus on operational execution allowed us to drive significant margin improvements.","This exceptional work has also allowed us to complete several major milestones towards our strategic plan. First, we have been able to over-drive our initial synergy target for SunGard by over 60%, with the identified total run rate now exceeding $325 million. While we will continue to focus on driving operating efficiencies and cost savings, this will be the last call we will update you on our SunGard-related synergy programs. Second, with the closing of our consulting divestiture on July 31, we've made significant progress towards our portfolio alignment strategy, focusing on strategic IP-led businesses. Maintaining a minority interest in the consulting business enables our clients to continue to benefit from our involvement while we focus our capital investments on IP-led solutions.","And finally, with our recent debt refinancing, we were able to reduce our total interest cost and tap new sources of capital. Our multi-year effort to build a scalable, global footprint with meaningful assets provided FIS the credibility to maneuver the successful alignment of our global capital structure. Woody will provide more details on this in his remarks.","Over the last 18 months, our strategic actions have driven transformational results for FIS. We have successfully executed on a strategic shift to enhance the structure, profitability and predictability of our GFS segment. The SunGard acquisition, in conjunction with our recent consulting divestiture, on a like-for-like basis has expanded GFS EBITDA margins by over 1,000 basis points and increased its reoccurring revenue base to almost 75%. We have also increased our total number of IP-led solutions by 25%, supporting our industry-leading comprehensive global solutions suite strategy. And over the last 18 months, we have paid down over $2 billion in debt, which has positioned us to announce the new share repurchase authorization of $4 billion.","All these efforts combined are proof of our strategic plan in action. These accomplishments allow us to leverage our exceptional global scale to create long-term value and are freeing up dollars to invest back into the core business. This provides future cash, flow which can be deployed for inorganic growth or returned to shareholders. These transformational results position us well for the next chapter in our strategy.","With this strategic backdrop, let's turn to slide 6 to focus on the near-term results. We have exited the first half of the year in a very positive position, capped by the following Q2 results: organic revenue increased 2%; adjusted EBITDA increased to almost $750 million, a 7% increase over the prior year with significant margin expansion; and adjusted earnings per share increased 13%. Our year-to-date financial performance, combined with the strength of our business model, progress against our strategic initiatives and clear line of sight into the second half of the year gives us continued confidence in our increased full-year outlook.","Turning to slide 7 to review segment highlights, our Integrated Financial Solutions segment drove anticipated top-line organic revenue growth for the quarter and strong year-over-year margin expansion. Importantly, this profitable growth was again driven by a broad base of solutions across the segment. Digital solutions continues to be a driver of growth, as evidenced by two large regional banks who invested in FIS solutions to bring advanced digital capabilities to their customers.","We also saw another solid quarter for our small business solutions, which signed many new financial institutions and dozens of their downstream customers, while also seeing growth from existing customers in user and transaction volumes.","Our Global Financial Solutions segment also delivered top-line growth at expected levels, with another very strong quarter of margin expansion. This growth was driven primarily by our international payments businesses and our derivatives utility.","In addition, we continue to see the benefits of our extended portfolio, enabling us to expand our presence within the existing client base. For example, we successfully expanded a significant relationship with a financial holding company with more than $12 billion in assets through the addition of a new front-to-back securities processing solution for their retail and institutional business.","Leveraging our existing relationship, we expanded our footprint through a new contract for these additional solutions and extended the term of the existing core contract. We also expanded our relationship with a leading trust company with more than $26 billion of assets under management. These are two great examples where we are now starting to get pull-through of SunGard's solutions into the existing FIS client base.","Moving to slide 8, our consistent Q2 and year-to-date results and outlook for the remainder of 2017 confirm that executing on our strategy is driving direct value to our clients. We remain focused on executing on our multi-faceted investment strategy, capitalizing on our expanded scale and operating leverage and paying down debt. All these measures are aimed at delivering sustained value to our clients, continued long-term earnings growth and consistent shareholder returns.","Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on slide 10. In the second quarter, revenue increased to $2.3 billion, or 2.3% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew to $746 million, a 7.2% increase compared to the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 240 basis points to 31.8%.","Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $342 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 13.3% to $1.02 per share compared to $0.90 per share in the prior-year quarter. For the first half of the year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew to $1.4 billion, a 7.1% increase compared to the prior-year period.","Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 220 basis points to 31%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 11.2% to $1.88 per share. Consistent with last quarter, a detailed bridge of revenue growth from GAAP to organic is included in the appendix material.","Moving to slide 11. In the second quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions organic revenue grew 2.6% to $1.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $469 million, an increase of 4.8% compared to the prior year. EBITDA margins improved 90 basis points to 39.7%, driven primarily by favorable revenue mix and continued cost management.","Excluding the consulting divestiture from both periods, which includes a small consulting group within IFS, this segment would've grown 4.3% on a pro forma basis, and EBITDA margins expanded 110 basis points to 40% for the second quarter.","For the first half of the year, revenue increased 2.1% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $911 million, a 4.6% increase compared to the prior year period.","Turning to slide 12, Banking and Wealth grew 2.5%, in line with our expectations. Payments grew 1.1% for the quarter, reflecting difficult EMV card production comparables that we have previously discussed.","Corporate and Digital grew 6.1%, driven primarily by new client signings for our small business solution, coupled with increasing transaction volumes from existing users and consistent demand for our digital solutions.","Turning to slide 13, in the second quarter, Global Financial Solutions organic revenue grew 3.9% to $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $331 million, an increase of 15.5% compared to the prior year. EBITDA margins improved 340 basis points to 30.8%.","Excluding the consulting divestiture from both periods, GFS would've grown 3.5% on a pro forma basis, and EBITDA margins would've expanded 420 basis points to 34.3%. These results are consistent with prior commentary on our strategy of growing higher-margin IP-led solutions and ongoing synergy efforts.","For the first half of the year, revenue increased 3.5% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $614 million, a 14.2% increase compared to the prior-year period. This represents 290 basis points of margin expansion.","Moving to slide 14, our Institutional and Wholesale business increased 1.4%, driven primarily by our derivatives utility. Growth was partially offset by the timing of implementation work. We remain confident in our second-half growth expectations for this business.","Banking and Payments grew 6.2%, driven primarily by steady performance in processing volumes in Asia-Pacific and Brazil, while Consulting grew 6.7%.","Moving to slide 15, the revenue from our non-strategic assets in Corporate and Other declined 17.8% on an organic basis, consistent with our previous guidance. Corporate expenses were $75 million, a 4.5% decline from the prior year, driven by continued focus on cost management initiatives.","Moving to slide 16, for the quarter, free cash flow was $275 million and $637 million for the first half of the year. For the first six months of the year, cash conversion was 102%. We expect cash flow conversion to be between 105% and 115% for the full year. As of June 30, our debt outstanding was $9.7 billion.","In the second quarter, we returned $97 million to shareholders through dividends and have returned $192 million in dividends year-to-date. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of 334 million on a fully diluted basis.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate decreased to 29.5% for the quarter, resulting in a $0.03 benefit for the second-quarter earnings compared to original expectations. The decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily driven by a year-to-date combination of tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and from higher international profits. We now expect our full-year rate to be about 30% to 31%, versus our original guidance of 32%.","Moving to slide 17, since our last call, we executed two significant transactions that create long-term benefits to shareholders. On May 23, we announced the sale of a majority stake in our consulting assets, which consisted of Capco and a small consulting group from the IFS segment. The transaction closed on July 31 and produced $469 million of upfront cash proceeds, or $441 million net of taxes and deal-related expenses, and included a retention of a 40% equity interest in the business. The transaction initially values our retained equity interest at about $175 million.","In 2017, these businesses were expected to contribute $630 million of revenue, $75 million of EBITDA and approximately $0.15 to $0.17 of earnings per share for the full year. The majority of the earnings per share contribution, $0.11 to $0.12, was expected to come in the second half of the year. We expect $0.01 to $0.02 of earnings per share contribution from the ongoing minority interest in the interest, resulting in net dilution of $0.10 per share in 2017.","On June 26, we successfully priced our inaugural European debt offering of \u20ac1 billion and \u00a3300 million at a weighted average coupon of approximately 1%. Simultaneously, we launched a tender offering on $2 billion of outstanding debt, with a weighted average coupon of approximately 4%. The tender was funded on July 25 with proceeds from the European bond issuance and borrowings from our revolving credit facility. On July 31, all the proceeds from the divestiture of the consulting assets were used to pay the revolving credit facility.","This transaction highlights additional value from our global footprint, by utilizing our assets and cash flows in Europe to optimize our capital structure, allowing us to issue debt in favorable market conditions. We're able to designate this new debt as a net investment hedge against the equity in our European operations, eliminating currency risk. This transaction is a continued evolution of our capital structure to align with global operations and gives us access to a broader investor base and new sources of capital. These refinancing activities will reduce our interest expense by approximately $25 million for the remainder of the year and about $60 million in 2018.","Overall, this transaction will provide $400 million of total interest expense savings over the next eight years. Finally, our weighted average interest rate declined 60 basis points from approximately 3.9% to 3.3%.","Turning to slide 18, for 2017, we are reiterating our organic revenue growth rates and revising consolidated and segment revenue dollar ranges due to the divestiture. Full-year consolidated organic revenue growth is expected to be 2% to 3%, resulting in a range of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion. IFS organic revenue growth is expected to be 3% to 4%, resulting in a range of $4.62 billion to $4.67 billion. And GFS organic revenue growth is expected to be 4% to 5%, resulting in a range of $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion.","Despite our relatively slow start to the year on a top-line basis, which we expected, we remain confident in the full-year growth rates we provided at the beginning of the year and the underlying strength of the core operating segments.","Turning to slide 19, based on the results of these transactions, operating performance and our lower tax rate, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EPS guidance. Our increased range includes $0.10 of dilution from divestitures, which is more than offset by a combination of a $0.05 benefit from the impact of the debt refinance and a $0.07 to $0.12 benefit from year-to-date performance, outlook for the remainder of the year and a lower tax rate. The net impact to full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance is an increase to $4.22 to $4.32 per share or 10% to 13% growth compared to prior-year period.","I also wanted to give some insight into our expectations of the quarterly earnings spread for the second half of the year to help with modeling. In light of the timing of these changes noted above, we expect our third quarter earnings results to be between $1.04 to $1.06 per share. Adjusted for the timing of the consulting and public sector divestitures, and the refinancing activity this summer, normalized EPS growth would be approximately 10% in the third quarter.","Finally, we are announcing the authorization of a $4 billion share repurchase program, which will expire at the end of 2020. While we remain focused on deleveraging our balance sheet, we are anticipating generating excess cash flow in the fourth quarter and throughout 2018. Our revised 2017 EPS guidance does not anticipate any share repurchase impact.","We are pleased with the execution in the first half of the year, which allows us to increase our full-year EPS guidance, even with the divestitures. We continue to focus on consistently improving cash flow generation, deleveraging our balance sheet, investing for growth, and returning cash to shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. Our first question will come from David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, David.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Morning, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Good to see you raised the SunGard cost take-out target. My question is on organic growth, perhaps in the SunGard assets, but more broadly enterprise solution selling, which was a key goal of yours when you acquired SunGard. Are you starting to see that enterprise selling, let's say, across the mid-tier and Tier 1 banks with SunGard?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes. David, it's a great question. The quick answer is yes. I highlighted a couple of examples in my prepared remarks, but we really are seeing the ability, as we discussed when we originally brought SunGard, SunGard operated in a very independent, product-by-product basis with separate sales teams, et cetera. We consolidated all those sales organizations into a global sales force. We've also consolidated the products that belong together under common leadership, and we're now starting to bring bundles and packaging of solutions to market. And we are starting to see that pull-through, as we discussed when we announced SunGard.","We thought the timing would take about 12 to 18 months. And honestly, that's about what we're seeing. You first have to bring the sales forces up to a global basis, get everybody trained on the new solutions, obviously, do some development work to integrate those better, but highlighted just a couple of examples of that this quarter. And we believe that's going to continue.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. And we've seen this initiative from BofA, Goldman and Morgan Stanley, Project Scalpel to form a consortium to try to bring down their trade processing costs. And I'm wondering if you've had any talks with those banks around outsourcing derivatives processing, given the strength you've highlighted in that business.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, we never talk specifics about our pipeline, but we have been talking to a lot of people. What you're seeing is in all of the large global institutions, you're seeing a lot of people looking for ways to take their various in-house developed products or one-off products, leveraging those to get costs taken out and actually improve service levels and delivery. And so we highlighted our derivatives utility and how well that's been performing. We got very full pipelines on a lot of these types of initiatives, where we're leveraging more of a utility outsourcing processing approach to some of these systems that more traditionally have been run in-house historically.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Quick final question on capital allocation, good to see the $4 billion increase in the share repurchase. On your current capital structure, you're a little under 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA on your 2017 EBITDA guidance. So more broadly, how are you thinking about capital allocation here? And do you have an appetite to do another strategic transaction like SunGard?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes. I'll start and let Gary add some color. With regard to the leverage itself, we had talked about being in the 2.6, 2.7 range by the end of 2017, targeting getting back to around 2.5 times. That said, based on the refinancing activity we've done, we'll repay all our pre-payable or maturing debt by the fourth quarter, so we'll have some excess cash then. We certainly anticipate having some excess cash flow, significant excess cash flow, in 2018 that we could apply across a number of different ways, but we wanted to make sure we had some flexibility to do share repurchase.","I think we're always looking to add strategic capabilities and expand our market capabilities, but we always do that in a disciplined way, looking at financial strategic value and relative valuation. Right now, we think on a relative basis, we're a very good buy. So we wanted to make sure we had access to buy some of our shares back.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes. I think, David, just to add a little bit to that, that's exactly where I was going to go. If you look at our current valuations against the rest of the market, we feel like we're a very good buy opportunity ourselves. Frankly, once we get our debt paid down to a level, we will continue to look for ways that will bring us a new product or a new service to an existing market we serve or break us into an adjacent market of financial services, or ideally both, but to Woody's point, it's got to generate a strong return for our shareholders and it has to make good strategic sense.","And so we're just not a company that looks around to do big acquisitions that don't fit our overall strategy. But we'll continue to drive the company in the manner you've seen for the last several years out of this team.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Greatly appreciate the insights. Congrats on the strong results.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, hey, guys. Nice job.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, and I guess, first of all, just a couple modeling and understanding questions of the GFS segment. You guided now to $4.15 billion to $4.2 billion of revenue. I'm wondering for this year now, if that includes one month still of Capco in Q3 or if you wiped out Capco for the back half? And then secondly, if your FX guidance in that segment, I think you have a $75 million headwind early in the year, if that's kind of wiped out now because FX has gotten better?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I'll hit your FX first. As you know, our organic calculation excludes FX and it excludes the impact of acquisitions or divestitures. With regard to FX, you're right. We had a very minor impact in the second quarter. And right now, based on FX rates, we are modeling a very insignificant impact for the full year. Neither one of those would impact organic growth in the way we calculate it.","With regard to Capco, we are removing Capco from the organic base and the consulting businesses from the organic base, so they would be out of the number. But the 4% to 5%, again, removes any divestitures and removes any FX.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Gotcha on that. And then, I guess, secondly, just on EBITDA progression, your margins have gone up so rapidly because you've so quickly taken out costs. And we're at a point now where it seems like you're at a pretty full synergy level. Is there still room for a lot of margin expansion in the overall business or are we getting back to that kind of more modest level as we look into the next couple years?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, I think we guided to what we think we'll consistently see from regards margin expansion over the next several years out of the business. The quick answer, Dave, is we still see a lot of opportunity to continue to get more efficient with the overall company.","The reality, to your point, we've integrated SunGard. We're about six months ahead of where we thought we would be at this point, maybe even a little more. The team's done an excellent job, but, at this point in time, once you get these companies so integrated, it's very difficult to tell is this is really a synergy related to the acquisition, or at this point is it just good operating execution focused on getting leverage out of the global enterprise.","And so we'll continue to focus on that, as we always have year-in and year-out. But we're very confident that we'll continue to see good margin expansion out of GFS for the next several years. There's a lot of opportunity with right-shoring of talent. There's a lot of opportunity in data center consolidation. There is a lot of opportunity in product consolidation, both in IFS and GFS. So we feel very good about continued margin expansion over the next several years.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question in queue will come from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys, nice job. So just starting off, obviously, compares in the quarter were tougher around EMV and then the people-based contract lapping. I guess first of all, if you back those out, any idea what your organic growth would have been in the quarter? And then, if you can also you provide us on the other items that would drive acceleration in the second half, and whether those are sustainable as a run rate into 2018, how to think about that going forward. And then, Gary...","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a follow up on the overall market, sorry. Just, Gary, if you can also comment on the kind of conversations you're having with the market, the sentiment with your clients, what kind of specific areas they're investing in? Thanks, guys.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Darrin, with regard to your first one, we've done some calcs, and we tried to give some color in the prepared remarks around what organic growth would look without the consulting business. We haven't pulled out what the impact of, specifically, of the risk-based project and some of the compares are, particularly on the EMV, because that's just ordinary business, difficult compares, and we've got to grow through it.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Exactly.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","But it'll certainly help both IFS and, we believe, GFS for full year in terms of organic growth. Probably, more importantly, it helps both their margin profiles. IFS would be up to about a 40% margin with it and GFS would be in the 34%-type, which is a significant improvement from a few years ago from a structural improvement. So it'll definitely help organic revenue growth. It'll help margins, but we haven't specifically carved out all the moving pieces there that you just mentioned.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, but, I mean, so compares get easier for sure in the second half. Any other variables that would drive some acceleration, which I know is sort of embedded in your guidance, and whether that's sustainable into next year?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, we certainly think once you move compares out, the original guides that we had, which was around 3% to 6% on IFS and 3% to 8% on GFS, still hold together. You certainly should see some improvement in acceleration in the back half of the year, particularly in the strategic segments. As you know, we were looking at about a 1 point consolidated headwind from Corporate and Other, but feel very good about the strategic segments, about the growth rates we outline, and about where they can go long-term in those sustained rates we mentioned back in May of 2016.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, and keep in mind, Darrin, before I get to your question about the conversations going on in the market, keep in mind, especially in the GFS group, with bringing the former SunGard business into the mix, Q4 is always historically a heavy license quarter, right?","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right, right. That's fair.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","So you get a lot of license activity typically in Q4, where our financial institutions are agreeing to move forward with a project, signing that in Q4 so that it can kick off in early Q1, and then deliver in the next year. And so we don't see that trend changing. So, by nature, when we look at our planning, and as we plan the year, naturally, Q4 does accelerate because of that.","Getting back to your question about the conversations going on in the market, really a lot has not changed from what we talked about in previous quarters. There is a tremendous amount going on in the market, so people are looking to push as much to an outsourced fashion as they can to lower their overall cost; a lot of focus on digital, but the extension of digital to really next-generation user experiences. So what we used to think of as the digital interaction around mobile, you know mobile banking has now extended very dramatically over that time.","We're seeing a tremendous amount of activity around data. We're talking to our customers about how they maximize data and address stuff like how do you take fraud to the next level utilizing data. How do you take next available product and interact and build relationships through data with customers. So and that then leads us all into a lot going on in the payments ecosystem as well. A lot is going on in real-time payments; once again, all abilities to help streamline processes. And whether we're in the U.S. or outside the U.S., and whether we're in very, very large institutions or even community institutions, those conversations resonate very well.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","And so we're seeing a lot of activity around those for us. (31:26)","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, all right. Just a quick follow-up on the buyback again, and then I'll turn it back to the queue, but, look, I mean, you guys historically were very shareholder-friendly, obviously, before the SunGard deal, you would keep your leverage ratio at a certain rate, and add leverage, and keep buying back stock with a considerable amount of free cash flow. Is that the strategy we should expect to resume again with regard to if there's not a real tuck-in deal or a real acquisition, you can assume that most cash flow is going to go towards the dividend and entirely toward buybacks, with even the extent of maybe even keeping leverage at 2.5?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I think you've seen us do exactly that in the past. We feel very comfortable at an aggregate 2.5 times leverage. That says we grow, right? You could even take on some debt to continue to keep that leverage at that level. But you've seen us default to share buyback versus trying to just reduce debt lower than that.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","So you've seen us do that a number of years, then we did the SunGard acquisition. We're getting our debt and our balance sheet back to where it needs to be, and you could certainly see us moving back into that from a default position while continuing to look at continued (32:29) opportunities.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, very good. Sounds great. Thanks, guys.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Darrin.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Darrin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue, that will come from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning and congrats on a nice quarter, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","The free cash flow came in a little bit lighter than we thought for 2Q, and even for the first half. I don't think the conversion maybe was quite as good as what you guided, Woody, I think, 105% to 115% for the year. Can you just run us through the thoughts on that and what kind of changes, if it's working capital or other?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I think it is just working capital movements. You've seen some timing around cash tax payments and some of the divestiture activity that we've had. Q2 is always our lowest cash flow generation item over the last four or five years. So what we try to do is not look as much on the quarter-by-quarter cash flow generation, but look at what the total year's going to do. Through the first six months, we're at 102% and I think again we're going to be at 105% to 115%. Some of that comes through heavier cash flow at the end of the year, with renewals and license maintenance that we've always seen in the past. So feel good about it, have good visibility into it, Brett, so.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on the guidance you guys raised, which is great, give us a sense of how you feel about that conservatism-wise. I mean, I think many folks have felt that you guys were being very prudent about kind of what your guidance was in this raise. Is it a little bit less conservative or how do we feel? What's kind of our stance on how the pro forma EBIT, (34:02) EPS guidance plays out?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes. I would tell you we feel very good about what we've laid out to the market, continue to take a conservative stance on the guide to make sure we are delivering our expectations, if not exceeding those expectations. So it seems like every time I put a guide together, some of the broader groups tend to get a little higher than I do in terms of picking a midpoint. But that said, I feel very good about where we're at, what we've guided to and have continued to keep a conservative stance on it.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","And then...","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Brett, just building on that, if you look at the back half of the year, we're obviously just very confident that we'll continue to be able to deliver the results we've delivered for the last 18 months. And so, the team's executing very well. The sales pipeline is strong. Obviously, we've got to go still close business for the back half of the year, but, as Woody and I always do, we dig through the results very aggressively and meet with the teams and we're confident in the back half of the year.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","And just last, just remind us, you mentioned a couple of things. We got 100 basis points headwind in Corporate, still organic revenue growth this year, if I'm remembering right. And then, also the people-based project, I think, in IFS is about 100 basis points. Are those the two biggest chunks that we can expect to not \u2013 or that we can lap into next year as we think about your long-term guidance and hitting that?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes. Those are the two biggest chunks. We had a convergency in Q3 of last year that we called out last year. I want to say it was around $15 million, but that's outlined in our view this year, but those are the big chunks, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's what we needed. Thank you.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question in queue will come from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk specifically about the SunGard and broader Institutional Wholesale business, growth there a little bit less than I think we had modeled, but you called out some of the one-time impacts in the quarter. Can you maybe just talk about the complexion of the discussions you're having with customers around the capital market space right now and whether you see any kind of discretionary spending for things like software investments freeing up or was that still muted until we get into a little bit better interest rate environment or something else?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, Jim, I'll tell you. We're actually very pleased with the whole Institutional and Wholesale business and how it's performed. The sales team's done very well. Frankly, as we've shared on a number of calls, when you look at that business, organic revenue growth quarter-by-quarter can be more lumpy, just due to the timing of license fees. You've also got through revenue recognition, opportunities where you sign a license, you can't recognize it because you've got professional services tied to it and so then you get that license fees over the delivery of that professional services work.","But, frankly, I&W team right in where we thought it was going to come in for the quarter. We feel very good about the back half of the year in that business, given the pipeline and given the results the sales team's been able to get and, frankly, the operating business and their ability to get the software implemented and launched. So we feel good about the business.","Conversations continue to expand in those markets, as we've shared. It's really kind of unique. The capital markets area is really kind of a unique area for us since we did the SunGard acquisition. And as we have conversations with those customers, there's a real drive to try to get cost out and to get more on a commercially-available solution which plays, which is a very good thing for FIS going forward and I think that resonates in our pipeline and the results we've seen.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. And then, maybe as a follow-up, can you maybe just comment on the international business broadly? You talked about the growth in A-Pac and Brazil. Are we back in a position where emerging markets can continue to drive double-digit growth for the foreseeable future? And then if you can maybe just make a comment broadly on the business in the UK.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, I would tell you when I look at the overall international business, we're pleased with the results of how it's performed this year. We got some very nice clients that we've on-boarded and we're seeing the results of that; once again, depending on the region. We highlighted Payments in Asia-Pacific, continues to do very well. We see some strengthening in Brazil with our joint venture. Other areas, frankly, Europe continues to be muted for us, right? So the team continues to execute there, but just in general that's more of a muted market for us in general. So will we see it return to strong double-digit growth? We certainly aren't planning for that over the next several years, but we do think it'll be a strong contributor to our overall growth in the future.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on Capco if the minority agreement in any way terms-wise preserves the merits of owning Capco outright; in other words, I know, Gary, you've talked about how it was the tip of the spear, helped you get a lot of relationships. So how does that impact your ability to replenish your pipeline going forward?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Frankly, we're very pleased with how this ended up, we're 40% ownership. We think it does maintain all the benefits we were getting out of Capco historically, but also, frankly, gives them the necessary independence to really grow that business. I think we've shared before, we intentionally muted the growth of Capco, just, frankly, because we wanted to direct our capital investments to some of the more IP-led, higher-margin businesses. With their independence, they're now going to get the ability to do that, but yet we're still going to be able to bring them in or they can bring us in from that tip of the spear. We've got a lot of great relationships now with common clients that we've built over the last five plus years.","That also gets to maintain those relationships. The last thing we wanted to do was for our clients where we brought in consulting expertise, to feel like we've abandoned them in that transaction. So we believe this combination really allows us to get the best of both worlds. There'll be several people in FIS involved on the board of Capco going forward. So all-in-all, we think it's kind of the best of both worlds for us.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sounds like a good outcome. And then, just as follow-up, just overall, obviously, the push towards is IP is happening; you did Capco. I mean, is there more to do? I know you have some professional services businesses, some more classic sort of tech outsourcing businesses. While I know it's small, but is there potentially more to do?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We're always looking and hopefully, we've showed that. We've always looked at assets that are within FIS that might work somewhere else, be more strategic under a different ownership structure. We really have right-sized the portfolio very significantly. Frankly, there's a couple of solutions sets that probably would belong somewhere else. But frankly, as we've discussed in the past, some of those are very hard to sell, just given the dynamics of what are going on in those businesses. So we'll continue to look at that, but I would tell you in general, we would say overall the asset pool has been pretty well right-sized over the last 18 to 24 months.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, as always.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Thank you and nice job on the quarter.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, George.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, George.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company, LLC","Two quick modeling questions, if I can ask, one, Woody, when you guys did the SunGard transaction, one of the key things was bringing down the tax rate. You're obviously making good progress there. Is there more room to go below that 30% to 31% tax rate longer-term or is that sort of a good way to think about it going forward? And then just lastly, the mechanics of the minority interest with the 60% Capco sale, I think you said from the $0.11 to $0.12, you'll make up about $0.01 or $0.02 from the 40% share that you still own. Why wouldn't it be higher than that? Why wouldn't it be something closer to $0.04? Just want to make sure I'm understanding that. Thank you.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I'll answer your second question first with regard to it not being $0.04, only being $0.01 to $0.02. The new owners put a little bit more leverage on there in terms of what we would do, and they'll continue to invest heavier as they try to grow that top line within the consulting business. So you're not going to see the same amount of net income that will ultimately pick up our 40% share. That's the biggest delta between just picking up 40% of what we operated it at from a margin profile. The second would be around the discussion point around the revenue growth profile and what it looks like. So, ultimately, we think it'll flow. It'll flow like that.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Great. Just on the tax rate, is there more room for that to go below a 30% longer term, or is this sort of a good way to be thinking about the business? Thank you.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I think the tax rate itself, I think this is probably about where it needs to be, George. We had a bit of a catch-up in Q2, which is around a higher stock-based comp, higher international profits. I'll caveat that with as we continue to see margin expansion outside the U.S. in those lowers rate jurisdictions, we'll continue to see a lower relative tax rate than maybe some others in the business. But 30% to 31% is a pretty low effective tax rate.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","To build on that, George, I mean obviously, we've seen the tax rate come down fairly dramatically, as you pointed out. You'll now start seeing more operating execution. And naturally, as we grow the international business, you'll see benefit from that.","George Mihalos - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks. Nice job, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","All right. Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Just looking at the IFS business and the Payments business, obviously, it's being watered down because of the EMV comparables. What is a more normalized growth rate you think that business can do, and what are the main drivers of that?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, I think if you look, Bryan, frankly, as you're very aware, the predominance of our Payment business is very issuer-centric. So when you look at the issuer side of payments, since we're not doing much on the acquiring side, frankly, we think we'll be a low to potentially mid-single-digit grower.","The team's doing a nice job of rolling out new capabilities across that issuer base. You saw them do a nice job with EMV. We did some nice things with the launch of Apple Pay that actually drove some nice growth. But we're not modeling that business to be a strong single-digit grower. We just don't have the penetration on the acquiring side to do that. A lot of new payment types are coming out in the market, so we're certainly focused on executing against the real-time payments agenda. There are certain new payment types, like Zelle, that are launching.","Frankly, we're always in a wait-and-see mode on those things. We want to capture as much of that opportunity with our clients as we can, but then let the volumes grow. But the nice thing about that business is its predictability and, frankly, the strong margin profile that's thrown off by that business. But the team continues to do a good job, but it's going to be a lower single-digit growth business for us.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Woody, just on the third quarter guide, the $1.04 to $1.06, I think you talked about there's a term fee that's impacting the earnings. I'm just trying to figure out and go back to the notes to see if there's anything else to think about there in the third quarter, in particular, with the big pick-up in the fourth quarter?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","That's really the only thing in the third quarter of last year. What you've got to think about is between the consulting sale and the PS&E sale earlier this year, that's about $0.07 that was in last years' that won't be in this years'. That's partially offset by about $0.02 of debt refi, so you've got about a $0.05 delta just through divestitures this year and the timing associated with those divestitures. That's the biggest issue. As you did mention, last year, we had about $0.03 in the quarter related to a conversion fee in the GFS group.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, helpful. Congrats on the solid results.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. A question on GFS margins. If we were to exclude SunGard cost synergies as well as the consulting sale, what's a good way of thinking about the annualized adjusted EBITDA margin expansion opportunity going forward? And what will be the key drivers in that segment?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, on that, if you go back prior to the SunGard acquisition, we were in the low 20s in terms of margin profile there. We had outlined that we anticipated our international business continue to grow and gain scale and we would expand margins through that, over time, anyway.","You couple that with SunGard and the consulting exit clearly is driving incremental heavier margins. But I would tell you we probably got 300 to 400 basis points of underlying margin improvement before you added synergies and before you got the impact from the SunGard sale. As Gary mentioned, that group is up about 1,100 basis points from that timeframe, and that is a blend between synergies, the absence of consulting longer-term, and then just ongoing scale in the existing businesses that we had, even pre-SunGard.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, so let me just build on that a little bit, Chris, about where the future and what's the opportunity in the future. As we've guided in the past, we think GFS still has more runway with regards to margin expansion, at least at a higher rate than what IFS is. And where those opportunities exist, is we're still on certain businesses in the early stages of right-shoring the talent and getting the people in the right places. Data center consolidation, this will be GFS as well as IFS, will be a big benefit from that as we continue to consolidate. I think we've highlighted on prior calls, we'll be well over 45% of our compute, at least in the U.S., we'll be in some type of cloud-based deployment by the end of this year. That will continue to grow.","And then you've also got product consolidation and modernization. And then you layer on top of that just the execution by our sales team in that market and layering more scale on in the individual markets. All that gives us a lot of confidence in continued margin expansion for that business at a pretty high rate.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And I also wanted to follow-up on the topic around free cash flow conversion. I know you're talking 105% to 115% this year, but I think historically, you've been a little reluctant to guide to anything more than 100% free cash flow conversion. So could you just talk more over the medium-term? I think some of your peers have been a little more aggressive in free cash flow conversion historically. Are you getting any more aggressive in the way that you think about that or how would you want us to think about that? Thanks.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, I think part of it would be around the structural improvement we've talked about.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","That's right.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We're going to see some margin improvement because the consulting business has lower incremental margins. With the removal of that, I would anticipate seeing better margin. And ultimately, that drives better cash flows. So we're not updating our guide around that, feel good about the 105% to 115%, but certainly anticipate EBITDA margins to continue to improve. And if we do what we need to, that should improve cash flows as well","Unknown Speaker","And, Chris, it's Bill. (50:58) The operating teams have done a very nice job of getting very focused to help lower the DSO as well, right? So we continue to want to make sure that we're collecting our cash and as timely as possible. So I don't know that that's a different aggressive stance. I just think, to Woody's point, as you see the transformation that's occurred and the continued execution on our IP-led businesses, you're naturally seeing our DSO come down. You're seeing our free cash flow conversion trend up, and so we feel good about it.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we do have time for one more question and that will come from Jeff Cantwell with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Morning, Jeff.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Morning.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have already been answered, but wanted to see if you could clarify one thing from your updated EPS guidance. I was just wondering if you could isolate the impact on that positive $0.07 to $0.12 you gave in the slide deck. That's from the change in your tax rate. That amount could have an impact of about $0.04 or $0.05 to get to that 30% to 31% range for the full year. I just wondered if that's consistent with your own thinking. Thanks.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes. It's probably in the $0.05 range. As you saw, the second quarter true-up was about a $0.03 benefit, so we're actually seeing that slightly lower in the back half, so about $0.05 is a good estimate there.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Now, I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any closing comments.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you for your questions today, and for your continued interest in FIS. FIS continues to drive change in the industry through our deep focus and investment in financial services. Our expanded scale, operating leverage and investment focus on IP-led solutions aligns to current client demand and is driving shareholder value. This, combined with our year-to-date performance and clear line of sight into the second half of the year, gives us confidence in achieving our full-year results.","I'd like to thank our loyal clients who depend on, and trust us, to keep their businesses running and growing every day. I'd also like to thank our leaders and our more than 53,000 employees for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. With that being said, I'll turn the conference, now, to Ms. Mary Waggoner. Please go ahead.","Mary K. Waggoner","Thank you, Jon. Good morning, and welcome to everyone joining us on the call. Joining me today are Frank Martire, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gary Norcross, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hayford, Chief Financial Officer. Today's news release and supplemental slide presentation have been posted to our website at fisglobal.com. A replay of this morning's call will be available shortly.","Please refer to the Safe Harbor language on Slide 3 of the presentation. Our comments today will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.","Today's discussion will focus on results from continuing operations and will include references to non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide more meaningful comparisons between the periods presented as outlined on Slide 4. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachment to the press release and the supplemental slide presentation. The presentation will begin on Slide 6.","I will now turn the call over to Frank Martire for an overview of first quarter results. Frank?","Frank R. Martire","Thanks, Mary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. ","I'll begin today's business review with a brief summary of our financial performance and business highlights for the first quarter of 2012. Gary will follow with the operations report and Mike will provide additional insight into our financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","We are very pleased with our strong first quarter results. Organic revenue growth improved to 5.3% in the first quarter, driven by solid performance across all businesses. EBITDA increased 10.3% and the EBITDA margin expanded 150 basis points to 28.1%. Earnings per share totaled $0.55, which represents a 22% increase compared to the first quarter of 2011. These results reflect our ongoing focus on increasing organic growth, driving margin expansion and delivering double-digit growth in earnings per share. The team is doing a great job executing the strategy that we described at the Investor Day. ","I will now continue with Slide 7. We are making solid progress in expanding client relationships in all of the markets that we serve. Last week, we hosted the first of several client conferences scheduled for 2012. The discussions we are having with clients indicate that they are increasingly focused on driving future growth given the progress they have made to improve profitability and strengthen their balance sheets. I was also very pleased with the positive feedback regarding our product offerings and integrated solutions. We feel good about the strength of our client relationships. We recently completed 2 solution enhancing acquisitions to further expand our risk, fraud and compliance offerings, which are key areas of focus for financial institutions. These acquisitions support our strategy to buy, build and invest in new products to cross-sell to our clients. Gary and Mike will provide additional details regarding these investments later on the call.","Throughout 2011 and 2012, we have made, and will continue to make, significant investments to improve our overall information security and risk management functions. For example, on March 9, we announced the hiring of Greg Schaffer as our new Chief Information Security Officer. Greg previously worked as Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications for the Department of Homeland Security. On April 17, we announced the hiring of Greg Montana as our new Chief Risk Officer. Greg previously worked as Senior Operational Risk Executive for Bank of America. Both positions report directly to me. We look forward to the additional experience that these 2 new executives bring to FIS.","Overall, I am very encouraged with our strong start to the year and the progress we are making towards achieving our 2012 objectives. We are working hard to maintain this momentum and are committed to executing the strategy that we communicated at our Investor Day. As always, our management team and employees are focused on serving our clients, growing the business and driving value for our shareholders.","One last thing before I turn the call over to Gary. Our ranking as the world's leading FinTech provider is due in large part to the execution of a disciplined, highly successful acquisition strategy. Bill Foley begin laying the foundation for FIS in 2003, with the acquisition of Alltel Information Services, and served as Board Chairman since taking the company public in 2006 through March 2012. On behalf of our board, our management team and our employees around the world, we would like to extend our sincere appreciation to Bill for the outstanding vision and leadership he has contributed in the creation and evolution of our company. We look forward to his ongoing involvement with FIS as Vice Chairman of the Board.","Now I will turn the call over to Gary for the business report. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross","Thanks, Frank, and thanks to everyone for being with us today. My presentation begins on Slide 9. I'll begin with an update on the global sales climate, followed by a summary of business highlights for the quarter. Although the regulatory environment has created challenges for financial institutions, they are moving forward, developing and executing new revenue strategies. We are encouraged by the renewed focus on growth and investing for the future. Ongoing initiatives to improve efficiencies continue to favor outsourcing over in-house solutions. While we anticipate that 2012 will continue to be a time of transition for the financial industry, we believe that the outlook for the banking sector and the economy as a whole is improving.","If you would turn to Slide 10, I will cover some of the business highlights for the quarter beginning with North America.","As Frank mentioned, we hosted the first of 4 annual client conferences last week. The conference was very successful, with more than 1,000 clients in attendance, which is a significant increase compared to last year. Activity surrounding the more than 100 FIS products and services being demoed was high, as was participation in the 130 breakout sessions which included topics ranging from merchant-funded rewards, to chip-based technology, to mobile solutions. In addition to being a great opportunity for our entire team to interact face-to-face with clients, the annual conferences provide valuable insight into how we can best allocate our investment dollars to generate additional cross-selling opportunities.","For example, 2 product acquisitions that we discussed earlier this year at Investor Day, GIFTS and Compliance Coach, and the ongoing enhancements we are making to integrate them with the core are great examples of how our investments are filling product gaps for our clients and driving incremental growth for our company. GIFTS, which is an integrated wire transfer and money management solution, has grown more than 30% through cross-sales to new and existing clients. Compliance Coach, which is a regulatory training and compliance tool, has grown by more than 50% since we acquired the company. We are also seeing good growth in professional services, Channel Solutions and our Global Commercial business. We are very pleased with the solid results in our Payments business, which grew 4.2%, excluding the check-related businesses. We continued to analyze transaction trends, including the impact of the Durbin Amendment, now that the 3 major milestones are behind us. These milestones and results are: First, volumes have held up well since the end of priority routing, which was effective October 1, 2011. Second, transactions have remained consistent post April 1, 2012, which is when the restrictions on network exclusivity went into effect. And third, we're closely monitoring volumes to assess the potential impact on the pricing changes that were implemented by VISA on April 14, 2012.","Next, I will provide an update on our International business on Slide 11. International continues to be a growth driver for our company. While organic growth of 7% in the first quarter is below our full year target, we expect double-digit growth in 2012. Brazil remains a great market for us with strong growth in card volumes and back office services. Growth in Europe is being driven primarily by the Capco Consulting business. However, we are also seeing ongoing demand for discretionary professional services, including the enterprise core platform upgrade for ING that we discussed at Investor Day. The Asia-Pacific region also continues to provide growth opportunities for our company. As we have discussed on prior calls, a number of banks in Asia utilize FIS as their core processing partner. We are seeing increased demand for our comprehensive integrated branch channel solutions and we were very excited to announce our first TouchPoint deal in Thailand earlier this week. We are also very pleased with the success we are having with our Payment Solutions throughout the region.","Moving to Slide 12. Organic growth of 5.3% in the first quarter improved sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, and was driven by solid performance across each of our operating segments. Growth in the higher margin businesses, including Payments, coupled with an ongoing focus on managing cost, contributed to the 150 basis points improvement in the margin. Our shift in strategy from large transformative acquisitions, is allowing us to focus on driving organic growth and optimizing performance across our company. As we discussed at our Annual Investor Day, we are targeting 3 areas to drive improvement, including revenue growth, focusing resources on high growth businesses and strong cost management. And we are executing on that strategy.","Turning to Slide 13. Similar to the GIFTS and Compliance Coach deals that I discussed earlier, ongoing investment in targeted product acquisitions are key components of our plan to sell more solutions across our extensive client network. This past Monday, we announced 2 product-focused acquisitions that support our strategy to provide end-to-end fraud, risk and compliance solutions to our clients. The first acquisition, ICS Risk Advisors, provides outsourced risk management and regulatory compliance programs to community institutions, as well as several top-tier banks. The second, Memento, provides enterprise fraud solutions to global financial institutions including 7 of the top 25 banks in the U.S. These products, which complement our earlier Compliance Coach acquisition, are great examples of investments we are making to help our clients address some of their most pressing challenges, including managing through an increasingly more complex regulatory environment.","Next, if you will turn to Slide 14, I'll provide an update on the investments we are making to improve information security across FIS.","As you recall, FIS experienced a cyber attack on our Sunrise platform in the first quarter of 2011. The financial impact related to the breach was borne solely by FIS, as previously reported. At that time, we took immediate steps to notify the affected clients and to remediate the problem. We also hired 2 third-party firms to conduct an independent review of our information security. Our executive management team and our Board of Directors have been actively engaged in the company's information security and risk management functions before, during and after the Sunrise event. Based on the nature of our business, FIS is periodically reviewed by the regulatory agencies that govern financial institutions. Upon completion of an interim review in late 2011, the regulators issued a confidential examination report to FIS related to information security and risk management. We responded to this report and described the actions that we have taken, and will take, to address the requested enhancements. The regulatory agencies distributed a letter to our clients in March of 2012, describing the requested improvements, along with acknowledging FIS's commitment to make the improvements. We are working closely with our customers to respond to their questions and update them on our progress. Our conversations have been very productive, and importantly, we did not see any significant impact on results in the first quarter.","Overall, we believe the steps we have already taken to improve information security, together with the additional investments that we are making in 2012, will result in FIS being an even better, stronger company.","In closing, I'd like to leave you with the following key takeaways, which are outlined on Slide 15. We are very pleased with our strong first quarter performance and the progress we are making to improve organic growth and drive margin expansion. We are delivering on our product-focused M&A strategy. Information security remains a top priority at FIS and we have made substantial progress against our planned enhancements. We remain focused on serving our clients and executing our business strategy.","Again, thank you for joining us this morning. I'll now turn it over to Mike for the financial report.","Michael D. Hayford","Thanks, Gary.","I'll begin on Slide 17 with a summary of our first quarter results. Revenue increased 4.6% to $1.4 billion in the first quarter. Organic growth, after being normalized for currency, was 5.3%, driven by growth in processing volumes, transaction growth and higher professional services revenue. First quarter EBITDA increased 10.3% to $406 million. The EBITDA margin expanded 150 basis points to 28.1%, reflecting growth in account processing, payment transactions, disciplined cost management and lower severance and integration costs compared to the first quarter of 2011. Also, as you will recall, the prior year quarter included a $13 million loss related to the Sunrise platform. In 2012, we are making significant investments to enhance overall security and risk management as Gary and Frank described earlier. These incremental investments were included in the guidance that we provided at our Investor Day.","Detail on the operating segments, starting with FSG, begins on Slide 18.","Financial Solutions revenue increased 7% to $539 million compared to the first quarter of 2011, driven by growth in data processing, professional services and global commercial services. Financial Solutions' EBITDA increased 7.1% to $209 million compared to $195 million in 2011 first quarter. EBITDA margin increased slightly compared to the prior year.","As shown on Slide 19, Payment Solutions revenue increased 2.6% to $631 million and increased 4.2% excluding the Check businesses. We are seeing nice growth across our electronic Payments business, which have partially offset the lower volumes in the Check business. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 13.7% to $249 million compared to $219 million in the first quarter of 2011. EBITDA margin increased 380 basis points to 39.5% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 35.7% in the first quarter of 2011 due to growth in transaction volumes and an ongoing focus on cost management.","Turning to International on Slide 20. International revenue increased 3.2% to $277 million and grew 7.1% on an organic basis, excluding a $10 million currency headwind. As Gary mentioned, we benefited from strong transaction services growth in Brazil, as well as growth in Europe driven primarily by Capco. International EBITDA increased 5.1% to $51 million compared to $49 million in the prior-year quarter. The margin increased 40 basis points to 18.6%.","On Slide 21, corporate overhead totaled $104 million in the first quarter of 2012. These results exclude approximately $19 million for the accelerated vesting of equity grants and a non-compete payment related to change in board responsibilities and executive roles. We expect corporate overhead to average approximately $95 million per quarter for the remainder of 2012.","Slide 22 provides a reconciliation of net earnings. First quarter net earnings from continuing operations increased 17.8% to $162 million compared to $138 million in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings per share from continuing operations, as adjusted, increased 22.2% to $0.55 per share compared with $0.45 per share in the first quarter of 2011. Our reported GAAP numbers are adjusted for the after-tax impact of purchased price amortization of $42 million or $0.14 per share. Also excluded from our adjusted results are after-tax costs of $12 million or $0.04 per share in debt refinancing costs and $12 million or $0.04 per share related to the accelerated equity compensation and non-compete costs that I described earlier.","Weighted average shares totaled 295 million in the first quarter of 2012, down from approximately 309 million shares in the first quarter of 2011. The effective tax rate was approximately 34%.","As shown on Slide 23, cash flow from operations totaled $204 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $260 million in the prior year. The decline was largely due to a final payment of $42 million related to an interest rate swap assumed in the Metavante acquisition. As a reminder, we expect to make a payment of approximately $28 million to our Brazil joint venture partner in the second quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures totaled $65 million in the first quarter, which resulted in free cash flow of $136 million compared to $130 million in the prior-year quarter.","Beginning this quarter, we have modified our definition of free cash flow to exclude the impact of net changes in settlement, assets and liabilities. These timing difference, associated with the movement of customer funds in our Payment business, that generally clear the following day, we believe that excluding these timing differences provides a better measure of our ability to convert earnings to cash and is a measurement that we will use going forward.","On Slide 24, we have received very positive feedback regarding the strategy that we presented at Investor Day, and are executing to that plan. As illustrated in this slide, we are investing for growth, including the $65 million in CapEx that I mentioned earlier. We continue to focus on strengthening the balance sheet. Mandatory debt payments totaled approximately $59 million in the first quarter. Debt outstanding was $4.8 billion and the weighted average interest rate was 4.7% at quarter end as summarized in the appendix. Debt to EBITDA was unchanged at 2.8x.","In February, our board approved a fourfold increase in the dividend to $0.20 per quarter, which resulted in $59 million in shareholder dividends in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $15 million in the first quarter of 2011. We repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares during the first quarter for a total cost of $101 million. Also in February, we announced a new $1 billion purchase authorization, and we anticipate executing approximately $250 million in share repurchases on an annual basis.","If you'll turn to Slide 25, I'll provide an overview of our recent debt refinancing.","In March, we issued an additional $700 million in 10-year unsecured notes at 5% and used the net proceeds to reduce the Term Loan B. We also extended the maturities on our Term Loan A and revolver to 2017 and reduced the spread by 25 basis points. We're making good progress towards achieving investment-grade credit ratings. In March, Fitch increased our rating to BBB- and S&P increased our rating to BB+. S&P subsequently revised its outlook for FIS from stable to positive.","In summary, our recent actions: first, extended the overall duration by approximately 2 years; second, reduced the weighted average interest rate to 4.7%; and third, substantially advanced our progress towards achieving an investment-grade rating.","Now turning to Slide 26. As Gary and Frank mentioned, as part of our new strategy that we discussed at Investor Day, we are focusing our M&A activity on buying, building or investing in products to cross-sell across our distribution network. The ICS and Memento deals, which have a combined purchase price of approximately $40 million, complements our existing risk and compliance products and are part of our strategy to provide end-to-end risk management solutions to our clients. Similar to the smaller product deals that we've done in the past, we believe these new offerings will pay ongoing dividends for FIS and our clients. We continued to look for opportunities like these to further build out our overall product offerings.","Before I open the line for questioning, I will provide a few takeaway points from today's overview as summarized on Slide 27.","We are encouraged by the strong first quarter operating results and the progress we are making to achieve our full year objectives. We take information securities very seriously. The additional cost of the investments we are making are included in the guidance as we discussed during our Investor Day in February. As Gary mentioned, we did not see a significant negative impact on first quarter results as a result of the regulatory letter. We continue to communicate with our clients regarding our progress and are closely monitoring sales activity for any potential future impact.","We are executing the business strategy we communicated at Investor Day including, first of all, driving organic growth and margin expansion. Second, we are making progress in executing our capital allocation plan, including extending the duration of our debt, reducing the weighted average interest rate and working towards achieving an investment grade rating on our debt. Third, we returned $160 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter. And we completed 2 small product acquisitions aimed at driving future cross-sales, which is consistent with the M&A strategy we presented during our Investor Day.","Operator, we can now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, go to the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, I guess the first question, maybe for Gary. If there's any way to give us a little bit more color on the sales activity and new bookings activity in the quarter, either from a year-over-year or even sequential perspective? Any way to sort of quantify the overall market and how you're been doing?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, Glenn. No, it's a great question. We typically don't disclose what our actual sales details are but our sales for the quarter were strong. The nice thing about our company is we've got a very diversified product portfolio. So where we see some maybe lumpiness in International, we see a pickup in global commercial services or if we see a slowdown in other areas. But the quarter, we had strong results. They were ahead of what they were in Q1 of last year. And so, based on the feedback that we got through our investor show and others, we feel confident about the year. I mean, the team's very focused and we're starting to see people talk a lot about coming out of this regulatory issue, this economy and how to get back to growing their financial institutions and their other businesses we serve.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Any sense that discretionary sort of spending decisions have improved or loosened a bit?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, I think it's too early to say. I mean, we certainly -- as we shared in our prepared remarks, we see some positive trends around spending. I mean, certainly the increase in conference attendance, I think, is an indication that people are getting back out in the market and wanting to start understanding ways they can grow their financial institutions, and as I've said, we've got a lot of activity in the sales force.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Mike, on the EBITDA margin up 150 basis points, obviously, tracking well above your full year 40 to 80 basis point expectation. Sort of how should we think about it? Was there sort of some timing of expenses? Obviously, you had the Sunrise grow-over which helped a little bit but not a lot. Maybe just a little more color on the 150 basis points relative to the 40, 80 guide for the year.","Michael D. Hayford","Well, I mean, first, I'd say we're very pleased with the number. Obviously, it's a good start to the year. It is -- for the full year, we're still very comfortable with the expectations we set. The first year -- or the first quarter, year-over-year, obviously had -- that comp from last year, had Sunrise in it. So if you normalize out Sunrise, we're in the band with that, that you'd expect for the full year. Now again, when we give expectations, we didn't strip Sunrise out. But I think on a quarter-to-quarter, it's a little bit more impact. Full year, again, we're pleased with the start. We're particularly pleased -- we had a very strong quarter in Payments, the work that Gary's team has done to really drive the cost and then you have a business like that which has so much leverage and the volumes come back. They drop right to the bottom line, so we're encouraged by that start.","Operator","And next we'll go to Dave Koning from Robert W. Baird.","Nathan J. Novak - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Nathan Novak on the line for Dave Koning. Could you expand a little bit on the lumpiness that you're seeing in International, what's causing that? Are you seeing just a fairly normalized accounts being added in Brazil?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. Nate, I'll take that one. Our international business always has a little lumpiness on the sales side. So I wouldn't read anything into it. We've got, actually, one of the largest pipelines we've had in International. We had a very strong sales quarter. The reality is, where you start seeing lumpiness is whether that's more license-oriented or more services-oriented. The first quarter, we had a lot of services-oriented business which, obviously, we get that revenue over the term of the agreement. Brazil was very strong. I mean we're continuing to see nice growth in both -- not only accounts but also transactions. We're also seeing nice growth in our EBITDA margins as we're bringing on more scale to those environments. So, yes, we're still very bullish on our international markets and we think we'll have a good year.","Frank R. Martire","Nate, the other think you see -- Brazil, agreements are strong, capital in Europe is very strong. But we had a very strong fourth quarter in International and sometimes you'll see that, where people will flush out their budgets at the end of the year and then start in the next year it's a little slower. So like, again, I think to Gary's point, to the full year we still are very confident of that business. The first quarter -- with the strong fourth quarter not necessarily unexpected.","Nathan J. Novak - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. Gary, could you expand on any type of impacts you're seeing on the NYCE network from Durbin, of the interchangeables that have been in place for a couple of quarters now and the dual brand requirements up for about a month now. Anything specifically that you're seeing there?","Gary A. Norcross","Honestly, Nate, we're not. We're actually continuing to see very good volumes in our NYCE network. We're seeing nice growth there. It's too early to tell, on the Visa pricing changes, they've just recently gone in. But as I shared earlier with those first 2 milestones, actually, we've seen no impact and that business continues to grow for us very nicely. So the team has done well executing the selling of NYCE across our financial institutions. We're seeing, just like Mike mentioned, good strong transaction growth in the first quarter across all of our Payments businesses, and of course, NYCE is going to be the recipient of that. Being a network, a lot of those transactions.","Nathan J. Novak - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Excellent, excellent. Good to hear. And the just last, housekeeping one for me. Do you have an assumption on the R&D tax credit implied with your 34% tax rate function? I mean, if that does not get passed, if that does not get renewed, does your tax rate guidance have to change?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. I think we anticipate and plan for a -- it's not a huge impact for us. The tax, the R&D tax credit. But I would say, our team continues to look for other ways get benefits. So I think we're comfortable with the 34%.","Operator","And next we'll go to David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Could you sort of walk us through, as you usually do, the unit pricing trends in Financial Solutions, going from Community Banks to mega banks, unit pricing and demand trends? And have you seen any change on a quarter-over-quarter basis?","Gary A. Norcross","You know, Dave, we really haven't. We watch this very closely. It's a very competitive environment out there. In the community bank markets, we continue to see the person with the most broadest comprehensive solutions, we see that as a competitive advantage. But with that being said, as you move up market, you get into more pricing compression and more competitive because more competitors start coming into the mix. So, honestly, we're not seeing any material change in that. We continue to see good growth in our sales pipeline. We're seeing good results out of our sales engine. The interactions we're having, not only with our clients, but our prospects are all positive. But at the end of the day, it's still a competitive market out there, and so we're not seeing any material change.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Have you seen any pickup in spending at the mega banks, just given the increased focused on growth that you highlighted earlier?","Gary A. Norcross","We are. Our conversations are increasing in that area as well. As we've shared on prior calls, we certainly, through this economic crisis, are now having conversations with the very large financial institutions that were different prior to the economic collapse. They were much more mono-line engaged. We were seeing -- where they would do a lot of their services in-house. And so as the result of that, we've seen a very nice increase in our professional services business through the LFI base. And we're also seeing our conversations broadened with regards to the type of solutions we're targeting. So we're very positive on what's going on in the LFI. I think we've shared before, we've got a dedicated team in that market, which has helped a lot. Capco has helped a lot as they come in and they're opening a lot of doors. So those moves, the move of Capco, the move of a dedicated sales force, the economic impact to the LFI's, conversations have definitely changed. And I think you're seeing it in the last several quarters in how much our professional services business has been growing and you'll see it in the future in our other sales as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","One question. Can you just go through the security issue again? I know you outlined it pretty nicely, but I'm confused about sort of what triggered the investigation, what the findings were and then kind of what the remediation -- if there's remediation that needed to occur or is this -- kind of give us, can you just go through that again, for us, in more detail?","Gary A. Norcross","Sure. I'll be happy to do that, Brett. I mean, we've always taken security at FIS very seriously. As you know, we're regulated by the same government bodies that regulate financial institutions. Our review cycle is every 2 years. But in the interim year, they'll have an interim review. And so, based on the Sunrise management, we had 2 different third parties come in and review our whole enterprise. Because frankly, as being the largest FinTech provider we felt, if we could be exposed, honestly anybody could be. And so we realized the significance of this as an industry issue. We realized that we're helping our clients each and every day deal with these situations. So we wanted to bring in 2 comprehensive third-party reviews. We did that. As we've shared with you, we're implementing a lot of changes. We think they're all very positive. Some of them around staffing, some of them are around architecture. These are things that you're going to have to have ongoing. As we came through our interim review cycle, the regulatory body agreed that we need to make some changes. They decided to communicate that that to our clients. We've been in, really, constant communication with our clients on this topic. We're very proactive, we've been very transparent about all these issues. The conversations have been very positive. Our clients appreciate all we're doing and they realize the severity of what's going on in the industry and they appreciate us stepping up and taking care of these things. So we're continuing to work with the regulatory body as we always have and we are going to continue to implement our plans as we discussed at Investor Day and earlier.","Frank R. Martire","We just finished a client conference and we spent a lot of time with over 1,000 clients. I mean, we talked to them on this subject and all. And they just feel really good about the communication we've had with them, the progress we're making, the working relationship we have with them. And so that's going very, very well. And we have another client conference coming up soon and we expect the same results out of that.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just one last issue. A little bit on the NYCE network again. Have you guys had any pin debit wins now that the network exclusivity has come into effect? Anything that you can tell us about?","Gary A. Norcross","No, as a mentioned earlier, we have. The sales team has just done an excellent job promoting our NYCE network. Not only across our client base but across other financial institutions that we don't have a major core, a major debit engagement with. And so, we have had some nice wins, and we continue to see good growth out of that business. We're also excited about some of the innovation that we're doing in that group as well, that we talked a little bit about at Investor Day, and there'll be more things coming. So all in all, we feel great about that business.","Operator","And next, go to Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Gary, can you talk a little bit about the card processing business in the U.S.? Are you guys moving upmarket at all and competing for maybe some larger portfolios with TSYS and First Data or are you kind of staying in the smaller end, as far as size of institutions?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, Greg it's a good question. We've always had some sizable institutions, especially on our debit card business, and we continue to sell very effectively in that market. Our credit card business, we've got a number of large institutions. We are not seeing as much movement on credit card. Frankly, that's a pretty stable market. The clients we have, we're seeing growth on and so that business had a good year last year and we expect it to have a good year this year. But we absolutely believe we have a very, very competitive footprint in credit on the card side. So as we move, if and when that market starts evaluating alternatives, we'll certainly be positioned to take advantage of that. Of course, that has done very well in our international markets, as highlighted by the Brazil joint venture and some of the other announcements we made. Debit, as I said, we've always been strong in the, what we would consider larger institutions, and we continued to compete and win business there. Our prepaid business, also, we can't lose sight of that. We've got a nice balance of prepaid and we really have 2 platforms. We have a platform that's focused on community institutions and a platform that's really focused on very, very large issuers, and we have a huge position in that space. So across the board, the sales team, we think, continues to do a good job maximizing those opportunities.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, Mike, on the 2 acquisitions. I apologize if I missed this, but have you given the revenue contribution we should expect and have those deals closed at this point?","Michael D. Hayford","They have both closed. We did not share the revenue expectation. And I think, again, on those deals, you can see the magnitude. $40 million in purchase price, they're smaller deals. They're specifically focused on targets, on -- sorry, private companies that have -- they're in areas where we expect to see a fair amount growth. You can see risk and compliance, as Gary talked about, is a fairly hot area for the marketplace. And the team there has built a nice strategy, they've identified a comprehensive solution and these are 2 things they wanted to go fill in, fill out that product suite. So, the goal is to get them, the relative early stage, and then to grow them aggressively using our distribution.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. So just your standard, good product, limited distribution, pumping through your distribution channel, grow it dramatically?","Frank R. Martire","Yes. Solid products and high demand by our clients also.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Perfect. Okay, and then just lastly, as we're looking to model 2Q, just anything special we should think about kind of 2Q relative to 1Q? We've got sort of a normal, seasonal uptick we expect in your business. But any other items in the year ago quarter, anything else we should be thinking about?","Michael D. Hayford","The only thing we called out is the cash payment to our JV partner in Brazil which, obviously, [ph] cash flow. But other than that -- again, I referenced that first quarter was a really strong, clean financial result. There wasn't anything unique or onetime nature in there. A real strong performance in Payments, so we're encouraged by that as we head in the second quarter, but there's nothing in the second quarter, particularly year-over-year, that would be of a nature to call out.","Operator","Our next question is from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Roman Leal in for Julio. First, I want to follow-up on the M&A theme. What are some other product sets that you would like to enhance or add to your suite of offerings or what are some of these other hot topics, hot areas in Financial Solutions?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, Roman, this is Gary. I'll start and then I'm sure the other guys will want to chime in. But at the end of the day, what's nice about our transition to a more product-focused acquisition is the business lines are now reaching out and driving through their strategy a lot of these opportunities. But as we mentioned earlier, risk, fraud and compliance is a very, very exciting area. You've already seen us do 2 here. When you start thinking about some of the innovation that's going on around payments, innovation that's going on around mobile. There's some exciting concepts around that. So it's really based on our client demand. So as we talked about, when we were at our last conference, one of the great things is really getting that feedback from our clients. And we want these product acquisitions to not only be geared towards where our business lines want to see the strengths go. But also where our clients want us to take them and so it's a real nice mix across risk, across payments, across delivery. We've got some opportunities that we think would help to grow some of our international businesses along those lines.","Frank R. Martire","So, Roman, as we look at it, we just step back, we listen carefully to our clients. So we may decide to build it, put a lot into investment, as you know, for the future, for the clients. Or if in fact, the right thing is to acquire it, that's what we'll do. But it's always by listening to what the client's needs are.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And was slightly surprised to hear your commentary about the lack of activity in credit. Was that comment more specifically related to the large banks? Are you seeing that in large financial institutions or is that across-the-board?","Gary A. Norcross","No, I was dealing, specifically, on credit card new sales. I thought that was the question. Obviously, there's a lot of strong demand around some of the credit offerings on lending, consumer, commercial, especially small business. Seeing a lot of activity in that area. So I was addressing the comment strictly towards credit card sales in the large bank market and we haven't seen much movement in that area in recent years, where people are moving from one solution to another. But we do have a very, very competitive platform for credit card processing and actually have some large institutions.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one last one on the International side. Can you just give anything you want to share on the pipeline? How strong that looks versus a year ago?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, as I mentioned -- I mean, the pipeline is very strong. We had a good quarter. As I said, it's always hard to predict because we have a higher percentage in international license fees, more software sales. So that's what gets some of the lumpiness in the quarters. But we had a good strong quarter in sales, we've got a good strong pipeline, we feel good about our double-digit growth going into the year. And so we feel good about it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to ask about Europe, I guess. Some of the IT services firms have been talking about some of the European firms being more open to outsourcing. I'm curious if you're seeing that at all? And if so, would the newer deals change in the way of mix shift between license sales to maybe more traditional processing or would you need to take over assets? I'm just curious what's happening on the ground because it seems like a lot is changing.","Michael D. Hayford","Yes. I mean we, I think, are fairly bullish on Europe. Notwithstanding the challenges that the economies have, as well as the FIs. We've seen the discretionary spend, particularly around Capco, continue to be very strong. So we look at that when institutions are spending on Professional Services, that's an indication that they are using discretionary dollars. Those are typically the first things they cut back on and we've, as we referenced, had a very strong quarter in that area. But we would agree with that sentiment. As the European banks continue to have pressure and financial pressures and have to look at ways to cut costs and do things differently, that they would be more open to outsourcing, more open to using a leverage model. We've seen that, in our FIS and Capco teams, working jointly over in Europe, sourcing a lot of opportunities. We haven't seen a lot of -- we've got a couple of relationships over there, that we've had, that are outsourced. I'd say the pipeline and activity is very active, we'd like to see some of those hit. But we think those institutions have to consider -- reconsider their model, look more out externally and look at a leveraged provider like FIS.","Frank R. Martire","Yes, we strongly believe that's the case and what makes us feel good, is we're well positioned for it, as Mike just talked about. Both for our current offerings and with the addition of Capco and the capabilities they have.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Just on the Sunrise issue, just to clarify. I know there' been a lot of questions on that now. Could it have any impact on your client prospecting? I mean, I get that there's going to be more costs and things to deal with, but just on the prospecting side, how's that going to change?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, at this point in time, we haven't seen any change in that. I mean, as far as the cost, we had it build into our guidance for the full year. We've talked about that. We think you're going to have to have an ongoing diligence to these type of issues going forward. But as we mentioned, we had a very large conference last week. We had a lot of prospects there, the engagement was very, very strong. And so, as I said, the pipeline indicators, the sales results for Q1, we're confident in the year.","Michael D. Hayford","I think the reality is the institutions, they have to ask questions, they have to follow up as part of their vendor management plan. They are doing that. Our teams have to be more active communicating, as Frank and Gary have both talked about, we're out -- very transparent, proactive with them on the issue and then more importantly, what we're doing. It's good and bad. It's a lot of work, a lot more communication that we have to do, the sales teams have to work a lot harder. The good thing is we get in front those clients, in front of the executives, more frequently than we otherwise would. And as Gary mentioned, those conversations, we spend a portion of the conversation explaining what we're doing. And then you spend a portion of the conversation talking about what else we can do for you. But it is, it's more work, it's hard work and we got to keep hammering through that, throughout the year.","Frank R. Martire","And we just see it as the course of business, things we have to do and we'll continue to do.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And I'm sorry you had to deal with it. Last one then I'll jump off. And a lot of questions on Durbin II. Just -- I know the VISA pricing strategy looks pretty aggressive to when the merchant business -- I'm curious, at a high level, without giving details, what else can you do beyond cutting price to sort of protect your base? I mean is there a chance to maybe bundle more network services with your core, I'm just curious if there's other creative ways to sort of deal with that situation.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. Now, that's exactly what we're doing, I mean, as I've said we've had great growth in that business over the last year. And we're doing a lot of bundling today. I mean we bundled it with our debit offerings, we've bundled it with our core offerings. We're doing some innovation, ourself, across that, that we are talking to clients about. And so as I've said, we've monitored it very close, because I think this question has come up on a number of calls. And as you would expect, we don't know what the impact of some of these things are going to be. You just have to monitor it. But so far, we've actually seen no impact through this process. And at the end of the day, it still comes back to offering the most comprehensive solution you can in the market. And those things work to our advantage given the fact that we have that.","Operator","And next we'll go to Ashwin Shirvaikar.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, my first question is the trend towards outsourcing increasing, that's obviously good news. You've said the pipeline is strong a couple of times. I wanted to ask more about, if there's anything in the pipeline that's different in terms of size or complexity or margin profile or is it pretty much a normal looking pipeline?","Gary A. Norcross","No, we have a good solid pipeline across all of our markets. I would tell you we're seeing backdoor outsourcing. We're seeing stronger demand in global commercial services than what we've seen in the past. Once again, I think that's just our ability to leverage our scale on an outsourcing basis. So that's all positive. Our focus with Capco, in the LFI space, is starting to produce results as well. That's driving more services businesses and that will truly trend, over time, to more outsourcing as well. So we feel good about all the segments. The companies have come together very cleanly. We've got a very focused sales engine and the moves we feel we've made in the last year are starting to pay benefits across all of those segments.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And I can understand the beneficial EBITDA grow-over related to the Sunrise event last year, but your revenue growth also is above the range and that guidance not changed. Is that just being conservative with the outlook or is there anything in the timing of upcoming conversions?","Michael D. Hayford","No. I mean it's, we were just slightly over 5, our range is 3 to 5. We had a great start to the year. I mean we'll see how we do second, third quarter, but it's early in the year. Again, we're very excited about the strong start, as you referenced, both revenue and earnings. We'd rather start this way, obviously, than be having the other discussion. But it's a great start, it's in the bandwidth we expect.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And the other expense of, I think, $20.9 million. What's in there? I apologize if you already addressed that one.","Michael D. Hayford","Yes, I mean, it's 2 things. One was refinancing costs where we issued the bonds, the $700 million of 5% bonds. And then we re-did our bank facility, our TLA and our revolver, and that's just financing debt -- or financing costs.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So that's onetime in nature?","Michael D. Hayford","Absolutely.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Last, I guess the Capco. Can you just remind me when the large client loss grow happened or has it already happened?","Michael D. Hayford","That was -- first, second quarter last year, they had the revenue, so it started hitting in the third quarter. Right now, it's kind of the peak of where they had strong numbers last year, that we're hitting, and they're doing a nice job.","Frank R. Martire","We're very pleased at the strength on the capital front, both on the European side and North America.","Operator","And next, go to Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","I was trying to understand maybe where bank spending is today versus it was last year. You've done a really good job. You look at the organic growth this quarter and it was very strong. And I'm trying to parse out execution versus market. I know this is a difficult question, but any thoughts on where maybe the market is growing relative to how you're doing?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, I mean, if you break it up, in kind of the things we talked about, professional services continues to be very strong. We like that as an indicator, that banks are spending discretionary dollars. Again, when the market went down and went down fast, professional services went away quickly. So we've continued to see strength in that, which is an indication that banks are looking forward, doing projects, spending money. Payments, as you can see, strong, pretty good organic -- adjust for organic growth if you strip out the paper, north of 4%, which is pretty strong compared to last few quarters, and importantly the profits there. So we think that's volumes coming back. And then, again, Europe for us has continued to do quite well. Again, in a market that the economy and the banks are challenged but we think that's forcing change and forcing spending with companies like us. So I think it's probably the same message we've had in the last couple of years, steady incremental improvement. We don't expect it to take a big jump at any point, but we're encouraged that it continues to move forward.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. To build on that, Kart -- I mean, if you look at our sales success throughout 2011, obviously, we've had good steady execution from our business lines implementing those sales. Obviously, more outsourcing engagements take time, right? To go through the implementation and so there's a lag effect that these sales come online, and so we continue to see good movement in our sales engine. And as Mike said, the services engine and all that continues to positive, good steady growth.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just, Gary, on the payments side. We see all the national banks offering mobile banking and wanting some of the other products. As far as community and regional banks, are you seeing the same type of demand for other products on the payment side as well or are they still being a little cautious on when you spend money on kind of ancillary products in that area?","Gary A. Norcross","No, not At all. We're seeing strong demand across all of our markets in the U.S., around mobile, around -- which we have a full solution set around mobile, not only payments but also mobile banking. We're seeing strong demand around some of the innovative products around payment wallets, etc., and all of those things we're well positioned on. So the community markets are starting. As we've shared in the past, there were 2 -- really, 2 types of institutions. There were institutions that were hanging on and there were institutions that had worked through, either their regulatory challenges and\/or their economic challenges, and they were looking to spend. And naturally, they're looking at some of the new innovation coming online to help them compete. So you just got there a small institution that doesn't eliminate their need to compete with the large institutions, and so we're seeing good demand there.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Heckmann with Avondale Partners.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about the -- again, with this letter from the regulatory bodies. You had talked about it being distributed to clients. Some of the media reports I read indicated that it was distributed to all domestic banks and credit unions. Is that correct?","Frank R. Martire","Well, we actually don't know. I mean, you'd have to ask the regulatory agencies around who they actually sent it to. We believe most of our clients got it. We have not been contacted by all of our clients. We've proactively sent out letters to our clients talking about this. Based on the interaction we have, we can't confirm that every single client we have has actually received a letter. And certainly, we don't know if all FIs have received that letter.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess the implication or -- well, it's a confidential letter, some of the language indicated that -- I guess, what I inferred was that the regulators were unhappy with the speed of your response to their October letter. Is that an accurate assessment?","Frank R. Martire","Well, I would actually say, no. It's probably slightly different. Again, to put it in context, that we had a breach a little over year ago. We discussed our breach, we've notified all the clients impacted, we were the only ones who had a financial loss. We talked about it on our call. And as Gary said, then we took numerous steps. Because, as good as you think you are in security, once you have a breach, you realize you have to get better. So we hired 2 different outside firms, we spent money and focus on improving security throughout 2011. The regulators came in as part of the normal process to come in and do an interim review in the fall of last year. That referenced us to something they had recommended we do organizationally. We have looked at that, we have done that. But the reference to -- we'd like you to have -- it was a really reporting on the tech service side, so they had suggested we do. And again, we've complied with that at this point. We haven't done it in October because we've been very focused on addressing and improving security up to that point.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then moving over to the discontinued operations in item processing. You're going about 2 years since you put that in discontinued operations. What do you think is the eventual outcome there? Is that something you might see wind down in the near future?","Michael D. Hayford","Yes. That's the Brazilian BPO, we call it, or Brazilian item processing, and actually, kind of back office lock box down in Brazil. That business is effectively shut down. We're working through labor claims down there, so it's employee claims that are just -- what's driving the cost. But the business itself, we divested some, the clients took pieces back in-house and then we shut others down. But the business operations are effectively shut down. We're simply dealing with claims out of labor disputes.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. And the labor rules, in Brazil, take typically about 3 years to work through. So it's a fairly long process in Brazil, and as Mike said, we're just working through that as a normal course.","Operator","And we'll go to Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I just wanted to try reconcile some, I guess, commentary around the International business. You talk about being lumpy, but then you've got a mix towards services. So it seems like it's pretty positive. I'm wondering, if we think about pulling Capco into that equation and the mandates and the discussions that you're having, is it the conviction that you have, with those discussions in Capco, that have giving you the confident that International can get to the long-term number that you gave for the full year guide? Or do you see mandates in software that we didn't see -- that we can't see from here, that are also giving you that conviction? I'm just trying to see if they tie together at all.","Gary A. Norcross","Well, Dan, we look at international holistically, including Capco. And consulting is growing very nicely in the European market. But our overall business on software and services is growing very nicely as well. Well, frankly, what gives us confidence is looking at the joined pipeline of both and we're seeing a strong demand and we've got -- we're having a lot of strong sales conversations today, across both, not only consulting but also Professional Services as Mike mentioned, as also software sales as indicated by the TouchPoint success in Thailand this quarter. So it's really just looking at the pipeline, looking how the sales teams are executing across the board, looking at our volumes growth. It actually is positive that we're seeing more swing towards more outsourcing and more services because that does give a much more stable base and easier to predict. But as you can see in that business -- I mean if a license fee slides from one quarter to the next, I mean, it can provide a lumpiness. So we're very confident in our double-digit growth for international and that's all based on the combined pipelines of all of our businesses.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just, I'm not going to beat this thing to death. But with Capco are you -- I'm just trying to think through the mandates that you would expect, right? Part of the reason you got this thing was to have these much higher-level discussions and it sounds like you're having those. So are these more holistic mandates that you're having at these discussion levels or are they still kind of piecemealing these things together?","Gary A. Norcross","No, not all. We're having some very, very broad discussions with a lot of our clients, very holistically, on how to materially transform these institutions and allowed them to be on a much more competitive basis. And I would tell you, those conversations have been very strong. As you would expect, these are big complex deals. And so we continue to work through them but the level of conversation we're having is exactly what we expected. We have had some success, as well, along those lines. And so we believe that the fundamental reason why we bought Capco still exists today, to drive broader conversations within the LFI market space, in both Europe and North America, and so we feel confident about that.","Frank R. Martire","And, Dan, that's working for us. And I think as we look at Capco, we look at it twofold. One is, the visibility and exposure, gets us at very senior levels and to all institutions globally, in conjunction with FIS. And secondly, don't forget Capco has its own independent plans and what it's doing as a business, that we're very pleased with, as we're going forward. So, on both fronts, we're feeling good about it.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. It sounds like it's been a good asset for you guys. On the Payments margin, again, being so much stronger. I'm trying to balance how much of that should we be thinking is really volumes coming back relative to cost takeout. Because I'm just wondering, if it's cost takeout is that something that we could see accelerate, in terms of margin expansion throughout the year, all else equal in volumes?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, I mean, as we shared at Investor Day, we took some strong initiatives to address our cost, third and fourth quarter. We're seeing the results of that. We're also seeing good strong transaction volumes as well and you're seeing the leverage that comes out of a business like that. And so we're very confident in the Payments business. We're very pleased with the leadership we have there and what the results of that business is showing. We don't believe that the transaction volumes that you're seeing is going to require us to put those costs back in. I think it was a more -- we just made some changes to more effectively optimize those businesses. And so it just shows, not only the leverage of our operating model, which we talked about at Investor Day, but also the leverage of our revenue model as additional growth comes on.","Michael D. Hayford","I think, Dan, you kind just in the see the numbers, in terms of the overall revenue growth versus the earnings, just on a dollar. So you can -- I mean, the simple lever is those businesses have a high degree of leverage and so that incremental dollar revenue coming on, obviously, comes on a good margin. And so the paper revenues going away, as you can see. And the team has done a phenomenal job of managing profitability in the paper business, even as some of that revenues decline. But then as electronic transactions are coming on board, that is driving very high margin for us. So it's electronics business coming on board with the cost management driving very good profit.","Mary K. Waggoner","And I think we have one person waiting.","Operator","And that will be Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The financial segment, that's what surprised me the most this quarter. I think third quarter maybe was up 1%, fourth quarter maybe up 2%, now up 7%. I just want to be sure, what's driving that acceleration and how sustainable is it?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, Bryan, it's a good question. We're actually, once again, it sounds like a broken record. But we're kind of seeing it across all segments. We're having good growth in professional services, which is really hitting our financial institution business there. We're also seeing nice processing wins all throughout last year, so we're seeing on-boarding there. We're seeing global commercial services, which rolls into that business. We've seen some very nice uptick, IT outsourcing for a number of existing customers and expansion of those responsibilities and then the final area is we're seeing Capco come through their grow-over with their loss of that significant client. So really, all 3 of those areas are working very well to help with the revenue. Based on what we see in our pipeline, based on the activities, we feel good about that business going forward or that segment going forward.","Michael D. Hayford","Bryan, I think we talked about this in the third and fourth quarter calls. The third and fourth quarter had very challenging grow-overs, license businesses, license deals that we had in '10 that didn't materialize in '11. Big license deals. And so I think, even on third quarter and fourth quarter, when the growth wasn't as strong as we'd like to see, we talked about not being concerned but that was more of a grow-over challenge and then you can see that bouncing back in first quarter. So again, we're pleased with the start to the year of, really across the board.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And can you guys by quantify the increase you saw year-over-year in license sales and Professional Services?","Michael D. Hayford","In first quarter, you're talking about? I mean the grow-over -- third and fourth quarter was a challenge in the license we that had, which took the growth down. First quarter, Professional Services was 11% growth year-over-year. I don't think first quarter license was materially different than last year. But again, it was more that third and fourth quarter had that drop on license versus '10. That's made those growth numbers lower.","Mary K. Waggoner","Thanks, and we're out of time this morning. Thank you very much for joining us. We appreciate your participation.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. You may now disconnect."],"9503":["Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

Please go ahead.","Pete Gunnlaugsson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Terry. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FIS's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Turning to slide 2, Gary Norcross, President and Chief Executive Officer, will begin with a business summary. Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with the financial results for the first quarter. Today's news release and a supplemental slide presentation are available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Turning to slide 3, as always, today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release and in the appendix of the supplemental slide presentation.","Turning to slide 4, I will now turn the call over to Gary to discuss the business highlights. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Pete. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm very pleased to open this morning's call reporting that FIS had a strong first quarter, with good performance overall, exceeding our expectations. We delivered strong and profitable growth. We have a solid pipeline, and our sales teams are doing a nice job of converting opportunities to new wins and cross-selling and up-selling to existing clients. Market and client demand for our solutions continues with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies and implementing transformational solutions. These results and trends underscore our confidence in achieving our full-year 2016 plan.","Turning to slide 5, our first quarter top line growth was driven by positive results across both operating segments. Adjusted revenue increased more than 4% organically compared to the prior-year period at $2.3 billion, with EBITDA growing almost as twice as fast as revenue at 8%. Adjusted earnings per share rose 22%, and we are ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration. In fact, we see clear line of sight to exit the year with $150 million in run-rate synergy. By all accounts, this is a good start to the year and creates a strong foundation for achieving our 2016 goals.","These results are further confirmation that executing on our strategy, including integrating and repositioning SunGard into our FIS business, is delivering the desired results. Steady execution, coupled with continued improvements in our cost structure and overall performance remains our focus this year to drive continued earnings growth.","We are in the right market serving financial institutions and empowering our clients of all sizes, from community and regional banks to large global institutions. Strategically, we are investing in the business to deliver long-term growth and consistent shareholder returns. Our growth strategy remains consistent and has the following key components.","First, we are focused on our base business growth by effectively selling to and delivering for our existing clients. The acquisition of SunGard broadens our base business through a wider set of solutions, allowing us to expand into new and adjacent markets and provide deeper value to our clients of all sizes.","Second, we are focused on continually creating enterprise value. We will accomplish this through disciplined integration of our strategic investments and innovation and by capitalizing on our expanded scale and operating leverage. This focus will enable us to create new sales opportunities to drive earnings growth.","Third, we are focused on financial discipline to maintain our strong balance sheet and improve our cash flow. We will efficiently use our strong cash flow to pay down debt in the near term and invest for growth for the longer term. We believe our strategy will consistently drive performance and results for the long term. And we remain confident in this strategy.","Turn to slide 6 to review our segment highlights. We entered the first quarter with strong momentum, driven in part by increased interest in our expanded portfolio. This momentum has translated into strong deal closure for the quarter and a robust quality pipeline of diversified opportunities across both operating segments.","In our Integrated Financial Solutions business we saw strong cross-sell activity delivering top-line growth of greater than 5% organically. This growth is driven by a balance of demand in each of our solution areas, including core Banking and Wealth, Payments, and our Corporate and Digital solutions. This is a strong start to the year for this segment, and we are pleased with its first quarter growth.","In our Banking and Wealth management business, we signed several strategic long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks, seeking the benefits of our fully integrated solutions suite. In March we signed a new, multiyear strategic agreement with a $6 billion community bank, replacing their long-term core banking, digital, network, and item processing applications with FIS solutions. We also signed a long-term agreement with the U.S. arm of a $900 billion global institution that renewed and expanded their core processing relationship to include a full suite of item processing and associated print and mail solutions.","In our enterprise governance risk and compliance business, we saw double-digit growth, primarily driven by institutions seeking to remediate regulatory compliance issues by working with our governance and compliance experts.","Our Payments business also drove double-digit growth in both our high-margin, high-reoccurring network business, called NYCE, which saw a significant increase in transaction volumes from a large major online retailer. And in our card production business, where we signed a new multiyear master services agreement with a bank with assets in excess of $65 billion, as well as continued strength in our EMV card deployments.","Demand for our digital solutions suite was strong, representing double-digit growth in our user bases for our digital banking platforms. Our mobile banking platform now supports more than 36 million end users. Additionally, our FIS Cardless Cash solution has now been deployed at more than 30 early-adopter institutions across the U.S. We are proud of our leadership position in digital money movement and innovation and expect it to continue to deliver new opportunities.","Within our corporate liquidity business we signed a multimillion-dollar agreement with a leading commercial financing and leasing company to upgrade and host its trade management solution. This is a great early example of how FIS scale and global distribution creates value and growth advantages for our acquired companies.","Two weeks ago we hosted over 1,200 North American community and regional bankers at one of our annual conferences. The event was focused on disruptive technologies, particularly in digital, and enabled us to showcase and demo many FIS solutions to these bank executives. Client response was overwhelmingly positive, as they look to run their banks more efficiently and invest in new innovative technologies so they can effectively compete and grow their institutions. All of these new and extended relationships demonstrate FIS strength in serving the banking and payment needs of North American institutions, regardless of size, creating predictable revenues tied to long-term contracts and deployed in a one-to-many model.","Turning to our Global Financial Solutions business, we are very pleased with the early progress in this segment attributable to the changes we implemented last year, combined with the new portfolio offerings from the SunGard acquisition. In the quarter we delivered top line growth greater than 4% organically. A significant change from last year: Approximately 85% of total revenue for this segment is now driven from IP-led solutions, due to the SunGard acquisition. We also have a much more diversified pipeline, primarily driven by the addition of new offerings from SunGard and our Clear2Pay next-generation payment solutions. While this will bring slower than historical growth for this segment due to the IP-led nature of future deals, it will also bring higher profit margins, accompanied with more predictable revenue.","The segment's Institutional and Wholesale business, comprised primarily of the former SunGard business, drove more than 5% organic growth with good margin expansion in the quarter. Growth was driven from demand in trading volumes and strong demand for capital markets, risk, and compliance solutions. We also saw good renewal activity in the quarter. Our Clear2Pay solutions drove double-digit growth to the top line, and our integration efforts have nearly doubled the margin profile of this business since we acquired the company in October of 2014. This global payments delivery platform continues to gain momentum with increased client demand as the need for more real-time and least-cost routing of payments gains momentum.","In Europe, we continue to see success with challenger banks. Atom Bank, the U.K.'s first all-digital bank, went live last month, ahead of schedule. FIS will continue to be their long-term strategic technology partner of choice. And in Brazil, we were encouraged to see continuing gains in transaction volumes, primarily due to the expanded relationship with one of our strategic clients in the region. Overall card processing in Brazil is up 11% excluding currency year over year. Additionally, we entered into a new multiyear strategic agreement to help this same client advance its digital banking strategy. Both of these new agreements are positive steps forward for us in a region that continues to be challenged by macroeconomic conditions. Our Consulting business is delivering on expectations and had a good quarter. The overall pipeline is growing as expected and supports our belief that 2016 will be an improved year for Consulting.","Turning next to slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our first quarter results. The strong performance reinforces our confidence in our 2016 operating plan. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth through new sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet through paying down debt, and returning cash to shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Woody for additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on slide 9.","In the first quarter, adjusted revenue increased to $2.3 billion or 4.2% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew to $637 million, an 8.1% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis, as if we owned SunGard in the prior-year period. This represents 170 basis points of margin expansion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $259 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 22% to $0.79 per share compared to $0.65 per share in the prior-year period.","As Gary mentioned, we're very pleased with the start of the year and with the efforts of the SunGard integration teams. The integration efforts have provided incremental synergies, which benefited earnings per share for the quarter by about a penny. As noted earlier, we now have line of sight to exit the year at an expense synergy run rate of $150 million, ahead of our original expectations of $100 million. We expect the earnings impact of this increase in run rate synergies to be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year and drive benefit into 2017. We remain highly focused on accelerating and overdriving our synergies.","As you know, we closed the SunGard transaction on November 30, 2015, with all the results of the acquired businesses flowing into the GFS segment for the month of December. During the first quarter, we made minor adjustments to the reporting structure of certain businesses to more accurately reflect the way investment decisions are made and how we're operating the company. We have moved the Public Sector and Education, Retail Check Processing, and our commercial Services business into the Corporate and Other segment. We have also included the recently acquired SunGard Wealth Management and Corporate Liquidity businesses in the IFS segment.","Included in the press release this morning, we have also provided historical adjusted combined financial information for 2015 and 2014 by quarter. These historical combined financials include SunGard's results as if we owned them January 1, 2014, and reflect these changes in order to provide you greater clarity and better comparisons to the prior years.","Moving to slide 10, IFS has been strengthened by combining the acquired Wealth Management assets with FIS Wealth Solutions and by adding liquidity solutions to our Corporate and Digital solutions. This slide highlights the key additions to the IFS segment from the SunGard acquisition.","Moving to slide 11. In the first quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions' organic revenue grew 5.4% to $1.1 billion. I'm pleased with how IFS has started the year. EBITDA increased to $426 million, an increase of 2.2% compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis, with 130 basis points of margin decline. We are pleased with the pace of revenue growth in the quarter, although the overdrive came in lower-margin solutions and services revenue. This revenue mix cost approximately 30 basis points of decline in margin for the quarter compared to our expectations. Additionally, as planned, we had higher incentive accruals in the quarter.","Turning to slide 12, Banking and Wealth grew 5.1% for the quarter. This was driven primarily by Wealth Solutions and continued market demand for regulatory and compliance solutions. We're also pleased with Payments growth of 6.7%. This was driven by volume in debit, payments over the NYCE network, and EMV card production. Corporate and Digital grew 3.7%, with mobile banking posting a double-digit growth rate in the quarter.","Turning to slide 13, the GFS segment has been strengthened by the Institutional and Wholesale solutions from the SunGard acquisition. These businesses include capital markets, global trading, and buy-side, and now comprise about 50% of the total revenue for GFS. Our traditional GFS Banking and Payments and Consulting businesses remain part of GFS.","Moving to slide 14, in the quarter, Global Financial Solutions' organic revenue grew 4.4% to $990 million, and EBITDA increased to $251 million, a 12.1% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis. This represents 270 basis points of margin expansion. The addition of SunGard improves the revenue stream in the segment by increasing the mission-critical intellectual property-driven recurring revenue of GFS, while providing opportunities to accelerate margin expansion in the segment.","Moving to slide 15, our Institutional and Wholesale business grew 5.4%, and we're very pleased with the start to the year. Growth was driven primarily by strong demand in global trading and capital markets risk and compliance solution. Banking and Payments' organic revenue grew 4% to $351 million, which was supported by double-digit growth in Clear2Pay. Despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges in Brazil, we continue to see strong growth in card processing volumes in that market. In addition, our first two fully outsourced clients in India continue to experience good growth. The Consulting business performance was in line with our expectations. We are building momentum based on a strong pipeline, which gives us confidence that 2016 will have improved results.","Moving to slide 16. As stated earlier, the Corporate and Other segment now includes the Public Sector and Education, Retail Check Processing, and Commercial Services business. This reporting structure change reflects how we make investment decisions to support these non-financial services customers. Adjusted revenue in the quarter was $151 million, with an EBITDA loss of $40 million. The Corporate and Other segment also includes results of $76 million of corporate expenses, which compares favorably to adjusted combined corporate expense of $89 million in the prior year, reflecting cost management and synergy attainment. The Corporate and Other segment declined 5% on an organic basis. The Public Sector and Education business had strong organic growth of 7.1%. Organic growth in the Commercial Services business declined 13%, driven by a final stub period of the nonstrategic contract nonrenewal discussed last year. Retail Check Processing declined 6.1%, reflecting the continued decline in check processing volumes.","Moving to slide 17, for the quarter, free cash flow was $338 million. As of March 31, we had $11.3 billion of debt outstanding. During the quarter, we repaid $150 million of debt. We returned $85 million to shareholders through dividends. We also ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of 327 million on a fully diluted basis. We are highly focused on cash-flow generation to delever the balance sheet, and it will continue to be a priority for us in the upcoming quarters. As expected, the effective tax rate increased to 35% for the quarter, driven primarily by the inclusion of SunGard in the results.","Moving to slide 18. In conclusion, we're very pleased with the start to 2016 top line growth and synergy execution. We are highly confident in our full-year 2016 plan, and we continue to expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, adjusted EPS of $3.70 to $3.80 per share, a 15% to 18% increase, and free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. Further, we believe that the market's current consensus view of the second quarter is in line with our expectation. We remain focused on constantly improving cash-flow generation, delevering our balance sheet, investing for growth and returning cash to shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hey, guys. Great job.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Dave.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, and I guess just a couple questions. The first one \u2013 is there a way for you to give us the growth, just SunGard's stand-alone growth, and then core FIS stand-alone growth in the quarter? Were they both around the same kind of 4% level?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Pretty close. If you look at legacy SunGard, the organic growth there (20:09) was about 4%, right at 4%, so that left us at a similar level on the FIS side \u2013 slightly higher than that, obviously. Obviously saw good margin expansion with the combination of the efforts they put in place, as well as the synergy execution on a stand-alone basis. It'll get more and more difficult to talk about them on a standalone basis as we work through our playbook of integration, but good results on both sides.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then I guess the second question, just when we look back at 2015, kind of every quarter in there you were doing kind of 0% to 2% core organic growth. This quarter, 4%. It's so much better. Was there anything one-time in this quarter that drove it better? And then maybe can you just talk about what's really \u2013 what are the two or three things that have gotten a lot better right now compared to last year?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Dave. We really saw just a good, solid quarter across the board. I mean, every business line executed very well. The SunGard integration is going extremely well, so the sales teams have not had much distraction at all. We had a real solid kickoff this year. We also had some strong sales that we signaled in the back half of last year that are now translating to the growth this year. We've seen some improvement in our people-based services business, which is also \u2013 was a pretty big headwind throughout the year for us last year.","But I would just say across the board we saw improvement. We highlighted a number of those areas with good, strong transaction growth in our network. We're seeing strong demand for some of our next-generation innovations we're doing. We also continue to see good response from the sales team around core offerings and all of the pull-through that that can generate across our product suite.","And to Woody's point, SunGard \u2013 the former SunGard business performed very well for us. We were pleased with the results of that. We had modeled that acquisition in that 3% to 4% range. So that came in on the high end. So all in all just a good quarter across the board.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks. Great to hear.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Nice job.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just want to start off, when we look at the additional wins that you still have rolling on throughout the year \u2013 and I'm thinking about Sainsbury's still rolling out, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, and I know we've talked about issuer processing wins like Cap One and others. Is this going to be a setup where 4% is the start of an acceleration still through the year? I know initially your guidance was 3% to 4% with more of a second half weighted year. But here you are starting at 4%.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Darrin, as I said, we're pleased with the quarter. I think we continue to stay focused on the guidance we've issued. We realize that one quarter doesn't make a year, so we're focused on results. As you mentioned, we've got a lot of stuff that's in the pipeline coming online. But frankly we have that every quarter. And so the team's really focused on execution in 2016, focused on the integration of SunGard, focused on continuing to close out our sales and getting them on board in an appropriate way.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Makes sense. Just a quick follow-up. I mean we get a lot of questions on SunGard, in terms of the strength of its abilities, especially given the capital markets volatility we're seeing and volume levels. Can you just comment on the strength of 4% now there in SunGard? And if that's really sustainable? And then maybe just to add onto that, any cross-selling opportunities you see that we can benefit from between SunGard and the legacy FIS over the course of this year on the revenue side?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean the nice thing about SunGard is they look very similar to the way FIS has looked for years. These are very mission-critical, highly reoccurring software products that are required in order for a financial institution to open its doors. So while sometimes we can see impact due to transaction volumes or trading volumes \u2013 no different than we can on, for example, our debit network \u2013 the reality is for these institutions to open their doors, they need it. So this mission-critical nature is very important.","We are seeing some really nice opportunities for pull through. Actually highlighted one in this quarter with that large commercial leasing company. This was a fantastic relationship that FIS had. And by the combination with SunGard, we were able to pull in our new offerings in a particular area that they were looking at and win that transaction.","So we're already starting to see some of that. As I've said in the past, what you'll watch for is that really in the back half of the year in early 2017, because sales cycles are long in this business.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But early signs are we will have a lot of opportunity in the global marketplace with our combined capability.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's \u2013 all right, that's great. Just last question and I'll turn it back to the queue. On the Consulting side it was really good to see the reacceleration there on the people-based. I mean is that \u2013 I guess that's Capco primarily, right? And is that reacceleration something sustainable now? We don't have to worry about it slipping back to negative territory?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, that was our Capco consulting business. And as you mentioned, we were pleased with the quarter as well. We've talked about in the past, when you look at Consulting business, you really look at about 120 days to 180 days out. We've got very strong book-to-bill right now coming through Q1, which would indicate good solid Q2. And then that pushes into Q3 and Q4. But we feel good about what the team has accomplished. We certainly made a strategic shift there, and that strategy looks like it's paying off for us.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. That's excellent. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks very much. I was wondering, given the solid growth you put up in SunGard in the first quarter, do you still feel confident that you can get to the upper end of the original 3% to 5% SunGard growth rate you kind of had laid out there at the start of February?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","We do. I mean we're pleased with the growth rate right now. We're pleased with the pipeline. We're pleased with how things are shaping up on the SunGard side. So absolutely. We still feel confident in what we've laid out and our ability to drive revenues in those levels.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And then maybe just on the cost side of things. With the increased synergy target can you maybe talk about where some of those increased synergies are coming from? Are those additional synergies? Or just pull-forwards of the original synergies you expected to see in 2017? And are those more likely to come on the cost, the revenue side or the SG&A side?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say it's a combination of both. As we went into this, we realized that SunGard would have not as much overlap as some of our traditional large acquisitions we've done. And so we really stayed focused on the SG&A side; we stayed focused on our leveraged services side. What we've realized as we've gone through this process is there are some opportunities within the former SunGard business to implement changes in the way FIS operates these businesses. So we've seen the combination of accelerated pull-through that was identified in due diligence. We've also seen some opportunities that are new that we didn't discover during due diligence. So we're confident that we'll exit this year with the $150 million in run rate. And as you guys have seen in the past, we typically beat our projections on synergies.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","And to add some color on your other question there, it was more highly weighted in the corporate costs right now, with cost coming out of the operations on an ongoing basis.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","So a little heavier in the corporate costs early, as you might imagine.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Brett.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","One more detailed question on Capco, and I think the 1.8% growth in Consulting that you all give us in the GFS subsegment breakdown, that includes both Capco legacy as well as the new SunGard, is that right?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","That's correct. The SunGard portion's pretty small, Brett. So if you remember sort of the views on the -","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. So is that 1.8% sort of \u2013 I think Darrin asked this question, but I just want to be sure. So that Capco growth last quarter was negative 10% organic constant currency. Is there an equivalent sort of number you can give us that's \u2013 or is that 1.8% apples to apples?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","It's close, Brett. You're probably plus or minus 0.2 point.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","It definitely was an improvement from the fourth quarter.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As Woody said, the SunGard consulting piece was very small.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then also in the legacy GFS business, I know it was a little bit weaker on sort of the regular processing type businesses in the 4Q. Any discussion on that? I think there was some Asia weakness and things like that. How did that fare, again, on a sequential basis on that revenue growth, if you could give us a little insight there?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think what you saw was really good growth in Clear2Pay, good growth in Brazil that we talked about. India was very positive. On the opposite side of that, you still have some drag from the people-based services business. They weren't down like they were sequentially in the fourth quarter. They were more along the flat area, year over year, but still a drag to overall growth. So definitely saw an improvement, but still a drag to overall growth.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","That's great. That's what I needed. Thank you, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of David Togut from Evercore. Please go ahead.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Congratulations on the strong start. Just a question on EMV. You called out strength there, Gary. Where are you in the EMV manufacturing and personalization process? What inning are you, approximately?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, we're in the very early stages. We appreciate the congratulations, but when you look at EMV, we're at the very early innings of this. We were quick to market, as we've discussed. We've seen this as a tailwind every quarter for us. We're still the vast majority of the plastics we're producing in the quarter are still non-EMV. And so we've got a lot of room to run with EMV, as we roll that out.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","How much longer do you see EMV as a tailwind? Will this push into 2017?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that would be a reasonable assumption, based on what we've seen today.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then you highlighted, I think a couple weeks ago, that you're pretty close to launching a real-time payments network at the beginning of next year. Can you talk a little bit about that, and what your plans are for that?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No, actually \u2013 we actually launched a real-time payment network a couple of years ago in PayNet. We've actually partnered with a very large customer that handles some of the largest global banks, and we're deploying a lot of our technology for that real-time payment environment, as we've discussed, David. There's going to be multiple networks to get this done. What we care about is that the underlying technology is FIS capabilities. Certainly that's all been augmented by our Clear2Pay acquisition that we did now a couple of years ago, as we highlighted. You see tremendous growth in Clear2Pay, and that's all around this real-time payments and also least-cost routing. So we think we're in very good position for this, as this comes online. But that client that we announced \u2013 I think it was either one or two quarters ago \u2013 that process is going very well.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. And a couple quick housekeeping questions. When you reported your fourth quarter, I think, Woody, you called out $150 million of revenue headwind from FX.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Are you updating your FX guidance? I think that was mostly from the real at the time?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I can give you some color. We put in our guide about $150 million. I would tell you we're more in an expectation of around $100 million, given today's rates, David. As you know, pretty volatile. But we're thinking more in a $100 million zone right now.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then just finally, what do you expect the deferred revenue adjustments to be on SunGard for each of the second, third, and fourth quarters?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","I would tell you we probably expect similar levels. It's an adjustment associated with purchase accounting. So we're adjusting it back in as if SunGard would have recorded it under GAAP. But we would expect similar levels through 2016 and it falling away into 2017, almost nonexistent in 2017.","David M. Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you and congratulations.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good quarter here \u2013 from me.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good to talk to you guys. Just wanted to \u2013 just a couple questions. Gary, you'd mentioned within GFS the IP-led deals, right? Potentially higher margins, more predictable but lower growth. Just to dig in on that, is that just the result of a higher maintenance mix as opposed to license fees and people-based work? Just trying to understand that comment a little bit better.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, no, there's been a huge shift in GFS. Certainly, we'll go into a lot more detail next week at our investor update. But when you look at the complement of SunGard products and services and the amount of assets that they brought into GFS from that acquisition, the percentage of revenue tied to now true software and software solutions, whether it's license, maintenance, or outsourcing, has increased that segment to be about 85% of the revenue. So this is a huge shift that has occurred since prior to the acquisition. As you know, product-related sales tend to take longer, right? And then you have to go through an implementation cycle to onboard. So naturally growth is going to slow a little bit than say traditional people-based services businesses that are somewhat detached from software. But the advantage of that concentration is now you're going to see margins lift significantly in GFS. And we think we're going to have a great opportunity with some nice margin expansion in the coming years in that business as it starts taking on more of the characteristics of a true classic IP-type company.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. No, that's a good outcome. Then different question, Gary, just on new sales or bookings in the aggregate, not just Consulting. I know there's been some mixed signals out there in terms of bank spend on the IT front. How do you see it? How did first quarter come in versus plan on new sales?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, no. We had a good \u2013 as you say, we had a good, solid first quarter. We saw good renewal activity across both IFS and GFS. We saw some good closings, and I highlighted some of the larger ones in my prepared remarks. We see a really good pipeline. I would say we've not seen anything shift with regards to the sales results, although as we've talked about now for multiple quarters, it's a very competitive market. And based on that, we think we've got the solution set and the mission-critical applications to win in those deals. But all in all it was a good quarter across the board.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, good. Just last one on guidance. Just \u2013 totally appreciate the conservatism in keeping guidance the same. But any incremental signs of weakness out there or revenue dissynergies that might give you pause in raising guidance? Doesn't sound like it, but just wanted to make sure.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","No, I would say no, just a good start to the year. Feel good about the guidance we've laid out and are confident we'll be able to meet it.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi Bank (sic) [Citigroup] (36:48). Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you, guys. And good performance on the bottom line and cash flow.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ashwin.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I just want to start with, again, the guidance question, because just want to figure out, based on just the earnings benefit of higher synergies, which you guys said was back-end loaded. You also the 1Q beat and on the top line $50 million from FX and all of that stuff. What would cause you to be at the lower end of the range, given all of these positive things? Is it the higher accruals on the stock-based expense, that kind of stuff? What causes you to be at the lower end?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","I think if you saw a fallback in the people-based services -","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","\u2013 that we saw last year, you could see some of that. If we didn't have good sales execution in the back half of the year, you could see some of that. So those would be the kind of things that could happen, Ashwin. We don't foresee those at this point, given what our forecast looks like. But again one quarter doesn't make a year, and we want to make sure we hit what we've outlined to the marketplace.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Understood. And then as you rebuild the Capco pipeline, is the nature of or attributes of the contracts that you're signing, the projects that you're getting, is it different than the last time you were rebuilding? Because that may have run into some issues back then.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, no, as we talked about in the end of last year, we made a strategic shift back to more strategic-type transformational consulting, which is the original ethos of our Capco business. As a result of that, we've seen our partners get much more focused on those particular areas. We've seen our pipeline grow. We've seen, more importantly, our book-to-bill number increase significantly, which is two very positive signs. And as I said gave us confidence for Q1, gives us confidence for Q2. We've got some more work to do for Q3 and Q4. But that's the nature of the Consulting business.","So we're pleased with the early results of that change. It really does put us now back into a different conversation, where we're able to influence some of the transformation that's going on in the market. And it's really helping us augment a number of our IP services.","So we highlighted for example, a large digital transformation with one of our more strategic clients in South America. We'll deliver that through our Capco organization, because it's a one-to-one, but that was led because of the significant relationship FIS has and our ability to leverage that relationship. So those kind of combinations are really what the intent has always been for our Capco consulting business. And as I said, the team has done a nice job.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Just couple of quick questions. One is the Corporate and Other piece. Should we look at these as maybe less strategic assets to you guys? There has been speculation in the past for example, that the public business might be up for sale. What might be the conditions under which you would say yes to that sort of a transaction?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think we always look for ways to look at the portfolio, and what are the best fits for the long term, and what are not the best fits for the long term. We've talked about if we had some ability to sell some assets, it could accelerate the deleveraging of the balance sheet, which we're very focused on. But frankly, it's just we think about those businesses slightly different in their customer base and how we would service that customer base versus traditional financial institutions. So just look at them a little differently.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I mean we saw a great quarter, frankly, in Public Sector. The leadership team is doing an outstanding job with that business. But I would say, Ashwin, as you've seen historically, as we have products that don't necessarily fit our strategy, doesn't mean that they're not great, great businesses. And so we divested our healthcare business as an example. We divested our gaming business. So \u2013 but in the meantime we're going to continue to drive these business lines. We've got great leadership over them and continue to maximize our shareholder returns.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Last real quick question: Can you provide a cadence for debt repayment?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","We've talked about looking at all excess free cash flow effectively being used to pay down debt. You can look at our history of driving free cash flow in terms of the curve, Ashwin, along with what we guided to this year. And minus dividends, that excess will be used to repay debt. That'd be a good way to model it.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you, guys. See you next week.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Congratulations on a strong quarter.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Are you seeing any different types of \u2013 now that you've had the asset sort of under your belt for a little while, have you seen any different types of cyclicality impacting SunGard versus your core retail bank business, things like in-flows or performance in asset management business or the broader financial market? Is there any incremental kind of macro factors to keep an eye on, as it regards to SunGard performance?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Ramsey, when we first bought SunGard, honestly, we talked about it when we made the announcement. You're looking at a company that looked very similar to FIS either the early part of this century or in the late 1990s. It had a heavy license fee concentration. So we were very focused on the license fee component of the revenue, because that can be more cyclical and also be somewhat more volatile.","What we liked about what SunGard had done is those licenses were then in the form of term licenses. And back to the mission criticality of it, if people don't renew those licenses, those products can no longer be utilized in the particular institution. And therefore not only are they mission-critical, they're very large and very complex to implement.","So we continue to watch that metric, but we also feel much better about that now after we've owned the company for some period of time. We continue to watch, just like in all of our large, global institutions, the macroeconomic issues that are going to impact spend.","One of the things that we like about FIS is the fact that we have such a diversified revenue portfolio. So what you're finding is this spend can move around the institution. So increased regulatory change can perhaps drive more focus on regulatory and compliance.","We now have a suite of solutions to deal with regulatory compliance. We also have robust professional services capabilities around that, as an example. And so what we've got to do is just make sure that our sales teams are tracking where the revenue is being spent, so that we can continue to maximize our growth through as the industry shifts.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Second one. You mentioned an increase in transaction volumes from a big online retailer. Can you give us a little more color there? Was that a new acceptance win? Or was that an existing relationship that ramped up for some reason? Or...","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it was an absolute new win that's been ramping up over quarters after implementation.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Got it, okay. And last quick one: What's your updated leverage ratio for the quarter?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","I think we're looking just under 4%, Ramsey, based on estimated synergies, but just under 4%.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","All right, got it. Thanks. That's all for me, guys.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Let me add my congratulations for the start of the year.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, George.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just wanted to ask \u2013 historically the IFS segment has been less volatile than GFS. You're off to a good start here at north of 5%. Is there anything we should be aware of that could cause that rate to sort of deviate throughout the rest of the year? Or do you expect it to be pretty uniform?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the biggest thing we always watch for in IFS \u2013 and as you said, it's very predictable for us \u2013 is really where acquisitions are occurring in market. And so the thing that is almost impossible to predict in this industry is when two financial institutions are going to come together, the size of that combination and where their processing is going to end up post-combination. So those are the things that can really impact IFS. We saw that over the last couple of years with some really large combinations. It drives a high termination fee, which drops right to the bottom line, but then you've got to fill in the processing volume. Other than that, really the business is \u2013 all the software we deploy in IFS is extremely mission-critical. We've had strong sales success over the last several years, as evidenced by the holes created in the example I just gave and the sales team's ability to fill that in. So we're continuing to monitor IFS, but to Woody's point earlier, we feel good about the quarter they had and frankly feel good about what the year's shaping up to look like for them.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Appreciate the color. And then just two quick ones. I'm not sure if you guys gave the term fees in the quarter, or maybe what they were a year ago. And then, as it relates to SunGard, the 4% growth, was that pretty uniform throughout both segments, both IFS and GFS? Thank you.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, term fees in 2016 first quarter were $8 million. That compares to $5 million last year. So, again, much lower than history. With regard to SunGard within the two groups, I think Institutional and Wholesale you saw at 5.4%, so the corporate liquidity and treasury, obviously a little lower than that, flow into the IFS group. With Public Sector and Education growing at 7%. So 5.4% for the Institutional and Wholesale, 7% for Public Sector and Education. Slight decline in the corporate liquidity that flows in the IFS group.","Operator","Okay. And next we'll go to the line of Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Good morning, gentlemen.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So I wanted to just ask, now that you gave us the segment restatements and some of the pro forma detail \u2013 which is very helpful; thanks for that \u2013 can you just give us a little detail, what kind of growth trajectory, margin trajectory you might be looking for in those segments just for the year?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think we added some color on that back in February when we gave guidance. The GFS segment, we think, full year, will be 26% or more, in terms of the improvement from a structural standpoint of adding SunGard in it, plus the synergy attainment. On the IFS segment for the full year, I think we still think 10 to 20 basis points for the full year is a good answer. Obviously you're seeing a little bit of a headwind there in terms of some incentive accruals, which are a little more difficult comp in the first and second quarter. But I think those outlined margin profiles are still intact for the full year.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And can you help us just understand the revenue in the Corporate segment for the year?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, it's pretty ratable. We anticipate it. We would anniversary the contract renewal in the second quarter, so you shouldn't see GCS with a similar level of organic decline. I think Public Sector and Education continues to perform well. So that sort of high single digit grower that we saw in Q1 should continue. And then with regards to the check processing business, that one we do think volumes will continue to decline over time.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. And then, lastly, you mentioned you're ahead on getting to the $150 million in synergies. You had previously said you wanted to get to $200 million by the end of 2017. So do you think you could be above that by the end of 2017 or get there earlier? Can you make any comments about that?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're going to go through all of that here in a week at our investor update and give you guys a lot more guidance. But if you look historically, with FIS and our large acquisitions, we've always been able to exceed our goals in those particular areas. Frankly, we're off to a very good start. We feel confident in exiting the year with $150 million in run rate. As more synergies go from identification to projects and timelines for implementation, we'll certainly update you guys as we go forward.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our last question for today will be from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just want to understand a couple things. On the guidance, you didn't raise the guidance, but with the lower FX and the higher synergies, I guess I would have expected you guys would take up the guidance a little bit. But is there anything offsetting that, like that's going the other way, that's causing you guys not to raise guidance? Or is that just being conservative?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","I would tell you it's just being conservative. It's a very good start to the year. One quarter doesn't make a year. Just being conservative.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the IFS margins, they were a little bit lower than your guys' plan. It sounded like it was incentive accruals. Can you help us understand what that is exactly? And then what, going forward, should we expect for those margins, should they recover in the second quarter?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think we expected the incentive accruals. As you remember last year, we brought incentive accruals down with the results that we had. What we didn't expect or saw some overdrive in the revenue, some of that margin mix impacted us. So that was about 30 basis points off what our expectation was. So pretty close, but pleased with the revenue growth.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then going forward there, on IFS, the margins, will we see the improvement?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, again, we think the full year is still sort of a 10 to 20 basis point kind of a growth curve. You obviously could see some change in that should the mix continue or accelerate, but we still think that 10 to 20 [basis points] is a pretty good answer.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then the other clarification. Just on NYCE, there was a large retailer that drove the volumes there. Usually we always think about bank wins driving some of the EFT networks. Can you just talk a little bit about that relationship and how that drives that growth to NYCE?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, I mean, NYCE is one of the largest debit networks in market. It's always been a strong grower for us. As you said, it's very issuer-centric, but as we also sign up merchants, large merchants' ability on the acquiring side to then funnel those debit transactions through that network, those volumes, since that business is a collect model, as those transactions come through, you'll see natural revenue ramp and obviously natural profit contribution from that ramp.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. That's all I had. Congrats on the great start.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And I'll turn it back over to Mr. Norcross for any closing remarks.","Gary A.

And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host today, Senior Vice President investor Relations, Ms. Mary Waggoner. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Mary K. Waggoner","Thank you, Dave. We'd like to welcome everyone joining us this afternoon for the Third Quarter Earnings Report. With me today are Frank Martire, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gary Norcross, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hayford, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I would like to ask you to please mark your calendars for our 2013 Investor Day, which is scheduled for Tuesday, February 12, in New York. Similar to our 2012 event, we will begin the day with the discussion of our fourth quarter and full year results followed by the business outlook and financial guidance for 2013. We look forward to seeing you there.","Now, onto the third quarter earnings report.

Please refer to the Safe Harbor language on Slide 3 of the presentation.","Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Now, if you will turn to Slide 6, I will turn the call over the Frank Martire. Frank?","Frank R. Martire","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll begin today's business review with a brief summary of our financial performance and business highlights for the third quarter. Gary will follow with the operations report, and Mike will provide additional insight into our financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Our third quarter results were very strong, including organic revenue which grew 5%. We are consistently delivering on our strategic commitments to maximize performance through organic revenue growth, margin expansion and returning cash to shareholders. As we move away from acquiring and integrating large companies, our results underscore that our change in strategy is working.","As shown on Slide 7, organic growth has rebounded nicely since 2009, fueled by strong sales execution and the ongoing market recovery. As you can see on the right, we have maintained our momentum and consistently delivered organic growth of 5% or higher in 7 of the last 8  quarters.","Turning to Slide 8, we are achieving the financial targets that we communicated earlier this year. They included organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%, EBITDA growth of 5% to 7%, margin expansion of 40 to 80 basis points and double-digit growth in earnings per share.","Through the first 9 months of 2012, besides generating 5% organic revenue growth, we've registered a 7% rise in EBITDA, expanded the margin by 90 basis points and increased earnings per share by 15%. Today's results position us very well to achieve our goals for the year.","Additionally, our strong cash flow and disciplined capital management enabled us to return $427 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and shareholder repurchases through the first 9 months of the year.","Now on Slide 9. Our strong third quarter performance reflected 12% organic growth in our international business and 7% organic growth in Financial Solutions. The EBITDA margin was 30.8%, and adjusted earnings per share increased to $0.63 from $0.60 in the prior year.","In mid-August, we've completed the previously announced sale of our healthcare business, which is aligned with our primary focus to serve financial institutions and operate in markets where we have meaningful scale. Mike will provide additional details regarding this transaction later on the call.","To continue with Slide 10, I will highlight a few additional accomplishments. Long-standing client relationships that grow over time serve as the foundation of our business. Earlier today, we announced the completion of a new and expanded 5-year agreement with BMO Harris. FIS and BMO Harris have maintained an excellent relationship for many years, and we are pleased to continue our strategic partnership. We will provide more detail on the new agreement later on the call.","In addition, last week, Gary and I met with the most senior executives from Bank of Montreal. The discussion was positive, and we are very optimistic that we will have opportunities to further grow our relationship with Bank of Montreal.","We continue to invest for growth with a strong focus on innovation, including supporting American Express on its new Bluebird initiative. We are also focused on increasing our footprint in high-potential markets, including India where we are significantly expanding our existing ATM operations.","Market leadership serves as the guiding principle of our company, and we are very proud to again rank #1 on the FinTech 100. Our success is a result of a delivered strategy that enables our clients to achieve success by providing them with industry-leading solutions and thought leadership; leverage our size and global scale to deliver cost-effective solutions; continually process innovation by developing or acquiring new products and services in addition to integrating our existing solutions; and a strategy that is reinforced by hiring and retaining the most talented employees in the industry.  Our top ranking serves as a testament to the ongoing confidence that our clients have in us, and it validates our winning strategy.","Overall, I am very pleased with our continued strong performance. We are confident that we will deliver on the near and long-term financial objectives we communicated in February. As always, we remain steadfast in our commitment to serve our clients well and drive higher value for our shareholders.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gary for the business report. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross","Thank you, Frank, and thanks to everyone for being with us today. FIS is building the future of financial services, and our latest quarterly performance substantiates our continued role leading the industry. As Frank mentioned, we recorded another very strong quarter for our company. The current results continue to build on our solid operational performance across all financial metrics.","My presentation will focus on 3 main highlights. First, I will cover our revenue accomplishments with emphasis on our strong year-to-date global sales performance and our third quarter rebound in sales to North American financial institutions specifically. Next, I'll provide an update on where we are expanding our value propositions and investing for growth, emphasizing new solution innovation and providing client examples of continued demand for our integrated solutions. Last, I will provide a greater understanding of our new 5-year agreement with BMO Harris, which will continue to be a top 5 revenue client for us. This agreement virtually eliminates the negative EBITDA impact in 2013.","Please turn to Slide 12 to begin my review, where I'll start with a review of our sales performance. Our global sales performance continues its solid year-to-date growth. We saw strong year-over-year and sequential increases in total contract value, where we are up 30% year-to-date. These new wins will drive future revenue growth for our company. This sales expansion signifies that overall investment spending continues to improve as our clients focus on driving greater efficiency and adapting their business models to align with the evolving paradigm shift in banking. We are seeing an ongoing shift towards outsourced services and integrated solutions for more traditional single-product purchases. Overall, we feel good about the strength of the total global sales pipeline and expect new contract value in 2012 to exceed our 2011 results.","I will continue with North America on Slide 13. As expected, we registered a strong rebound in new sales to North American financial institutions in the third quarter from the second period. And sales also increased year-over-year. We have a robust pipeline heading into the fourth quarter, and we feel good about our continued sales success for the remainder of the year.","Continuing in my sales performance review, Slide 14 provides an update on our international business. During the quarter, we closed significant sales outside of North America, where larger opportunities are developing for payments, software and outsourced services. Organic revenue growth in our international business accelerated to 12% in the third quarter, driven by solid results in all major regions.","In emerging markets, growth continues to outpace that of Europe and North America. For example, when you exclude currency, revenue grew 14% in Brazil, propelled by higher card volumes and more favorable pricing. While growth in Europe is less robust than in emerging markets, our European business continues to perform very well. Challenging market conditions are driving strong demand for Capco's consulting services as clients seek to improve overall performance. And on the professional services front, we continue to see strong demand, especially for core banking platform enhancements throughout the region.","Turning to Asia, which is an important market for our international strategy, we continue to pursue many opportunities. We recently added our first ATM switching client in Thailand, where a majority of the top banks run on an FIS core solution. And we also added our first core processing plant in Vietnam.","In August, we announced a significant expansion of our footprint in India. Over the next 2 years, we will increase the number of ATMs that we support in India to more than 9,000. For the next 7 years, we will also provide ongoing outsourced services, including supply, setup and ATM operations. This is a tremendous win for FIS, which, once at full scale, is expected to generate nearly $100 million in additional revenue per year at a margin that is accretive to our international business.","All in all, I am very pleased with our third quarter sales performance of both North America and our international markets and encouraged by a robust pipeline heading into our final quarter of the year.","Switching topic, I will continue on Slide 15 with an overview of a few select business expansion initiatives, which emphasize our new solution innovation and demand for our integrated solution offerings.","Financial institutions continue to concentrate on replacing lost fee income and identifying new efficiencies. This is driving demand for a broader set of services that include outsourced technology, business process services and consulting expertise. We also are seeing strong interest in mobile access and delivery, new payment technologies and regulatory compliance. Consequently, we are expanding our investment in these areas to meet the growing demand.","For example, we continue to focus on solution innovation in higher growth areas, expanding our offerings and capabilities in such areas as mobile and real-time payment solutions. As a result, we have experienced a significant increase in our mobile banking client base in 2012, with the launch of our tablet, mobile wallet and business mobile banking offerings.","Nearly 450 financial institutions and 3 million consumers now use mobile solutions powered by FIS. This represents increases of 150% and 200% respectively in 2012, and we expect growth to remain strong as consumer adoptions and our sales momentum continues.","Additionally, we recently launched PayNet, the industry's first real-time, noncard-based global payments network. It enables instant authorization of payment transactions in seconds or less, expediting payments for e-commerce, P-to-P, bill pay, mobile and emerging digital payments. PayNet supports our strategy to remain at the forefront of real-time and global movement of money and serves as a great example of our ability to leverage existing capabilities and global scale, including the NYCE network. This broad market presence, combined with new capability, enables us to continue to drive new innovative solutions for our clients.","PayNet is currently in pilot with 145 financial institutions, and we will be working with additional clients to increase network participation and market share throughout 2013.","Also exemplifying our solution innovation is our very exciting announcement that we've been selected by American Express to support certain components of its new Bluebird initiative, as Frank mentioned earlier. Our innovative mobile solution lets consumers use their smartphones to scan a check and load funds into their Bluebird account, limiting fraud by leveraging our analytics and payment guarantee technologies.","For these and other industry-changing offers, FIS continues to be the partner of choice where depth of experience, proven solution capability and delivering innovation intersect, providing clients an unmatched breadth and depth of global capability.","Further reflecting our strategy to supplement organic growth through small acquisitions, we recently acquired ProNet Solutions, expanding our outsourcing and advisory capabilities. This provider of managed IT solutions for banks complements our leveraged outsourcing capabilities. ProNet also offers a proprietary information management tracking system, which further expands our regulatory compliance and advisory product suite. This new capabilities allow us to leverage our existing client base and unified sales force to drive higher cross-sales. Early sales results have been positive since the acquisition.","Continuing the overview of our business expansion and opportunities, I will highlight new examples for our integrated solution offerings. Over the years, FIS has made substantial investments to develop and integrate a full array of industry-leading solutions across every transaction and touchpoint within the financial commerce. These bundled solutions reduce the number of systems that our clients have to manage and enable them to deliver a more seamless experience to their customers at a lower cost.","FIS core banking solutions were recently recognized by ITAGroup for leadership in feature functionality, vendor experience, as well as ease of integration. These attributes enable a strong selling proposition and help to drive client demand.","In August, we announced that Bremer Financial, an $8 billion holding company, selected FIS as its core technology partner. As a part of their implementation, the bank will deploy additional FIS solutions, including item processing and imaging, treasury and cash management, ACH, branch automation and analytics. The tight integration of these components with our core platform together with our ability to support the bank's growth strategy were key factors in the selection of FIS as its new core banking provider.","Also during the quarter, we announced that Barclays has deployed our core banking solution to support the launch of its direct bank in the U.S. And we are pleased to report that CapitalOne also has expanded their relationship with FIS as the go-forward partner for its new direct bank. These are just a few examples of where our solution integration and industry-leading technology help us drive growth.","Next, if you would turn to Slide 16, I am very pleased to share with you today an update on BMO Harris and our new 5-year agreement, which virtually eliminates the negative EBITDA impact in 2013 that we discussed last quarter. We are also making good progress towards replacing some of the lost M&I revenue through a broader relationship with Bank of Montreal and other new sales wins.","In early October, we completed the migration of the legacy M&I accounts to the BMO Harris in-house platform. And as we announced this morning, FIS will continue as the bank's partner.","In addition to extension of the core application management agreement, we also expect to provide additional IT professional services on an annual basis. Further, we will continue providing a number of ancillary solutions to the bank, such as EFT, online bill pay, institution wealth management services, image and output solutions and mobile banking, all on an outsourced basis.","We are very pleased with how our relationship with BMO Harris is progressing, and we consider the new agreement which solidifies BMO Harris as a top 5 revenue client to be a great outcome for FIS and the bank. Mike will provide a financial overview of the new agreement later on the call.","In closing, let me leave you with the following key takeaways outlined on Slide 17. First, we are delivering on our plan to drive profitable revenue growth and margin expansion, as evidenced by our strong global performance through the first 9 months of the year. We are encouraged with the rebound in North American financial institution sales in the third quarter, as well as the continued strength of our global sales through the first 9 months of the year. We also are very pleased with the strength of our pipeline as we head into the end of the year. The extension of BMO Harris is an important milestone for 2012 and puts us in a strong position to deliver on the remainder of the year. And we remain optimistic about the opportunity to further expand our relationship in the future.","We feel extremely good about our strong competitive position as we continue to invest for growth. We remain focused on generating new sales and driving value to our clients through solution and service innovation and integrated delivery of our deep and broad global offering. These healthy results demonstrate our ongoing success as we continue to build on our consecutive quarters of strong operational performance.","Again, thank you for joining us this afternoon. I'll now turn it over to Mike for the financial report.","Michael D. Hayford","Thanks, Gary. I'll continue the presentation with Slide 19. Consolidated revenue increased 2.8% to $1,437,000,000 in the third quarter. After normalizing for the impacts of acquisitions and currency, organic growth was 5% driven by a 7% growth in Financial Solutions and 12% growth in international. Third quarter EBITDA increased 2.8% to $442 million. EBITDA margin was 30.8%, which is comparable to the third quarter of 2011.","As we discussed at the February Investor Day, in 2012, we are reinvesting some of our underlying margin improvements back into infrastructure and security. These investments are timed more heavily in the back half of the year, including information security spending, which negatively impacted the margins by 120 basis points in the third quarter.","The operating segments start on Slide 20 with FSG. Financial Solutions revenue increased 8.1% to $566 million and grew 7% organically driven by growth in account processing, consulting and services revenues. Financial Solutions EBITDA totaled $224 million, which is comparable to the 2011 quarter. The EBITDA margin was 39.7% compared to 42.8% in the prior year. The decline is primarily attributable to increased investments in information security and a change in revenue mix.","On Slide 21, Payment Solutions revenue totaled $576 million in the third quarter, which is comparable to the third quarter of 2011. Consistent with prior years, payments revenue declined sequentially due to -- due primarily to peak tax processing revenues in the second quarter. Growth within our Payments business was negatively impacted by approximately 90 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2011 due to the deconversion of a large former e-Fund debit issuing client that we referenced on our second quarter call. Excluding the check businesses, Payments revenue increased approximately 2% driven by continued growth in electronic payments, including the NYCE PIN-debit network, which grew 11% compared to the third quarter of 2011.","Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 6.1% to $235 million. EBITDA margin increased 230 basis points to 40.7%, reflecting ongoing expense management.","As a reminder, we are facing a difficult comparison in our Payments business in the fourth quarter due primarily to higher revenue growth and margin expansion in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2012, we expect revenue within our Payments business to be comparable to 2011 revenue with a strong margin expansion.","Turning to international on Slide 22, international revenues declined 0.7% on a reported basis. Organic growth was 11.9% in the third quarter, excluding the $38 million of currency impact. The increase was driven by growth across all regions: our Brazilian card operations, Capco's European consulting practice and Asia. International EBITDA increased 6.6% to $71 million. The margin improved 170 basis points to 24.7% compared to 22.5% in the prior year due to greater scale and leverage as this business continues to grow.","Let's turn to Slide 23, I will summarize the financial impact of the M&I core migration project and our ongoing relationship with BMO Harris. On our last call, we shared that we had anticipated a $60 million annual run rate EBITDA impact related to M&I migration, and that the termination fees will offset approximately half of that impact in 2013. With the signing of the new agreement, we now expect that the negative EBITDA impact in 2013 will be virtually eliminated by; first, a $40 million one-time termination and settlement fees; second, additional professional services that we expect to provide to BMO as part of this new agreement; and lastly, we are in the process of finalizing additional deals that will provide approximately $10 million in new recurring EBITDA for FIS.","Similar to the process we file during every planning cycle to manage the impact of client losses through market consolidation, we are working aggressively to eliminate the impact of the M&I migration beyond 2013. The Bremmer Bank win that Gary referenced earlier and our ongoing discussions with Bank of Montreal are good first steps towards achieving that goal.","Please turn to Slide 24 for a reconciliation of net earnings. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations totaled $148 million in the third quarter, adding back the $40 million in after-tax purchase amortization results in adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $188 million. Weighted average shares totaled $298 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $307 million in the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 5% to $0.63 compared to $0.60 in the third quarter of 2011. Last year's number included $0.04 of benefit from tax due to some favorable tax outcomes in the third quarter of 2011. The impact of foreign currency on earnings per share was not material due to our natural hedging by region and the lower cost of our Indian captive.","As we expected, the effective tax rate increased to 34% in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 29% in the second quarter of 2012 and 30% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rates in the prior periods were reduced by favorable resolution of certain tax provisions taken by the company. We continue to anticipate a full year tax rate of 33% in 2012.","On Slide 25, cash flow from operations totaled $255 million in the third quarter of 2012 with capital expenditures totaling $71 million, resulting in free cash flow of $193 million for the quarter.","Next, I will provide an overview of our sale of our healthcare business on Slide 26. The sale is completed on August 15 in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $335 million, with net proceeds of approximately $220 million after-tax. We recognize an after-tax GAAP loss of $56 million related to the sale, which is included in the discontinued operations. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy and the terms of our credit agreement, the after-tax proceeds will be used to reinvest in the business. Although these proceeds from the healthcare divestiture will provide us with greater flexibility regarding the use of our operating cash, including potential additional share repurchases.","Slide 27. On February 14, we outlined our capital allocation strategy that focuses on 3 specific areas, namely investing in our business, strengthening the balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders. We continue to execute on that plan. Gary provided several examples of where we're investing to expand our solutions suite to new product development and tuck-in acquisitions that leverage our existing capabilities and global distribution channels.","On September 30, we completed the ProNet transaction for approximately $24 million in cash. In 2012, we have completed a total of 3 acquisitions at a combined cost of less than $70 million. The nature and size of these deals clearly reflect a strategic shift in our M&A focus. We continue to strengthen the balance sheet and are working towards our goal to attain an investment grade rating. Total debt outstanding declined by $332 million in the quarter to $4.5 billion. The weighted average interest rate was 4.7% as of September 30, and debt-to-EBITDA improved to 2.6x at quarter end.","In February, we also aligned our plan to return excess cash to shareholders to a fourfold increase in the dividend and a $1 billion stock buyback program, which targets $250 million in baseline annual share repurchases over the next 4 years.","In the third quarter, we purchased 3.1 million shares at a total cost of $100 million, which includes approximately $50 million with the cash proceeds of option exercises. Dividends totaled $59 million in the quarter.","Through the first 9 months of the year, we have repurchased $251 million of our stock or 8 million -- 8.3 million shares, and paid $176 million in dividends for a total cash of $427 million returned to our shareholders. Approximately $850 million in share repurchase authority remains under the existing plan.","Before I open the lines for question, I will provide a few key takeaways from today's overview as summarized on Slide 28. We continue to execute the strategic shift that we communicated to shareholders in February. We are delivering on a financial commitment and capital allocation plan, more specifically, 5% organic growth, 90 basis points of margin expansion and a 15% increase in earnings per share through the first 9 months of the year. And we have returned $427 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases.","We are encouraged by the year-to-date increase in global sales activity, including the third quarter rebound in sales to North American financial institutions. We anticipate that new contract value across all of our business lines in 2012 will exceed our new contract value from 2011.","We have solidified our relationship with BMO Harris as a top 5 client. In addition, we have virtually eliminated the 2013 EBITDA impact of the M&I migration and are working aggressively to eliminate the impact beyond 2013. Our focus on information security is ongoing, and we will continue to invest to further improve security and risk management across the company.","In closing, we feel good about our execution for the -- through the first 3 quarters of 2012. For the full year, we expect revenue to come in at the high end of our range of 3% to 5% organic growth, margins to be in our expected range of a 40- to 80-basis-point expansion over 2011, and earnings per share from continuing operations in the middle of our range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share.","That concludes our prepared statements for today. Operator, you can now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we will go to the line of Dave Koning with Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And I guess first of all, just on M&I, just to make sure we're clear on it. Last quarter, you basically said there was the $60 million hole. Now you're basically saying, given some of the wins you've got, there's a $40 million hole but it'll be offset next year by a term fee. And then going into to 2014, hopefully you'll sign more stuff to offset the $40 million. Is that a good way to characterize it?","Michael D. Hayford","Yes, David, I think that's a very good way to look at it. And again, last quarter, we were in a situation where we had M&I getting ready to migrate over in October and felt we should share with the Street where we were at with that. But we did not have that agreement signed. So as you can see, the outcome of the agreement came up better than we anticipated. The $40 million is a 2013 one-time, the rest of it we anticipate going forward. But as we stated, we lose clients through consolidation of marketplace every year. And every year, we have to refill those buckets. So we feel pretty good about the time we have left to get ready for beyond 2013.","Frank R. Martire","David, we are -- this is Frank. We are very pleased with the results, but as important now with our strong relationship with Bank of Montreal. We're pretty excited about the future.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, that's great news, definitely. And then the second thing, I didn't realize how big the India win was. How long do you think it'll take to get to the $100 million revenue run rate?","Gary A. Norcross","This is Gary. We're very excited about that. That was a very competitive win. There was a formal auction process. We won 2 large circles at a really premium rate. Those will be coming over. The overall deal is 7 years in nature. Keep in mind, we have an existing business there that's already growing very nicely, so this layers on. But we'll be coming up to speed over the next several years installing those ATMs, and then the adoption will come around but -- and we'll see growth over the next 3 to 4 years to those numbers.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's great news too. And then finally, last quarter, there were some uncertainty about some of Visa's pricing strategies and a little bit of fear around NYCE. But that was great to hear 11% year-over-year growth in NYCE. Maybe you can just give just a quick summary of kind of the competitive dynamics in that business right now.","Michael D. Hayford","Well, as you can see, NYCE continues to perform very strong for us. I'd say we still are monitoring what's going on with Visa and some of the actions that they've taken. But the network we have is very competitive. It's very integrated to our product set, and we continue to get a lot of questions on how NYCE is performing, and NYCE is performing very well.","Frank R. Martire","Yes, that's exactly right, Dave. I mean, we're seeing strong transaction growth. But as Mike points out, keep in mind, our sales are up significantly for the year, and so -- across the entire company. And when you think about NYCE, we're seeing good cross-sales into our existing customers. And so we're seeing nice growth for it. As we've shared with you in past quarters, VPN has been an issue, but we have some strategies, as well, that helps address that. So we're confident in that group continuing to perform.","Operator","Next we'll hear from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar, I believe, with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So one question I have is you're tracking to the upper end of the range. Sometimes, you went a little bit higher on most of your metrics, even when I consider the information security spending. So would you say you're kind of, for 4Q, leaning more towards maybe the upper end of the range? And why wouldn't you raise guidance, why -- at least to say that you're at the upper end of the range?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, again, Ashwin, we -- our revenue is tracking very strong, as you can see, through 3 quarters we're at the high end of our 3% to 5% range. I think if you keep in mind in the last quarter, we adjusted our EPS for the divestiture healthcare, so that $0.07 came out. And then we turned around and bumped it up for primarily for some tax. So we've already bumped it up $0.05, if you look at it that way. I think we feel good about where we're going to be on earnings in the middle of the range. You can see it's putting some money back into the business, but we're pretty excited about the revenue of strength that we've seen now for 8 quarters. And again, we got a good headstart on where we're going to end up for the full year.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And that information security spending, that kind of spikes up in 3Q and 4Q here. Does that begin to taper off early part of next year? Or how much of that is ongoing, I guess, has been my question?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, that comes in 2 components. One is there's some project work related to some of the activities that we're undertaking. And then we do believe that, on an ongoing basis, our level of spending in information security and, to some degree as well, the risk management area will be higher going forward than it has been in the past. I think when we finalize our budget and sit down and talk about '13, we'll give you a sense of where that spend will be for '13. But we've got -- as you can see, a lot of activities going on in that area. And we anticipated that spend in the second half of the year being a little higher than the first half.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Last question, just a clarification, the North America FI sales rebound. Is that broad-based, and does that kind of include already the BMO deal? Or is that more 4Q, I mean, when will that completely finalize, I guess?","Michael D. Hayford","Yes, Ashwin. Well, keep in mind, the number that we gave you would being new sales of new revenue, not renewals. But so it would include the new sales within BMO. So the reality is we saw just strong rebound in the quarter. I mean, we told you in the second quarter we thought we would have some bleed over from the second quarter. We saw those deals get signed, and we saw a very, very nice rebound over second quarter and then year-over-year.","Frank R. Martire","It's actually -- and I think BMO signed in early October, so it wouldn't include -- now when I think about it, it would not include that number. So it was a very strong quarter for sales, not only in North America but across the spectrum.","Michael D. Hayford","And that's showing a strong pipeline going forward also.","Operator","And next, we will hear from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","As you guys -- one of the things that sort of stuck out to me was your investment in the security stuff, and I understand why you're doing it. Some of it, I think like you said, is projects, and some of it as, I think, you're positioned to be sort of a market leader. When we look out next year and you think about your long-term guidance for margin expansion, is that long-term guidance still accurate relative to the incremental investments you-all think you need to make in that security stuff next year? Or what kind of color can you give us as we think forward for the long-term model?","Frank R. Martire","Yes, I mean, again, I -- our long-term expectation in that range, we've laid out 36 basis points of margin expansion. We would anticipate we will continue to execute against that. You can see this year, we're still 40 to 80. You can see the level of spending we're putting back into that particular area. But our long-term numbers are still intact.","Gary A. Norcross","And, Brett, as you mentioned, we are very focused on the investment class in this area. And we think it's going to be the new normal, and it's going to be required in order to compete in the market. And we've always taken a long-term view of the market. And we've always invested heavily to be able to be as competitive as possible. So we think it will be a differentiator for us in the future.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And then one follow-up question. In Europe, obviously, it sounds like Capco continues to carry a lot of water there, which is great. I know one of the things that we've been hoping to see at some point in the medium term is Capco helping generate a big core win or similar win in Europe or in other region where they have operations. Can you give us any just qualitative thoughts about how conversations for those larger deals are going and what we might expect here in the medium term?","Frank R. Martire","Yes, Brett, I mean, we've talked about this on a number of calls. I'll tell you, Capco is really paying off for us across all front. As you said, they're performing exceptionally well both in Europe and North America. So the growth is there, the margin expansion's there. All I can say is the level of conversations we're having this year at this point in time are far greater than where we were a year ago. The types of conversations we're having in very large financial institutions, not only around core banking but services and payments and how to bring our capabilities, are exciting. So we think Capco has already turned out to be a success for us, and we think in the near term, you're going to see us sign some business that are very complementarity as a result of this combination.","Michael D. Hayford","Yes, I mean, as Gary said, Capco is performing very strong stand-alone, just by itself. And now we just see the significant opportunities we have as being part of the total FIS family.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","The first question, probably for Gary, sort of looking at the Slide 12, the 30% increase in new contract value sold, and I think you said year-to-date. And then you suggested BMO, the incremental part of it, would sort of roll on to the fourth quarter. It sounds like the pipeline's robust. But then you suggested the new contract value in '12 could basically be -- it sounded like almost flattish to 2011.","Gary A. Norcross","No, no, I'm sorry, if I did, I misspoke. Absolutely, we're very comfortable that 2012 total contract value in new sales will exceed 2011. We're up through the first 9 months globally. We brought an issue in the second quarter because we saw a dip in North American financial institutions. We saw that recover in Q3, which was what we expected. As you can see, we've already signed BMO in the quarter in October, so we're very comfortable that our total contract sales will exceed our 2011 results.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a little bit of more color in the North America. Was it just sort of timing of deals that slipped from 2Q to 3Q? And related to that, I just want to get a sense for like the environment, has -- are banks making more decisions or what sort of happened 3Q relative to 2Q?","Frank R. Martire","Well, I can tell you, we've said this on a number of calls. We're definitely seeing deal elongation. I mean, it takes longer to get these deals closed. So yes, we did see slippage in Q2, and the results of that were quickly in Q3, we were able to pick up a number of those. So the decisions are being made as evidenced by our sales success, not only within North America but abroad. But it is taking longer to get these deals done. They're more complex, they're bigger. But as we shared in the opening comments, we are seeing our clients look to leverage innovative solutions to help drive their costs down and become more efficient and compete. So the decisions are out there, but definitely, we see some slippage from time to time. And that's what happened in Q2.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then for Mike, just sort of given that you successfully filled the hole on BMO, any reason to think that you'll be outside of your long-term EPS targets in 2013?","Michael D. Hayford","No. I -- we'll still be -- I would expect that when we sit down in '13, we'll give you specific numbers. But the long term being the full year range that we gave you back in February, is kind of our look at what the current environment will give us in terms of top line growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. And as I said before, we're still very comfortable that we'll continue to be in those ranges. When you give a kind of long-term outlook like that, nothing ever happens exactly how you'd expect it. But given the size and the diversity of our company, we're able to adjust and make up any challenges that we have. So sitting here today, as we said, we're still very comfortable with where we're going to be.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I want to ask about the Payment Solutions business. I know it's been sluggish for a couple of quarters. When do you guys see on the horizon that, that business might turn? Is that some point in 2013?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, Bryan, yes, as we adjust every quarter, we adjust out our paper-based businesses, so we are seeing some growth in the business. We're seeing great margin expansion, which shows the flexibility of our model. We have a huge Payment business, so the reality is a number of our areas like bill payment and then some of those areas are seeing very good growth, some of the things that we're doing around mobile payments. But we feel like our Payments business going forward is going to be, at least sort of next year or so, mid- to low-single-digit top line. But we think we'll get very strong organic growth. So we're pleased with how the business is performing. And you see some of the examples of like the growth that Mike highlighted around NYCE this quarter.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I assume that PayNet might start contributing to revenue in that business segment, probably '13 and '14? I guess that's the first question. And second question, how does that compare to something like a Popmoney? How do you guys think it compares? And one last piece of that, do you guys see yourselves competing directly with the networks like Visa and MasterCard with PayNet?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, let's take your first question. PayNet, as we shared with you, we've already got over 100 clients running in pilot today. We'll roll additional functionality through that solution. We'll continue to have -- to bring on customers and expand the network through 2013. And, yes, you'll -- we'll start seeing some revenue contribution in 2013, and that's going to grow in 2014 and beyond. We think it's got potential to be -- to produce some fairly sizable revenue. As far as the comparisons to other solutions, we think we have a very competitive offering. We're very confident, the things that we're going to be able to do with PayNet, and so we think we'll be very competitive in the industry. As far as competing with Visa and some of the schemes, we're, once again, not sure. The reality is we'll just continue to compete on the strength of our product and through our sales engine, and cross-sell and drive value to our clients. And that's, frankly, how we think about all of our solutions that we roll out.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you think about selling PayNet directly to the merchants, or was it just -- will be mostly to the FIs?","Frank R. Martire","It's going to be an FI-centric solution, but they'll have some merchant components to it as well. So we're pleased with what we've developed.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for me. Just on the -- when we talk about the BMO Harris, the $40 million of term fees -- term and settlement fees, does that show up in any one given quarter or is that spread throughout, equally, through the 4 quarters of 2013?","Michael D. Hayford","Yes, I mean, you should anticipate that being spread fairly evenly throughout the year.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And did you guys also say that $10 million to $20 million of that -- you said something about -- not all of that $40 million is onetime. I just want to make sure I heard that correctly.","Michael D. Hayford","Right. So that $40 million of the term and settlement fees, I don't think it'll be evenly spread throughout 4 quarters, but you'll see it hit all 4 quarters across 2013.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I guess my question is, is that a -- is there -- is that $40 million all kind of -- do we have any of that carry forward into 2014?","Michael D. Hayford","No. That is a 2013 event.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from the line of Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Roman Leal in for Julio. First, on the sales growth, maybe you can -- can you help us out and just kind of walk us through what -- where is most of the growth coming from? I know you say it's pretty broad-based, but perhaps what segments are beating your expectations versus just meeting them?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, well, as we shared within North American financial institutions, we saw a rebound from second quarter to the third, and we saw a year-over-year growth and also sequential quarter growth. And that really was on the strength of a lot of our core banking and payments technologies in the U.S. And the international markets, depending on what region of the world you're talking about, we're seeing good sales and expansion through core, through payments, like the India is a huge win for us, and so that's driving a lot of revenue growth. We're also seeing some nice expansion around our services businesses, IP services in North America. So really, there's -- those are the primary areas that are ahead for the year.","Roman Leal - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just based on your commentary that -- and your confidence that total contract value for the year will be ahead of last year. Is it just fair to say that heading into 4Q '12 and 2013, you're more comfortable at this point than you were a year ago heading to 2012?","Gary A. Norcross","I don't -- obviously, we'll give you 2013 guidance later. But we're very confident with our pipeline. We had a strong sales year last year. We're exceeding that growth this year as far as new sales go. Obviously, we need that level of sales to continue to push the company and drive on the top end, high recurring revenue and organic growth. So we're confident that we'll be able to push into next year like we did last year.","Michael D. Hayford","We're confident because we've had nice growth in '12 over '11, so it makes you feel more optimistic going forward.","Operator","Next is from the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just had a question, I guess it probably applies sort of the topic of PayNet, which is payments overall. Could you talk about how you think about PayNet or any of your other payment-related assets in the business-to-business world, not just necessarily the consumer-to-consumer, consumer-to-business?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, when we're looking to build out capabilities, Tim, I mean, obviously, we're wanting to hit the multiple markets that exist. So we certainly want to think about our payments and our innovation to drive not only personal but also business electronic adoption. And as one of the nice things about our company is we've built such a breadth of portfolio of solution that we're able to package more creatively and address those markets. So we think about them differently because they do take different solutions. I mean, PayNet, is certainly an opportunity for us to move, as I shared with you some of the ideas around P2P and some of the things we're doing to transfer over that network. But we're also doing a lot of payment activities around B2B as well. But so we think about our capabilities depending on the market we're going on and make the investments where we think we can get the most growth, that's also not only going to drive the most revenue but also the most profit expansion for us.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Do you think as you -- I know nothing here, necessarily, is material in the near term given the breadth of the company, but as you think about the B2B market, which I think is so much more paper-intensive than consumer, do you feel like you have the assets or the bandwidth internally to continue to evolve and develop that marketplace when you believe the time is right? Or would that actually be an avenue where a targeted acquisition might make more sense for you?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, tuck-in acquisitions will always play in our strategy. As Mike mentioned, we've done 3 acquisitions this year. We think it's an important component. But do we have the ability to expand the markets? We always evaluate markets to see, is there really a potential to monetize our sales force. I mean, we have one of the largest sales forces in the industry. We also have one of the largest investments from a capital standpoint back into our products each and every year. So those 2 come together in concert, and we make sure we're making the investments where we think can drive the most growth for the company. So can we go tackle B2B? We would agree with you, it's a very paper-intensive market. Certainly, as we see that market evolve, what we will certainly -- if there's a business -- if there's an opportunity for us to take advantage of it, we will, as we've shown over the last several quarters of performance.","Michael D. Hayford","Tim, you might see us do more buildout in our partnership in this space. And one of the reasons why it's probably underinvested as a whole is it's harder to make money in the B2B space, that's why we don't see as many competitors. So I think we have some very good underlying technology to get back to real-time transactions. And whether we would look at acquiring or building or maybe even more, like I said, partnering with people. But that -- this is an area that we think is going to have some investment dollars over the next few years.","Gary A. Norcross","Absolutely.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from the line of Stephanie Davis with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's actually Tien-Tsin. I wanted to just make sure I heard this correctly. I mean, if B2B is up, your bookings and sales are up, is it fair to say that the reg letter issues from before are sort of behind you, and sort of yesterday's news at this point?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, I -- we certainly had a confidential regulatory letter go out where we certainly feel like we've addressed or are addressing that process with our clients. We're communicating very openly with them. We continue to work with our clients, and I would say the results speak for themselves from a sales standpoint. We were concerned in Q2 that it might be having some impact. We saw that rebound nicely in Q3. So at this point in time, we're continuing to move forward and just work with our clients and sell the best solution we can.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good. So the -- and then separately, the debit issuer deconversion that was mentioned on the release, sorry if I missed it in your prepared remarks. What was that and what was the size?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, we had called out last call, in the second quarter call, that we had a large client, that happens to be a large legacy funds client that had been with us for a long period of time. And they, quite frankly, had been in the process of deconverting literally for years. And they left our platform in the second quarter, so we knew that would be a hit for us in the third and fourth quarter, so we didn't give a specific number. But you can see that in the results that growth went down a little bit at linked quarters.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, understood. Last one, just the India timing. I know Dave Koning asked this before, but how should that progress? I mean, is that a design managed services outsourcing contract, or are there some deliverables and assumed transactions to get there? I'm just curious what...","Michael D. Hayford","Yes, no, that's a great question. This is part of all the financial inclusion that's going on within India. The good news is, Tien-Tsin, we've got a very strong business that exists in India today that has shown very nice growth over the last several years. So we're not stepping into this with, we would consider, incorrect expectations. There are some assumptions on transaction and volume growth, but we think, from multiple years of experience we had, that we certainly can hit our financial numbers that we talked about in the call. As I shared, the contracts are done. We'll be rolling those out over the next couple of years on top of our existing business. So we're very comfortable that the growth factor we disclosed will be there.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","On the Payments business, Mike, you highlighted a tough compare coming up in Q4 in the margin front. But you did have 230 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion there despite flat revenue. How should we think about the margin trends in payments as we look to 2013? Are there additional major cost takeout actions that we should expect?","Michael D. Hayford","Yes, I don't know if I get to mention the '13 at this time. I mean, you can see the last 2 years, the team has done a really good job with margins in PSG, in an environment that has a relatively low growth. So they look at how we end up '12. You can see, as we look at the second half, it's a little more challenging in the first half on the revenue, but the earnings are still pretty solid in there. And as we look at '13, we'll have to go through that business and see what kind of growth we can get. And then as you've seen Gary and the team do in past years, if we don't have the top line growth, I'm sure we'll find ways to get the bottom line expansion.","Gary A. Norcross","And, David, that's something we do every year. Gary does that consistently year after year. We look at our growth potential, and we're realistic about it. And then if we have to optimize or do something on the expense side, we take action and we do it.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Definitely good to see the progress there. Gary, your thoughts on the new business pipeline in Brazil, should we expect some significant new addition to the Banco Bradesco card processing JV?","Gary A. Norcross","We've got a fantastic relationship down there, David, and it continues to perform very nicely. We saw some nice growth there this quarter, and then we highlighted it in the call. I would tell you, the relationship can't be stronger as Bradesco continues to grow, the joint venture will definitely be the recipient of that. The question is whether ELO's going to take off. There's a number of interesting things going on in Brazil, and it's hard to predict what the adoption rate or some of those are going to be. But we're very comfortable with the position we have in Brazil. We're the largest third-party processor in the country, and we're very pleased with that business.","Frank R. Martire","We're just well positioned.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, just a quick final question, if I could sneak one in. On September 30 share count, Mike, basic and fully diluted?","Michael D. Hayford","Yes, I think you'll get all the detail in the Q when it comes out later this week. But it's $298 million, is where we ended up the count, fully diluted.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from the line of Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a quick one. The minority interest increasing, that's just increased profitability in the Brazilian JV, is that correct?","Gary A. Norcross","That's correct.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, so that's probably sustainable, there was nothing one-time in the quarter, per se, right?","Gary A. Norcross","No, no. That's just the continued growth of that business.","Michael D. Hayford","Yes, that business is just a pure processing business based on volume.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just your outsourced prepaid card processing, it sounds like you're working with AmEx, but I don't think you're doing the actual processing on that. I was just -- my question is, what's demand like both in the U.S. for other banks kind of entering the prepaid card space? And then, also, do you have international processing capabilities for prepaid cards?","Frank R. Martire","We do -- a lot there, I mean, first, no, we're not actually doing the card processing for Bluebird for AmEx. We are doing, as we shared, a lot of the mobile capabilities, doing a lot of the back-office, BPO-type of services work around that. When you think about prepaid both within North America and abroad, we do have extensive capabilities for prepaid outside of the U.S., and we're seeing very strong growth of that business in Europe. We're also partnered with American Express on a number of their gift card programs. So we're seeing good solid growth within North America as far as demand goes, but also in the international markets as well.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one last one, the legacy check business, the check risk management, the old Certegy business, any potential for a transaction there? I know you've explored it a number of times, or should we just expect it to kind of continue to bleed lower?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, I mean, it is a business that's got a secular decline in the payments, which we see both in that check verification business, as well as our item processing. But there's -- it's a business that, as you know, we've looked in the past. We continue to get pretty good margins out of it. And even though the revenues have continued to decline, the teams have been able to just improving the algorithms, improving the process to maintain the profits. So it's one of those situations where I don't think somebody is going to come in and look at writing us a big enough check based on the money we're going to take out of that the next few years.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes, you're certainly doing a good job on the margin side there.","Frank R. Martire","We're focused on running the business, optimizing the business and making sales where we could.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from the line of John Kraft with D.A. Davidson.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups here. Mike, I thought, in response to just the last couple of questions, you said something about the -- that large conversion actually happening in Q4 as well. Is that not completed in Q3?","Michael D. Hayford","No, no. That was a, I think, the related payment was a deconversion that occurred towards the end of the second quarter and impacted the third quarter and will also impact fourth quarter in payments.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So it's -- but it's completely done?","Michael D. Hayford","Yes.","Gary A. Norcross","Correct.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And then, also, you called out the strength in NYCE a couple different times. But in the press release, you mentioned strength in bill pay. Would you say things were accelerating there? Are you gaining some share? Can you talk a little bit about the market there?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, we're having some very nice wins in bill payment. And we're seeing good growth, not only top, bottom line, but also in transaction volumes. So that's driving, not only from adoption with the existing clients, but also good cross-sales. We shared with you guys over the last couple of years, we made a lot of investments in bill payment over the years. We've got a very competitive offering there, and we're real pleased with what the team is accomplishing this year.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Peter Heckmann with Avondale Partners.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to clarify on some of the revenue impact that we're talking about from BMO Harris and M&I. My assumption is that with the termination fee and some of the additional professional services, we might have the revenue headwind for 2013 down to perhaps less than 50 basis points, but then it would move up to another 100 basis points in 2014. Is that about the right way to look at it?","Michael D. Hayford","It might be a little bit higher than 50 basis points on the revenue side, but probably in that neighborhood, between 50 and 100 would be the revenue impact, depending on how much professional services would be pulled through.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then are there any capital requirements on the expansion of those ATMs in India, or is that on a third party?","Gary A. Norcross","No, we'll see some capital requirements. That's pretty typical of that business. But as we've shared in the comments, I mean, we think it's very accretive to our overall international business and the way it's operating today.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Sure, sure, okay. And then, I'm sorry, back to BMO Harris. Final question there is that, you were clear on the last call that you're consolidating the core, and in today's press release, you referenced bill pay and debit and some other tangential services. Are you consolidating all of those services in the U.S. with FIS?","Gary A. Norcross","We did. We've already completed that. We've completed not only the core conversion, which is an application management engagement, but we also completed all those ancillary services that we talked about in the script. We've converted those, as well, on a combined basis so...","Operator","The final question in queue currently comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Gary, when you're talking about new sales, you'd said the sales cycle is lengthening. I'm wondering, are you seeing anything in the new sales you're doing, whether it's India, whether it's the professional services, where it would lead you to believe that the revenue cycle would be different, as well, versus what it's been in the past?","Gary A. Norcross","No, not at all. I mean, the reality is, we've talked about this on multiple calls, the swing towards not only outsourcing but the packaging of services augment a particular product through an outsourced engagement is really occurring in quite a dramatic way. So that revenue comes online, however, in some instances, even faster if it's some type of services engagement. But that the onboarding of that revenue is typically about -- they're about the same length. The reality is our clients, we saw some pent-up demand because of the economy. We're now seeing that free up. They're making some decisions. But I would say the -- obviously, the economy is pushing some of the elongation out, but frankly, just the complexity of the overall solution. When you look at some of those things we referenced, like Bremmer, there's not too many banks that size in North America that are going to make a decision to convert off their income in core and then bring all of those additional services in a big bang approach. BMO Harris is a great example, as well. We converted all of that single system. It took us a long time to negotiate that agreement right up to the time we actually did the conversion. So at the end of the day, I think the revenue comes on in very much the same way.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then, Gary, just the last question. You're seeing some really good organic growth, especially on the financial institutions side. What do you think the market is growing at? And I guess the reason I asked is your ability to continue this momentum, you've done it for a long period of time now. And it seems as though with the sales momentum you have, you should be able to continue putting out these kind of numbers.","Gary A. Norcross","Well, we're pretty pleased with the team. I think all of us are. We think the opportunity to continue to grow is there, frankly. When you look at the assets that we assembled over the last 10 years, how we've bought together those assets, the innovation that we've wrapped around them and invested in, we think it puts us in a very different place. When you augment that with what we're doing abroad in our international markets, it's a very complementary mix that has allowed, as Frank and Mike highlighted, very nice organic growth, 7 out of the last 8 quarters, so over 5%. So at the end of the day, we're comfortable that we can continue to grow the business. We're comfortable that we got the team that can execute, the sales team and the operational team. We obviously got to keep innovating and keep making sure we're making the investments, do tuck-in acquisitions that make sense and allow it to come through our sales force.","Michael D.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. ","And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Pete Gunnlaugsson. Please go ahead sir.","Peter Gunnlaugsson","Thank you, Brad. Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. ","Gary Norcross, President and Chief Executive Officer will begin with a summary of our financial performance followed by the operations report. Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with a detailed financial review. Today's news release and the supplemental slide presentation are available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Today\u2019s remarks will contain forward-looking statements.

These non-GAAP measures are outlined on slide four. Reconciliations between the GAAP and the non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Gary to discuss the fourth quarter financial highlights on slide six. Gary?","Gary Norcross","Thank you Pete and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Turning to slide six, 2014 proved to be another very strong year. We drove consistent execution, continued to deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders and achieved our full year growth outlook. ","We finished the year with record revenue of $6.4 billion reflecting 6% year-over-year growth. We drove adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.10, growing our earnings per share by 10% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $864 million. ","In the fourth quarter our results are equally as strong; revenue increased 7%, EBITDA increased 9%, margins expanded 30 basis points and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% over the prior year period. We finished the year on a strong footing with continued sales success across all markets, a robust pipeline and good visibility heading into 2015. ","Turning to slide seven, consistent with our growth strategy, we are using our significant cash flow to drive value for our clients and our shareholders. First, we continue to invest for growth in our operations that target global financial institutions, as well as strategic solution oriented acquisitions including Clear2Pay, Reliance Trust and CMSI, all of which strengthen our payments well and lending capabilities respectively. ","Second, we maintained our strong balance sheet ending the year with leverage of 2.6 times debt to EBITDA, which reflects complete deleveraging of our investment and Clear2Pay during the fourth quarter. Our continued financial discipline was recognized by upgrades from both Fitch and Standard & Poor\u2019s during 2014. ","Third, we continue to deliver strong value to our investors returning $750 million to our shareholders in 2014 through $475 million of stock repurchases and $275 million in dividends. We also recently announced an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. ","Overall our strong fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the continued successful execution of our business strategy and our ability to consistently enhance shareholder returns. ","Turning now to the markets on slide eight. We continue to capitalize on the increasing market demand for scalable outsourced solutions and transformational services by leveraging our comprehensive suite of end to end technology assets, consulting services and outsource managed delivery capabilities. ","We saw increased demand in the quarter and year-over-year for our suite of integrated financial solutions. This was especially true in North America where we saw a number of key competitive core baking wins in the quarter and for the full year. For the fourth quarter we signed 14 new core deals and for the year we saw a 54% increase in total new core wins compared to the prior year. ","Digital channels continue to be a key driver as consumer adoption rates grow, creating strong opportunities for our broad based mobile platforms. These opportunities have translated into strong double-digit revenue growth in our mobile business, supported by our strong performance in new mobile deals last year and a user base approaching $30 million. We continue to be one of the leaders in integrated digital channels and mobile platforms and are delivering key innovations that are chaining the way people bank. ","As you would expect with the increasing regulatory burdens, our enterprise governance risk and compliance business continues to experience double-digit growth. We see intuitions of all sizes looked at by us to more effectively address the increasing regulatory requirements, enforcement actions and cyber security threats. ","In fact, last week we hosted over 300 clients in San Diego for our 11th Annual Enterprise Governance, Risk & Compliance Summit. This event brings together key stakeholders from banks and non-banks to federal and state regulatory agencies to discuss emerging risk and explore new best practices for handling these risks. ","These events are not only information sharing events, but create significant sales opportunities for our teams over the following months. These successes coupled with others within our North American businesses have created strong momentum and pipeline for 2015. ","Outside North America macro economic trends around the globe continue to cause headwinds in Brazil and some slippage of deals in Europe. Foreign currency exchange rates were a headwind in Q4 and will continue in 2015. However due to our broad geographic business and extensive asset portfolio, we produced strong double-digit growth overall for the year and have confidence in similar double-digit organic growth in 2015. ","This confidence is due to our success in 2014 delivering several key client wins, as well as continued progress on our large implementation projects. For example, in Q4 Bandhan Financial Services Ltd., India\u2019s largest micro finance institution with over 2,000 locations and 6 million customers will be offering retail baking services to its customers utilizing our core baking capability on an outsourced basis. The proposed Bandhan bank plans to launch between 400 to 600 branch locations beginning in Q2, 2015. ","In addition Muthoot Financial Partners also delivered another strong growth opportunity in Q4 by selecting us to fully manage its ATM services and switching solutions across India. Finally new startup banks in the U.K. proved to be a solid area of opportunity with FIS signing several startup bank clients in the quarter. ","To capitalize on the large IP spend and our success in selling to the top global financial institutions, throughout 2014 we added new global client partners, sales and client implementation support teams along with client centered marketing through our operations. ","As a result of these additions, we are building on our 2014 success and have a strong pipeline for large transformational outsourcing deals and are seeing results as cost containment, regulatory pressures and front to back office transformation projects continue to dominate our clients agendas. ","Additionally, we have seen significant increase in demand for our Clear2Pay solutions among these institutions. Our integration of Clear2Pay is on track and early sales results are inline with our investment case. We continue to see the benefit of FIS\u2019s global sales force adds to these strategic acquisitions by increasing access to our broad client base. ","Before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report, I\u2019d like to review the key pillars of our multi year strategy that provide us a strong foundation for success in 2015. ","Turning to slide nine. The breadth and depth of FIS\u2019s solution portfolio combined with our large sales and global reach enables us to drive change within our organization to deliver on our growth commitments. From this we are able to deliver on our financial commitments to our shareholders, while continuing to drive profitable growth consistently year-over-year. Strengthen our balance sheet by maintaining improving our investment grade ratings and meeting our total debt to EBITDA target. ","Continue to return cash to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks and quarterly dividends; leverage our scale and cost effectively manage our operations through continuous expense management discipline; and then act on strategic acquisitions in an environment of increasingly rapid and aggressive global competition. ","This increasingly rapid change is driven by disruptive innovators entrench competitors expanding their services and global players who are to scale with a wider breadth of solution and services is growing an importance to clients. This strategic focus provides us confidence in our ability to drive continued growth and strong financial performance. ","Woody will now provide details around our Q4 and full year performance. Woody?","Woody Woodall","Thanks Gary. I'll begin on slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year 2014. ","In the fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 7% on a reported basis to $1.7 billion. Consolidated revenue increased 5.4% on an organic basis, continuing our trend of accelerating organic revenue growth this year.","EBITDA increased 9% to $526 million, with EBITDA margin expanding 30 basis points to 31.1% compared to 30.8% in the prior year period. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $249 million from $220 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to $0.87 from $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2013. ","For the year revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis to $6.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% to $1.9 billion, EBITDA margin of 30% was 20 basis points lower than the prior year period reflecting our strategic investment in the global financial institutions market, shifting revenue mix and lower termination fees.","Adjusted earnings per share rose 10% to $3.10 per share, which is inline with the EPS guidance we provided in the third quarter call. These results include a negative currency impact on EPS of $0.01 for the quarter and $0.02 for the full year. ","Next, I will continue on slide 12 with a review of segment results. In the fourth quarter Financial Solutions revenue grew 7% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis to $645 million. These results were driven primarily by growth and implementations, consulting and services and risk and compliance solutions. ","Financial Solutions EBITDA for the quarter increased 6% to $253 million; EBITDA margin was 39.2% down from 39.7% in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher consulting and services revenue. For the year Financial Solutions revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic basis to $2.5 billion from $2.3 billion. This growth was primarily driven by consulting and services, mobile banking and risk and compliance solutions. Full year EBITDA increased 4% to $980 million, EBITDA margin was 39.3% with 70 basis points lower than the prior year period resulting primarily from lower termination fees.","Turning to slide 13, in the fourth quarter Payment Solutions revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic basis to $647 million. This growth reflects increased volumes in network solutions and card production. ","Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 5% to $275 million in the quarter and the margin increased 10 basis points to 42.5%, driven primarily by transaction volume growth on our processing platforms. For the full year Payment Solutions revenue increased 2% on a reported and organic basis to $2.5 billion. Full year adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to lower termination fees compared to the prior year period.","Now I\u2019ll cover on our international business on slide 14. In the fourth quarter International Solutions revenue grew 13% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis to $398 million. This double digit organic growth was driven by increased implementation revenue and consulting services. International EBITDA increased 7% to $103 million. EBITDA margin was 25.9%, down 140 basis points compared to the prior year due to shift in revenue mix. ","For the full year International Solutions revenue increased 12% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic basis to $1.4 billion. Full year EBITDA increased 6% to $320 million compared to $303 million in the prior year period. EBITDA margin decreased 140 basis points to 22.5%, reflecting the shift in revenue mix in 2014 and the investment in the global financial institution market. ","Overall corporate expense in the fourth quarter was $105 million, down from $114 million in the prior year period. For the year corporate expense was down $18 million to $427 million. This decrease is driven by our continued commitment to productivity improvements and cost management. ","Moving to the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP EPS on slide 15. GAAP earnings totaled $0.71 per share compared to $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 for acquisition-related purchase price amortization and $0.04 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs.","Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $455 million in the quarter of 2014 and $1.2 billion for the full year. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $99 million and $371 million for the year. The $371 million for the year is 6% of 2014 revenue and represents our commitment to continue to invest in our businesses and new products and services. ","We delivered free cash flow of $357 million for the quarter and $864 million for the full year 2014. These results are consistent with our previous guidance for free cash flow conversion to approximate adjusted net earnings for the full year. Our uses of cash flow during 2014 were consistent with our capital allocation priorities of investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.","Moving to slide 16. We returned $750 million to share holders in 2014. This consisted of $275 million in dividend and $475 million in share re-purchases. In 2014 we repurchased 8.7 million shares in the open market at an average cost of about $55 per share. ","The share re-purchase programs over 2% decreased in our weighted average diluted share account to $288.7 million in 2014 from $294.2 million in 2013. We did not re-purchase any shares in the fourth quarter as we reduced debt related to the Clear2Pay acquisition. Debt outstanding totaled $5.1 billion as of December 31. The weighted average interest rate was 3.1% at year-end. Total debt to EBITDA was 2.6 times which is in line with our target of approximately 2.5 times. ","On December 18 we announced the amendment of our existing credit facility. We increased our revolver capacity from $2 billion to $3 billion and extended the maturity to 2019 from 2017. Heading in to 2015 we feel very comfortable with the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility that affords us to continue to invest for growth.","Moving on to slide 17, I will discuss our outlook for 2015. For 2015 we expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% on both a reported and organic basis. As stated in our third quarter call, we expect margin expansion to continue in to 2015 and to be in the range of 10 to 30 basis points for the year. ","We expect 2015 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.37 to $3.49 per share, which is a 9% to 13% increase over 2014. Foreign currency exchange rates will continue to be a meaningful headwind in 2015, negatively impacting EPS by approximately $0.06. Excluding the impact of currency our 2015 EPS growth would be 11% to 15%. We expect free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. Finally as Gary noted, we recently increased our dividend by 8% to $0.26 per share.","Today we are also providing first quarter 2015 EPS guidance to give color on the calendarization of our 2015 plan. We expect continued negative foreign currency impacts in Q1, 2015. Additionally, while good news for the long term, we are planning for a very little impact in bank consolidation resulting in our lowest level of termination fees in the first quarter over the past three years. Based on these items we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.72 per share in the first quarter. ","We are confident that we will again deliver on our full year guidance. This is based on our proven ability to execute and meet our stated financial commitments. Revenue visibility from deals sold in 2014, our sales pipeline and our continued focus on managing our cost structure. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","Good morning guys.","Gary Norcross","Hi, good morning Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","On the organic growth Woody and Gary, can you explain just the 5% to 7% range both reported and organics. I think there is some Clear2Pay in there. I think that\u2019s the big organic item. Can you just give us a sense of sort of how you parse that in the 5% to 7% range?","Gary Norcross","Yes, you relay got two things going Brett on the reported growth you\u2019ve got Clear2Pay coming on for three extra quarters in 2015. You also have Reliance Trust coming on for a full half of the year and CMSI coming on for may be an extra quarter. On the opposite side of that you got about two points of FX on the top line that will dilute that reported growth. That\u2019s how you kind of end up with a reported and organic in the same area.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","I see, I got it. So we basically, if we took the mid-point or six we\u2019d add two points to get8x-4x [ph].","Gary Norcross","That\u2019s correct.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","And then we\u2019d subtract, I don\u2019t know other sorts of things about two points in the organic.","Gary Norcross","That\u2019s about right.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful thank you. And then my only other question was Gary you talked about a couple of things in India. One, I think we knew about the big microfinance with many branches and then I think you announced a new one. Can you just tell us about the new one again? I didn\u2019t quite get that?","Gary Norcross","Yes, now wait \u2013 the team continues to execute very well in India Brett. We signed a deal with Muthoot whose going to actually bring over all of their ATM driving all their ATM settlement and it just continuous to build out that ATM franchise. As you know we signed that very large India ATM deal with the public sector banks. That\u2019s going very well, that roll out and we just continue to expand our business there. So it\u2019s just a very nice add on to our existing infrastructure.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","Okay, and then any other \u2013 can you talk just a little bit about risk and compliance generally. Woody when we went through the segments I heard risk and compliance mentioned a lot. Are we still in inning two or three of banks spending on risk and compliance. Can we expect to look forward to that for some time to come or we more in inning seven or eight on that and we got to find a new source of revenue?","Gary Norcross","No, I think we are in the early stages. What we are starting to see now Brett is as you know, we want through a series starting all the way back to 2011 where we saw a significant ramp in our OpEx around risk and security. Those investments have now parlayed into some assets that we are now offering out to our customer base. And just like everything we see, we saw the precursor of it being consulting services, so we saw our consulting side of our business grow. We then moved into back office services and now we are seeing it move into some of the product capabilities that we built out over the last several years. ","So we think we are in the early stages. It\u2019s absolutely the top of mind. I just got back from a large conference a couple of weeks ago and it was literally the number one theme across all of the CEO\u2019s of the largest banks in the world and so we think there is tremendous opportunity here for us to continue to grow the business going forward.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","Okay great. That\u2019s what I needed, I appreciate it.","Gary Norcross","Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of David Koning with Baird; please go ahead.","David Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. ","Yes, hi guys nice job.","Gary Norcross","Thanks David.","David Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Yes. I guess my first question is Q1 you talked a little bit about guidance for Q1. It\u2019s the easiest comp of the year in terms of revenue growth. But I\u2019m just wondering, you know is this year going to be a little different. I know you had the big pipeline of deal activity. Do we actually this year even though it\u2019s the easier comps, start a little slower with growth and then as some of that deal momentum builds and you layer it on, that revenue growth actually accelerates through the year?","Gary Norcross","I think it\u2019s really more around timing around some term fees as I tried to mention. Typically we\u2019ve had probably one to one and half points per quarter in the form of term fees Dave. We\u2019ve called that out. It\u2019s been as high as almost two points when we had M&I flowing through back in 2013. ","We are planning for the lowest level of term fees we\u2019ve seen in three years in 2015, which again very good for the long term because you don\u2019t lose the run rate but it does move some of that lumpiness around. We had over a point in the first quarter of last year in terms of term fees and we are looking at at-least from a planning perspective almost negligible term fees for Q1 of \u201815.","Woody Woodall","Yes Dave, just to add to that, if you think about it term fees are very hard to predict obviously. We don\u2019t know what acquisitions are going on in the market until typically they are announced. Every now and then we get a little advance notice, but if you think about when we came out of the 2008 economic collapse and once the bank stabilized and dealt with all of their loan issues and we saw the closure rate fall off, we now have seen a spike over the last several years of the increase, what I would say, almost pent-up acquisition demand. ","As Woody said, the good news is we see that trailing off, I mean which is positive for us, because as we talked in the past, even when one of our clients buys one of our plants, one plus one never equals two. So for us based on what we are seeing, based on what our clients are telling us that\u2019s going to continue to trend down. We saw a drop in term fees last year. We think it\u2019s going to be dropped again this year. But as far as the growth of the revenue goes, it always cycles where Q1 is always typically our slowest growth and then it ramps up through the course of the year, just the nature of the business.","David Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. ","Okay, good and then I guess the other thing, margins up year-over-year this quarter, which is nice trend to start again. My guess the way you are kind of talking though this is margins actually might be down year-over-year in Q1 because of the term fee issue, but then should they be up year-over-year in all the other quarters of 2015?","Woody Woodall","Yes, again we were trying to add further color from Q3. We saw some margin expansion and expectations into the fourth quarter and actually executed on that. We did see those come through. We do anticipate margins for the full year to be in the 10 to 30 basis point range. We do believe that margin will come further in the year second, third, fourth quarter.","David Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. ","Okay, and then finally FX, you know you characterized it as a two point headwind. We are usually pretty close. Our model is like 2.8% headwind right now and I know you give a wide enough range on revenues to kind of absorb different moving parts, but I\u2019m just wondering, it just feels a little more like 3% would be kind of the conservative approach, but unless there is a little change in FX make up now with some of the acquisitions. I guess maybe you could just quickly kind of walk through that?","Woody Woodall","Yes, I think the difficulty is exactly what you talk about. If you can give me where you think all the different rates are going to be for the year, I\u2019ll give you exactly what FX is going to be very challenging as you know, particularly in a very dynamic market over the past eight weeks or so in FX, but in that range it could be a little higher Dave, but we think we are in a range, a ballpark its about there.","David Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. ","Yes, I won\u2019t guess that. I\u2019ll stick to my day-to-day job, but thanks, good job.","Gary Norcross","All right, thanks Dave.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of George Mihalos from Credit Suisse, please go ahead.","Allison Jordan \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, congrats on the quarter. This is Allison joining in for George. I had a question, if you could possibly provide a breakdown of constant currency growth within international, maybe what you are seeing across Europe and LatAm and if you can give us a sense of the contribution coming from Asia?","Gary Norcross","Yes, Asia Pac has been growing very significantly for us. We typically haven\u2019t been giving individual growth rates in those regions, but I can tell you it\u2019s in the 20% type range. It\u2019s been growing very well. ","As you know, LatAm, we gave a lower growth profile around LatAm. In fact for the year we saw almost flat Latin American growth and some decline in Brazil and then we saw good bounce back in Europe where we saw you know mid teen growth in Europe. Adding it all together we ended up with that, so I think it was around 11% for the full year in terms of growth. ","Again, we keep talking about India. You are hearing wins in Asia. It\u2019s not a huge dollar impact yet, but it\u2019s growing very rapidly for us and we believe it will become a more and more important piece of the overall pie. The full geographic breadth I guess is the strength of our international business right now were you can see certain areas growing very fast, other areas that may not be growing as fast, but still giving us good visibility into solid double digit growth for a long horizon there.","Woody Woodall","Yes, I think that\u2019s key Alison. When I think about the business and where the business is growing, you saw Brazil be a huge tailwind for us post 2008, while Europe was struggling to recover. We signaled on many calls that we started seeing our consulting business grow again in Europe, which is great. Then it lead into some significant product wins which we\u2019ve announced on the call. I know Brazil is going through that cycle. ","Asia frankly has been strong throughout the entire recovery. The team is just doing a great job over there. So for us it\u2019s really that geographic dispersion that allows us to have good strong confidence that we can maintain that double-digit growth rate outside the U.S. in 2015.","Allison Jordan \u2013 Credit Suisse","That\u2019s great color, thank you. And then just one more from me, are you seeing any more EMV driven issuance activity and do you expect that to be a meaningful contributor to the top line growth in 2015?","Gary Norcross","Yes, EMV is going to be a tailwind for us in 2015. The sales team\u2019s done a nice job. We are continuing to see more and more activity on that. We\u2019ve announced on several calls some very nice wins of people converting their entire card base. We\u2019ve now got a lot of people who are starting to sign up and they are on kind of a three-year cycle to go through that. So I think your going to see it as a nice tailwind for us for the next several years. ","You\u2019re also going to see frankly even Mag Stripe and some of the prepaid areas etcetera. It\u2019s going to kind of maintain its kind of steady state. So card production will be a definitely a tailwind for us for the next couple of years.","Woody Woodall","Yes, if you look back to Q4, PSG grew in the 3.5% zone and card production was definitely one of the drivers. If you go back to the prepared remarks you should be able to view that.","Allison Jordan \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter.","Gary Norcross","All right, thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Glen Greene from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Glen Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","Good morning. I\u2019ll start with sales activity. Gary it sounded like the commentary overall was good, maybe a little bit mixed. It sounded like there were a few deals that slipped maybe in Europe. On the other hand it sounded like you\u2019ve got a pretty robust sort of transformational outsourcing pipeline. Maybe if you can just give us a little bit more color and if you think this is sort of the breakout here for those big transformational deals. ","Gary Norcross","You know Glen, I think the answer to that is it could be yes. I mean what we\u2019re seeing is frankly we are seeing good signings. We are seeing some bill slippage in Europe which continues to bother us, but I think it\u2019s the kind of the state of the whole European environment, but we still signed a number of \u2013 in Q4 we signed a number of startups in the UK for example on product. We continue to see our consulting business grow exponentially in that market, which is always a great sign and we\u2019ve already announced a number of bog transformational outsourcing deals. ","So I think when I think about the global marketplace, global financial institution marketplace, the pipeline continues to grow and we continue to execute. I wish some of these deals wouldn\u2019t slip from quarter-to-quarter, but that\u2019s just the nature of these areas in the economy. ","When I turn to the U.S., the U.S. sales team had a great year last year and had good strong consistent growth over the prior year and their pipeline is starting to see good throughput. So all in all I\u2019m very bullish on where the company is, how the sales team is executing and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve increased our guidance for growth going into 2015.","Glen Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay, and then for Woody maybe you could help us a little bit in terms of thinking about segment growth and margins directionally. You\u2019ve obviously talked about international continuing in that sort of double digit organic. Should we assume some continued sort of mix pressure on the margins in international and how should we be thinking about sort of the organic growth in financial and payments.","Woody Woodall","Yes, I think in financial and payments your still looking at a similar trend line where we\u2019ve got some of the consulting end services in the U.S. helping to drive our financial group at a little higher growth rate and then our PSG segment similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the past and then sort of a low to mid single digits around the breadth of products with some growing pretty rapidly and some of the more material products not growing and some even declining. So your still seeing that in the low to mid single digit area. I don\u2019t think we are looking at a significant trend on either one of those than we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Glen Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","And same on margins?","Woody Woodall","Probably so. I mean, I think we continue to focus on cost structure where if you looked at the individual components of the fourth quarter, you have FSG driven down by some of the consulting and services, as well as the investment in the global market. You had ISG with the same trends. ","PSG expanded a little bit of margins and then we got about 30 basis points of consolidated margin because we\u2019re continuing to manage that consolidated corporate cost structure getting leverage out of the balance of the businesses. So I think you\u2019ll continue to see that. I think you\u2019ll see it further in Q2, Q3, Q4 as we continue to grow it out of the balance of the business and manage our overall cost structure.","Gary Norcross","Yes Glen, our overall services businesses just across the entire company continues to grow very well and that\u2019s the testament to the size of our company and the ability to deliver these kind of robust services. So you got that in general, growing double digits, but you also keep in mind you\u2019ve got the Clear2Pay acquisition, which is a very nice product pull through that\u2019s going to be splitting between ISG and PSG. ","And as Woody pointed out, there\u2019s a number of deep product elements that I even mentioned in my prepared remarks around mobile and some of those things. So it\u2019s going to be a nice dynamic, but we feel comfortable that the margin expansion that we described will come through in 2015.","Glen Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","Just one real quick. The [6N EPS] [ph] from FX, historically from what I recall you had sort of more of a natural hedge and so whenever you saw a revenue headwind you generally didn\u2019t have too much run into your EPS track. Any reason why that\u2019s changed? Has the mix changed or I guess I was surprised at the order of magnitude of the EPS track.","Gary Norcross","Well, I think the point really is around the magnitude of the rate changes and if you looked at the full year our currency impact this year was about $35 million, $37 million on the top line. To follow-up on Dave\u2019s point we\u2019re looking at two points plus on the top line this year, which is a much more significant change in the FX, so therefore we called it out. Again it\u2019s a translation risk. It\u2019s a translation of the P&L. Unless we\u2019re trying to get those euros or Brazilian reals or pounds and trying to repatriate them, it becomes a paper issue more than the economic issue. ","Glen Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay great. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan, please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just on the Europe deals slipping, is that a macro issue or is it perhaps regulation driven with PSG2 going on or what not.","Gary Norcross","No, I don\u2019t think so. I just think as the economy bounces around and the recovery bounces around over there Tien-Tsin, it\u2019s going to deal slide. I mean its nothing that we\u2019re concerned about at all. We\u2019ve had this going on now for well over the last couple of years and so we saw that movement coming out of the recovery in the U.S. where deals were hard to predict when they were enclosed in one quarter and they would slide to another quarter. ","So I don\u2019t think its anything more than just the course of business. The good news is the team keeps building the pipeline and it just incents our sales team to make sure the pipeline is as robust as possible and as I said Woody mentioned a minute ago, we saw a good recovery in Europe last year, it had good performance from a growth standpoint. So it\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re concerned about.","Woody Woodall","Yes Tien-Tsin, as for the color, I think part of it maybe around Gary and my expectation around the team. We still grew in the 12% zone and we just anticipated more. ","Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Yes, so that\u2019s obviously a good rate. So I just as a follow up to that and we\u2019ve been hearing that there could be some higher M&A activity in Europe as well given the regulation, getting close to being finalized. Do you think that\u2019s going to be the case and do you expect to be active?","Gary Norcross","I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ll state it this way. We\u2019re seeing an increased level of M&A activity definitely. As we talked about in the past, for us we want to make sure that we\u2019re doing the responsible M&A that returns value to our shareholders and also drives product and service to our clients. ","So as I said in my prepared remarks, if we can find an opportunity that drives earnings per share always compared to share buybacks as kind of the bar, then we\u2019ll certainly evaluate it. We\u2019ve done a number of acquisitions last year. You\u2019ve seen over the last three years the level of acquisition activity from the dollar amount has increased consistently. I think last year we did about $600 million in acquisitions. ","So it\u2019s important for us to keep ahead of the innovation curve. It\u2019s important for our clients. We continue to see your demanding a larger portfolio suite from providers like us in order for them to be competitive to deal with the regulatory burden and the security burden and frankly just all the innovations going on. So we\u2019ll always evaluate if there\u2019s an opportunity that makes sense.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan","All right Gary, thank you. Then just a quick one for Woody, did you give the bookings growth number or a target that you set for -- or how you came in on 2014 and what\u2019s expected in \u201915 related to the booking for new sales.","Woody Woodall","We typically don\u2019t give bookings numbers Tien-Tsin, not now.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Cool. Thank you so much, so I didn\u2019t miss it. Thank you.","Woody Woodall","Sure thanks.","Gary Norcross","Thanks.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 Jefferies","Hi guys. I wanted to ask you about, you mentioned that you had strong I think network transaction growth. Could you kind of flush out that comment a little bit, what\u2019s the driver there, what are they referring to?","Gary Norcross","Yes, this is really our nice network and we just had strong transaction driven volumes in the fourth quarter. ","Woody Woodall","Yes, which is all good, the increase in volumes across going forward. We typically see the spike. Its always a big shopping season and so everybody knows and so we were a good recipient of those transactions throughout the quarter. ","Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 Jefferies","Anything related to lower fuel price, anything you can read into? A boost in debit spend due to lower fuel or is that tough to call?","Gary Norcross","Yes, I would say that would be tough to call. I\u2019m sure someone on our team could give you that kind of detail, but for us we saw just a nice increase across our networks and it translated to nice revenue and profit growth for us. Was it fuel cost reductions that accelerated that, it would be too hard to call for us at point. ","Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. I wanted to ask you for an updated on your broader check business. Has the rate of decline in that business kind of continued to stabilize firs? I guess second, would you entertain any kind of \u2013 are you closer to entertaining any kind of strategic options for that business in terms of potentially divesting it or you know that type of thing. ","Gary Norcross","Well, first the decline of the unit rate of checks continues to be steady, right. We continue to see it in various pockets. The teams done a very nice job as we\u2019ve highlighted over the years, especially in our back office check processing, the team\u2019s done a nice job of selling to financial intuitions to outsource that. ","So actually the sales team last year was able to fill in that hole and we actually saw our check business on the back office side, it actually had a minor growth, I mean below single digits. ","On the point of sale offering which is another area that we engage in checks. We are seeing a fairly consistent decline there. The team\u2019s doing a good job of maintaining margins on that business. As far as a strategic look at it, we\u2019ve looked at it several times as you guys might know and frankly at this point in time. We just have never been able to find an offering that would make sense for our shareholders. ","Ramsey El-Assal \u2013 Jefferies","Got it. All right thanks a lot guys. ","Operator","Our last question of the day comes from the Line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc,","Thanks. Hey guys good morning. ","Gary Norcross","Good morning. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc,","So my question is trying to get from the 5% to 7% revenue growth to the 9% to 13% EPS growth. If I assume maybe lets call it 1.5% to 2% of buyback. Is there is the delta there \u2013 could you sort of provide some detail with regards to are you going to continue to pay down debt? What\u2019s the operating leverage coming through and where I\u2019m getting to is really you guys have had a couple of good years of really good solid bookings, consulting growth, international growth. Some of these things are at lower margin obviously. But the backend of that lower margin is higher revenue processing type work. So when do we get that is sort of the question. ","Gary Norcross","Yes, you take the top line growth in there, lets use six as the mid point Ashwin. We will get some level of margin expansion in that 10 to 30 basis points, so that give us you a little bit more there. We\u2019ve done a good bit of refinancing activity over the course of the year. We get a little bit of benefit for the first half of this year as you get the annualization of the activities we did in 2014. And then from a default standpoint you are looking at our share buyback to give you those last couple of points if you will to get that 9 to 13 range. So that kind of bridges you between the revenue growth to the 9 to 13. ","Woody Woodall","And keep in mind Ashwin. I know you\u2019ve seen us do this every year. Last year it was over shadowed a little bit with our Global Client Partner Investment. But every year as we work through our plan, we also take cost actions and shift our cost structure around associated where our growth is going to be. So fundamentally that\u2019s just part of our DNA as a company and last year that was over shadowed because we also ramped up a big investment, but you will get some lift out of that as well. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc,","And that part was going to be my next question, the global investment that you had. I think last year was what 50 basis points, 30 basis points, something like that. Does it step down now this year or do you continue at the same level, but that isn\u2019t the year-over-year impact. How should we think of that? ","Gary Norcross","What we talked about was a $30 million investment we did make right at that investment level in 2014. We would anticipate, continue to keep that investment again at this people and go to market resources in those large banks. We would continue to keep that investment at the same level in 2015. Again, long lead times on these deals, so we want to make sure we are getting return, but it takes a while to get that return on the investment as we anticipate, absolutely.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc,","And then my last question is, it was good to get the 1Q color, but thinking beyond that, you do have the divesture to GPN and so on and so forth. How should we think of the timing of how revenue growth slows versus margin growths through the year? ","Woody Woodall","Yes, I think you are going to see margin growth through the year as we continue to drive that cost management through there. I think the global deal we anticipate to close early Q2 somewhere in late April timeframe. As we talked about it, it compared to Clear2Pay, the combination of the two we thought would be neutral to EPS in 2015, still thinking that\u2019s the same, so you will see some revenue from global drop-off in the second quarter and continue to see the ramp up of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made in 2014 flowing into 2015 over the course of the year. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc,","And that\u2019s all in your guidance, right. ","Woody Woodall","Correct. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc,","Okay, great. Thank you guys. Congratulations. ","Gary Norcross","Thanks Ashwin. ","Gary Norcross","Thank you for your questions today and for your continued interest in FIS. We are executing consistently on our commitments.

[Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded.","And at this time, I'll turn the call over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Nate Rozof, Please go ahead, sir. ","Nate Rozof","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the FIS second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. This conference call is being webcasted. Today's webcast, news release and corresponding presentation are all available at our website at fisglobal.com.","Turning to slide 2. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.","Please refer to the Safe Harbor language.

Woody Woodall, our CFO, will review FIS's and Worldpay's second quarter financial results and provide guidance for the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary, who will begin his comments on slide 3. Gary? ","Gary Norcross","Thank you, Nate. Good morning and welcome to today's call. I'm very pleased to announce that FIS and Worldpay have officially combined. We now begin the next exciting chapter in our pivot to growth strategy. I'm especially excited to welcome the Worldpay team as well as their clients and investors into the FIS family.","Charles, Mark, Stephanie and key leaders from Worldpay are staying with the company and joining our team to continue driving growth in the merchant business and other areas of FIS. I couldn't be more optimistic about the future of this company and what we will accomplish together.","Clients and partners from both companies have shared how excited they are about the opportunities that the new FIS will bring to the table with their expanded capabilities. As a leading provider of technology for merchants, financial institutions and capital markets across the globe, this gives us the unique ability to create seamless end-to-end experiences. Together, we will advance the way the world pay, banks and invests positioning us to power the digital economy. This combination redefines our road map to accelerating organic growth.","Both FIS and Worldpay had a strong second quarter, providing us confidence that our markets remain robust and that our teams remain focused on execution. FIS has successfully generated six consecutive quarters of exceptionally strong sales. In the second quarter, sales were up more than 30% increasing our backlog by 7% organically giving us clear line of sight to continue to accelerating revenue growth.","Wins in the quarter continued to amplify client demand for our solutions to improve the digital experience for their customers and drive operational efficiencies. For example, in our IFS segment, a large regional bank with more than $35 billion in assets expanded its relationship with us through a significant new multiyear agreement for our Digital One item processing and capture solutions to gain new efficiencies, reduce costs and improve the digital experience for its customers. This move toward outsourced solutions also propelled a large U.S.-based insurance company to select our hosted enterprise platform to streamline key back office processes and improve the customer support experience.","Additionally, in our GFS segment, a regional arm of the top five UK institution signed a long-term agreement for an FIS core banking solution in support of the bank's goals to better serve its German-speaking markets post-Brexit. Also, a large asset management firm with more than $60 billion in assets under management chose to partner with FIS to gain cost and servicing efficiencies within this transfer agency operations.","Similarly, Worldpay has maintained a strong growth trajectory as the business is ideally positioned in secular high-growth payments markets, including global e-commerce and integrated payments.","Within global e-commerce, Worldpay continued its exciting sales momentum by adding 14 new cross-sell wins during the quarter, bringing the total to 56. These wins show that Worldpay's global reach and tailored solutions are clearly resonating with merchants.","On day one of the FIS Worldpay combination, FIS organic growth rate increases from 4% to 6% on a pro forma annualized basis. The combination also creates significant revenue synergy opportunities of $500 million. We expect to begin realizing revenue synergies in the coming months accelerating organic revenue growth trends towards 7% next year and then into the 7% to 9% range in the future.","In addition, we will continue to invest in new value-creating opportunities to reinforce and enhance our growth by harnessing the power of our combined cash flow. Later in the call, I'll provide further perspective on our transformation into a unique global leader within commerce and financial services and the differentiated value proposition that we'll bring to our clients.","But first, Woody will take us through our second quarter financial results. Woody?","Woody Woodall","Thanks, Gary. I'd also like to express my enthusiasm for closing the transaction and my sincere thanks to our teams for making this a success. We have been hard at work since the transaction announcement to provide the investment community with a complete package of information today in order to paint a clear picture of how we see FIS going forward.","This includes presenting both companies outstanding second quarter results as well as quarterly historical pro forma combined financials combined company guidance for the rest of the year plus initial thoughts for 2020. It's been a heavy lift, but our teams have done a great job.","Turning to FIS' consolidated results on slide 4. In the second quarter, revenue increased 5% on an organic basis. Our EBITDA margins expanded 170 basis points to 37.6% and adjusted EPS grew 9% to $1.78 per share. Our top line growth continues the acceleration we saw in the first quarter and reflects the strong sales momentum that Gary mentioned.","Our healthy margin expansion was enhanced by our data center consolidation program and the ongoing benefits of prior-year divestitures. We are very pleased with the first half of the year, and we are excited for the future of FIS.","Moving to slide 5. Our IFS segment continues to accelerate and increased 6% on an organic basis as EBITDA margins expanded by 150 basis points. IFS' strong top line performance was broad-based and our banking and wealth famous and corporate and digital businesses each grew 6% during the quarter.","GFS also had a very strong quarter with organic revenue growth accelerating to 4% and EBITDA margins expanding by 120 basis points.","Within the GFS division, our institutional and wholesale business returned to growth, increasing by 3% on an organic basis. We anticipate this business will continue to experience improving trends, in the second half of the year.","It was another impressive quarter for Worldpay, as you can see on slide 6. Revenue increased 9%, when excluding crypto and foreign currency headwinds. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 330 basis points. And adjusted EPS increased by 19% to $1.24 per share.","Fueling Worldpay's strong top line its technology solutions statement secular upper teen's growth, increasing by 19%, when excluding crypto and foreign currency headwinds. The Merchant Solutions and issuer solutions segments, each grew 2% on a constant currency basis, in line with the expectations.","Worldpay achieved $50 million in cost synergies during the quarter, and completed its U.S. platform migration, keeping it on track to successfully complete, its $250 million annualized cost synergy program, by the end of the year. These results reflect continued strong business momentum, providing a solid base to begin the second half of the year.","I'll now turn the call back over to Gary, to discuss our go-forward operating model, beginning on slide 7.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, Woody. As we bring our two great companies together, we will structure our organization into three operating segments. This new structure reflects our distinct, but complementary global businesses and the integration of Worldpay's talent and technologies.","Going forward our segments will be merchant Solutions, banking solution and Capital Market Solutions. Starting with Merchant Solutions, FIS will go to market using the Worldpay brand.","The segment will be led by Mark Heimbouch, Worldpay's former President and Chief Operating Officer, who will continue to build its leading market position in global e-commerce and integrated payments.","Our Banking Solutions segment will be led by Bruce Lowthers, who previously led IFS. In his expanded role, Bruce will continue to drive accelerating growth across our global client base.","Our third segment will provide best-in-class solutions across all facets of the capital markets industry. Mark and Bruce will lead this segment serving by side and sell side firms as well as corporations and insurance companies.","The common denominator across all three of these segments is digital enablement across global markets. All three serve the largest multinational clients, with leading solutions at global scale.","They also bring innovative capabilities to help our small and midsized clients to be agile, resilient and to reach their full potential. Finally all three are uniquely positioned in secular high-growth markets. Turning to slide 8, we will go to market in all three of our segments with a powerful client value proposition.","For over 50 years, FIS has driven growth for clients around the world by creating tomorrow's technology, solutions and services to modernize today's business and customer experiences. We do more than develop technology.","We provide access to innovation, by continuously investing to create innovative, secure enterprise grade solutions that position our clients and their customers for success today and in the future.","With our data and insights, we create new intersections between markets and technology that solve for our client's future, while delivering experiences that are more simple, seamless and secure to advance the way the world pays, banks and invests.","Using our world classic scale, we enable our clients' global reach at the global level. With their connection across the global financial ecosystem, we provide clients access to new enterprise grade solutions that enable them to run their businesses more efficiently, grow more effectively, and enter into new markets with greater speed and lower cost of entry.","Delivering innovation and insight at this global scale, puts us at the heart of commerce in the financial world. This is why I'm so confident in our ability to build on the strong foundations already laid at FIS and Worldpay to accelerate our revenue growth even further together.","I'll now turn the call back to Woody to round out our financial discussion before he opens the call -- questions. Woody? ","Woody Woodall","Thanks, Gary. Moving to slide 9. We have a compelling financial profile which is further strengthened by the Worldpay acquisition, a high-quality revenue supported by long-term contracts for mission-critical solutions. This creates recurring revenue that\u2019s predictable and resilient. The Worldpay transaction enhances these attributes by providing meaningful exposure to secular, high-growth markets like e-commerce and integrated payments.","Our world-class scale creates operating leverage and drives substantial margin expansion. We deliver solutions using a one to many SaaS model and aggressively focus on operational excellence. One of the attractive components of this transaction is that the Worldpay team has the same focus and together we will use this operating mindset to drive significant cost synergies.","Finally, FIS is known as a strong cash flow generator, which will be significantly enhanced going forward. As we achieve our integration targets, free cash flow will almost double over the next three years dramatically expanding our capacity to invest for future growth. These attractive qualities combined with our constant focus on creating shareholder value will create substantial earnings growth.","Turning to slide 10. Consistent with past practices, we have taken advantage of the past four months to do detailed integration planning. Through this planning, we have identified opportunities to accelerate our time line to achieving synergies. We now have line of sight to exit 2020 at $150 million of annual run rate revenue synergies $50 million more than our original expectations making us even more confident in our ability to generate a total of $500 million in annual run rate synergies by the end of 2022.","As we achieve these synergies, we expect our organic growth rate to accelerate from approximately 6% on a pro forma annualized basis in 2019 towards 7% in 2020 and higher in the future as Gary mentioned.","We will initially generate revenue synergies by driving additional volumes across our payment networks, optimizing our loyalty and fraud solutions and enhancing Worldpay's issuer business. All of these opportunities are supported by solutions that are in market today with a demonstrated value proposition for our clients. As we move further out, longer term opportunities include increasing authorization rates for our e-commerce platform, leveraging our global presence to expand market share in emerging geographies and utilizing our global back channel for merchant referrals.","Turning to slide 11. Through integration planning we validated the time line that we expect to deliver cost synergies including increasing our total expected expense savings to more than $500 million on an annual run rate basis by the end of 2022. This includes more than $100 million in net interest expense savings annually due to our successful refinancing of Worldpay\u2019s debt.","We will quickly begin executing our operational synergies by achieving operational efficiencies, technology optimization and corporate alignment now that this transaction is closed and expect to exit 2020 at a $200 million annual run rate. This annual run rate will step up to $300 million and $400 million by the end of 2021 and 2022, respectively. Consistent with past transactions, we look forward to updating you on our progress for both revenue and cost synergies in the upcoming quarters.","Turning to slide 12. Our capital allocation strategy remains consistent. This quarter we generated over $400 million of free cash flow representing a 20% conversion to revenue and 18% growth year-over-year. Our current leverage is approximately 3.5 times and we are committed to rapidly delever to approximately 2.7 times in 12 months to 18 months. Even as we delever, the strength of our balance sheet, it gives us the flexibility to consider tuck-in acquisitions to further enhance growth. We will also continue to maintain and grow our current dividend program, which returned over $100 million to shareholders this quarter.","Finally, we'll continue to use our strong free cash flow to invest in industry-leading technology initiatives to drive sustained organic growth. With the strength of our balance sheet and the power of our free cash flow we can do each of these things while still hitting our leverage targets.","Turning to slide 13. We are presenting third and fourth quarter 2019 guidance for the combined company, which includes Worldpay's contribution to our results beginning on August 1. Our revenue guidance supports 6% organic growth through the full-year on an adjusted combined basis, and it supports our conviction in approaching 7% organic revenue growth in 2020.","Our EBITDA guidance reflects ongoing margin expansion at both companies, primarily driven by our data center consolidation program and Worldpay's $250 million cost synergy program. Going forward, we will continue to expense stock compensation, which Worldpay has previously added back.","This creates approximately $70 million in stock compensation within our guidance that would not have been incorporated into prior expectations for Worldpay. We expect to incur approximately $30 million in stock compensation expense for Worldpay employees during the third quarter and approximately $40 million during the fourth quarter, which is factored into this guidance.","I am pleased to report that following constructive dialogue with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we will resume our prior method of reporting adjusted EPS, which excludes amortization of purchased accounting intangibles only.","For the third quarter, we anticipate adjusted EPS of $1.33 to $1.37 per share and $1.47 to $1.53 per share in the fourth quarter. We've provided a reconciliation of our EPS guidance between both methods in our earnings release and the appendix of this presentation to ensure transparency.","Along with the additional assumptions provided on the slide, I would also like to message that we believe our full-year weighted shares outstanding will be approximately 453 million to 455 million.","While we provide formal 2020 guidance on our Q4 call, I wanted to give a quick recap on some of our 2020 commentary. Given the strong trends within our business and our confidence to exit 2020 at $150 million of annual run rate revenue synergies, we expect our organic revenue growth rate to accelerate from 6% towards 7% in 2020.","Further, we expect to exit 2020 at $200 million of annual run rate cost synergies in addition to generating over $100 million in net interest expense savings. Given our success to date with this integration, we now expect the Worldpay acquisition to be accretive in 2020.","With that, I'll turn the call over for Q&A. Operator, you may open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave Koning","Yeah. Hey, guys. Congrats on auto progress.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, Dave.","Woody Woodall","Thanks, Dave.","Dave Koning","Yeah. And I guess, first of all it's interesting to see the new segment results along merchant banking and capital markets. And I'm wondering you gave the 10%, 5% and 3% growth for the three segments. I know you're expecting acceleration over the next couple of years. Maybe you could talk a little bit about how each of those segments contributes to the acceleration, which ones maybe more than others and how you see those segments growing?","Gary Norcross","Yeah. I think you're right. We're looking at the merchant to be in kind of a high-single, low-double-digit growth rate over the next few years. We are looking at banking in the mid-single-digits and capital markets to be in the lower-single-digits. I think we'll see revenue synergies in both banking and in the merchant business, driving higher growth over the next few years. But we're very pleased with the acceleration we've seen in both businesses and the momentum, both businesses have going into 2020.","Dave Koning","Okay. Great, thanks. And then, I guess on -- originally I think, maybe 18 months ago or 12 months ago, you talked about -- I think it was 2021, being 7 to 750. And now since then, you said that, this deal will be accretive to the midpoint of that range, I think or accretive to at least that range.","But now also you had better results than expected across both companies. You had interest expense going down. I mean, are we kind of thinking higher end of that range now?","Woody Woodall","I think what we've really clarified today, was that instead of a diluted deal in 2020, we're looking at an accretive deal in 2020. Hadn't really updated as far as where we're at on 2021. But certainly pleased with progress to date, and certainly pleased to being able to accelerate the revenue synergies earlier.","Dave Koning","Okay, great. Lastly, just free cash flow nearly double exiting, 2022. What does that mean exactly? Double from what level, or just -- how do we think of that may be in dollars or...","Woody Woodall","Yeah. If we go back to the announcement day deck, I think, you looked at we describe 2022 or post synergy number of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, and are still looking at that number in the out year Dave.","Dave Koning","Okay, great. Well thanks guys. I appreciate it.","Woody Woodall","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Togut","Hi. Good morning and congratulations.","Woody Woodall","Thanks Dave.","Gary Norcross","Thank you.","David Togut","It looks like the second consecutive quarter of 5% organic growth for core FIS, and that's probably the first time in at least three years. So what would be your assumption for organic growth for FIS standalone for the back half of this year? Because it seems like you're trending above the 4% to 4.5% organic revenue guide for the full year.","Gary Norcross","Yeah. It's a good question. We're certainly seeing the investments that we've been making, paying off into sales, sales turning into revenue now. We've talked about that for the last few quarters.","If we were on a stand-alone basis, we would be raising our standalone guide to more like a 5% number right now for the consolidated FIS standalone Dave.","Woody Woodall","Yeah. Absolutely, Dave well maybe if you look we are now had six quarters of consecutive strong sales, obviously very strong sales, this past quarter. Pipeline looks really good. So, we're really pleased with all the investments we've made on modernization.","All of the work that we've done around, data center consolidation. We've talked about new availability limits that we're bringing to market, our mass enablement programs. All of those are really pushing the former FIS into mid-single digits. And we feel very confident that's going to continue across that base.","David Togut","Good to see. And then, on the synergy targets, the $50 million revenue raise by year-end 2020 on revenue synergy, and $100 million raise on costs synergy for year three exit rate, what specifically changed in the last few months, to give you the conviction to raise the targets so early on?","Gary Norcross","I think Dave when we start pulling the teams together. And we started working on. One we start to working on the various tracks, whether the business lines got together. And start working on the revenue opportunities. And what we saw is the potential new product deployments across the various client bases.","And even when we saw the across on the operating side as well, we just started building a lot of confidence in our ground up planning. When we come into announcement, we've done top-down due diligence, based on experience, and based on what we saw during due diligence, we come into a synergy number.","And that always gives us high confidence. I mean, we always have a -- we're always very good at exceeding those expectations. But then as you build ground up, you really start gaining confidence on how you're thinking about what products, where the market opportunities are, what the cross-sell is, what's the total addressable market to address against that and all of that\u2019s driven us a lot of confidence going into next year and delivering the revenue earlier than what we thought. We've also had great feedback from our clients both from the Worldpay and on the FIS side our clients have been reaching out to us. They're excited about what this combination can mean for them. So all of those things come into play with why we're confident in the revenue synergies going forward. ","David Togut","Understood. Congrats, again.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Jim Schneider","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just following up on David's previous question. Can you maybe just give us a bit of a sense about some of the earliest revenue synergies you expect to materialize and some examples of kind of what those could be whether that's more on the e-commerce side? Whether that's global distribution throughout your bank network of Worldpay's products etcetera? ","Gary Norcross","I think, the short-term what we're going to see Jim is -- as Woody discussed in his prepared remarks, it's really our existing capabilities or Worldpay's existing capabilities and our ability to deliver that across our new combined client base. So early on, obviously, we'll be focusing on debit routing initiatives. We talked a lot about that on the launch. We think there is some real opportunity to be gained there.","When you start thinking about the data and analytics that Worldpay can do around merchants and merchants portfolios to provide that access into that information to merchants, we were really nascent in that space over our merchant portfolio so a real opportunity going that way. You see other areas where -- as you think about cross-selling other capabilities on both sides that will also step-up. Longer term, we'll start seeing more pick-up of merchant referral programs. We're going to start seeing more pick-up of using our loyalty as a currency that we've talked about in the past to being able to deploy across that base. So we got really good line of sight into the revenue synergy opportunities.","The sales teams now post close are coming together and really building out all their go-to-market plans. Marketing has done a great job in letting them hit the ground running with launch materials on what we're going to be selling in those bases. So all of that's triggering a good strong insight into our revenues on. ","Jim Schneider","That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up can you maybe just give us Gary a little bit of an update on the strategic and macrolevel from your core kind of Banking and Solutions clients? What they're saying about the current interest rate environment if it's having any kind of impact on their spending or outsourcing decisions? And kind of how do you feel about the remainder of the year in that specific segment and heading into 2020? ","Gary Norcross","You know, Jim it's a good question. I mean everybody watches as interest rates go up and go down, what does this means for financial institutions. And clearly as you're looking at interest rates being lowered, especially, on a number of our customers that were directly hit their net interest margin and therefore hit their income. But what we're seeing honestly is what's going on in the industry I think a lot of financial institutions and we've talked about this on prior calls they really held on too long to their historical legacy technologies. And I think they're really in a mode now where they have to invest. And so what -- we've seen six consecutive quarters of very strong sales. We have a very full pipeline going in the back half of the year, across all of our businesses both banking and capital markets and Merchant Solutions.","So, all of those things make us bullish and confident on the future. I don't think that banks are going to be able to pull back their spend in the short-term, because at this point in time, they have to move to the next-generation platforms. They have to move to the cloud. They have to move the digital enablement in order to survive. And FIS is very well-positioned to capture those revenue opportunities as people are making next-generation decisions and really pushing in that direction.","Jim Schneider","Congratulations for the update, guidance and thank you.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Let me add my congratulations Gary and Woody on both closing the deal as well as this initial presentation deck here is very useful.","Gary Norcross","Thank you.","Woody Woodall","Thank you, Ashwin. We appreciate it.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Sure, sure. Yeah. Let me actually start with some disclosure type of question. FIS used to provide obviously both for IFS and GFS sort of the underlying multiple lines subsegment information. Worldpay used to also provide segments underneath. What should investors expect going forward as you think about that next level underlying information as well as if you can provide sort of the timing of when some of the historical information so we can do proper analysis? Any color on that would be great.","Woody Woodall","Yeah, Ashwin thanks. I think the team did a great job in pulling the pro forma combined historical information. If you look at the data in the earnings release today, you can see it all the way back by quarter back to Q1 2018, which I think can help you with there. We're going to continue to have new segments around merchant, banking and capital markets. That will be the external disclosure, if you will.","We'll continue to provide some color in the commentary around technology solutions, the Merchant Solutions and what's going on both globally and domestically within banking. But probably we won\u2019t externally disclose at that level of granular detail, but we'll continue to provide transparent information to the market on our results and what's driving those results.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. And then with regards to -- obviously there is a market expectation that's based on your track record that you will exceed sort of the synergy number. You started off well here with increased confidence on one side and also increasing synergies on the other. I wanted to kind of get a little bit deeper into that sort of what's changed between the last time, you were speaking publicly and now with regards to bringing up the synergy -- the near-term synergy expectation and why would that not explicitly bring up the longer term as well.","Gary Norcross","Well, why don't I start Ashwin, and I'll let Woody chime in. I mean honestly when you look at the operating synergies, the team just did an outstanding job refinancing Worldpay's debt, I mean really generating over $100 million of savings there. So that's where obviously we needed to increase our $400 million target on that number going forward.","Obviously we got very high confidence in the operating synergies. As you know, we've historically exceeded those -- exceeded our synergy expectations by more than 30%.","As you look at our revenue side, we're increasing the rate at which our revenue is on-boarding. We've now extended beyond $500 million. I think, we've just to my points earlier, really are getting clearer line of sight of, how those revenues are going to come on board.","So, Woody talked about it, but I can't trivialize how hard the teams had worked between signing and close. If you look at all of the prepared information you do a combined call like this, is not nothing short of amazing.","But also, all of the business owners have really been doing deep dives, week in and week out, building those plans around, where we're going to tackle the expense side, and the revenue side. So that's all. Well that's really what's been the big change, since our last public conversation about those topics.","So high confidence on the $500 million, we see that revenue coming in earlier than what we originally expected, which is great. That will actually smooth that curve out some, over the next three years.","When you look at the operating expense, frankly we want to make sure that everybody saw the interest savings that we did here. And stay committed to the original guide on our OpEx. So that's when we raised that overall expense savings number.","But we're very pleased, at where we are at this point in time. The cultures of the companies have come together very well. I commented the landing of the leadership team from Worldpay, in key positions and FIS was very important to me personally. So, all of that just gives us a lot of confidence, as we go in to the back half of the year, and into 2020.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And one quick thing, if I could squeeze it in, is the -- just to be clear the, $100 million incremental, on the interest side, is that all going to the bottom-line or are you going or reinvest a piece of it to get better growth, or I mean how should we think of that?","Woody Woodall","That interest savings will go dollar for dollar to the bottom-line. It will start August 1.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Thank you, guys. This is great.","Woody Woodall","Thanks, Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dan Perlin","Thanks guys and congratulations again on everything you guys have accomplished thus far.","Woody Woodall","Thanks Dan. Appreciate it.","Dan Perlin","You bet. I just wanted to get a sense kind of the macro backdrop has been evolving pretty quickly here. And there is a fair amount of exposure in terms of cross-border e-commerce opportunities that you guys have.","But it also can be somewhat of a risk in these kinds of environment. And so I was just curious, what you're hearing from your clients. What if anything are you seeing kind of in near-term? Obviously your guidance suggests that things are going be okay, but I'd love to get any kind of incremental color on that. Thanks.","Gary Norcross","Yeah. You know, Dan, it\u2019s early. I've been -- as you would expect, I've already met with several of the largest Worldpay clients since close. So we've been really busy and engaged with that, in those areas. Frankly, not seeing any concerns at this point in time. Frankly, when we look at the trends, they are very consistent across the board. We've modeled, continued slowing in the U.K. due to Brexit. Obviously, we're not expecting any turnaround there. But our e-commerce volumes seem like they're performing well. Our same-store sales are growing well. And so, all of those things would indicate, we're pretty pleased with what we're seeing. And that we feel very confident in the forecast. ","Dan Perlin","Great. Can you \u2013 Woody, maybe can you just help us a little bit on the third and fourth quarters kind of organic growth assumptions? I think you said you thought for the year you'd land at 6%, if I heard you correctly. I'm just trying to think about how that trends since we got a little bit of kind of a stub in terms of the third quarter and then rolling into the fourth quarter? Thank you. ","Woody Woodall","That's right. I'll start with the fourth quarter first. It's about a 6% organic grower in the fourth quarter as you get all three months of Worldpay and get a more consistent point of view on the numbers flowing through. Third quarter is a little lower than that. Really you're getting two months instead of three months of Worldpay's higher growth as a contribution there. We've got a difficult comp from last year. That was our high watermark last year in terms of growth with the third quarter. And we got a little bit of accounting conformity in both the third and the fourth quarter, but impact in Q3 a little heavier. So that's what you're looking at there. Yes, you pull all that that, you're looking at more like a 5% grower in Q3 really driven by some of those points I just mentioned. ","Dan Perlin","Okay. And then if I could sneak one more in Worldpay's EBITDA margins were kind of off the charts strong. I just want to make sure, is that just the synergy attainment in terms of the closing the U.S. platform or was there something one-time in nature? Thank you. ","Woody Woodall","No. Not one-time. Very strong synergy attainment. They looked to $50 million in quarter still on track for the $250 million for the full year and drove it just like we thought we would. ","Gary Norcross","Yes, Dan. Also they are completely done with the U.S. consolidation movement which is really positive. So just as we thought and we talked about in the announcement day, we felt very confident that normally, the NAP program over in the UK was going very well. We also felt very confident in the U.S. and that U.S. platform has been consolidated now so that's behind us. ","Dan Perlin","Excellent. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. ","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thanks, and thanks guys. Good morning.","Gary Norcross","Good morning. ","Lisa Ellis","Gary, could you comment on -- from your perspective what aspect of the merger is going to be the most challenging and sort of where are you spending your personal time focused? ","Gary Norcross","Well, right now, I'm not seeing -- I mean, it's a great question, Lisa. Right now, I'm not seeing any red flags. But with that being said where I always spend most of my time in these very early days post close is with employees and clients. You know, I've already been out on day of close I met with two of the largest clients in Worldpay's portfolio. Right after this call, I'm on my way to London. We've already been in front of -- on a global town hall our employees because you want to make sure that everybody stays focused on our commitments and that's something that hit very strong, focus on our clients make sure that we meet the expectations in the market.","And then frankly focus on sales. We just don't want anybody to get distracted. So early on I\u2019m focused there. I also spent a lot of time making sure that the cultures blend together. I'll talk about that in a minute -- earlier on the earlier call. You know these cultures are very aligned which is great. But we will find subtle differences and it's important to get those identified and get those perceived barriers or cultural barriers eliminated so everybody can come together as a team.","Landing the leadership team as I talked about was very important. So I feel great that we were able to do that between signing and close. So we've brought a lot of talent into FIS because of that. But right now in the early days that's where I'm focused. Obviously that will shift very quickly to -- we are pivoting the growth here and so we're going to have to shift very quickly in the next few weeks and really start focusing on go-to-market prospects and I'll make sure that I'm getting engaged there as well. But Marc's doing of excellent job. He's been with Worldpay for years. He really understands the business, and obviously he's hitting the ground running, so -- but that's really where I'm focused on right now.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. And then my follow-up, the global expansion revenue synergy is one of the critical ones over the longer term and in the out years. Could you just describe what sort of actions you are taking over the next 18 months to make sure you're on track to begin generating that synergy revenue out in 2021? Like sort of how will we know it's progressing and is on track? Thank you.","Gary Norcross","Well, you're going to see it through the revenue growth line. Obviously you're going to see our organic growth rate accelerate as we talked about to approximately 7% next year. You're going to see it move beyond that to 8% and 9% in the years out.","What we're doing and we've already been doing it, we've got our teams together. Our banking teams and our capital markets teams, sales teams and go-to-market teams together with our Worldpay teams, we've got -- in certain markets where we have huge presence whether it's India, whether it's Brazil or whether it's Australia we're getting those teams together.","One of the things that's different about us is we're really a global company, but we have a local presence, which is very important, and us being able to leverage that local presence to make those introductions and accelerate change business for e-com penetration in those markets is going to be very important. So, we are well down the path of those conversations today.","Obviously, we're also doing steps to augment the product. We want to increase those authorization rates. We want to decrease those fraud rates. Really, we're already separate and apart with regards to e-commerce when you think about where the authorization rates are today. But how do we raise that 200 basis points, 300 basis points and really further distance us.","So, those two things will really help us accelerate into those new markets and we're pretty excited about it. I think we'll have some really good traction. While we said that's going to be later in the process, I think we'll have some -- we have potentially some good early wins here in the next 12 to 18 months.","Lisa Ellis","Okay. And then maybe one last one, that's not related to the merger. I know you've highlighted for core FIS that faster payments and faster ACH is an important growth area for you. Can you just quickly comment on how announcements like the Fed announcement or Fed now and then this morning's announcement from MasterCard of buying next account-to-account business, how those types of changes in the market impact you?","Gary Norcross","Yeah. Well, I think it's a great question. I saw the Nets announcement today. It looks like a good acquisition by MasterCard. A lot of people are focused on where faster payments is going, how money movement's going to occur. We talk about it a lot. It's been a huge area of focus for us. We actually got into real-time payments now a little over four years ago with our clear to pay acquisition. That's gone very well. We're now in more than 20 countries running their real-time payment platforms today form on an FIS software.","When you look at what the Fed announced, it didn't surprise me. It's logical that the Fed would also look to accelerate what they're doing in real-time payments. What I would tell you is all those things create opportunities for FIS. So, as money moves across the various channels, what's important to us is to make sure that we have the full breadth of capability to capture those payments as they move across various verticals.","So, as real-time payments accelerate, we're very well-positioned to capture that volume. As e-commerce accelerates, we're very well-positioned to capture those volumes. So, we talked a lot about the breadth on a global basis, across merchant, across banking, across capital markets.","The other thing we have to realize is there is, a breadth across our asset portfolio that really allows us to not be disintermediated as these new technologies roll on.","So, all of these announcements or just will long-term be positive. Thanks for FIS, as more and more money moves to various channels, so we can absolutely capture that and drive our revenue stream.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thank you and congrats again and I am look forward to updating you guys. Thanks.","Gary Norcross","Thank you.","Woody Woodall","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Great. Good morning, guys. How are you?","Gary Norcross","Doing great Jason.","Jason Kupferberg","Terrific. So, I just wanted to see if we can go a little deeper on the commentary around the deal now, becoming accretive in 2020. Can you just clarify? Do you mean that on a full year basis it will be accretive, or that exiting 2020 it will be accretive?","Gary Norcross","So we think it's accretive on a full year basis, in 2020. And really to kind of get your base, we use some assumptions and projections that are disclosing our joint merger proxy, that show what our expectations were on a stand-alone FIS basis. That's a $6.16 number for 2020, so that's kind of the market we are talking about.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. That's very helpful. And, I was just curious on the OpEx side of things. I know at this juncture, obviously the deal just closed. So you're still sticking with that $400 million target, excluding the interest expense savings.","But hypothetically, if you do ultimately deliver upside potential on that $400 million, would you expect that to be more on the operational side, technology, the corporate alignment piece?","Gary Norcross","You know it's too early, Jason to really talk about that at this point in time. I think Woody gave some insight, into how we see the $400 million spreading. As we dig into these situations, we're very confident on the $400 million.","We think -- at FIS we're looking across the full enterprise to make sure that we're taking advantage. And getting the maximum leverage we have out of these combinations without damaging the business.","Obviously, we want the -- we've said, this a number of times, this is about pivoting to growth, accelerating our growth, in the upper-single digits and hopefully higher in the long-term.","So, but we feel very good that a lot of those synergies will come out on the technology and business side. But also the corporate side of FIS. But as we build into more of that, it's early.","One of the things that we've always taken great pride in is being very transparent, on where we are on synergies, throughout the process. So, as we get, several quarters into this, we'll start giving more insight into where the majority of the synergies, we see are coming from or where we might see upside in any of those three areas.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. That's helpful. And just last one for me. I know on the Worldpay side tech solutions, was really quite strong again at 19% on an adjusted basis. I was just curious, what kind of trajectory you're assuming for the second half of the year on that metric.","Gary Norcross","Yeah. We've been thinking about technology solutions in line with mid to high-teens growth rate, that's been outlined for a number of quarters.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay.","Woody Woodall","It's executing very well. And our expectations, is really to continue to execute in line with what's been described in the market.","Gary Norcross","And if you look, and look that, Shane and his team had another great quarter of cross-sells. We talked about in the prepared remarks. I mean that really gives us strong confidence that he's going to continue, he and his team are going to continue to execute. And based on what we're seeing in volumes and everything there is just -- there's no indication that it should come off that guide. ","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. I appreciate the comments. Nice job.","Woody Woodall","Thank you. ","Gary Norcross","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead. ","Brett Huff","Hey, Gary and Woody congrats again on getting this deal done. ","A \u2013 Woody Woodall","Hey, Brett. Thank you. ","Brett Huff","Two questions. One unrelated to the merger. I've been focused on the modularization, the rewriting of your guide this quarter that you've been doing where you kind of rewrite a back office thing and then kind of spread it out. Where are we in that process? Are we still early innings or -- and then also kind of related to that what's the uptake on those -- on that particular program right now? ","Gary Norcross","I appreciate the question, Brett. As you know when we announced that that was a very long-term project -- program build. It is going very well. I would say we're in mid innings to late innings. So we continue to -- the response has been terrific in market. We've actually made some announcements of key wins with some really early- stage innovators. We have now one in production on that platform. The product continues to be being built out on a modular basis. Obviously, we're doing it in a very agile nimble way launching from the ground up in the cloud. We're going to have some really nice announcements on that platform in the coming quarters. And we feel very good about that program. ","Brett Huff","Great. And then second one related to the deal. One of the great, sort of, things you guys have done over the years with the deals you've done as you\u2019ve taken on the data center consolidation kind of behemoth several times. ","Gary Norcross","Yeah.","Brett Huff","And I know that this one started, I think, three years ago. How -- tell us how this gives you insight into getting the cost synergies with Worldpay? I'm assuming it's getting rolled in. And then what potential pitfalls do we have kind of joining the Worldpay data center project which I assume is going to start soon with the one that's ongoing? Is there any kind of -- how do we manage that risk? Thanks.","Gary Norcross","Well -- it's a great question, Brett. I'd tell you -- Ido Gileadi, our Global CIO and his team have just done a phenomenal job with data center consolidation. We have over 80% of our digital applications now in the private cloud. We've launched -- we've announced publicly to our clients availability of less -- guaranteed of less than 15 minutes now which the industry is at 24 in some instances 48 hours. So it's really, really going well. And so naturally as we put these two technology groups together that comes under common ownership within FIS, and naturally those data centers will become part of the overall consolidation plan in the future.","So we feel very confident. We've got a great team geared up. We're well -- we're three years into this program. You're seeing the benefits drop to our bottom-line. And we'll just keep the team now churning as we bring these groups together. So we have very high confidence on execution. We have very high confidence in taking advantage of the next-generation technologies and it will be a key contributor to our synergy saves. ","Brett Huff","Thanks, guys.","Gary Norcross","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead. ","George Mihalos","Hey, good morning, guys. And let me add my congrats on getting the deal done.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, George. ","George Mihalos","I wanted to go back to the tech solution segment within Worldpay, which again as -- Jason said was very, very strong. Can you talk a little bit about the trends? It sounds like there's a lot of momentum continuing on the e-com side. But maybe what you're also seeing on the integrated payment side? And then, as it relates to e-com, some of the changes that are happening, FCA in Europe coming on at some point at least over the next couple of months. Is that really more of an opportunity for FIS, or are you concerned there could be some disruption there?","Gary Norcross","Well, let me first start with the integrated side. Honestly, it still continues to be strong. We continued to win new business. We actually think there is increased opportunity with the combination just given our size and sales scale and reach. So we're very excited about integrated and how that business performs. We've talked a number of times on the call. Shane's really very strong on the overall e-commerce site.","So we don't see any issues. Frankly, as you talked about changes, typically changes are -- is the benefactor, so I mean it's the same way Worldpay as we talked. What's interesting about the business is, when we see any kind of regulatory change or any kind of change whatsoever, we typically see that converting to a tailwind for FIS. And so, we are confident that our growth rates are going to continue to be strong.","Woody Woodall","We saw a really good growth in both components there, with e-commerce probably a little higher than the 19% that we saw, and IP a little lower blending to the 19%. But that was in line with expectations and where things are going. If you look at some of the regulatory changes that are coming on board, we think some of our low fraud rates can actually drive the exemptions and drive some wallet share opportunity in some of those areas to reduce friction with that deal authentication that's coming down the line.","George Mihalos","That's great color. Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up shifting gears a little bit to capital markets so that returned to growth as you expected. I think Woody you laid out kind of long-term low single-digit growth. Should we expect that over the back half of 2019, that growth to accelerate a little bit from 3% given the somewhat easier comparisons over the second half? Thank you.","Woody Woodall","That's exactly right. We're seeing some accelerated growth. Some of that is just good execution by Martin and the team, but we also are facing a little easier comps in the back half of 2019 within capital markets. You're exactly right.","Gary Norcross","Sales continues to be strong in that area, George. I mean when you look at the historical backlogs and you look at what backlogs are today and you look at the execution, we\u2019ll continue to go through a little bit of volatility noise just on that movement from license on premise to outsourcing, and we'll continue to see that. But honestly, from an execution standpoint, our ability to take share, the teams are delivering very nicely against those sales. So, we feel good about that business going forward.","George Mihalos","Congrats again.","Woody Woodall","Thank you.","Gary Norcross","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller","Hey, thanks, guys.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, Darrin.","Woody Woodall","Hey, there.","Darrin Peller","Hey. Listen, when we look at the FIS trends standalone and we look at where they're trending now 5% this quarter, even last year 4% adjusting for one-time items. And we compare that to the prior year -- I know you guys said you would expect it to be 5% this year. But just what exactly is different? Can you specifically point to what products are growing more quickly? What is it the end market that's better? I'd be curious to hear what changed so substantially that and why that's sustainable. It's great to see. Just curious more color on that -- go ahead.","Gary Norcross","Well, I think two things Darrin. What's really changed is, honestly, if you look we are well-positioned in the larger financial institutions around the world, right? So whether you look at the mid-tier or large financial institutions, FIS is well positioned. If you look at that client base specifically, they really have held onto their technology investment way too long.","Look at SunTrust and BB&T coming together, all about scale to drive innovation. So, you're just seeing in that secular market, an increase spend rate around technologies. And they're focusing on a number of different things.","They're focusing on, digital enablement, of their capabilities, where they're really trying to go to next-generation, omnichannel capabilities. Obviously, we're a leader in that space, with our Digital One application.","If you look at some of the things that Brett talked about -- asked about or Stevens, whether you're even looking at globalizations. And how to move my legacy technology from some of these applications, that have been in place for 30 or 40 years. How that really move on to a next-generation cloud-based platform.","All of these things are just driving an increased spend rate. And when you look at six quarters in of really strong sales, it just gives us high confidence that's going to continue. We got a number of significant opportunities and fly high clients, very full teams who really engaged.","And so I think, timing is just really working in favor of FIS, giving where we're position in market, giving the type of clients we have also giving where we've made investments. We started these investments on cloud-based technologies, 4-plus years ago.","We started these investments on next generation applications, four years ago. And all of that's really accelerated to our benefit as our customers look to modernize and transform themselves.","Darrin Peller","Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then, guys I mean with regards to the Ecom side, again there was 19% growth in overall. Did you already have the benefit of any of the revenue from the cross-sales, between them and Worldpay.","When you list off incremental 14 or so this quarter, there were some that started last year. I think the second half, is where we're hoping for the revenue for some of those to really start to come on.","Is that still on target? And should that help with the growth rate of the e-com and overall tech solutions in the second half?","Woody Woodall","Yeah I think, what we actually described is more of that revenue benefiting 2020, from a growth perspective. Year-over-year, we're certainly seeing the cross-sell right now. And we are excited about it. But more of that revenue growth is in 2020, as those convert.","Gary Norcross","Yeah. Keep in mind Darrin. I mean as you think about, new sales across e-commerce, very similar to the FIS business in banking. Can be a long sales cycle, but it also can be a fairly lengthy implementation cycle, right. You've got to integrate the software, into the e-commerce environment. They're going to actually slowly start moving volume over. So the ramp really you start seeing in 2020. But\u2026","Darrin Peller","Okay.","Gary Norcross","As Woody shared it earlier, we still feel very confident about the back half year. And what we're seeing in those current growth rates. So really sales as we talk about in these quarters, are really indicative of what, what, what it's going to look like, you know three and four quarters out.","Darrin Peller","All right. Just last quick on those low hanging fruit revenue synergies, around the nice network, co-production those deals should be coming on a plant?","Gary Norcross","Yeah. Now we talked about it. We really think, that we're going to start seeing some revenue benefit here very early in the process. And so, that gives us high confidence as we guide in 2020 that really start pushing forward 7%. And we've got really good line of sight into those some of those topics we've discussed on prior calls into that.","Darrin Peller","Very good. Thanks guys.","Gary Norcross","Thank you.","Woody Woodall","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We do have time for one more question that will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Ramsey El-Assal","Hi. Thanks for taking my question \u2013 squeezing me in here. I actually wanted to follow-up on Darrin's last question about the near-term synergies where you mentioned in addition to some of the network optimization -- you mentioned optimizing loyalty, fraud and enhancing Worldpay's issuer business. I'm trying to just get a little more granularity about that. But I thought maybe optimizing loyalty might have to do with your with pay with points program. But it seems like that might've been a little later on in the planning in terms of revenue synergy realizations. So if you could just give us a little more color what exactly is optimizing loyalty fraud and enhancing Worldpay digital business I'd be grateful. ","Woody Woodall","Yes. On the loyalty side I think you are going to see that in the short-term and in the longer-term as well as we take that capability and push it through the existing distribution channel.","Ramsey El-Assal","That\u2019s right. ","Woody Woodall","That was already growing for FIS on a stand-alone basis so that will continue. We can accelerate that with Worldpay's distribution. And in longer-term we can build it into the e-commerce platform and drive incremental differentiation there. So that's the biggest component there. On the fraud side, it's really more incremental we have more data sets to work through -- more data sets to drive through our processes. Those are the two biggest components from additional color standpoint. We will see some level of revenue synergy more in fourth quarter starting to come online, but it's pretty minimal in terms of its end-year contribution for 2019 more of that coming in 2020. ","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay. And then -- and lastly for me, can you give us some indication? You spoke a bit about that the evolution in the marketplace of kind of faster payments and how you're well-positioned on a lot of different axis to benefit from that. Can you just speak to any capabilities that the merger will unlock in terms of potential honest alternative path -- routing paths to go from merchant to bank, or is that something that's in your road map, or any color there would be helpful too?","Woody Woodall","Yes. No, Ramsay. We think there could be a real opportunity there. Obviously, when you start talking about long-term combination of the company and some opportunities that might exist that's one of them that we're looking at, but we're not really prepared to talk about that today. ","Ramsey El-Assal","Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Woody Woodall","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to our presenters for any closing comments. ","Gary Norcross","Thanks for joining us today. We are thrilled with this combination. Worldpay is a respected global brand with a best-in-class executive team and over 8,000 talented employees. They have a loyal and extensive client base and partner network who represent some of the most successful businesses in the industry.","This combined with our profitable and very predictable financial institution business, banking and capital markets all aimed at the heart of commerce and the financial and transactions that power the world's digital economy makes us a powerful combination. We are grateful to all our loyal clients who depend on us to keep their businesses running and growing every day.","Finally, I am personally thankful for our now 55,000 leaders and employees for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients. FIS is dedicated to advancing the way the world pays banks and invests. Thank you for joining us today. ","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the FIS First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd like to turn the call over to Pete Gunnlaugsson. Please go ahead.","Peter Gunnlaugsson - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FIS's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call.","Turning to slide 2, with me today are Gary Norcross, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer. Gary will begin today's call with company highlights for the quarter and Woody will continue with the financial results. This conference call is also being webcasted with today's news release and corresponding presentation available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Moving to slide 3, today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release and in the appendix of the supplemental slide presentation.","Turning to slide 4, it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Gary to discuss the business highlights for the quarter. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Pete. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased to announce today that FIS delivered a very strong quarter and start to the year, exceeding our revenue, profitability and earnings expectations, and delivering exceptional margin expansion.","Based on these results and a robust forecast, Woody will be increasing our EPS guidance for the full-year. Top line growth was driven by balanced execution across our IFS and GFS segments. Key factors include the sales momentum we have been discussing for the past several quarters; the continued expansion of existing client relationships; growth of our clients through higher volumes of transactions and accounts; and new client logos. We continue to be pleased by the accelerating market momentum globally for our products and services.","Turning to slide 5, in the quarter, revenue increased over 3% to $2.1 billion. We expanded EBITDA margins by 340 basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew 33% to $1.09 per share. We delivered the strong results for continued execution of our strategic plan, investing for growth in our focus areas and driving increased efficiency within our operations. We have capitalized on our year-end sales momentum by successfully turning demand into closed deals and further expanding our strong pipeline.","Our Integrated Financial Solutions segment drove top line organic revenue growth of more than 3% for the quarter. Q1 sales were robust, building on the momentum we experienced in the previous quarter. Demand remains strong for our Retail Banking, Wealth and Digital Solutions. Outsourced solution deployments in key business verticals were particularly strong in the quarter. And we saw increased end-user adoption and transaction volume growth across our digital banking platforms.","Our GFS segment delivered top line organic growth of over 5% for the quarter. Growth across the segment was fueled by diverse mix of license revenue from global institutions, especially within the capital market offerings, as well as higher processing and transaction volumes across multiple businesses.","Core banking, buy-side and post-trade processing, drove especially strong results. Margin expansion was exceptional this quarter at 650 basis points, driven by growth in our high margin IP-based offerings and through the positive impact from divestitures of lower margin and non-strategic businesses.","Going forward, we are disclosing a new revenue backlog metric which provides insight into the total revenue under contract. We entered this year with a revenue backlog of about $19.5 billion, speaking to the strong forward visibility. Woody will provide additional insights.","Turning to slide 6, we continue to execute on strategic actions that reinforce our plan to drive transformational results for clients and FIS. This includes executing on our significant investment in continuously modernizing our offerings to meet client demand and drive our near- and long-term growth.","Some of the capabilities we will be delivering in market for 2018 include: bringing new core banking capabilities to market that are built on cloud-based technology with common reusable components which deliver, speed agility and efficiency for clients; consolidating payment platforms into our Unified Payments solution that delivers a consistent modern user experience across all payment transaction types; delivering our integrated omni-channel Digital One strategy that provides modernized digital banking experiences complete with personalization, mobility and social engagement capabilities; bringing our next-generation post-trade solution to market, tripling processing power and performance; continuously adding new APIs to our very robust online gateway, Code Connect, which offers nearly 1,300 APIs for financial services; and deploying more than 50% of our solutions into the FIS private cloud environment.","Proof that these investments are creating strong interest and demand, three weeks ago, we hosted more than 3,000 clients, prospects and partners at one of our large annual client events. This venue provided the platform for our clients to learn more about our strategy and modernization investments and get hands-on with nearly 170 solutions that provide proof of the investments we are making to help them modernize for their future.","Feedback from our clients has been overwhelming positive and results of the conference show a strong increase in demand for our solutions. This feedback, coupled with our strong first quarter results and robust pipeline, underscores our confidence in our strategy and investment decisions, and gives us clear line of sight into our ability to deliver on our 2018 goals and beyond, which are to innovate for long-term growth, drive strong sales with competitively differentiated solutions, and build on our global scale.","We remain very confident in the value we are delivering for our clients and believe that will continue to translate into strong returns for our shareholders.","Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter and full year. Woody?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on slide 8 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter 2018 results and comparable historical financials reflect the adoption of ASC 606 on a like-for-like basis.","In the first quarter, revenue increased 3.3% on an organic basis to $2.1 billion and EBITDA increased 6.7% to $705 million. EBITDA margin expanded a healthy 340 basis points to 34.1% and adjusted earnings per share grew 33% to $1.09 per share.","We entered the year with a more focused set of assets. We're now seeing increasing demand in the markets and improved sales momentum. Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our business model and the success of our sales teams have had over the last six months.","Moving to slide 9, in the first quarter, IFS revenue grew 3.2% on an organic basis to $1.1 billion and EBITDA grew to $451 million versus $439 million in the prior-year quarter. EBITDA margins expanded 10 basis points to 42.5%.","Turning to slide 10, Banking and Wealth grew 5.7% for the quarter. This positive performance was driven primarily by the onboarding of new wealth accounts as well as higher processing volumes.","Payments declined 1.6% driven by the card production business, lower termination fees, and a tough license comparable. We saw some positive signs for the remainder of the year with healthy transaction volume growth in our debit business and fraud solutions. We expect these volumes to continue to grow, giving us visibility and confidence for low-single digit growth for the full year.","Corporate and Digital grew 5.7% for the quarter. Growth was driven primarily by new client onboarding to our mobile platform, increasing user adoption, and higher volumes for our small business solutions. We also saw strong growth within our Corporate Treasury Solutions. As expected, term fees were relatively flat at $17 million in the quarter versus $18 million in the prior-year period.","Turning to slide 11, in the first quarter, GFS revenue grew 5.4% on an organic basis to $927 million, while EBITDA grew 15.2% to $305 million. Margins expanded 650 basis points to 32.9%. Approximately half of this expansion was driven by continued growth of higher-margin IP revenue in the quarter and operating leverage in our business. The remaining expansion reflects the removal of our consulting business divested late last year. We are pleased with the consistent improvement of the margin profile of this segment.","Moving to slide 12, for the quarter, our Institutional and Wholesale business grew 6% and we saw increased volume growth across our solution suites in the buy-side space and strong license sales with global institutions. We're very pleased with the start to the year for this group.","As outlined in the February call, we do not expect similar growth in the second quarter based on the timing of 606 [ASC 606]. We remain confident in our full year growth of 4% to 5% for GFS and an acceleration of revenue growth in the back-half of the year.","Banking and Payments grew 4.8% primarily driven by a large international core banking license sale and higher transaction volumes resulting in growth across all geographies, in particular, Asia-Pacific and Europe.","Moving to slide 13, Corporate and Other revenue in the first quarter was $80 million, with an EBITDA loss of $51 million. The Corporate and Other segment results include $67 million of corporate expenses for the quarter compared to $70 million in the prior-year period, a reduction of 5% reflecting continuing cost management.","Moving to slide 14, cash flow for the quarter was $226 million. First quarter cash flow was primarily impacted by a one-time shift of approximately $100 million in tax payments related to Hurricane Irma from late 2017 into the first quarter of 2018. To a lesser extent, cash flow was also impacted by the timing of working capital. Despite these headwinds, which were contemplated in our full-year forecast, we remain confident in our full-year target of approximately 110% free cash flow conversion.","Debt outstanding as of March 31 was approximately $9.1 billion. The weighted average interest rate is 3.3% and approximately 95% of our total debt is fixed rate. As expected, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%.","For the first quarter, we returned $500 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We paid $106 million to shareholders in dividends for the quarter and repurchased 4.1 million shares for approximately $400 million.","In April 2018, we repurchased an additional 2.1 million shares for approximately $200 million, bringing our year-to-date total to 6.2 million shares for approximately $600 million. Approximately $3.3 billion remain in our existing share repurchase authorization.","Finally, the weighted average diluted share count is 334 million at the end of the quarter and our basic share count was 330 million.","Starting this quarter, we will begin disclosing our revenue backlog. Revenue backlog is defined as revenue signed and under contract, which will be recognized in future periods. As Gary mentioned, the current backlog is approximately $19.5 billion.","Over the next 12 months, we expect to recognize about one-third of this revenue or approximately 80% of our 2018 revenue guidance. The remaining two-thirds of the backlog will be recognized in future periods. Our consolidated recurring revenue figure for the first quarter was 84%, which is in line with what we had previously messaged.","Moving to slide 15, this morning we announced that we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance. Our previous full-year EPS guidance was $5.10 to $5.30 per share, which we are raising about $0.04 given the strong operating performance in the first quarter. Therefore, we are now expecting 2018 full-year adjusted EPS of $5.14 per share to $5.34 per share, representing 20% to 25% growth. We are confident in our increased full-year earnings per share guidance.","Although one quarter does not make a year, we are very pleased with the start of 2018. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to leverage our significant investments in market-leading solutions and client service to produce strong cash flows and maintain a healthy balance sheet. This value-added business model creates predictable and consistent top line growth. Our ability to drive ongoing margin expansion and strong cash flows allowed us to invest for future growth and return cash to shareholders.","In closing, we're excited to see you next week, Tuesday, May 8 at our 2000 (sic) [2018] Investor Day in New York City.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question will come from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys, Great job again.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And I guess, first of all, Q1, if I remember right, in the whole first half was supposed to be a little slower than the rest of the year. And I think maybe even the margins not quite as good as the rest of the year, but margins were right at the top-end, I think, of guidance, growth \u2013 revenue growth right about at the top-end too. Maybe what drove it to be better than you expected in Q1? And does that momentum kind of keep going through the year so it may be closer to the higher end of revenue growth from the lower end? Or did Q1 steal a little bit from the rest of the year, just that dynamic?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, no, I'll start, Dave, and let Woody add. We had a very strong Q1 across the board. We had really good sales in Q4. It came into Q1 and had really good sales in Q1 as well. As we talked prior in the call, that gives us confidence for the back half of the year, because most of our sales, as you know, there's a long sales cycle and then there's a long onboarding cycle. But we also had some nice license deals out of GFS that the team did an excellent job on in Banking and Payments in various regions.","We continue to see good strong momentum on our synergies, while we finished the overall SunGard synergy program, we had not completely finished all of the programs we've had lined up. So, we've actually \u2013 we're onboarding some of those through the back half of last year and into this year, and that's generating results on the margin. So, really just across the board we just had a really good quarter. Woody talked about our transaction volume, and so that we're improving in Q1 as well and all that just translates into very high \u2013 higher revenue than we expected at very nice margins.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Dave, if you think about it, we certainly feel incrementally better about the full-year. There are certainly some timing items in Q2 we talked about, but we feel incrementally better about the full-year. That's why we raised both bottom-end and top-end of the EPS guidance.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you. And I guess just a follow-up. As we think about Q2, because you mentioned the timing issues and stuff, is that more \u2013 you are above the top-end, close to 3.5% in Q1, should it be backed on to like 2.5% in Q2 and then the rest of the year, I guess, we can figure it out later, but is that kind of what you're thinking for now?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I would say, more directly we're right on top of consensus estimates for Q2.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, got you. That's great. Well, great job, guys. Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Next to the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners","Good morning. Congrats on the strong results.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, David.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners","The Institutional and Wholesale business accelerated versus the fourth quarter up to 6% organic. Are the drivers behind that growth sustainable and is 6% a number we should be thinking about for the rest of the year?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, let me talk about it from the sales channel. We're very pleased where the Institutional and Wholesale team is executing. We've had really good strong demand for sales across those product lines. As we talked in the past, David, we're seeing a lot of those customers, especially Tier 1 institutions where they built a lot of those capabilities in-house, they're now looking to lower their total cost of ownership. You've seen the growth in our utility and post-trade, but you've also seen good strong license sales and also SaaS model sales across that group.","So, it's really being driven by market conditions with just a lot of disparate capabilities and we saw all this in the SunGard due diligence, but it's really nice to see it coming forward through the sales channel, and people are just looking for more effective ways to really pull together the front, middle and back office with capabilities that lower overall cost of ownership. So, sales has been strong. You do get some lumpiness in the Institutional and Wholesale business because of the license fee nature, although we are pushing more and more to a SaaS model that will level that out over time, but we're very pleased with the growth rates in I&W and we continue to see very strong demand in the pipeline and the teams did an excellent job executing against that pipeline and closing business.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners","Got it. You seem more constructive about end-market demand than on the 4Q call. Are you seeing any sort of increased demand tied to the tax cuts in the U.S.; banks being more willing to spend that dividend?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, at times we can be a little more conservative. We saw good strong demand in Q4, but frankly, one quarter doesn't make a difference for us. We've now had two really strong sales quarters in a row, which gives us \u2013 frankly, it does make us lean in a little more to market conditions and seeing them improve. The pipeline looking forward into Q2, we feel good about our sales momentum going into Q2 and what the pipeline looks like there. So I do think right now, demand in the markets are improving.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","And I think, David, that really gives us higher visibility in both back-half and more importantly, the out years, 2019 and beyond.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners","Got it. Quick final question. You alluded to some additional margin expansion initiatives beyond SunGard. What are those initiatives, and are those drivers of 2019 and beyond?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think, David, one of the things we've been talking about in the past is data center consolidation and one of the factors that could drive future margin expansion. We're seeing strong traction in that program to-date, and we're going to talk more about Phase 2 of that program next week, but we certainly see the ability to drive margins beyond 2018.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners","Understood. Thank you very much.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And next we go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, Incorporated. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Can you guys talk a little bit about your digital products? We've had some questions I'm trying to get a handle around. What do you guys kind of consider total digital revenue? And any sense of kind of how that's trending, growing, accelerating, et cetera, as you think about your business?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, we haven't necessarily disclosed the exact revenue of digital. It's been a very, very strong grower for us over the years. As I've just talked about in my prepared remarks, we're rolling out our new Digital One capabilities, which is really an omni-channel approach to digital, and frankly will be our third-generation digital that we've been deployed dating all the way back to 2008.","We continue to see very strong demand across our client base. We've disclosed on prior calls more than 40 million consumers running, for example, our mobile banking app. But we think it's going to be a continued strong grower for us for the foreseeable future.","Digital has really now moved beyond just the mobile banking experience and really has moved across true omni-channel, and we're excited about this next-generation capabilities we're rolling out. And that's a great opportunity for us to upsell our existing clients, but also continue to take market share with our leading capabilities.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. My follow-up question is as you look across your portfolio of assets, you guys are a really big company and have lots of broad products. Where would you like to most add scale if you could? Or where is a hole in technology that you feel compelled to \u2013 most compelled to add to?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, for us, when we think about \u2013 when we think across our various verticals that we're serving, Retail Banking, Payments, Institutional and Wholesale, from a true product gap trying to fill, I would say we've got very little gaps there. You've seen us fill a few over the last several years. We made an investment, for example, in Wealth Management. We did something with Clear2Pay on real-time payments. But honestly, we feel very good about the portfolio.","One of the things we'll be talking about next week in the investor update is really line of sight, and you're hearing us talk about some of the new capabilities we're bringing to market which will allow us to consolidate, frankly, in some instances two, three, four platforms down to one next-generation capability.","From a scale standpoint, we do feel that scale's always an important \u2013 and while we have tremendous scale especially in the processing world, as we talked about our revenue backlog today, we would \u2013 we'd be interested in adding scale across any of those three verticals if it made sense for our shareholders and for the company.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Gary, could you maybe update us on the kind of the broad outlook at your bank customer set both in terms of what you see with respect to the consolidation of your customers, the bank M&A landscape? And then also, it sounds like there is a little bit more incremental willingness to spend on discretionary items in terms of outsourcing. Is that something you think that's kind of really picked up in terms of your conversations with clients?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Jim, it's a great question. We're not forecasting a drop in consolidation in the industry. We think that consolidation will stay steady, although with me talking to clients as much as I do, a consistent theme are valuations are getting expensive, right? So, as people look at their various opportunities to do acquisitions, that will come into play. But we do think through 2018 we'll see fairly consistent consolidation in the industry.","From a demand standpoint, I do see increased demand. We're seeing it in our sales channel and closing. Frankly, we run multiple large user conferences, just giving the size of our company, we just completed, as I said, three weeks ago our first one. We got our next one coming up in another three weeks. And both of those enrollment, it was up tremendously year-over-year, which also shows that banks are willing to start spending more discretionary dollars on travel to actually get exposed to new capabilities.","So, there's a couple of things that would indicate demand is definitely growing over the last two quarters and we're seeing that push into the second quarter as well. So, Woody and I are pretty confident in the remainder of the year that that demand is going to continue. But we also think that you'll continue to see some fairly significant consolidation going on in the industry, assuming valuations don't just continue to rise at a too high of a rate.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful, thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, speaking of expensive valuations, can you maybe just kind of give us your updated thoughts on the M&A landscape in terms of targets for FIS, specifically your view on valuations? And any kind of complementary businesses, whether that be merchant acquiring or I&W businesses or other areas where you think there could be attractive targets, M&A relative to share buyback?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, we're confident that we can do M&A activity and it drives tremendous shareholder value, as indicated by the SunGard acquisition. But what I'd share with you is, we also are a mature buyer. In other words, we can look across Retail Banking, we can look across Payments, we can look across Institutional and Wholesale, and there would be certain opportunities in any of those three verticals that could make sense.","Valuations are high. Probably not telling you anything you don't know. So, for us, we're very confident in our strategy we have, we're very confident on our increasing organic growth and expanding our margins. So \u2013 but if an opportunity presented itself, that made sense, that brought us a new product or capability to one of those existing verticals, or broke us into an adjacent market we found interesting, and we could do that and really return a lot of value to our shareholders, we consider it.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we move to the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering if we could get an update on the debt retirement plan, and have your targets changed at all with M&A being less of an opportunity?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","No. So, we closed out 2017 with about $8.8 billion in debt. That ticked up slightly in Q1, which was expected. We anticipate aggregate debt to be down slightly year-over-year and leverage to come down based on our EBITDA growth. So, we will pay debt down slightly over the course of the year. We bought back about $600 million of shares to-date \u2013 year-to-date, and we continue to look at that as a use of excess cash flow as well.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And then, on the margin front, can you remind us of the margin drivers? I think, the top driver has been data center consolidation in the past. Maybe you can give us an update on where you stand with that. I just hope I'm not stealing anything from the Analyst Day. Thanks.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, I think, more broadly, the last few years have been a lot of synergy from a margin expansion perspective. This quarter you had a couple of components. One, we really saw high margin revenue growth as the main driver of margin expansion. We certainly are seeing increased traction around our data center consolidation that will drive future expansion in the back half of the year, and in 2019 and beyond, and then, we've seen some divestiture of low margin businesses. That's a combination of the three main drivers of margin expansion.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Pardon me. Interesting to hear you talk a little bit about volumes as well as mix. And I think you, maybe Woody, you touched on a little bit in GFS in terms of license sales. Can you just expand a little bit on how sensitive the business is broadly to volume, how much visibility you have to changes in volume?","And then, also, on the revenue mix side, is \u2013 I recognize in that SunGard historical is a little more license heavy than FIS. Is there anything meaningful that's changed sort of in the complexion of the business in that regard?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","No, I wouldn't say we've had a meaningful change in the complexion of the business. We had an 84% recurring revenue base as the starting backdrop, which is very consistent with what we've talked about in the past of 80-plus percent. We did have high license revenues in the quarter, but we saw also increasing processing and \u2013 processing volumes. The processing volumes are a little more difficult to predict, but I think you look at it in terms of how the markets are performing, what do you see in the broader markets on the volume front. So, looking at both those combined, we feel very good about what we have, but no major change in the landscape or the revenue type in terms of what's driving it.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And on the backlog figure which is helpful, thank you. Any color on how that's grown historically and sort of how that's translated into current period revenues, sort of the...","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I would tell you, our back testing, I would say, the translation in the revenue has been very similar, which really realigns to about an 80% recurring revenue number. That has ticked up some as we've divested the non-recurring revenue businesses that we've talked about in the past. We haven't spent as much energy going way back, looking at backlog as it's a relatively new disclosure, but obviously we'll be trending it going forward. It's obviously ultimately going to drive in line with our longer term growth rates.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And as a last one for me. In that backlog figure, is it \u2013 is the incremental, let's say, just sequentially in the first quarter sort of similar to mix of business, in other words, little more contribution from GFS than IFS?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I would say the contribution is similar. As you think about our business on a broad scale, Andrew, it's a very predictable forecastable business. We have some lumps here and there in terms of license, but again, very predictable in terms of our ability to forecast.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Keep in mind, our IFS business has a much higher reoccurring revenue rate, right? So, as you think about it, it really is that revenue under contract and based on the remaining term of the agreement and onboarding. But, to Woody's point, it really onboards in that backlog very similar with the reoccurring revenue rate at the various segments.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next we have the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Gary, I just wanted to go back to sort of the sales track you've seen for the last couple of quarters, and nice to hear you talking about the macro environment getting better, one of the first companies sort of acknowledging that.","But my question is really more where are you seeing the pickup in demand across products, service sets, if there's any? A little bit more color you could give us on where specific pockets of demand are.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Glenn, it's a great question, and honestly, we're seeing good strong pull-through across a number of our verticals. We're pretty excited about all the new capabilities. Over the last three years, when you \u2013 we were doing a lot of integration work on SunGard, but we were also doing a lot of innovation work around new capabilities and a lot of that's coming onto the \u2013 coming into market in 2018.","So, we've seen really nice growth across our digital channels, both in volume, but also in sales momentum. We're seeing a lot of \u2013 several of our back office services as people are trying to drive costs out of their businesses and lower their overall total cost of ownership, seeing nice growth there.","As we move over into GFS, we saw \u2013 we're seeing good demand on our new core capabilities, especially in some very large institutions and seeing good traction around some of those components and driving those into market.","We've talked on several questions today about strength across Institutional and Wholesale. So, it's really a nice blend and that's one of the things that we always had felt great about FIS as we have such a diverse product portfolio.","Our clients \u2013 various of our clients are investing in various areas based on their needs, and given our capability and strength of our capabilities, we can participate in those engagements.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, Woody, just a quick question on the Payments growth and outlook within IFS. That was the one sort of negative in the quarter, but it sounded like you've got confidence that that kind of accelerates in the back-half, and I think you suggested kind of low-single digit or some growth for the year. But maybe just to get a little bit of color on what you \u2013 why you've got visibility for Payments growth getting better in the back half?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, I'll get more specific on Q1. We had a term fee that was about a point of headwind. We had a license last year that was a difficult compare, which was about a point. You add those back, you're getting roughly 2 points of growth, and we anticipate seeing that. We saw underlying volume growth in both fraud and debit and are seeing visibility into those volumes into the back-half of the year. So we think that's the low-water mark for the Payments business this year.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","All right. Great. Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question we go to is Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Bryan?","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm sorry about that. Just thinking about the increasing demand, you guys are seeing better sales, pipeline's strong, we've got a good recurring revenue backlog. But you guys decided not to raise the revenue guide. When does that translate all the stuff you're seeing better than expectations into potential upside to your top line?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I would tell you, if you think about our sales and then when they're onboarding, it gives us higher confidence into the acceleration in the back-half of the year we've talked about. It also gives us a point of view around further accelerating in 2019 and beyond. We were \u2013 while very good this quarter, 3.3% was still within the top-end of our range for the year. And we're relatively conservative. So one quarter doesn't make a year, but as we've talked about, feel incrementally better about the year and we're certainly ahead of our plan to-date.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. And then, I did see the stronger buyback in the quarter. Is that because you guys aren't finding much on the M&A front and we should expect more capital return in terms of buybacks?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, I think about it in terms of M&A being \u2013 continuing to be a part of our long-term strategy, but the deal's got to fit strategically and it's got to make good financial sense. We're disciplined buyers. We don't just buy to buy, and we feel like our balance sheet's healthy. We feel like our leverage is about where we need to be. So we would anticipate continuing to see share buyback over the course of the year, absent a good M&A deal with a good valuation that fits strategically. And I think that's evidenced by year-to-date $600 million of share buyback.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color, and solid quarter.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Not to beat a dead horse around where the strength is coming from within the business, but maybe instead of looking at it from a vertical perspective, Gary, maybe you can talk a little bit about spending patterns in some of your Tier 1 banks versus some of the smaller community banks and maybe international versus domestic? Is it sort of broad-based strength? Or is something really standing out between those groups?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, I think, if there would be something that's really standing out, I'd try to make some of those comments, George. We've talked a lot about domestically in community banking this need to outsource virtually 100% of their capabilities on a SaaS model. What we're seeing especially in the larger banks and regional banks, both domestically and internationally, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, we continue to see an increased demand for SaaS in those markets as well.","And one of the things that I've been surprised by, we continue to talk about that, but the size of the institution that's willing to consider outsourcing a product, whether it's debit or credit processing, whether it's core banking, whether it's Institutional and Wholesale, post-trade, we're continuing to see a stronger increased demand in those outsourcing trends, which gives us a lot of confidence.","Now in the short-term, George, as you expect, especially in that GFS market, we have more license fees. So there's a balance. As people move more to a SaaS model, we could see some lumpiness and actually some pullback in our license fees, but we're very pleased by that trend.","Obviously, as our reoccurring revenue continues to go up in GFS, that will raise the overall reoccurring revenue of the company, which certainly gives us much, much higher visibility, not only into our quarters, but into multiple years out in our backlog, et cetera. So I would say that's the thing that probably is standing out the most for me. And we just continue to see that trend accelerate in the last several quarters.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then, Woody, can you just remind us what the expectation is for term fees for the full-year relative to 2017?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Our expectation is relatively flat. We had about $62 million last year. We've got roughly $60 million in our forecast for the year.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question will come from the line of Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the competitive environment and I wondered if that has anything to do with the improved demand that you're seeing from your customers. I know that, I think, a few quarters back, you mentioned that being a bit more of a headwind. So, could you comment on that and talk about how that's evolved?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I think it's still a competitive marketplace. No matter what market we're participating in, I think, we talked in quarters in the past, we might run into different competitors depending on the geographic region or the particular product line. But as I've also shared, we've got extremely competitive products and we're competing very well in the market and our sales teams are executing very well.","We continue to invest behind our sales force and grow the sales force in our various geographic and market regions, and that's obviously going to continue to pay benefits as well as we onboard additional sales reps and get them up to speed. But, I would say, we've not seen any change in the competitive environment to speak of and \u2013 but our products just continue to perform very well in the market.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And I guess, just another question around demand. As you think about the impact of tax reform and I think a lot of institutions maybe are still in planning stages, but you're still seeing \u2013 you're seeing demand I guess early. Does it feel to you like a lot of your customers are budgeting things a year from now, two years from now? Or are things really getting underway this early?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I really do see \u2013 we've talked about it a lot on this call. We really are seeing just increased demand in market. I mean, Q4 was a strong sales quarter for us pretty much across the board. Q1 was a strong sales quarter for us across the board. Pipeline continues to grow and have good velocity. Interesting, on our user conferences with the increase in participation, typically that's the very first thing that's cut is travel when people are really curtailing expenses. And so, we're seeing a nice increase across all of our major conferences.","So, all those would be good indicators for me that demand's growing and we feel it's going to continue. But as people are really entering into, as you guys know, our contracts are long-term in nature. And so, typically the sales cycle is anywhere from 6 to 12 months, probably closer to 12 months in duration. Our onboarding times are in a similar range. So, these are big strategic commitments, our clients are making the purchase mission-critical IP-centric capabilities. And so, we feel good about it.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. Appreciate the time.","Operator","And that was our last question. I'll turn the call back over to our speakers.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you for joining us today and for your ongoing interest in FIS. We are pleased to start the year with a quarter of strong revenue, profitability performance, and earnings growth. Importantly, we are pleased to have a robust pipeline that positions us for another year of strong results.

Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Peter Gunnlaugsson, please go ahead.","Peter Gunnlaugsson - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Leah. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FIS' Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Turning to slide 2, Gary Norcross, President and Chief Executive Officer will begin with the business summary. Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer will continue with the financial results for the third quarter.

Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release and in the Appendix of the supplemental slide presentation.","Turning to slide 4, I will now turn the call over to Gary to discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Pete. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to open the call affirming another strong quarter of execution for FIS. We saw expected growth across all operating segments. Our Q3 results continued the positive momentum we built in the first half of the year, delivering profitable growth and outstanding cash flow. This is the third consecutive strong quarter which speaks to the fundamental strength of our underlying business and the success of our focused execution.","Now turning to the remainder of the year. We are pleased that our outlook remains positive. Despite continuing macroeconomic pressures, our sales teams continued converting opportunities to new wins and cross-selling and upselling to existing clients. Market and client demand for our solution continues, with an emphasis on creating operational efficiencies to run and grow their business. These results and trends underscore our confidence in the strong finish to 2016. As a result of our solid performance year-to-date and remaining outlook, we will be increasing our current guidance for the second time this year which Woody will outline later in the call.","Turning to slide 5. As expected in the quarter, adjusted revenue increased 4% organically compared to the prior-year quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA grew more than twice as fast as revenue at 8%, and adjusted earnings per share rose 11%. We are very pleased with these results given the difficult comparisons of the prior-year quarter. As you will recall, last year was a very good quarter for license fees especially with regards to the former SunGard business. Also, Q3 2015 marked the quarter where we reversed short-term incentives due to the year-to-date results.","With less than 90 days until year-end, we remain ahead of schedule with our SunGard integration. We are very pleased to report that we are on track to exceed our run rate synergy commitments and have line-of-sight to exit the year with $200 million in run rate synergies for 2016. This milestone is a full 12 months ahead of schedule from originally targeted dates. We are confident that we will also exceed our long-term target and deliver more than $250 million in run rate synergies by year-end 2017, continuing our positive track record of exceeding our synergy commitments.","More importantly, our intense focus on the integration is continuing to yield results in new and existing client sales. On all accounts, we are pleased with our strong performance through the first three quarters of the year. We are on track to exceed our full-year 2016 goals and are well-positioned to achieve our longer-term growth objectives which are to: grow our base business, unlock enterprise value through strategic investments, expand our solution portfolio within our existing client base, and remain focused on strong financial discipline.","Turn to slide 6 to review segment highlights. Our Integrated Financial Solutions business continues to grow, driving top line organic revenue growth of more than 4% this quarter. We saw a solid growth in our Retail Banking, Wealth and Payment businesses, entering into several strategic long-term agreements with North American community and regional banks, syncing the benefits of our fully integrated solution suite. In the third quarter, we signed several new competitive takeaways encompassing our Core Banking, Digital and Payment Solution offerings. For example, as you've seen in our recent press release, a multi-state community bank with approximately $10 billion in assets selected FIS to provide a complete suite of Banking and Payment Solutions spanning our core processing, digital payments, EFT, card personalization and fully managed IP outsourcing to help drive its digital and commercial growth through next-generation technologies.","In another example, a fast-growing community bank in the Pacific Northwest will be implementing FIS core banking, bill pay, lending and item processing solutions to support its growth and efficiency goals.","Our Payments business had another strong quarter, with nearly 6% organic growth, driven by continued growth in debit processing volumes and our card production business, especially from our EMV card deployments. In addition, our innovation investments are showing early promise with the successful roll-out of a new mobile-based fraud prevention solution driving demand as institutions look to help their customers better combat fraud.","Importantly, these new wins characterize the strength of IFS's growth profile, which is long-term, mission-critical software applications deployed in our one-to-many model that creates significant and predictable reoccurring revenues.","Turning next to our Global Financial Solutions business, we delivered another strong quarter with top-line organic growth of 4.5%. Opportunities in this segment were driven by client demand for our transformational and next generation Institutional and Wholesale and Banking and Payments capabilities. Demand for our Banking and Payment Solutions outside of North America remained strong, driving organic revenue growth of 11% this quarter. While Asia continues to be a high-growth market, we were pleased to see steady growth in EMEA, with continued progress in Brazil.","In late September, Sainsbury's Bank went live on its new FIS-hosted banking platform, enabling the bank to support its customers with next-generation capabilities and technology. This delivery milestone moves the FIS and Sainsbury's Bank relationship into an exciting new phase, as we begin the long-term, decade-plus operating agreement where we are focused on running the daily operations of the bank. With this successful implementation, we are proud to be the FinTech partner of choice for two of the UK's most innovative financial services providers: Sainsbury's Bank and Atom Bank, both having gone live on FIS solutions in the last few months.","In Asia, we continue to build on our already strong market presence, signing significant multi-year deals with two de novo institutions in India this quarter. In addition, we entered into an agreement to provide new payment capabilities to one of India's largest government-owned banks, showcasing our ability to serve clients of all sizes in this fast-growing market. Within our Institutional and Wholesale business, Credit Suisse became the second major client to go live on the FIS Derivatives Utility, approximately four months after choosing to join this highly scalable, consumption-based solution.","We're also pleased to have renewed a significant post-trade agreement with one of the world's largest global institutions. While the I&W business brings more quarterly volatility due to the timing of license fees, we're extremely pleased with the overall year-to-date growth of 4%, which is more than what was originally modeled during the SunGard due diligence.","Finally, while the implications of Brexit are still unknown in these early stages, demand for our Consulting services are in line with our expectations, as we work with institutions to help them prepare for future scenarios.","Turning next to slide 7, before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize today by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. Our performance, combined with the strong pipeline and clear line of sight for the remainder of the year, gives us confidence in our full year results. To meet our goals, we will continue to focus on our integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth through new sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.","Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on slide 9. Adjusted revenue increased 3.8% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew to $766 million, a 7.7% increase compared to the prior year on an adjusted combined basis as if SunGard was owned in both periods. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $330 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 11.1% to $1 per share.","Year-to-date, adjusted revenue increased 4.5% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew to $2.1 billion, a 9.5% increase compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis. EBITDA margin expanded 180 basis points to 30.1% and adjusted earnings per share grew 17.5% to $2.69 per share.","As Gary said, we are pleased with the quarter and year-to-date results.","Moving to slide 10, in the third quarter IFS revenue grew on an organic basis by 4.1% while adjusted EBITDA grew 1% on an adjusted combined basis. As Gary mentioned, in the third quarter of 2015 we reversed incentive accrual due to business performance. In 2016, we're performing ahead of plan and have booked incentive accruals accordingly. This has created a difficult comparison in the third quarter 2016. After this difficult comparable, IFS EBITDA would have grown 4.4% or expanded margins by approximately 10 basis points.","For the first nine months, revenue increased 5.9% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew 3.9% compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis.","Turning to slide 11, Banking and Wealth grew 3.9% organically for the quarter. This was partially driven by a large risk and compliance project and strength in our IT and Print Solutions.","Payments continued its strong growth, posting 5.8% this quarter. EMV card production, debit and fraud processing all contributed to this growth. As we've previously discussed, EMV growth comparables become more difficult in the coming quarters.","Corporate and Digital grew about 1% for the quarter.","Mobile Banking continued to grow double digits. The strong growth in Mobile was partially offset by timing of license fees and Corporate liquidity and the grow over (11:55) of a termination fee creating a difficult comparable to the prior-year period.","As discussed on last quarter's call, we did not expect results for IFS in the second half of the year to replicate the exceptional growth in the first half. We remain confident in IFS producing full year organic growth exceeding the midpoint of our long-term guidance and are pleased with the year-to-date performance of this segment.","Turning to slide 12, in the third quarter GFS revenue grew 4.5% organically while adjusted EBITDA grew 13.3% on an adjusted combined basis for the quarter. This represents 290 basis points of margin expansion to 32.1%. Year-to-date, revenue increased 3.9% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11.5% compared to the prior-year period on an adjusted combined basis reflecting 250 basis points of margin expansion for the first nine months of 2016.","As we've discussed in the last few quarters, the addition of SunGard to the GFS segment is driving a long-term structural improvement to the segment. EBITDA margins for this segment have increased by 630 basis points over the prior year reported margin of 25.8%. The inclusion of the SunGard assets increases revenue contribution from intellectual property-led sales of mission-critical applications and enhances the profit margin profile of the segment. The combination of revenue growth and higher margin solutions and execution on synergies has driven three quarters of meaningful margin expansion. In fact, we now expect to deliver approximately 30% margins in this segment for the full year, ahead of our initial expectations.","Moving to slide 13. Our Institutional and Wholesale business grew approximately 1% for the quarter. As we discussed in the second quarter commentary, we expected lower growth in Institutional and Wholesale for the third quarter and expect higher growth in Q4 related to the timing of license signings and including renewals. As we look forward, we're seeing a longer-term trend developing in this market where clients are demanding processing solutions versus a traditional license model. This will be a long-term positive for recurring revenue but we'll have some quarterly lumpiness as these contract renewals and sales move to processing solutions.","Banking and Payments grew 11% organically. The growth was led by a one-time fee related to a successful conversion of Sainsbury and continued strength in Brazil and Asia Pac across both retail Banking and Payments processing. Gary highlighted the continued sales wins and momentum driving long-term growth for the business creating recurring high-margin revenues. As we've previously discussed while our Consulting business continues to provide value to our clients, it is becoming a smaller part of the overall business. Results for the quarter were in line with our expectations and we continued to see softness in discretionary spending. We do anticipate higher growth in the fourth quarter due primarily to an easier comparison to the prior-year period. We continue to project a revenue headwind from foreign currency translation of approximately $100 million for the full year with no adverse impact to EPS guidance.","Moving to slide 14. Corporate and Other adjusted revenue in the third quarter was $154 million with adjusted EBITDA loss of $34 million on an adjusted combined basis. The Corporate and Other segment results include $75 million of Corporate expenses for the quarter compared to $80 million in the prior-year period. This reduction in Corporate expense reflects ongoing cost management efforts and synergies. As you are aware, the businesses in this segment are non-strategic and not aligned with our long-term strategy of serving clients in the financial services market. While our Public Sector and Education business again posted very strong organic growth of 6.2%, Retail Check Processing and Global Commercial Services was and will continue to be a headwind for the segment. Despite these headwinds within the Corporate and Other, these do not impact our consolidated three-year outlook and our IFS and GFS segments continue to perform well and in line with our expectations.","Moving to slide 15. Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow. Free cash flow was $426 million for the quarter, and over $1 billion for the first nine months. In the third quarter, our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings exceeded 100%. We have reduced our debt by more than $650 million since December 31, and have approximately $10.8 billion of debt outstanding as of September 30. We remain highly focused on cash flow generation to de-lever the balance sheet which continues to be a top priority for us.","In August, we successfully completed a debt refinancing including a two-year extension out to 2021 of our $3 billion credit facility and a $2.5 billion bond issuance. These activities reduced our near-term exposure to market uncertainty, increased our liquidity, extended the tenure of our debt by about 2.5 years and locked-in attractive rates. These benefits are substantial although they do create additional interest expense. We were very pleased with the results of these activities and the strong support from fixed income investors.","In the third quarter, we returned $84 million to shareholders through dividends and have returned $225 million in dividends year-to-date. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of $330 million on a fully diluted basis. In line with our previous guidance, the effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter.","Before I conclude my remarks I would like to provide some final thoughts as we finish the year. As Gary mentioned, we continue to execute on synergies and expect to exceed our revised 2016 target of $150 million. We now have line of sight to $200 million in run rate synergies exiting 2016. The teams continue to work diligently on accelerating activities in addition to identifying new costs take out opportunities and anticipate exiting 2017 with a cost synergy run rate of more than $250 million. We will continue to provide you updates on our progress.","These higher than originally anticipated synergy benefits will be partially offset by two factors from an earnings perspective. As discussed, we recently completed a debt refinancing and are incurring additional interest expense. Our original full-year guidance for 2016 outlined in February, we forecasted net interest expense of $370 million. We now expect net interest expense for the full year 2016 to be $12 million higher, primarily impacting Q4. Earlier this year, we also provided guidance on depreciation and amortization costs excluding purchase accounting of $570 million. Due to accelerated integration efforts, including, but not limited to, data center consolidation, implementing enterprise corporate systems, we had increased our short-term capital spend to drive future cost benefits. In addition, we continue to invest in our products for future growth, highlighted this quarter by the example Gary provided in his remarks.","Based on these continued activities in investing to reduce ongoing cost and investing for growth, we now expect depreciation and amortization expense to exceed our original guidance by $10 million $15 million. We also anticipate our capital expenditures to run at approximately 6.5% of revenue versus our previous guidance of 6% of revenue for 2016.","In May of this year, we provided you with a three-year outlook on revenue growth and profitability and remain comfortable with those views. While I know you want me to discuss 2017 in more detail, we will let our commentary regarding 2017 at this time and, as usual, we will provide you full guidance in February. Given our performance to-date, we're tightening our full-year organic revenue growth to the midpoint of our previous guidance range of approximately 4.5% for the year. We also expect our full-year adjusted EPS to be $3.80 to $3.85 per share, which increases the low end of our previous range of $3.75 to $3.85 per share.","As you will recall, in the first quarter we raised our synergy targets for the year. In the second quarter, we raised our revenue and EPS guidance. Today, we are again increasing our synergy targets and tightening our EPS expectations for the year. These increases speak to the fundamental strength of our underlying business and the focused execution of our teams. We remain very pleased with our results for the first nine months of 2016 despite a continued difficult macro environment. Our business model generates consistent earnings per share growth, creates strong cash flow, and allows us to return cash to shareholders. We believe the strength of our business model and our company will continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Nice job on the margin front in the quarter. I just want to start off, first, if you can...","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. If you could just start off by highlighting perhaps the run rate of what we should be seeing into the fourth quarter which is implied by your guidance. I mean I know you guys had some items in the quarter, like a licensing timing in SunGard and some of the Payment revenues. And maybe you could just distill exactly the one-time sort of things, or the benefits of the \u2013 headwinds and tailwinds of the quarter that will allow you to re-accelerate back to what it looks like is around 4.5% growth in Q4?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. A couple of things. We think IFS will be above the midpoint of our guidance, so above 4.5%. If you look at individually within the quarter, we had some term fees in the Corporate and Digital area. Instead of 1%, the growth in Corporate and Digital would have been about 4%, ex the term fees.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We're pleased with 4% growth in Banking and Wealth, and Payments will have a little bit more of a difficult comparable in the fourth quarter around EMV, as we've been outlining for the last couple of quarters. But we certainly like the growth year-to-date, and certainly feel like we're going to be above midpoint, particularly being November the 1st with a couple of months to go, Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's good to hear.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. And just add to that, Darrin, if you like look at the license fee comment, typically Q4 is a very large quarter for license fees historically, and as we get more comfortable with the Institutional Wholesale business, former SunGard, you're going to see more of this lumpiness as license fees flow in various quarters. But we'll see a nice quarter in license fees in Q4 for that business as well.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. But, I mean, overall, it sounds like the sustainability of the 4.5% growth implied in the guidance is pretty real, in terms of run rate going forward?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. We feel very good about it. Absolutely.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, I just had a quick follow-up on the margin change. Obviously a lot of it was synergies. Was there anything organic \u2013 in other words, can you give us a little more color as to what surprised you to the upside? What are the actual levers you were able to pull faster to get to the GFS margin to reach that level a little more quickly?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Darrin, if you looked at what's going on in the synergies, obviously when we originally entered the year, we had thought we would get full $200 million of run rate synergies out in two years, $100 million by the end of this year and $100 million by next year. What we're seeing, and frankly seeing some of that in the capital needs, we're able to accelerate a lot of our projects that exist in our playbook. We talk about our integration playbook all the time, and we're just able to accelerate those programs and get to them on a much faster basis.","Frankly, the cultural elements of the two company came together much cleaner than what we've seen in other large acquisitions we've done. The alignment of leadership teams and the focus. And so it's allowed us to accelerate a lot of the programs that are in our existing playbook. It's actually driven our capital a little hotter than what we would typically see, but all for a good outcome. And so that's why we're very confident of hitting the run rate of $200 million this year, and as Woody said, more than $250 million next year. But we're not done. We're very focused on continuing to execute the integrations, continuing to look for opportunities to drive out synergies, but it's really just been the acceleration of our integration playbook.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Darrin, the other component around that would be the composition of the GFS segment. The growth in Institutional and Wholesale at 4% for the year, and the growth in Banking and Payments at 5% for the year, are becoming a larger and larger component of the business, which come with larger higher margins, and that's helping from an organic or ongoing basis as well, in that segment.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Fine. All right. Makes sense, guys. Thanks, again.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next we go to the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Morning, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Could you comment on the demand outlook in the post-trade derivatives processing business? You highlighted a second client who went live in the quarter, and it seems like the CFTC is cracking down on swap reporting errors by large banks. Are you seeing any increased tendency to outsource in that business?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, no, David, it's a great question. We're very excited about the opportunities when we look at our post-trade processing unit. The team has done an excellent job of not only signing customers, but also onboarding them. We've got a very full pipeline, with various institutions looking for ways to lower their total cost of ownership, leverage our best practice through our utility like deployment. So, we'll continue to see this business be a tailwind for us into the future.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","And then on the large bank core processing market, what does the demand outlook appear to be? I mean, any pickup given the pressure on net interest margin and regulatory and compliance spending?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, as you can imagine, it's a great question. When you're dealing with these large global institutions, these sales engagements tend to be longer in nature. We highlighted obviously the significant implementation of Sainsbury, which was a very large deal. We do have a number of other key opportunities that are in the pipeline today that the teams are working very focused on. As you mentioned, given the regulatory compliance arena, given the need to take out cost and lower the total cost of ownership, we do continue to see more opportunities of larger institutions trying to figure out ways to leverage our capabilities to address those two topics. And so, we see a really good opportunity for us in the future, and the team continues to execute well. But, as I said, these sales engagements take time and they don't move as fast as what we've seen in traditional community and regional banks. But some good opportunities out there for us.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Just quick final question on EMV card production, what percentage of your customer base do you estimate has a completed EMV card production? And could this be a tailwind through 2017?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We talked about 20% to 30% on the second quarter call, David. I would tell you we're probably little more than 30% at this point. I think it's more normal and ordinary course into 2017. We'll see the volumes at higher levels than earlier in 2015 and 2016. But I think the volumes will be more in line with normal ordinary course versus a tailwind.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, David. We talked about this on some of the earlier calls. What was interesting about our client base \u2013 and I think maybe some of it was due to some of our larger clients. We had several of our customers reissue 100% of their card base, just wanted to immediately go EMV across the entire card base.","To Woody's points, we're now more in that maintenance rollout phase where we've got our clients as they're normally coming and their mag stripes are coming up for maintenance replacement tenures then we're replacing that. But we're still at a very good strong quarter of growth in EMV, and that's going to continue to be an area where we'll produce a lot of EMV cards going forward.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Can you talk a little bit about Consulting? I know that's been a point of focus obviously last year, and we're just trying to make sure we understand it this year. It looks like the Consulting business slowed a little bit. I think we went from 1.8%, 1.3% (29:20) to 90 bps this quarter. Can you just walk us through what's going on there? I think we thought that 3Q might be a little better only because the comps got easier, and I think, Woody, you mentioned the comps get even easier in 4Q. Considering this, give us a sense, and maybe as part of that talk a little bit about Brexit and if you're seeing any change there?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I'll try to give you some of the math, and then maybe Gary can touch on the broader demand question. If you look at the math, we were at about 1% for the quarter. I would tell you that was about in line with our expectations.","If you go back to the previous commentary, it was easier comps in the second half of the year. That is still consistent. We would tell you we still look at mid-single digit growth for the full year and probably sequentially around flat for the fourth quarter, which obviously would drive a significant increase into the fourth quarter in terms of quarter-over-quarter growth, Brett.","So still mid-single digit for full year. We've got about a one-to-one type book-to-bill ratio, so feel good about our line of sight into the fourth quarter, as we've talked about before. Got very good line-of-sight about three months out and then less visibility as you look further on the calendar, but we feel good about the guide. We feel good about mid-single digit and feel good about what we previously described to you guys.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think Woody kind of hit it all, Brett. Honestly our Consulting group is performing exactly where we thought it would. As Woody said, Q4 is a much easier comp. We saw significant deceleration last year. Given our book-to-bill and where it is right now, we're very confident going into the quarter.","Frankly, as we've discussed we have focused now \u2013 we have moved capital back more towards truly transformative Consulting engagements. We're seeing the results of that in our margin. Our margins are coming up in that Consulting business, which is good. Lance and his team are doing an outstanding job running that business for us.","As we've also talked about, we really are looking for Capco to augment our engagements where we have product involved in large-scale engagements, and so that's an important role for us. So intentionally by design we're not going to be running Capco on the top line as hot as we have in the past. You can do that, but obviously it comes with a margin sacrifice. So we're just very focused on the right type of engagements and having Capco perform the purpose that it was designed when we did the acquisition.","But we're pleased where the business is today. We've got a very strong team running that business today and some really good engagements going on.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then just the Brexit. Could you guys hit on the Brexit thoughts?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I think we're still early on Brexit. Obviously Article 50 could be filed into Q1 next year. They've got up to two years. There's still a lot of uncertainty of what this is going to mean. Typically, as we've said in the past, regulatory change has typically been a tailwind for FIS of significance, but it's still too early to know what the impact is going to be.","But as we start watching for it, our Consulting business will be the early indicator. So we'll continue to monitor that closely. Given the long term nature and reoccurring nature, mission-critical nature of our software products, you'll see less impact short term in that area.","So we'll continue to monitor it very closely, but we still got some time before we will know the answer to that question.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And next we go to a question from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hey, guys. Nice job.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. I just had a couple numbers questions. The first one is in the Banking and Payments part of GFS you talked about the Sainsbury, the one-time fee for converting them. Is that the difference really between I think you had a 11% growth in Banking and Payments and normally you grow kind of mid-single digits. Is that maybe 6% difference or so the amount of that conversion fee in rough terms?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","No, if you look at Banking and Payments at 11%, if you exclude the Sainsbury one-time fee we grew 8%. So solid growth in Asia-Pacific as we've talked about with some of the wins in the India market and then continued revenue growth in Brazil despite the macro economy. So I would say we have a very good quarter in terms of Banking and Payments within the GFS segment even excluding the Sainsbury one-time fee.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got you. That's great. And then I guess the second one is, you talked about the synergies exiting this year over $200 million and exiting next year over $250 million what's the way though to think about the in-year synergies this year and next year, is it something like $120 million this year and $220 million next year? I'm just trying to think about how much kind of incremental we get next year for the in-year synergies.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","The in-year, next year, I would say probably in that zone, Dave, more of our synergies in 2017 are probably back half than front half as we've got some particular conversion dates and cutover dates. But, I think that's reasonable in how to think about it.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Well, nice job in a tough environment.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks so much, Dave.","Operator","And next we go to the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Woody or Gary if you could maybe start off on the discretionary bank spending environment? You mentioned it's challenging, it's clear from all the data points that things are difficult out there, but maybe give us a sense of what you're seeing out there, any differences between the larger banks, and the medium and smaller-size banks at this point in terms of spending intentions? And can you maybe talk specifically about the SunGard business and the trading license revenues and whether you have confidence that will recover in Q4?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Jim, why don't I start with some of the macroeconomic issues, will let Woody chime in as well. If you look across the entire banking industry, right, we're seeing very consistent regulatory demand and changes with increases that are driving in the whole area of risk and compliance. We'll continue to see those businesses be a tailwind within FIS. We continue to see the need for our clients to drive more cost out of the structure.","So as Woody highlighted we're seeing a trend that our license fees are consistently going to be pressured because more and more of our customers don't want to license the software, they want to outsource it to process in our environments to help lower their overall cost, which is a very good outcome. When you get to discretionary spending specifically, because of those two fundamental demands, financial institutions are looking for ways especially in the area when they've got something that's truly discretionary in nature, of lowering those dollars to free up those dollars to invest in something that's nondiscretionary such as risk, such as compliance, such as modernizing their digital platforms et cetera. So we're seeing that money get moved around in the ecosystem, just based on those headwinds. Woody, anything you want to add?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. With regard to the growth, we had a large license renewal in 2015 in the third quarter. That didn't recur in the third quarter of 2016, but we absolutely anticipate growth in the Institutional and Wholesale to be higher in the fourth quarter, as we talked about in the commentary from last quarter, and still believe that we're in that 4% to 5% zone.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe as we look into the future, clearly there's been a lot of discussion about real-time inter-bank payments with the launch of Zelle recently. Can you maybe talk about how you're planning to participate in that, and whether that could actually be a revenue generator for you next year?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Jim, it's a great question. We will participate in Zelle; we'll certainly be exposing a lot of our clients to that opportunity. We talked a lot about real-time payments on this call in the past. We certainly have what I would consider a multitenant approach. We're not sure that one size is going to fit all for all of our clients, and so \u2013 but certainly Zelle will play a part of our strategy going forward.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","If you think about it, Jim, we don't anticipate Zelle to be a significant driver of revenue growth for us in 2017.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Not in 2017.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","If it becomes a significant revenue driver, we would call it out. We don't anticipate that to be a significant driver in 2017.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we have a question from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just want to ask about the license fees. Is there a way to quantify that, just to see the impact of what it was year-over-year?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I would tell you, license fees were down about $10 million year-over-year in terms of the timing of renewals. We did about $80 million of license fees in Q3 of 2016, and about $90 million on an adjusted combined basis in 2015.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then the EMV card production \u2013 I think you guys are saying it's going to soften a little bit, obviously, with kind of the big spike taking place \u2013 or the bigger spike taken place already. Just trying to quantify that impact. Does it actually decrease sequentially? Or how do I think about that impact for the EMV card production?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","To be clear, it just makes growth more difficult. The volumes of EMV issuance themselves continue to grow, but the year-over-year impact in terms of the growth percentage becomes more difficult in terms of comparables.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Exactly.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We issued about 12 million cards this quarter from an EMV perspective, and would anticipate that level going forward.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, I know we'll get more details going into next year, but just thinking about the Analyst Day and the three-year outlook \u2013 I think it was a 2016 to 2018 outlook that you guys laid out. I know there's some moving pieces with the macro environment, but just wanted to see if there's any kind of high-level changes to that outlook that you guys laid out at the Investor Day?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","None whatsoever. Feel very good about how IFS is producing. It'll be above midpoint of that guide for the full year. GFS will be in that midpoint of the range for the full year, is our anticipation, with probably higher margin expansion than we originally anticipated. This being partially offset by lower growth in our Corporate and Other that I highlighted will continue to be a headwind for us.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Super. Thanks for answering my questions.","Operator","And next we go to the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Morning, Glenn.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","First question \u2013 I think you may have touched on it, Woody, but adjusting for the moving parts and the license fees and the Institutional Wholesale, it sounds like SunGard is still sort of growing in that 4% to 5% and you're comfortable with that? I guess more importantly, is that the expectation we should be thinking about beyond 2016 still? Or anything that's changed there?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","To answer your first question, if you normalize timing, I&W for the quarter was about 4%. It's about 4% for the full year. We underwrote the deal at probably 3.5%, so it's performing better than we underwrote the deal, as Gary mentioned, and feel good about that level of growth.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, on the margin side \u2013 and I'm not sure if the question makes more sense from a GFS margin perspective or overall \u2013 but my thinking is, you had higher incentive accruals, lower term fees. You had a $10 million timing on the license fees, yet you still put up, I'm sure relative to most people's expectations, above-expected margins. And I think you also called out on the second quarter call not to expect a lot of cost synergies in the third quarter, that it would be fourth quarter-weighted. So maybe you could help us understand how you got such margin expansion?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. If there was a non-expected item, it would be greater synergies than we anticipated.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Absolutely.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","The teams are very focused on it, as we've talked about throughout the year, and certainly happy with the results on the synergy side right now. Obviously, being able to upgrade that a couple of times this year.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. And just to build on that, Woody hit it, Glenn, earlier on an earlier call, but the structural improvement in GFS to the percentage of our revenue truly tied to a software solution now, whether it's on an outsource or a license basis. With synergies \u2013 a lot of those synergies coming in GFS, the incremental margins on those dollars being produced are just higher, and we're seeing that.","So, as Woody talked about in his prepared remarks, we're now \u2013 if you remember when we started off this year, we were thinking that we could get GFS from a low 21%, 22% margin business up to that 27%, 28% margin business. Now it looks like will be exiting the year at 30%. So you can see where the synergies are falling and then that place to the contribution going forward as our revenue, while revenue growth continues in that market, it's continuing now in software solutions instead of services-based solutions. So that structural transformation is significant for us.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Just one quick one. The Sainsbury's, it sounded like it ramped at the end of the third quarter. Putting aside the one-time benefit, are we sort of fully ramped on Sainsbury? Or could it be a potentially be a meaningful tailwind going forward?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No. It's a great outcome to the implementation of Sainsbury. The team did a phenomenal job getting that bank converted. We've talked a lot about the history of it. We've got another phase of implementation that'll be coming on next year which the team feels very good about, but you've got now a decade-long processing agreement that, as Sainsbury continues to grow and expand the business, we will benefit of that as our unit times rate continues to accelerate. So we feel great about the long-term relationship and the outcome of this engagement.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the license sales, you mentioned the secular shift to processing which you've said in the past, but I'm just curious. When we're thinking about NPV, are you still on a positive position there when you get a processing deal in lieu of a license deal? Just trying to understand the trade-off of revenue versus profits over the life of a contract.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Certainly you're making sure you're at a NPV-positive position on it. But customers are looking at more of an outsourcing solution versus some of the license model. I don't think that turns overnight. I think that's a multi-year transition but we are certainly starting to see it. I think the derivatives utility is a perfect example of that, where we're seeing first two customers actually come on and convert. As we continue to put more clients on that platform you'll see additional scale over time, a lot like you saw the transition in the IFS group over the past decade.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","That's exactly where I was going to go, Woody. I mean we've seen this transition before. This takes years and years to complete. We'll continue to see extremely high renewal rates on our licensing clients; we'll continue to see new deals in licensing. This doesn't happen overnight. But as we continue to see growth in the processing business, it'll be a very positive long-term outcome. You'll see our overall reoccurring revenue percentages of GFS continue to accelerate. You can look at IFS now in the upper 80s percent. So, but it will take years for this to transition.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And then on the debit wins, are those processing and switching? Are you doing something differently there? It seems like we've seen some pick-up in growth from the non-Visa\/MasterCard players.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. A lot of that growth has been in fraud processing, Tien-Tsin.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We've got a really, really good product there and I've seen some wins.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Absolutely.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Last one. On PSD2, I don't think it has been asked. But if it was, just tell me. But just the opportunities and risks there. I would think with assets like Clear2Pay and some of the others, you might see more opportunities. I'm just going to understand if there could be a measurable impact on the PSD2 in the midterm here, maybe in 2017. Any comments there?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No. We're not-we don't see that is going to make a significant impact. I will tell you, you highlighted Clear2Pay specifically continues to do well and so continues to be a nice growth engine for us. But no real commentary on that.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Tientsin.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, our last question is from the line of Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Paul.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess I'd just follow up on some of the commentary around CapEx and near-term investments and I'm curious if you can give us some more detail. And was that an opportunity that maybe, with the synergies tracking the way they are, you decided to move into? Or had that always kind of been part of the plan?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, I mean, let me first start at a high level, Paul, and then let Woody get into the details. But, keep in mind, as we accelerate these synergies, there's capital involved in those. As we select enterprise systems, and we move all of former SunGard to a common payroll system, for example, common human capital system for FIS, these come at a capital cost. And we were always planning on that but as we accelerate these synergies, right, you're going to see an accelerated need for capital. So it's all a positive outcome from our perspective. But, I also don't want to trivialize there's a lot of things that we're excited about in the industry highlighted one but there's some great opportunities to make some investments into our products to continue to maintain the growth, accelerate the growth in some areas and generate the profits we're looking for and our shareholders are looking for. So we don't think it's going to be something \u2013 you're never going to see this capital accelerate significantly, but as I said, we'll be running right around 6.5% for the year.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes. This is not a significant shift forward, but does come at a slight change in depreciation that we just wanted to call out so everybody's models get accurate.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. And then would the 6.5% also be next year? And then on the interest, it looks like $112 million or so in the fourth quarter. Is that the run rate next year? Or is there some kind \u2013 are there any kind of one-time interest costs in the fourth quarter just from the refinance?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","No, the interest cost is more of a normal run rate. You can look at the refinancing that we did with the rates on the individual bonds and do the math on that one. But it'll certainly flow into 2017. With regard to the capital, we are not given a guide on 2017, we're right in the middle of the planning process right now. I think the really thing to stay in mind is we're comfortable with the revenue and profitability guide back from May that we outline.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Peter Gunnlaugsson - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We are pleased that you could join us today. Thank you for your questions and continued interest in FIS. The market and our clients continue to react very positively to our expanded ability to serve the breadth and depth of their needs. This is evidenced in our results year-to-date.

Frank. ","Frank Martire","Thank you Nancy and welcome to the FIS team. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. 2013 proved to be another very strong year for FIS. We again drove consistent execution against our targets and delivered solid returns to our shareholders. I am proud of the progress we are making to execute this strategy we outlined in February 2012. ","We continue to build global scale in 2013, finishing the year with record revenue of $6.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.83. We generated $1.2 billion operating cash flow and free cash flow of $826 million. We are delivering on our commitments. ","Additionally organic revenue growth of 5% came in at the high end of our guidance range. This marks our third consecutive year delivering organic growth of 5%. We grew earnings per share by 13% to $2.83, which was the midpoint of the EPS guidance that we gave you in October, resulting in a five year compound annual growth rate of 14%. ","In addition, our continued sales success included multiple deals in the large North American and global financial markets. We finished the year on strong footing with a robust pipeline and good visibility heading into 2014. ","Also consistent with the strategy we outlined last February, we are using our significant cash flow to drive value for our clients and our investors. First we continue to invest for growth; second, we strengthen our balance sheet achieving our leverage target and investment grad ratings from all three rating agencies; third, we returned $732 million to our shareholders or approximately 90% of our free cash flow. We remain focused on returning cash through a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend and the new $2 billion share repurchase program. ","All of these actions reflect the confidence we have in our business and underscore our commitment to further enhancing shareholder returns. By all accounts, 2013 was another successful year. ","The success of our company ties directly to our employees\u2019 hard work and dedication to service our clients. For that I want to personally thank our leadership team and our 39,000 employees worldwide. I also would like to thank our loyal clients who depend on us and trust us to keep their businesses running every day. It is because of our clients and employees that FIS continues to rank as the number one FinTech Company in the world. ","Now I will turn the call over to Gary for our business strategy and operating highlights. Gary. ","Gary Norcross","Thanks Frank and thanks for joining us this morning. My remarks today will cover the following important aspects of our 2013 performance and our focus in 2014. First I will cover our global sales performance, emphasizing our execution and providing examples of continued demand for our breadth of solutions. Next, I\u2019ll provide visibility to how and where we are investing in 2014 to accelerate our growth. ","As Frank discussed, 2013 was the year of strategic progress and strong financial results. Our client focus strategy in growth investments are driving the desired results and creating positive momentum. The financial services industry continues along the path of fundamental change that includes connecting businesses and consumers together through new digital channels, providing instant access to information and commerce and managing vast transaction and dollar flow, while preserving data integrity and information security. ","This change brings enormous challenges for financial institutions and significant opportunities for FIS as their strategic partner, helping to redesign and operate their businesses more efficiently. ","FIS is enabling this transformation by bringing the front office and back office together, streamlining banking and payments and creating a more agile, more intelligent and more efficient business model for financial institutions. We are doing this by delivering a variety of offerings from our broad and deep portfolio of technology, consulting and outsource solutions and services. This winning strategy propelled our growth in 2013 and is the underpinning of our strategic focus in 2014. ","Turning to sales, we saw strong year-over-year in sequential sales growth in the fourth quarter. We continue to add new clients and expand existing relationships through cross sell and up sell activity. This continues to trend resulting in more expensive engagements and longer contract terms. ","Next I\u2019ll provide highlights for each of our three key markets; North America, international and global. Beginning with our international business, given their accelerated progress again this quarter, we are very pleased with the continued momentum in our international businesses. Our revenue growth accelerated to 13% in the quarter, for the full year our international business grew by 11% to $1.3 billion in revenue, which is further evidence of our credibility and ability to gain scale in the markets that we serve. This position has allowed us to consistently produce double-digit compound annual revenue growth over the last five years in our international business. ","Looking forward, we executed well against our sales plan and remain encouraged with the ongoing strength and quality of the international sales pipeline. The change in market dynamics is driving growth opportunities, particularly in India, Southeast Asia and parts of Europe. We continue to see increased opportunities around long term outsourcing arrangements, which provide more predictable revenue streams. ","Our focus on retail banking and payments has created an unequal brand in the market. In Europe I am pleased to report that we have finalized the contract with Sainsbury Bank, solidifying a 10-year agreement for a fully outsourced FIS solution. This very large deal creates significant reoccurring revenue and is a model for other banks in the region seeking to leverage our full breadth of outsourced solutions. ","In India we are very excited about out partner relationship with BMB, a new public sector bank empowering woman as entrepreneurs, which opened its first branches to the public in the fourth quarter. This represents another outsourcing win for FIS. Under this contract FIS provides a solution for the bank covering all their technology needs, from processing through network and branch infrastructure. We feel this win is important, because India has announced the potential issuance of more banking licenses and the success of BMB should help FIS with these additional opportunities. ","Turning to Latin American, FIS successfully completed the deployment of the credit card management solution for Banco Popular in the Dominican Republic. Through this successful implementation, FIS is now processing over one million credit cards for this customer. ","In Brazil, as we announced in Q1, the signing of Cencosud, a market leader in supermarket and retail, we are pleased to announce that we successfully implemented this outsourced card processing arrangement. This continues to drive further diversification by adding new clients to our Brazilian joint venture. ","In North America we see continued demand for our full range of solutions as clients prioritize spending around operating more efficiently, garnering more wallet share for their customers and managing regulatory compliance. We continue to deepen our relationships with community financial institutions such as U.S. Century Bank, offering new and needed services such as digital banking and payment solutions and infrastructure management. ","Among the large financial institutions where platform architecture is more complex and requires a higher degree of customization, we continue to see activity around core platform enhancements, including an expanded services relationship for solution integration for Capital One. ","Additionally, our mobile business showed significant growth in 2013 on all dimensions. We implemented more than 280 new clients to our mobile platform in 2013 and have a backlog of more than 150 additional institutions due to be implemented in the first half of 2014. This brings the total number of FIS mobile clients to more than 1,300 financial institutions, which is a 22% increase over prior year. ","Mobile active end users grew 36% to $24 million. We also received strong third party validation of our mobile solutions through numerous awards, including winning 2013 Best in Class Mobile Banking Vendor Overall by both Javelin Strategy & Research and CEB TowerGroup. ","Additionally we saw significant press coverage for our mobile solutions, especially our new Cardless Cash Access solution and Mobile Wallet. Based on this momentum and recognition, we believe 2014 will be another very strong year for our mobile banking business. ","We also saw strong year-over-year growth in bill payment adoption, including more than 140 new implementations with more than 70 currently in process with implementation. We are pleased by several significant wins in Q4, including a large channel partner who will sell our bill payment solution to more than 600 member institutions. Additionally, we are also excited to add a large $15 billion mid-tier financial institution as a new bill payment client. ","In our global financial institution market, we see continued demand for large transformational outsourcing deals that\u2019s cost containment, regulatory pressures and front to back office transformation continues to dominate our client\u2019s agendas. In Q4 two Tier I global financial institutions outsourced their program management function to FIS. This includes an expansion of the project, which we discussed during last February\u2019s investor update. For both engagements FIS will provide access to strategic business processes and technology change experts. Each of these very large deals entails a multi-year engagement. ","Next, moving on to how and where we are investing for growth in 2014. First based on the success we have seen in 2013, and the opportunities we see with global financial institutions, we are investing an incremental $30 million in 2014 to accelerate growth in this market. As you are aware, the majority of the IT spends comes from the largest global institutions. To capitalize on this opportunity, we are adding new global client partners, sales and client implementation support teams, as well as client centered marketing investments. ","These dedicated client teams will bring highly valuable and differentiated offers to the global financial institutions. We believe this incremental investment will better position FIS to capitalize on the opportunity in this market and be a catalyst to further promote top line growth. ","Second, we will continue to invest in solution innovation to further expand our client value proposition to drive new opportunities for growth. This includes investments into existing solutions, into early stage companies and by incubating an early stage exploratory consulting service that focuses on the disruptive technologies that are changing with the financial services industry to define new business models with our customers. We currently have several of these client initiatives underway through our innovation centers around the world. ","In summary, before I turn it over to Woody, we are execution on our strategy to optimize performance and drive organic revenue growth. We delivered on our financial commitments in 2013 and we delivered consistently strong performance over the last five years during a very challenging environment for our clients. ","2013 was another strong year of sales performance, underscored by large deal signings and new client implementations that are transformational in nature. We have strong momentum and visibility heading into 2014. We continue to strategically invest in key markets, in innovative solutions to drive profitable growth. ","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Woody for the financial report. ","Woody Woodall","Thanks Gary. I\u2019ll begin on slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and the full year 2013. In the fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 5% on a reported and organic basis after normalizing for currency and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $487 million and the EBITDA margin remained strong at 30.8% compared to 31.4% in the prior year quarter, reflecting continued growth in consulting and services revenue and increased corporate expenses. ","Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $222 million from $201 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.76 from $0.68 from the 2012 quarter. ","For the year, revenue increased 5% on a reported and organic basis to $6.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% to $1.84 billion. EBITDA margin of 30.2% was slightly favorable to the prior year. The margin reflects that change in revenue mix resulting from strong growth in consulting and services and increased corporate expenses include sales and marketing, healthcare and continued investment in security and risk. ","Adjusted earnings per share rose 13% to $2.83 per share, which is at the mid-point of the EPS guidance we provided in October. These results include a negative foreign currency impact of $0.02 for the year, including a $0.01 impact in the fourth quarter. ","Next I will continue on slide 12 with the review of segment results for the fourth quarter. Financial Solutions revenue grew 4% to $604 million in the fourth quarter, driven by growth in consulting and digital delivery channels. Financial Solutions EBITDA increased 1% to $240 million in the fourth quarter. EBITDA margin remained strong at approximately 40% down from 41% in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher consulting and services revenue. ","Turning to slide 13, Payment Solutions revenue increased 3% to $618 million, and 4% excluding the check businesses, reflecting growth in electronic payments including debit, credit and network solutions. We continue to see an improving stability in the check related businesses, which totaled $110 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to $115 million in the prior year. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 7% to $262 million in the quarter and the margin increased 150 basis points to 42.4%, driven primarily by growth on our leverage platforms. ","Now I'll cover our International business on slide 14. Organic revenue growth in our International business accelerated to 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by double-digit growth in Latin America and continued growth in Europe and Asia. Strong sales execution, implementation of deals previously sold and ongoing demand for consulting and services contribute to this strong performance. ","International EBITDA increased 11% to $99 million for the fourth quarter. EBITDA margin was 27.7% comparable to the prior year, reflecting continued strong demand for consulting and professional services, increased processing revenue, partially offset by lower license revenue. Corporate expense was $114 million in the quarter, up $12 million from the prior year period, primarily driven by increased sales and marketing expense and higher healthcare costs. ","Moving on to our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP EPS on slide 15, GAAP earnings totaled $0.26 per share compared to $0.49 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012. GAAP results are adjusted to exclude $0.35 for the previously announced charge for acquisition related earn-out and incentive plans resulting from Capco\u2019s consistently improving performance and growth prospects as outlined in the 8-K filed on December 20. This charge reflects the final settlement and amendment of the Capco earn-out and incentive plan provisions. ","Fourth quarter results also exclude $0.13 per share in acquisition related purchase amortization and $0.02 per share in cost actions related to the rightsizing of our labor force in Germany. These costs are over and above normal course of business workforce reductions due to the unique nature of separation cost in the German labor market. ","Moving on to cash flow on slide 16, adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $431 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Capital expenditures totaled $98 million or approximately 6.2% of revenue, primarily reflecting increased investment in growth initiatives. This brings us to free cash flow of $334 million in the quarter, compared to $365 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. ","For the year, adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $336 million or 5.5% of revenue, resulting in free cash flow of $826 million, which is consistent with our guidance for free cash flow conversion to approximate adjusted net earnings. ","The year-over-year decrease in free cash flow primarily reflected lower cash tax payments in 2012. Our use of the cash flow during 2013 was consistent with our capital allocation priorities of investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. ","As shown on slide 17, we returned approximately $191 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, including $65 million in dividends and $126 million in share repurchases. We repurchased 2.5 million shares in the open market at an average cost of $50.73 per share. For the year we repurchased 10.7 million shares for approximately 4% of the outstanding shares, at a cost of approximately $476 million or $44.58 per share. ","The share repurchase program drove the decrease in our weighted average diluted share account to $294.2 million in 2013 from $297.5 million last year. At the end of the quarter basic shares outstanding were $288.2 million. Debt outstanding totaled $4.5 billion as of December 31. The weighted average interest rate was 4% at year-end. Total debt to EBITDA was 2.4 times, which is in line with our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of at or slightly below 2.5 times. ","Moving on to slide 18, I will discuss our outlook for 2014. We expect recorded and organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, driven by accelerated growth in international and continued strong demand for consulting and services. ","We anticipate EBITDA growth in line with revenue growth. This includes approximately $30 million of planned incremental investment, to take advantage of opportunities in the global financial institution market, which Gary mentioned earlier on the call. We believe the additional investment, which we are modeling to occur ratably throughout 2014, will enable us to accelerate our revenue growth. We expect to maintain strong EBITDA margin comparable to 2013. ","As a reminder, termination fees in 2013 were skewed more heavily in the first half of the year and will create difficult revenue and profit comparisons in the first and second quarters of 2014. We\u2019re anticipating the effective tax rate to be in the range of 33% to 34%, compared to 32% in 2013. ","As a reminder, the 2013 rate benefited from favorable resolution of tax items and R&D tax credits. We expect 2014 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.05 to $3.16, which is an 80% to 12% increase over 2013. To be clear, this range includes $0.07 of incremental investment related to the global financial institution market. ","We expect free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. Planned uses of cash in 2014 are consistent with our existing capital allocation priorities, including reinvesting 5.5% to 6% of revenue in CapEx, maintaining debt-to-EBITDA at or slightly below 2.5 times and pursing tuck-in acquisition to augment our existing capabilities.","In addition as Frank noted, our board recently approved a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.24 per share and offered us a new $2 billion share repurchase plan, which replaces the existing plan. Consistent with recent practice, we anticipate share repurchases to occur throughout the course in 2014.","In summary, we are very pleased with our 2013 financial performance and consistent execution of our strategy. We are optimistic about our revenue growth and opportunities based on new client signings in 2013, combined with a strong pipeline headed in 2014. We remain focused on driving EPS growth and creating value for our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we can now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc.","Thank you. Good morning Frank and Woody.","Frank Martire","Good morning Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc.","So pretty solid revenue growth and guidance. Can you help bridge the gap between, lets say middle of the range, 5.5% revenue growth, which is certainly above expectations and the middle of the range, say 10% EPS growth. You announced the new expanded buy back. How much of that gap is buy back versus it sounds like there isn\u2019t much debt paid down, margin expansion, and in terms of margin expansion, how much of a drag should the term fee impact from last year be in first half versus second half?","Frank Martire","Yes Ashwin, thanks. I\u2019ll hit the last question first. If you remember, term fees were weighted about 70% in the first half with the term fees related to BMO about 70% in the first half compared to 30% in the back half. So if you take our $40 million term fee we disclosed, we\u2019re looking at $28 million in the first half of the year as a tough comp. ","In terms of looking at the composition of EBIDA versus EPS growth, first and foremost the investment is about $0.07 to be clear. So without that investment we\u2019re looking at more of a 10% to 14% type EPS growth and that investment is about 50 basis points of margin. But bridging all the way down the EPS growth, your seeing us buy I guess $400 million, $450 million and $475 million over the last three years in terms of share buy backs. Leaving our debt at or around 2.5 times, not de-leveraging any further, you could see that increasing some what is our plan for 2014 in terms of share buy back.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc.","Okay, got it. So, just wanted to delve a little bit deeper into that $0.07 of investment. These types of investments obviously, while the impact is positive, they tend to rarely be one time in nature, because its ongoing you\u2019re always investing in something. Is there a reason you are calling out that $0.07 of investment this time around? Is it related to any specific contract? I know the opportunity is very large, so it\u2019s the right thing to do, but could you provide more details.","Gary Norcross","Yes, now Ashwin, this is Gary. I think that\u2019s a great question. If you look at the success that we\u2019re having with global financial institutions and frankly just look at the historic success of FIS, as we build traction in that market, as we\u2019ve seen capital come on and penetrate the consulting services business and gain more share in that space and the success we\u2019ve had there. ","As we\u2019ve gotten some of the signing as I highlighted two Tier I signings in Q4, we\u2019re just very bullish on that market and see a very unique opportunity, and so based on that confidence that we\u2019ve had from the past, we thought it was time to increase our go-to-market staff there. So you\u2019ll see us adding people around global client partners, which in building out teams that we can square off against these very large financial institutions more effectively, because we think there\u2019s other opportunities these that we\u2019re just not getting.","Obviously as Woody talked about earlier, there\u2019s some mix issues as we see that, but we\u2019re very confident that not only do we get strong revenue growth, we get strong EBITDA production through these engagements as well. ","So the reason why we\u2019re carving it out, it is an additional investment that\u2019s not typical for us. We\u2019ve waited to see us getting some traction and with that traction, with that confidence and with the opportunity, we think now is the time to invest more people to go square off on some of those sales engagements and we readily expect as you know, this should push our growth higher, and if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll actually pull down the investment. But we feel confident that there\u2019s enough opportunity there that we can growth this market.","Woody Woodall","The last is based on a couple of things. I think Gary just summarized it really nice. It\u2019s the impact of the sales we\u2019ve seen, that track record we\u2019ve had. What is important is the pipeline we see in front of us.","Frank Martire","An opportunity.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc.","Yes, now it\u2019s clearly understood. One clarification if I may; I got the $0.01 negative FX impact in 4Q, is there \u2013 I missed what the FX forward impact in 2014, what\u2019s your assumption?","Frank Martire","We\u2019ve kind of outlined organic growth, so we pulled out the FX on the revenue. To the extent we\u2019ve got impact on the EPS line, a significant attachment, we\u2019ll call it out on the individual call versus trying to give you any kind of headlights on that right now.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc.","Right. No, it makes sense. Thank you guys, congratulations.","Frank Martire","Thanks.","Woody Woodall","Thanks Ashwin.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brett Huff of Stephens Inc.; please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","Good morning guys.","Frank Martire","Good morning Brett.","Woody Woodall","Good morning Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","Congrats on some good momentum here. Just two questions from me; Gary you called out a few things; the finalization at Sainsbury, the new India bank deal, a couple of large program management deals and I think you used the term very large on all of them. Can you give us a sense; I think your policy is anything over $25 million TCV is called out. Where do these things stand relative to that, if you can give us additional color?","Woody Woodall","It\u2019s a great question Brett and you know we typically stay away from sizing individual deals. We certainly sized the India ATM deal as $500 million, at the time we disclosed that. These are very large, they are much larger than the $25 million in size. ","Sainsbury as you would imagine ramps up over a period of time, because it\u2019s a very large implementation as we convert it onto all of our products and services, but all of these that I mentioned are much larger than the $25 million in size, so they are very good deals for us.","Frank Martire","And Brett I think the thing that\u2019s happening here is what we talked about on our last few calls. As we went back a few years we used to talk about one or two large deals, now we talk about you know 10, 15, 20 significantly sized deals that are in our pipeline.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","Okay, and then just to put a finer point on the investment, I want to make sure I get it. So this is \u2013 and Gary I think you answered it this way. It sounds like its mostly people and it sounds like its mostly \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you call them sales or maybe business development or those kind of teams that are trying to figure out how you all can help some of these big FI\u2019s; is that the right way to think about it?","Frank Martire","Yes, so if you think about it Brett, we\u2019ve identified a number of financial institutions that fall in this category for us. Obviously there is actually more than what we put in this past quarter, but we think there\u2019s about 30 institutions that we can truly square off against some of these opportunities and win new business, and so what we\u2019re building at is dedicated teams for some of these financial institutions that we weren\u2019t serving throughout the year. ","I mean we were trying to serve them through the leverage teams, and what we\u2019ve realized is really building out a robust team that can dedicate it to one of these global financial institutions; that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to find the opportunity. You\u2019re going to start with typically some type of transformational consulting engagement. That will typically follow on like what we mentioned with some large program management opportunities and then you\u2019re going to follow on with products and services as we\u2019ve seen with the success at Sainsbury. ","So we think the model works very well. We\u2019ve proven that model throughout 2013. When we look at the opportunity across those institutions, the need to build out some more dedicated teams just makes sense. ","So to Ashwin\u2019s point earlier, it is a one-time, meaning it\u2019s a one-time ramp, but these are going to be ongoing calls for these dedicated teams. Of course as we get success across these other institutions, don\u2019t be surprised when we come back and build out additional teams for other larger institutions we\u2019re not serving. But we\u2019re very confident and bullish that there\u2019s an opportunity here and that we need to go put up the teams in place to go get some of that opportunity.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","Great, that\u2019s what I needed. Congrats again. Thanks guys.","Frank Martire","Thank you, yeah.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Dave Koning of Baird; please go ahead.","Dave Koning - Robert W. Baird","Yes, hey guys, nice momentum.","Frank Martire","Thanks Dave.","Woody Woodall","Thanks Dave.","Dave Koning - Robert W. Baird","Yes, and I guess my first question is just mobile. You mentioned quite a bit of success in the mobile channel and a couple of things there, that is within the financial segment if I remember right and maybe how big in terms of total revenue is that?","Frank Martire","Yes, we haven\u2019t disclosed total revenue around that Dave. What I can tell you is, it\u2019s not a giant contributor at this point, but it\u2019s growing very rapidly right now. So again, we haven\u2019t disclosed a particular dollar amount, but the growth profile is extremely exciting.","Woody Woodall","Yes David, I wouldn\u2019t call the number yet meaningful, but I would say to you the potential and the opportunity is very meaningful, that\u2019s what we see.","Gary Norcross","Yes, at its current course and speed. I mean it will be a very major contributor to our overall top line and bottom line and it is within the financial segment and does show the traction that we\u2019re just getting in North America and frankly building on the strength of the mFoundry acquisition. ","So that\u2019s turned out to be a phenomenal acquisition for us, the integration back into our channel delivery strategies has worked very, very well and we\u2019re just thinking it\u2019s a great momentum there. But it\u2019s going to be a big contributor for us, there\u2019s no question.","Dave Koning - Robert W. Baird","Okay, great. And secondly just corporate class, you mentioned they were up again in Q4. I think for the full year they might have been up about 15% or so. Is that something now that\u2019ll kind of baseline into 2014 or do you expect that to keep growing pretty fast?","Frank Martire","No, we expect that to be effectively flat to 2013 and \u201914; that will be sort of the expected number. You saw a ramp up continuing in security and risk in 2013, which was the primary driver of that major growth component for the full year. We did see some increases in per-claim costs in our healthcare area in the back half of the year, but we believe that\u2019s really more of a normal area. We expect corporate costs to be effectively flat.","Dave Koning - Robert W. Baird","Okay great, and then my final question. Just the deal signings have been really strong. I\u2019m wondering, is there a kind of a timing throughout the year of revenue growth ramps or acceleration or do you expect growth to be pretty stable throughout the year.","Frank Martire","No, again, as we talked about the difficult costs, we\u2019ve got some challenging comps in the first half of the year and believe a combination of the removal of those difficult comps, combined with some acceleration of these signings, revenue growing will be higher in the back half of the year this year.","Woody Woodall","As you know Dave, I mean you know this business well. That\u2019s why we highlighted Cencosud on the call. You know we signed that in Q1, we implemented it in Q4. That\u2019s about as aggressive as you can get with these large transactions, so there\u2019s typically a ramp of anywhere from nine to 18 months, to bring these online. The India ATM deal was longer just given the scope, but a lot of these will be contributors in the first and the second half.","Dave Koning - Robert W. Baird","Sounds good, thanks. Great job.","Frank Martire","Thanks.","Woody Woodall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays; please go ahead.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Thanks guys. ","Frank Martire","Good morning Darrin.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Great, good morning everybody. So, just a first question on the buyback plan, I mean obviously a fairly material increase. But you said earlier, I think you bought back about half of what your authorization was last year and now with the $2 billion authorization. I mean are we talking about a pretty aggressive year of buy back with \u2013 I mean can you give us a sense of what percentage of authorization we should be looking for.","Frank Martire","Well, we haven\u2019t really guided specifically to the dollar amounts in here, but you can see over the past three years our default use of cash has been share buyback. Should we find some M&A activity that\u2019s accretive in nature and very strategic to us, we could do some of that, but again our default use is share buy back. ","You couple that with leaving our leverage at 2 to 2.5 or slightly below 2.5, with EBITDA growth we could potentially take on some debt to maintain our leverage profile, but we\u2019ll buy shares ratably. The buy back was over 40 years, so if you do that ratably, that\u2019s a 500 million range or so and we\u2019ll continue to take out option dilution as well, so.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","All right, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. One other question, on the international side, I mean obviously you\u2019re investing even more heavily in it now and we see the growth accelerating up to 13%, a pretty impressive rate. ","Can you just give us another sense of the drivers going on? What sort of secular shift you\u2019re seeing or how sustainable is this type of growth rate? I mean a little more specifics beyond just the consulting side and the Capco. Well, I mean Capco is a part of it, but a little more granularity would be helpful as to what we should really be looking for and what\u2019s driving it?","Woody Woodall","Yes Darrin, I think there\u2019s a couple of things. So first, I mean you got to look back historically. I mean we now had five consecutive years of very strong double-digit growth, compounded annual growth. So we\u2019re very confident we can keep this continued. ","Some of the things that\u2019s driving it actually, the consulting component is actually a relatively small piece. We are just seeing great movement and we will talk about it on prior calls, tremendous movement towards our solutions and capabilities, especially on an outsourcing basis. ","So you\u2019ve seen three or four years ago a much heavier license component and much more discreet independent decision, today you are seeing the Sainsbury bank moving pretty much everything they have across core banking and payments on a full-on outsourcing basis. ","You know those kind of deals didn\u2019t occur three or four years ago. You\u2019re seeing the India ATM, which is a huge ATM payment outsourcing engagement and then you continue to see our growth in Latin America. So what\u2019s happening is these larger financial institutions within these countries, and as we talked on prior calls, we\u2019re very focused on a dozen very discreet countries where we\u2019re going deep in those countries by broadening our solution set in those. ","You\u2019re seeing them struggle under their own regulatory burdens. Frankly you are seeing them struggle on getting their cost out. Very similar to what we saw here in the U.S. and so for that they are turning and now starting to look for outsourcing opportunities and how to get on a product that\u2019s being built for many institutions that they can leverage, and so that\u2019s really the success of our growth. ","And the reason why we\u2019re bullish and feel good about the future in international is how robust the pipeline is. I mean when you look at the kind of deals the team\u2019s engaging against, as I said three years ago we\u2019re heavily license laden, now its almost all outsourcing. So that shift from license to outsourcing model has occurred much more rapid in the international markets than we thought, and it makes us much more confident. ","And it also makes us \u2013 frankly the nature of our business makes us much more immune to economic shifts that occur within these countries. These are critical applications that are required to keep the lights on. So at the end of the day, no matter what\u2019s going on in the economic, you got to process your payment transactions, you got to process your banking accounts and so we\u2019re confident about on what the future holds for us in these markets.","Frank Martire","You know here in the international growth we look at, Capco\u2019s been a great acquisition for us in consulting and it has done very well for us, but the international business stand alone has been incredibly successful for us over multiple years and that\u2019s why you hear so much optimism here. ","Gary Norcross","To add some color to that, license revenue in the fourth quarter of \u201913 was down 6%, revenue growth was 13%. So it\u2019s a combination of processing and outsourcing deals and consulting as well.","Frank Martire","Right, which is a model we prefer, obviously you get license fees, you get a much more spiky revenue and profit screen, but this give us a much more predictable, and frankly gives us good vision into what the future holds. ","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","All right, just this last question and I\u2019ll turn it back in the queue. In the domestic markets, I mean are we seeing the vendor consolidation that\u2019s really driving this and there\u2019s definitely been a lot more RFPs than we\u2019ve seen. Like you said earlier, at any point in the past few years. Again, is that just a consolidation phase going on, we\u2019re banks are thinking we prefer to use one or two or three vendors versus others or can you give us a little more color there and then I\u2019ll just turn back.","Frank Martire","I think what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. is financial institutions are coming out of the financial crisis of 2008. They\u2019ve weathered the storm. You see the number of closures have pretty much all gone away. So they\u2019ve worked through their loan issues and now they are focused on how do you get more efficient? How do you get more leverage and more platforms that allow them to compete in the market and so because of that what we\u2019re really seeing is not only in the largest banks, but all the way through the community banking market we are seeing a lot more RFPs, and I think its just a combination of weathering those storms and working through their own issues and now focusing on the future and all those drive great opportunities for us at FIS.","Woody Woodall","Darrin, they are looking to increase market share right and they are being aggressive about it and they know for a fact they needed more competitive products in order to be able to do that and that\u2019s why I think you see that increased activity also.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Very good. All right, thanks guys.","Frank Martire","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JP Morgan; please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase","Hi, great. Good morning. Just a few follow-ups to some of the questions that were asked, all good questions. We\u2019ve been hearing that there is a lot of inorganic opportunity, especially in Europe. I\u2019m curious if that is consistent with what you are seeing in terms of where you are investing and I\u2019m curious if your appetite to do acquisitions has changed, and if you\u2019d be willing to do something bigger than just a tuck-in.","Frank Martire","We are starting to see more opportunities out there Tien-tsin as we look around. Frankly, as you know we\u2019ve been very picky around what we look for. Frankly, it means to bring a new product and or service for an existing market we serve or break us into a new market. ","Do we have some more room? We\u2019ve done some tuck-in acquisitions throughout last year. Those have been very successful for us. Would we change our capital allocation policy? No. I mean we\u2019re very focused on keeping investment grade; we\u2019re very focused on as you see with the increase of our dividend of 9%, very focused on our share buy back in investing our solutions. ","But would we do something that is more medium sized, that had the right fit and could drive, a company faster? Sure, we would look at that, but we\u2019re really not in the market to just go buy overlapping product and services and troubled companies, that doesn\u2019t make sense for us.","We certainly have a lot of available cash in our international markets. As you pointed out, Europe, that\u2019s very tax efficient to be able to use it that way, but we\u2019re continuing with our very diligent approach to looking it up.","Woody Woodall","We talked to you a couple of years ago about being focused on organic growth and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen us do. We internalize, we\u2019ve stayed focused on our organic growth with some tuck-in acquisitions. You never say never to something that\u2019s large, right, but I think mid-tier and mid type acquisitions, some we may look at, but the reality is we\u2019ve been very focused on organic growth in the company and we\u2019re going to keep that focus.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase","Yes, this makes sense. So just in the global financial institution, this opportunity, so investing around the 30 institutions you\u2019re talking about, a couple of questions there. Is Capco aligned with some of those relationships, and who are you competing with on some of these? Is it different or is it mostly just an in-house going to outsource?","Frank Martire","It\u2019s a great question and honestly one that we\u2019re \u2013 when you look we\u2019ve been very pleased with the capital acquisition. It just couldn\u2019t have gone better for us from the standpoint of their growth, really pulling that up under. Rob Heyvaert is the founder of Capco. We\u2019re actually placing in him, placed our global financial institution business also up under Rob. So we see tremendous benefit as we pull the center of these together of the leading financial services consulting arm, with the leading product and services arm in the industry and so we do see some great opportunities there and those will naturally align. ","Do Capco have relationships in those institutions? Yes. FIS does as well and so that combination we think will really be positive for us.","Woody Woodall","We leverage our relationship both ways. ","Frank Martire","Absolutely yes.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase","And then the competition for those big, for the big ones?","Frank Martire","Well, competition would be the list of the usual suspects, so obviously we\u2019ve run into their centers of the world. We\u2019ve run into the large Indian firms, still run into in-house development organizations a lot, right, so the technology on the financial institutions that we\u2019re competing with. But as you can see in our recent success and signings, I mean we feel good about our capabilities, and keep in mind, the financial institutions are looking to bring not only their cost down, but being able to streamline their operations to compete more effectively and there is really no one better than FIS at doing that.","Woody Woodall","And we have a very unique opportunity with the combination of our services and our products as we bring it together.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase","Sure, sure. No, fingers crossed, you guys should get more than your share. Thank you.","Frank Martire","Thank you.","Woody Woodall","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Thank you. Good morning everyone. ","Frank Martire","Good morning. ","Woody Woodall","Good morning Glenn. ","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","First question is really just a clarification for Gary and sorry to parse words here, but just on the investment, you sort of talked about it both as a one-time investment and then an ongoing cost. So just clarity, are we going to see that 50 basis point margin drag go away or come back in \u201815?","Woody Woodall","I apologize, you\u2019re going to see a one-time ramp in resource and then obviously the resource will continue, but we expect that resource to drag some significant revenue opportunities for us. ","Frank Martire","Its incremental investment, \u201813 to \u201914, but those ongoing payroll dollars, etcetera, should be in our numbers. But we probably anticipate to get revenue growth from returns on those investments.","Woody Woodall","Absolutely. I think what we\u2019re saying is, we will manage it well. If we put incremental investment, its because we\u2019re seeing a nice return. If we decided to tone back the investment and pull it back a little bit because we are not being as successful as we thought we would be. But right now we are incredibly optimistic that we will be. ","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay, makes a lot of sense. And then on your long-term guidance, obviously the 12% to 15% CAGR through \u201815, just sort of looking at the midpoint of your range for \u201914, it kind of implies, if my math is right, about a 13% lift into \u201815 to get to the low end of the guide. Are you still confident in that 12% to 15% CAGR?","Gary Norcross","Yes, we\u2019re still confident in our 12% to 15% CAGR. Haven\u2019t adjusted anything on our long-term guidance. What we did do is to call out the margin expansion issue will be a little muted because of the specific investment. ","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay great, and then Woody, just it might be helpful if you could directionally sort of talk us through segment growth and margin expectations for \u201914 or should it look a lot like \u201813, with a pick obviously from the International and maybe from unit margins because of International?","Woody Woodall","Yes, I think I sill start around the international. You will see a continued acceleration of growth there. In our payments business you\u2019re still looking at sort of low to mid-single digits and then the FSG is sort of low to mid-single, mid-single digit kind of growth there, with some acceleration in the back half of the year. ","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","And then any commentary on margins? ","Woody Woodall","In terms of margins I would say, the consulting and services, the shift in the revenue and we\u2019ll continue to put some pressure in the FSG business in terms of margin. We believe we will get some expansion internationally and then payments continue to have very rich margins. ","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay great. Thanks a lot. ","Frank Martire","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank; please go ahead. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ","Yes hi, good morning. ","Frank Martire","Hey Bryan. ","Woody Woodall","Hey Bryan.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ","Just wanted to follow up on Glenn\u2019s questions there. On International, the acceleration of growth organic, I mean can that get up to mid to high teens or where do you guys think that goes, especially as we go into next year and then we think about the long-term growth rate of this business now with these investments?","Woody Woodall","Well we\u2019re really pleased with the outlook from the fourth quarter at 13%, so I don\u2019t know what mid to high means for you, but we\u2019re very pleased with 13%. Our \u201914 plan will allow the deal signings that we have; it looks pretty solid. So I would say we feel really good about our ability to continue to accelerate international revenue growth. ","Frank Martire","And just to add on that Bryan. Some of that, to Woody\u2019s point, I mean we feel very confident in the growth, but a lot of these businesses are tied to transaction volumes and growth in those as well, and so that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about some of this long term business. ","When you look at the India component as an example, we keep bringing that up, but that\u2019s going to ramp up over the three or four years. Right now we are seeing good adoption around those deployments and so as that continues, as financial inclusion grabs hold more throughout India, I mean we could further push our growth even higher. So we think there\u2019s just a great opportunity here to consistently perform in the international market. ","Frank Martire","Bryan, what we like a lot is the recurring revenue model in this international growth. So once you get it, you have a long-term revenue steam coming from it; that continues as Gary just said, to grow. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ","Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. Just turning to the Financial Solutions Group, the EBITDA growth there was I think 1%. It had been hovering around \u2013 or for the year I think it was 6%. Just want to make sure I understand the components there that drag that down. It sounds like that probably continues; I\u2019m guessing with the lack of M&I fees going forward. ","Woody Woodall","Yes, the term fee challenge is going to be there in terms of the FSG segment. Some of the term fees are also in PSG, don\u2019t forget that. But what we are seeing really is that consulting and services growth and FSG putting some drag on margin in that particulate segment. Again, trying to accelerate top line growth and trading some margin expansion for profit dollars being the trade we are willing to make. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ","What is the breakout between the term fees between FSG and PSG?","Woody Woodall","I think we gave you some color on that in the third quarter. I might have to get back with you on that one though. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ","And then the follow-up question to that is, I know its $28 million for the first half. Just remind us, is it split equally between the first and the second quarter? I just want to make sure we set our models accordingly.","Woody Woodall","It was split pretty ratably, yes.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank ","Okay, all right super. Thanks guys. ","Frank Martire","Thank you. ","Woody Woodall","Hey Bryan, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of David Togut of Evercore. Please go ahead. ","David Togut - Evercore ","Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. ","Frank Martire","Good morning David. How are you?","David Togut \u2013 Evercore","Good. Gary, you highlighted the strength of bookings in the fourth quarter and for the full year overall. Can you quantify what bookings were, both for the quarter and for the year on a year-over-year basis? ","Gary Norcross","Now, we try to stay away from giving those type of numbers. David I can tell you it was up. As you know 2012 was a very strong year for us as well, 2013 was up over 2012. We saw sequential growth Q4 over Q3 and we continue to see a very robust pipeline. ","So we do see as we mentioned throughout the call, our mix continues to change, but we think that\u2019s a positive thing. It just helps the strength and capabilities of what FIS has to deliver and it allows us to square off where those opportunities are. So while we are seeing more opportunity around complex business services, complex outsourcing engagement, that\u2019s a positive that we have capacities to deliver on that. ","Woody Woodall","David I will add some color. If you remember 2012, that was our highest sales year ever, including that $0.5 billion India deal and we had incremental growth over that. ","Gary Norcross","That\u2019s correct, yes. ","David Togut \u2013 Evercore","I see, okay. And then just as a follow-up, Gary in your remarks you focused a lot on the large global FI market. But what are you seeing demand-wise from the small to medium-sized Financial Institutions in the U.S.? And if you could provide some color on pricing also, that would be helpful?","Gary Norcross","No, it\u2019s a great question and I tried to bring some focus on the midsize and community banks. I mean if you referenced the mobile banking, if you reference the bill payment, if you look at those engagements, a lot of that is penetrated through the community and mid-tier markets. So we are still seeing strong demand for cross-sells and up-sells to that market. ","Really that capability of that end-to-end outsourced solution or back office services is resonating there. From a competitive situation in that market, we see the same original, the same competitors you can name and while it is competitive, are we seeing any increase in pricing compression? In the aggregate, I would say no. ","We run into an occasional deal where there is some significant price increase. But typically as we\u2019ve done in the past, you\u2019re able to cross sell and up-sell additional product and service that not only covers the price compression, but also grows our revenue stream for us and in a fairly good manner. ","So we still are very bullish on that market. We think we\u2019ve got a great position in that market and a great product suite and our sales team is executing very well. ","David Togut \u2013 Evercore","Great. Thanks for that, and just a final question for me. A couple of quarters back you talked about your contract with MCX. What are your expectations for the timing of the MCX launch and what magnitude of revenue would you expect this year and next from them?","Gary Norcross","Well, we\u2019re going to have to leave the launch to MCX. That\u2019s up to them to announce that. I know they\u2019ve been kind of slow coming out with what their plans are. Its not been due to lack of work. I mean we talked about out pricing model. Really we are paid for building out and running the network and settling the transaction. So we really don\u2019t have any interchange involvement at all. That\u2019s going be settled out with the financial institutions and so as their transaction volumes grow, we naturally grow. ","If you remember when we disclosed that for the first time in one of our quarterly calls, there are minimums in the contract and you will start seeing contribution this year from MCX to FIS from a revenue standpoint. ","David Togut \u2013 Evercore","Would it be material? ","Gary Norcross","It was a fairly sizable contract growth at the time we disclosed it. It\u2019s a very nice engagement even with the minimums.","David Togut \u2013 Evercore","Okay. Thank you very much. ","Gary Norcross","Yes, thank you David. ","Frank Martire","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies ","","Hey guys. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the Payment Solution margin performance. Its really strong in the quarter. I know and Woody mentioned that this margin strength is set to continue going forward, and that I think you talked about growth in leveraged platforms helping. But I was wondering if you could parse out sort of the drivers of margin expansion in the Payment Segment, I guess in the quarter and going forward?","Frank Martire","Well, kind of conversely to what we talked about in Financial Solutions International, which has the consulting and services, which is a bit of a drag on margins. Because its in the leverage platforms, each incremental sale, each incremental revenue dollar comes out of a very high incremental margin and that\u2019s a lot of what we saw this year. As we saw growth in bill pays, Gary described we continue to see growth in the network business as those dollars come on at a very good margin. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about. That\u2019s the primary driver of what we saw in margin growth in 2013. ","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies ","Okay. Switching gears, any impacts that you guys have perceived from the recent target breach, and I only mean that in the context of the demand environment for your services, whether an increased appetite for risk-related solutions, EMV migration or any potential pullback in consumer debit card spending or anything at all that you can kind of link to that high-profile target breach?","Gary Norcross","Yes, obviously Ramsey, I think that\u2019s one the largest card breaches in history and we don\u2019t do much on the acquiring side. So we are pretty much immune to it. ","From an issuing standpoint, we are seeing some increased demand in the re-issuance of cards, which is very important in this process. We got capacity to do well over 200 million cards a year through that environment. We are starting to have more discussions around risk opportunities. In conclusion if you highlighted any EMV, that\u2019s the strength of FIS, one of the things that we bring to the table that people don\u2019t realize is we are one of the largest processes of EMV in the industry given our presence in Europe, given our presence in Latin-American and other areas. So our systems have been EMV enabled for years now and so we are very well positioned as EMV comes online in the U.S. ","We got the capability to product those chip cards and so we are seeing, not in a lot of conversations, but starting to see some growth in actually re-issuance and some people looking \u2013 is this now the time to take advantage to go ahead and produce a chip card, given the fact that we got to go though the re-issuance process anyway. So that\u2019s really been our exposure, what happened on our side of the target. ","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies ","Okay. One last quick one, revisiting the India ATM deal, I know that was over a relatively long period of time. The revenues associated with that deal were expected to flow in. Where would you say you were in terms of, however you want to calculate the percentage of the implementation of being complete or innings or however you want to look at it? Where are you in terms of implementing that deal?","Frank Martire","Yes, so first I was just over there in Q4 for the BMB launch and obviously as you would expect, you can\u2019t step foot in that country and not talk about that opportunity and where we are. The project is going very well. I think as we discussed when we announced that project, its about a four year ramp to get to full capacity. So I would say we are right on target with our projects. Still less that 50%, but the team is executing it extremely well. ","Some of the other, as you might remember, that went out to bit and there were a lot of what they call circles that were awarded to various people and I do think some of the circles are struggling. We\u2019ve actually seen some wins in new business in those circles that we didn\u2019t win, because the financial institutions are looking to get ATMs deployed and the people that won those circles are struggling. ","So once again I just keep coming back to, it really makes us encouraged about our opportunities because when you see FIS win these large complex things, the team executes very well, we deliver on time, on budget and hit the numbers, and so we are still very confident in the business phase. I would say we are still in the bottom half and the team is deploying exceptionally well. ","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies ","Okay, thanks for your answers. ","Operator","Due to time constrains, our last question will be from the line of Peter Heckmann of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead. ","Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners","Hey, good morning gentleman, I\u2019ll be brief. Just to be clear, your growth guidance of 4.5% to 6.5%, is that constant currency or is that reported?","Frank Martire","This, it comes both reported and organic. ","Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners","Okay, but I am seeing a fairly significant FX headwind in the first half of this year and so do we think in the first half we can still see 4.5% reported or it will be 4.5% minus the FX headwind?","Woody Woodall","I would say your 4.5% organic is what we are looking at. Additionally to it, first half of the year has difficult comps on the term fees that we talked about as well.","Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners","Okay, okay, that\u2019s fair. And then I did have a question. It appears that one of your largest competitors on the card-issuing side is experiencing some fairly significant financial distress. Are you seeing a benefit from banks and credit unions looking to second-source or potentially explore alternatives given that financial distress?","Gary Norcross","You know we haven\u2019t at this point Pete. We are such a large producer of plastics ourselves and typically we produce that plastic in relationship to our debit and credit operations. So while that business continues to grow, I mean it did perform well. We certainly have seen some increase in volume and we\u2019ve associated that with targets, because a lot of them have been reissuing. But no, we\u2019re not seeing just this massive influx of plastic production. ","It\u2019s been very steady and constant throughout 2013 and frankly we think that\u2019s going to continue throughout 2014. As I said to the earlier question, we are seeing more demand around EMV issuance or chip-card issuance, which is positive and we\u2019re prepared and are delivering that today. ","Peter Heckmann - Avondale Partners","Okay, fair enough. I appreciate it.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Martire for any closing remarks. Please go ahead sir. ","Frank Martire","Thank you. Well, thank you for your questions and interest in FIS. Over the last decade FIS had emerged as the global market leader in financial technology. Our scale, solution breadth, unmatched financial industry expertise enables our clients to succeed in this era of rapid change and financial services. ","So let me conclude today\u2019s call by reinforcing four key points; we operate FIS in a great industry with strong fundamentals. Our proven business model, including high recurring revenue and cash flow drives stability and predictability. We have a very strong track record of profitable growth. Finally, we remain focused on returning cash and driving superior returns for our shareholders. ","Again, I want to thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. Also, as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded.","At this time, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Pete Gunnlaugsson. Please go ahead, sir.","Peter Gunnlaugsson - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FIS' Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call.","Turning to slide 2. With me today are Gary Norcross, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer. Gary will begin today's call with company highlights for the quarter and insights as we enter into 2018. Following Gary's comments, Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with the financial results for the quarter and full year and will conclude with 2018 guidance. This conference call is also being webcasted with today's news release and corresponding presentation available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Moving to slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release and in the appendix of the supplemental slide.","Moving to slide 4. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Gary to discuss the business highlights for the quarter. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Pete. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm very pleased to announce that FIS delivered another strong quarter with full-year results exceeding our profitability and earnings expectations, delivering exceptional margin expansion and significant shareholder returns.","Turning to slide 5. In the year, we delivered total shareholder returns of 26%. This was driven by consolidated margin expansion at 240 basis points, adjusted earnings per share growth of 16%, contributing $1.6 billion in free cash flow, which allowed us to resume share repurchases and return $385 million to shareholders in dividends. The bottom line as our strategy is working.","Our leadership team has executed extremely well throughout 2017 and continues to position the business for accelerated growth and driving increased efficiencies. Our sales and marketing teams are generating demand and cross-sell opportunities, resulting in strong momentum coming out of Q4. We are consistently generating strong results and are performing well in a dynamically changing industry.","Turning to slide 6 for a quick review of segment highlights for the quarter. Our Integrated Financial Solutions segment drove top line organic revenue growth of 3% for the year, underpinned by very strong growth of 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by especially high demand for our retail banking, wealth and digital solutions.","Our GFS business recorded top line and organic growth of 3% for the quarter and for the full year. Margins across this segment delivered expansion of more than 600 basis points in the quarter compared to prior-year period and almost 400 basis points for the full year. This further reflects the material improvement to the operating structure of this segment and a focus on higher-margin solutions sales as evidenced by Wedbush Futures, who became the third organization to join our innovative Derivatives Utility.","Turning to slide 7. I want to focus on the results of our strategy and execution and how it is driving transformational results for FIS.","Since the SunGard acquisition, a little more than two years ago, we have continued to successfully execute on the strategic shift to enhance the structure, profitability and predictability of our Global Financial Solutions segment. The SunGard acquisition, in combination with strategic divestitures, has expanded GFS EBITDA margins by over 1,000 basis points and produced a reoccurring revenue base of approximately 70% today.","Our focus on leveraging our cloud-based technologies and driving our consistent one-to-many model has driven margins in our IFS segment to some of the highest in the industry, exceeding 40%. We're reoccurring revenue of approximately 90%, which drives high visibility for the future.","We continue to develop and bring to market new products, supporting our industry-leading, comprehensive global solutions suite. And over the last 24 months, we've paid down approximately $3 billion in debt. We also exceeded our initial $200 million SunGard cost synergy targets by more than $125 million through superior integration execution.","Finally, all these things together will result in a total company EBITDA margin in 2018 of more than 36%, with further room to grow. Supporting this strategy, we divested our public sector and education business, a majority interest in our consulting businesses and announced the divestiture of our China-based Kingstar Solution in the fourth quarter. We entered 2018 with a strong set of assets and a positive outlook for the year.","These results are proof of strategic plan that is working. It allows us to leverage our exceptional global scale to create long-term value and free up dollars to invest back into the business. In fact, over the last two years, in addition to our integration initiatives, we've also directed significant efforts and dollars in innovation to drive long-term growth.","Our investment strategy has been driven with a focus on integration and modernization across our solutions, delivering infrastructure and client services, creating a modern path forward for clients to transform their businesses.","This transformative strategy and unified approach was driven with common design principles and is evolving the way we develop solutions, enable technology and ultimately support our clients.","These innovation principles include creating open APIs and component-based solutions that allow us to build capabilities once and leverage many times, driving reusability and speed to market.","Delivering cloud-ready solutions on both open and proprietary platforms with a secure encryption framework built into every module, and driving rapid and seamless integration across solutions unifying user interfaces and client experiences, deepening end-to-end processing and modernizing client support.","These investments over the last two years are allowing us to launch several new offerings throughout 2018. These include core banking and payment solutions offering an open platform built on a modern technology stack with common reusable components and adaptable to a wide variety of financial arrangement and instrument types, geographies and currencies. Benefits include reuse and sharing of capabilities across platforms, promoting our one-to-many model and delivering speed, agility, and efficiency for clients.","Second, our unified payment solution consolidates our payment platforms, delivering a consistent modern user experience across all payment transaction types. It provides a 360-degree view of a financial institution's cardholder base, making it easier to engage with our customers with more compelling services and solutions.","Third, DIGITAL ONE, our fully integrated omni-channel platform, providing personalization, mobility and social engagement capabilities. These are offered across a multitude of devices, enable a variety of customer experience, choices such as touch, voice, gesture, auto technology and more.","Fourth, our next-generation post-trade solution more than triples processing power and performance over the legacy trade technology, bringing significant straight-through processing value to clients.","Finally, Code Connect, our robust online gateway to over 300 and growing FIS-enabled APIs to serve banking, payments, and consumer finance. The FIS APIs allow clients easy integration and enable rapid development for modern FinTech innovation. In addition to new client offerings, we continue to invest in our data center consolidation projects and in fully transforming our services infrastructure to our FIS secure cloud environment driving continuous availability, high-performance and agility.","This environment allows our next-generation cloud foundation applications to take advantage of scale, performance and resiliency that is industry-leading. By the end of 2018, we will have well over 50% of our U.S.-based products in this environment. Our clients will benefit from the automation of service management, capacity on-demand and fast provisioning, all delivered in a fully secure FIS environment.","As a final point in our investment strategy recap, I'd like to comment on our capital deployment strategy considering the immediate and positive impacts resulting from the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We are focused on a multi-year plan and anticipate adding $650 million to $700 million in cash flow over the next three years as a result of this legislation, enabling us to positively contribute to the economy focused on the long-term interest of our shareholders, clients, and employees, all of which achieve the intended goals of the tax legislation.","Based on this legislation, we saw four important areas for increased investment all building on investments we've made over the last several years as I just discussed. First, the savings will translate to enhanced compensation and benefits for our most important asset, our employees. Through increased funding in our annual wage and bonus pools, paying for high performance and rewarding results.","Additionally, we will be increasing and creating new employee benefits such as increased tuition reimbursement and a new solution focused on helping our employees pay for their student lending debt that was incurred during their undergraduate or post-graduate studies. All these programs will help attract and retain strong talent.","Second, we will further accelerate our already substantial investment in solution innovation to generate increased growth and provide further long-term and competitive benefits for our clients.","Third, we will also accelerate capital investments in our data center consolidation and secure cloud efforts, driving continued long-term margin expansion and enhanced client service.","Finally, we will also be returning some of this benefit to our shareholders through increased earnings per share and dividends. Woody will provide more color in his prepared remarks.","This multi-year plan leveraging the benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will accelerate our progress in all these areas, funding both current and new investments. We are very pleased with this opportunity to further advance the long-term interest of our employees, clients, and shareholders.","Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to acknowledge several important achievements. 2018 marks our 50th anniversary year, a significant achievement for which we're all very proud. Also, FIS was recently recognized as one of Fortune's most admired companies, a recognition that complements our market leadership. I am very appreciative and proud of our employees who achieved this award by delivering to our clients across the globe.","In summary, I'd like to reaffirm that we are very pleased with our full-year 2017 results, which highlight our ability to drive revenue growth and realize exceptional gains and profitability. We expect the positive momentum we created to continue into 2018. To meet our 2018 goals, we will continue to execute on our differentiating capabilities, capitalize on our global scale and continue to invest for long-term growth. Put simply, we are confident that we will deliver another year of enhanced value to our clients and returns to our shareholders.","Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter and full year. Woody?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and for the full year of 2017. Following a review of our financial results, I'll also provide information on the impact of the recently passed tax reform legislation, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, and our 2018 guidance.","In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 3.1% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to $881 million, a 4.1% increase compared to the prior-year period. EBITDA margin expanded 340 basis points to 37.8% and adjusted earnings per share grew 19.3% to $1.36 per share.","For the year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to $3.1 billion, a 4.2% increase compared to the prior-year period. EBITDA margin expanded 240 basis points to 33.6% and adjusted earnings per share grew 15.7% to $4.42 per share.","We are very pleased with the ongoing margin expansion of the business, primarily driven by our one-to-many model, creating significant operating leverage in the business as well as continuous efforts to fund operational efficiencies.","We have also seen structural improvements specific to our GFS segment, with the successful divestiture of the majority stake in our consulting business and anticipate further meaningful margin expansions into 2018.","Moving to slide 10. In the fourth quarter, IFS revenue grew on an organic basis by 5.6%, while EBITDA grew 5.3%. Top line growth was driven by strong demand for our Banking and Wealth solution and, as expected, a rebound from our Payments business.","For full year 2017, IFS revenue increased 2.8% on an organic basis and EBITDA increased 3.9% compared to the prior-year period to $1.9 billion. Margins expanded 60 basis points to 40.3%.","Turning to slide 11, Banking and Wealth grew 8.5% for the quarter. This was driven by balanced growth across the businesses with elevated volumes in our output and wealth solutions. We are pleased with the 4% full year growth from this group.","As expected, Payments rebounded and grew 5% this quarter. As we are seeing increased demand for our fraud solutions in the payment space; growth was also driven by a data analytics deal.","Corporate and Digital was impacted by a difficult license sales comparable and corporate liquidity, which was called out in the prior-year period. Growth in our digital and mobile solutions remained strong as we see continuing demand for this product suite.","Turning to slide 12, in the fourth quarter, GFS revenue grew 3.1% organically while EBITDA grew 7.5% for the quarters represent 630 basis points of margin expansion to 42.3%. In addition to continued strong operating leverage and favorable revenue mix, margins also benefited from our recent consultant divestiture.","For the full year 2017, revenue increased 3.1% organically. EBITDA grew 9.6% compared to the prior year, reflecting 380 basis points of margin expansion to 34.2%. We're extremely pleased with the EBITDA margin profile in this segment approaching the mid-30% range.","We exceeded our original plans and this momentum continues into 2018 as we anniversary our recent portfolio of divestitures, and we remain confident in our ability to drive margin expansion through our ongoing operating leverage and scale.","Moving to slide 13. For the quarter, our Institutional and Wholesale business grew 5%. We remain pleased with the continued high client retention rates resulting in strong software license renewals during the quarter.","We are confident in the long-term growth prospects for this business as we continue to see sales progress and our bundling of solutions for clients and where the strength of our balance sheet continues to be a competitive advantage in the marketplace.","Banking and Payments was relatively flat as growth in North America was offset by some softness in Europe and Asia, which is directly tied to the timing of sales.","Moving to slide 14. Corporate and Other revenue in the fourth quarter was $83 million with an EBITDA loss of $60 million. The Corporate and Other segment results include $79 million of corporate expenses for the quarter compared to $88 million in the prior-year period, reflecting ongoing efforts to drive operational efficiencies, which will be leveraged by the business model driving incremental profitability.","As expected, this segment was approximately a 100-basis-point headwind to consolidated full-year revenue growth in 2017. This 100-basis-point head wind will continue into the first half of 2018, but should improve as the year progresses resulting in approximately 50 basis points of headwind through our consolidated revenue growth for this full year. We expect the impact that this segment has to overall growth become less meaningful as its contribution to our consolidated revenue continues to decrease.","Moving to slide 15. Cash flow generation remains strong. Free cash flow was about $550 million for the quarter and $1.6 billion for the year, representing 108% full-year conversion rate, which was in line with our previous guidance. We reduced our debt by $1.9 billion in 2017 and had approximately $8.8 billion of debt outstanding as of December 31. As expected, our effective tax rate for the full year was approximately 28%.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $100 million. Approximately, $3.9 billion remain on our existing repurchase authorization. The weighted average diluted share count was 336 million at the end of the year.","Finally, we returned $96 million to shareholders through our dividends in the quarter and $385 million for the full year. We exited 2017 with a strong balance sheet and our position to continue to drive top line growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow to drive shareholder returns.","Consistent with our historical capital allocation principles, we'll continue to invest in innovation and product development to better serve our clients. Our Board of Directors recently approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share.","And finally, we continue to assess value-creating M&A opportunities. Absent any actionable deals, we will continue to repurchase shares. It has been a very busy time for our tax and accounting teams over the past several months, and the team's efforts have really paid off.","I will now spend a few moments discussing the impacts of the recently passed tax legislation and implementing the new revenue recognition accounting standard.","Bear with me here as there is a lot of information to cover. Turning to slide 16. The recent tax legislation resulted in a significant impact to our tax liabilities, which created a net tax benefit of approximately $780 million in our GAAP net earnings or $2.32 per share of diluted EPS for the fourth quarter.","This net benefit is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This was driven primarily by the revaluation of existing deferred tax liabilities at the lower rate and, to a much lesser extent, the transition tax on foreign earnings. We anticipate being able to utilize foreign tax credits to effectively offset the transition tax, resulting in the net cash impact from our foreign operations being immaterial.","For 2018, we anticipate an 8-point reduction in our effective tax rate from 28% to 20%. We believe we can sustain this 20% rate in the future years. This drives incremental earnings and cash flow into 2018 and beyond.","As Gary mentioned, we anticipate reinvesting up to $100 million of this 2018 benefit into broader employee benefits and increased wages, higher innovation spend and accelerating data center consolidations. Roughly, half of this reinvestment will impact operating expenses in 2018. The remainder of the tax savings will benefit shareholders through earnings per share and dividends.","Turning to slide 17, effective January 1, 2018, we are required to adopt the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. As previously discussed, we are adopting the standard by restating all historical periods to give a transparent view of the impact to all periods that show historical perspective comparisons on an apples-to-apples basis.","Our prior period financials in 2018 planning will be affected by the implementation of the standard. The graphs on slide 17 shows these impacts for 2016 and 2017 on revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. For example, the impact to EPS is approximately $0.15 for each of these years.","We've built our 2018 plan and guidance under the new rules and anticipate a similar impact for 2018 as a result of the adoption of the accounting standard compared to the old rules.","As previously discussed, and more importantly, this accounting change does not impact cash flow of the business, nor is it expected to have a significant effect on expectations of future growth. However, while ASC 606 does not have an impact on consolidated revenue growth for the full year, it does impact the segments.","For 2018, IFS revenue growth includes about 1 point headwind and GFS revenue growth includes about 1 point tailwind. The most significant change was related to certain pass-through fees. About 80% of the revenue adjustment was from changing growth revenue recognition to net revenue recognition for these fees. This will have no effect on earnings.","The majority of the EBITDA and EPS impacts are related to the deferral of early software license renewals to the original renewal date and software rental fees being recognized upon delivery rather than ratably over the rental period.","We expect to publish our full-year 2017 10-K the week of February 19 under the old rules. Following this, in late February or early March, we will publish three years of historical financials reflecting the new rules. We will also provide supplemental quarterly data to help the modeling. At that point, all financial results reported in 2018 including historical results will be comparable under the new rules.","Primarily as a result of the adoption of 606 and the related timing of recognition of known items, our GFS segment planned growth in the first half of the year is expected to be below our guidance range and growth in the second half of the year is expected to be higher than our guidance range, aggregating to full year growth guidance.","While we expect this to impact GFS and result in consolidated revenue timing during the year, we expect earnings seasonality to be basically in line with the average quarterly contribution we've seen in the last few years.","Moving to slide 18. With that behind us, let me move on to our guidance for the year. For 2018, we expect consolidated organic revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, IFS revenue growth of 2% to 3% and GFS organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%.","Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin of 36% to 37% and adjusted earnings of $5.10 to $5.30 per share representing growth of 19% to 24% compared to a restated for ASC 606 baseline EPS of $4.27. Consistent with historical practices, we have provided supplemental planning assumptions in the appendix material.","Moving to slide 19. We're exciting to enter 2018 with a more focused set of solutions serving the financial services industry, a healthy balance sheet coupled with strong cash flows and a meaningful share repurchase authorization.","We are confident in our guidance for the year and our ability to continually drive value to our shareholders through our compelling business model and strong cash flow generation.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. Our first question will come from David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, David.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Your 2018 outlook for IFS revenue growth of 2% to 3% or 3% to 4%, if we make the adjustment for ASC 606, what are the puts and takes embedded in that outlook? And in particular, are you seeing any more optimism among bank CEOs with respect to spending intentions for 2018?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes. If you look at how we exited the year with roughly 4% in Banking and Payments, low-single-digits in payments itself and in Corporate and Digital and roughly 4% as well, we would anticipate similar levels into 2018 in terms of the growth components. When you look at the 1% headwind in IFS and the 1% tailwind in GFS, the underlying business of both segments is doing about 3% to 4% with about 50 basis points of headwind from Corporate and Other, David. But we would anticipate similar expectations regarding it.","With regard to overall spending trends, I think we still think around IT spend in the 3% to 4% level, which would be close to growth of the overall market, and we're growing in line with it.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes. Let me build on a little bit from a sales standpoint, David. As you know, historically, we're coming off Q4, very strong sales kind of across the board. We're looking good for Q1 in our pipeline. But, as you know, we have very long sales cycles. And then once you close the deal, very long onboarding cycles. So even if those changes do increase spend over time, to Woody's point, you'll see that translate into higher growth, and IFS especially really 12 months down the road, right? We've got to sell through that process and then you got to on-board it. So it really is a longer lag for us to start translating into our growth numbers.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Good. And then, as a follow-up, your EBITDA margin guidance calls for 290 basis points of expansion at the midpoint of your outlook. Beyond the SunGard benefits that might flow into 2018, what are the big incremental drivers of your EBITDA margin forecast?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Let me give you just a rough walk there, David. If you came out of 2017 at roughly 33.5%, the impact of ASC 606 is about an 80-basis-point benefit as we're having some of the no-margin revenue coming out for those pass-through fees. Divestitures for the year are about 140-basis-point benefit, and the rest is operational, driving you to 36% to 37% for the full year 2018 expectation.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then, just a quick final question on capital allocation. You indicated that you do maintain an active acquisition pipeline. How do you think about capital return versus M&A in this environment, given where asset prices are?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, your point is valid. At least a few days ago, valuations were very high. So multiples are high in the area. I think you've seen us be very disciplined over the years, trying to find assets that increment our capabilities, add a new service or a new market or ideally both. But we're disciplined in terms of valuation. If we don't have deals that fit strategically or action where we don't meet our valuation screens, we'll certainly buy back shares. You saw us buy back $100 million in December and we're entering into 2018 with a $3.9 billion authorization.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, David.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. One moment please.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Dave? Dave, are you there?","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Oh, hey.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, there we go.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Nice job. So I guess, just I have two questions. The first one, is it fair to think \u2013 you said 19% to 24% EPS growth kind of ex the ASC 606. Just looking at the numbers, it looks like about half tax and half core. So does that mean each of tax and core growing about 10% to 12% EPS for the year? I'm just trying to isolate what the core is growing.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Let me give you even an easier walk on this, Dave, and thinking about our midpoint of $5.20 in 2018 is a plan. You really need to add $0.15 related to the impact of adopting ASC 606, add about $0.10 related to the operating expense component of the tax reinvestment, and back out $0.55 related to the net impact on the tax rate differential. I think that drives you down to about a $4.90. And that would be an apples-to-apples pre-ASC 606 and pre-any adjustment for taxes.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you. Yeah. So your core, yeah, 10%, 12% or so. Okay. That's good. And I guess, the second thing, just on ASC 606, just so we're clear on the segments, about $455 million of revenue comes out in aggregate. Is that about half in each segment? Just so we know what base used for each segment.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I would tell you more of it is going to be in IFS because, as you saw, about 80% of that numbers related to pass-through fees for interchange and network where the vast majority of that is in our domestic payments business or IFS. So the majority will be in the IFS group.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, like 70\/30 or 80\/20 or something in there?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Somewhere in that zone.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Well, thank you. Nice job.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","(30:42) back to your $4 or your $5.20 midpoint, that's helpful. Congrats on a nice quarter and a couple of questions for me. Number one, can you talk a little bit about data center consolidation? I know you guys are sort of perennially working on this kind of stuff. What kind of bene (30:57) did we get from it in last year, and what are we going to get from it this year? Is it measurable? Is that some of the underlying margin improvement that we're seeing?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Absolutely, Brett. We exited last year with a little over 38% in our private cloud. As I shared in my prepared remarks, end of this year we'll be over 50%. We are seeing a lot of benefit. The team's doing an excellent job of executing against. This is a big program, right, as we take all of these data centers that we collected over the years through acquisitions and consolidate them down in the U.S. but we are seeing real benefit. You're seeing it flow through some of the corporate line improvements in Corporate and Other and then that's translating into the business lines through our segments, through our allocations as well. And we'll continue to see that. As we look into 2018 and we're guiding to more margin expansion, that'll continue to be a contributor to that overall benefit.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. To add to it, Brett, it's certainly a contributor of margin expansion also as part of our confidence and continuing to drive margin expansion going forward. We're working through updating our business case connected to this accelerated spend. And we're going to come back at Investor Day and outline fully as to what the base plan and what the accelerated spend associated with the plan is driving in terms of benefit, timing, and savings. And that will be in May.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then, Gary, I think you mentioned some technology you've been working on in several different areas. And one that I didn't know as much about was a new open core platform. Can you talk a little bit about that?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. We've talked in the past, Brett, I mean, really, the whole industry is really based on legacy-based technologies, whether that would be mainframes or client servers, or whatever the underlying technology might be, but they're very close to nature historically.","And so, over the years \u2013 over the last several years, we've been very focused on building the future of where we think financial services is going. And obviously, we need to enable our clients, our existing clients to upgrade, over time, to those new technologies, but they're also needed in order to continue to compete and take share going forward.","So this year in 2018, we're bringing many of those new technologies to bear. And one of them is a fully open core banking system that we built from the ground up. It's day one cloud-ready. It runs and you can run it. Our clients can build their own user experience by coming through our open API framework or they can consume our new state-of-the-art user experience. But we think these are going to be very important launches as we look at where the future of this industry is going.","We all know how all of the technologies are becoming more and more digitally-enabled. If you don't really start deploying some of these foundational elements, you're not going to be able to take advantage of that. And so we're not only excited about core componentization coming online, but our next-generation payments platforms and the other things that we mentioned in the prepared remarks as well. So 2018 will be a big year for us as we start bringing these to market.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's all I needed. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue, that will come Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Thanks for the presentation. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give the SunGard cost savings achieved in fiscal 2017? And I'm curious on the SunGard revenue front, how did that come in versus plan? Are you satisfied with the revenue synergies et cetera?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. The revenue synergies have done very well. The team has executed extremely well. Q4 is always a very busy quarter for us, given the nature of the SunGard assets and, frankly, the high concentration license fees, Tien-Tsin, so they executed extremely well. And we had the best quarter in sales we've had. So we're very pleased with where revenue is overall with the SunGard assets. We continue to see nice leverage of relationships. And we've cited a number of examples of that. So I would tell you, looking back on due diligence and what we modeled, the SunGard revenue synergies, they certainly exceeded our expectations.","In the prepared remarks, we didn't get an exact number. But when we originally did the SunGard, we did declare $200 million of synergies and we exceeded that number by more than $125 million. And frankly, while we stop tracking through SunGard synergies at this point in time because company is so integrated into FIS, there's a number of programs that are still ongoing that's going to help us continue to grow margins for several years in the future. So we just couldn't be more pleased with how that overall acquisition worked out.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Well done. Just a quick second question, just on the margin front. IFS margin is quite high, I guess, it was 40%, 41%. You're getting closer to a ceiling here. And I'm curious does your \u2013 did you give margin outlook by segment in fiscal 2018? And does it reflect the ASC 606 adjustment?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Let me take first the IFS margin and are we reaching the ceiling. The quick answer is no. If you look at all the things that are going on with data center consolidation, if you look at our one-to-many model and how we're deploying software to, in some instances, thousands of clients, and you look at all of the focus that I just deployed about heightened innovation and the deployment of those innovations, those innovations will go into that base.","So what will those innovations allow us to do? One, grow share, further cross-sell and up-sell into that base, which will drive more revenue that will come on at much more incremental margins. It will also allow us to consolidate some of our legacy platforms. We have, in certain areas, redundant platforms for certain functionality and we'll be able to consolidate that over time.","And then, you add on data center consolidation. When you look at all those things, we think there's still plenty of room in IFS for the long term to expand margins. We'll go into a lot more detail than that in the upcoming investor update, but no, we're not to the ceiling that.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","And Tien-Tsin, we didn't give specific individual margins. We gave consolidated margin 36% to 37%. That implies around roughly 300 basis points of margin expansion. I'll tell you both segments are going to expand. IFS will expand less than GFS as we continue to drive operational efficiencies through GFS, but both segments will expand in 2018 operationally.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's great. Thank you, both.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit of color on the institutional wholesale that's been quite strong, as you mentioned, for a while know. Do you think that 5%-ish outlook can hold throughout 2018? And any color can provide on the capital markets side more broadly?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I'll start from the sales perspective then let Woody build on it. We're very pleased with the I&W group and how they performed. Obviously, I just commented, they came off a very heavy Q4, which is very traditional for this business. I'll tell you our sales leader over that group's \u2013 gentleman by the name of Jim Neve continues to execute. He and his team extremely well with not only closing but also building out future pipelines, bringing in and expanding the sales talent to continue to grow the output out of our overall sales engine and doing that globally.","So we're very pleased with that group. We're very pleased with the future. When we look at what's going on in the whole capital markets world specifically, one of the things that attracted us to SunGard is that was a very, very fragmented market. So lot of competition, lot of in-house developed software, and, arguably, a need for all those customers to take advantage of more commercial grade-type solutions. And we're seeing that in our sales efforts.","So as we look forward to 2018, the team's going to be very focused on solution bundling, right, instead of just selling an individual product for a capability. How do you take multiple products build a solution to solve an end-to-end need within capital markets, and we certainly think we've got some of the best assets in the industry. I also mentioned on innovation. We're in some \u2013 we're in very late innings of some very large rewrites or development from the ground up of some of those capabilities that will really help propel us also into the future.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","And, Jim, to add some color from sort of how the cadence will go, because of ASC 606, we would anticipate the first half of the year particularly in the I&W to be a little lower than our guidance range and the back half of the year to be higher than the guidance range based on the timing of recognition there, aggregating to that 4% to 5% we outlined.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And then, maybe just going back to the broader macro outlook, in terms of what you're hearing from your bank customers, I understand that an improving spending environment may take some time to materialize, as you pointed out, in the 12-month range. But you look at your sales yesterday and the new deals that you're looking to sign, how do you think the two forces of higher rates and lower potential regulation is playing out in customer's calculus in terms of are they feeling less pressure to outsource with enhanced profitability? Or are they feeling any more willing to outsource, just any directional color on that would be helpful.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I would tell you at this point in time, Jim, we're not seeing this massive increase in pipeline that we could point to, expanding interest margins and lower regulatory spend. We're also not seeing any trend that would suggest that more and more customers aren't looking to outsource. I highlighted Wedbush who's the third client for us coming into our Derivatives Utility.","Frankly, what clients are looking for is how do we lower our total cost of ownership by leveraging commercial-grade solutions. If we can deliver that at a lower total cost, they're going to want to outsource that on top of just licensing the software. And we see no indication of those trends changing. I just highlighted we've got a very strong pipeline and we just closed out one \u2013 our strongest quarter in that area, and that pipeline continues to grow and the sales team continues to execute against that.","But by showing some massive uptick from more of these animal spirits that people like to talk about, we've not seen that indication yet. But, as it does, if it does occur, what I'd suggest to you is, we'll first see it in our pipeline, we'll then see it in our closings and then we'll see it in our revenue after we do our on-boarding anywhere from 9 months to 15 months down the road.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, guys. Good morning. Can you \u2013 I may have missed it, but the $100 million of incremental investments, did you guys specify how much was going to be recurring versus one-time at this point?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Of the $100 million, we would say the three areas we talked about being employee benefits, incremental innovation spend and incremental data center consolidation. The full outlay is roughly a 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3. I would tell you half of the up to $100 million, we have operating expense in 2018. I would anticipate us continuing to invest in employees going forward. I would anticipate continuing to invest in innovation going forward. And then, hopefully, we can, at some point, get data center consolidation behind us and won't have to have that ongoing long term, but this would be a multi-year plan in terms of the spend.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Absolutely.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. The open banking platform that you guys talked about, cloud-ready day one, presumably, that's for your smaller institutions that are going to be within IFS. The question, I guess, I have is, is some of that ultimately like self-cannibalizing? And then to that extent, is there anything we need to be aware of as we think through the implementation of that affecting your revenue growth rate? Or is it all incremental?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, first, let me clarify one thing. Our open banking platform is not just going to be for IFS. We're actually seeing a lot of momentum in our GFS market around that platform as well. Frankly, when you look at some of the ancient architectures that are in place around the world, this is a great opportunity.","As large banks want to transform their infrastructure, these are the kind of solutions they're actually looking for. So it'll actually drive benefit to both of those segments and a great indication of us being able to leverage our investment once across many markets. Now the reality is that platform will be deployed in different ways, right? So we would expect to see that because the customer demand is different, but we will get leverage out of that.","From revenue growth, I think you'll see both. You won't see cannibalization as much. We will see our customers upgrading to it. So we'll see maintaining and growing of the existing revenue as customers upgrade to these technologies and then take additional services. And then obviously, we expect to see increased revenue growth by taking share as well with some of these newer technologies.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And if I could sneak one more in, your leverage now, I guess, close to 2.6 turns. And you said absent deals, you've got repos. I'm just wondering your appetite to do multiple smaller deals? Or are you kind of targeting the larger deals given the efforts that management team has specifically put into those types of things? Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. We would traditionally \u2013 we tend to look for something more larger, something that really brings us a substantial new offering to an existing market that we're serving or break us into an adjacent market. Obviously, we want to continue to make sure that we play a substantial market leadership role. And so that all tends to typically push you towards something on the larger side.","To Woody's point, the values are high. We've never been an irrational buyer. We've never been someone that has just felt like they had to go do a transaction. And so frankly, Woody went through the capital allocation. We always like to look at investing into our existing capabilities or new products, which I highlighted a lot. We think that's a great way to continue to accelerate the growth of the company.","And then, we'd always look if we can find something that really fits our strategy and makes sense for FIS to own, looking at those acquisitions, but if not, we still have a very large authorization from our board on share repurchases. And we'll continue to fall through that list in that order.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos - Cowen Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, George.","George Mihalos - Cowen Inc.","I wanted to ask a question on the M&A side. Maybe just to kick things off, I've always been under the impression that, from an M&A characteristic standpoint, you haven't wanted \u2013 you've avoided deals that would be dilutive to the overall organic growth rate of FIS. Just curious if your thinking on that has evolved at all, if there's a certain threshold, given some recent deal activity where you may put that aside to do something that would be very accretive for the business.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","You know, George, I don't think our viewpoint on transactions really changed. Obviously, we want to make sure that it's a good financial deal for our company, and, therefore, for our shareholders, so accretion is very important. Obviously, we want it to be synergistic, not only just through the operating line, but also through the revenue line. We want it to be complementary of our existing solutions set. So we don't like to swim too far out of that lane. So all of those are pretty consistent guiderails (48:19) that we maintain as we think through what potential M&A activity might be.","George Mihalos - Cowen Inc.","Great. Thanks. Thanks for the color, Gary. And then, maybe on the other side, how are you guys thinking about bank consolidation going forward in M&A activity in the FI space? Has that potentially bit of a bigger headwind for you guys going forward?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question, George. We continue to see consolidation occurring in the market. We don't see anything that's going to slow that consolidation. Frankly, we're watching the SIFI classification. If you see that number raise up, this is just my opinion or our leadership's opinion, I think we've got an opportunity to see consolidation accelerate some there, feel like that SIFI classification has really dampened down some of that.","So we're watching that closely. But those would be the things. We don't see anything that would slow consolidation although valuations are continuing to go up and banks tend to not be irrational buyers as well. But we're counting on 2018 to be fairly consistent and are in alignment with the consolidation we saw in 2017, but there could be some regulatory change that might accelerate that, but that remains to be seen; not really seeing anything that I would suggest is going to slow it unless it's just valuations get too far out of range.","George Mihalos - Cowen Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Gary. Hi, Woody.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. So as I look at the strong end to the year from IFS subsegments like Bank and Wealth, and Payments or maybe the institutional side of GFS, I'm wondering why this does not translate to stronger growth as we head into 2018. I think, Gary, does this have anything to do with \u2013 you mentioned APIs and cloud and new solutioning quite a lot in your prepared remarks. I'm wondering if there is a competitive impact or a pricing impact from these things.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No, I wouldn't tell you that I think that we're losing competitively, because our existing software is not competitive. We're not seeing that. And, in fact, we continue to perform well in those areas in competitive situations. I think innovation, my comments were more about \u2013 and typically, we do this at FIS, we don't bring things to this call until we're ready to bring them to market. And so I think a lot of people thought we were strictly heads-down on integrating SunGard for the last two years. And frankly, we have been heads-down integrating SunGard. We've also been heads-down running the business. And software takes a long time to develop, right?","And these are very complex systems. And that's more a future statement where I want you to realize that we are moving into the future. We're proud of what we're seeing around cloud-based technologies. We're proud of what the teams are building and we'll continue to do that. When you look at the headwinds, we did have a strong quarter on IFS and very pleased with that. Woody talked about some of the headwinds we're experiencing with the accounting change.","Frankly, we continue to see consolidation high in IFS, right? I mean, when you look at the level of acquisitions are occurring in that space and depending on what subsegment of IFS that's occurring in, that can be a headwind to this business. But, no, we're very pleased. We are forecasting accelerated growth of IFS over 2017. We feel confident about that, that the team will execute. And so you'll see that growth continue to recover as we continue to cross-sell and grow through the markets.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. I'm just kind of saying that this late in this cycle \u2013 a growth approaching 3% does seem fairly paltry to a lot of people. But my second question is with regards to what specific capital return and repurchase assumptions are embedded in 2018 guidance. And could you comment on free cash flow conversion rate?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I'll take the last question first. We ended 2017 at about 108% free cash flow conversion. We anticipate 2018 to be about 110%, if not, a little more. I would tell you that we always look at capital deployment in terms of generating cash flow and redeploying that cash.","We anticipate based on that conversion rate about $1.8 billion of free cash flow in 2018. We've got a bond to repay that comes due in the year about $1 billion. But we would anticipate maintaining our leverage at similar levels. So if we don't find M&A activity that is appealing and fits strategically and valuation-wise, we'd certainly repurchase shares, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please go ahead","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. What were term fees in Q4? And what's the outlook for term fees? And just to clarify on the buyback, you're assuming that besides debt paydown and any dividend, everything is used for buyback and that's what's in the EPS guide?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, on the term fees, we were about $21 million for Q4. That compared to $22 million last year. Full year was $59 million in 2016 and $64 million in 2017. We're expecting it slightly down, maybe $50 million in our 2018 planning for term fees. Again, on share repurchase, we look at excess free cash flow. And to the extent we're not paying down debt, we would certainly look at buying shares back, particularly, at these valuations for us.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, on the Derivatives Utility, maybe just talk about the incremental margin profile of that business. I know that the first two banks, you took on some staff from those firms. Is that true with Wedbush as well? And then I know there was a bit of a gap, like a two-year gap between signing clients. Just curious what the pipeline there looks like? Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Let me the take last one first and then I'll back into the other one. Anytime you're launching a utility like this, finding the right foundational clients to come into an environment's very, very important. We've done that historically at FIS and we could point back to a lot of those historical utilities. So getting the right partners early on is very important.","But I'd also tell you these are very complex transactions. You've got to find clients who want to enter into something that is starting from scratch and someone who sees the vision of where this is going. And so it's a combination of finding the right customer to on-board as well as a very big sales effort. So I don't want to trivialize that.","Pipeline, still got good pipeline on this. Obviously, we'll be on-boarding and selling more clients in 2018, and we're counting on that in the planning cycle. Also with any startup, just like you said, margins, because we on-boarded a number of people through the first two margins started out, and frankly, in a negative position as we build out that platform. But we're very confident that the utility will not only come into profitability. It will continue to expand and grow throughout 2018. So a very nice business for us.","But like any business startup, it takes a while for to on-board and start producing. So we're certainly going to do that in 2018.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Sure. Thanks for taking my question.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, Ramsey.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Hey. In the context of 2017 results, 2018 guidance and all the recent divestitures, can you just take a step back and update us on your thoughts around the long-term organic growth trajectory of the business? Maybe help us think through what are sort of upside and downside risks to organic growth going forward and whether there's any potential accelerants you can conceive or call out?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, as far as long-term guidance, we're going to be updating all that at our upcoming investor update, which I'll talk about in the closing comments. So we'll certainly share that with you at that point in time. As Woody pushed forward, our annual guidance for 2018, you'll notice fairly tight bands on that guidance range. Frankly, when you look at the nature of our sales engagements, you'll look at the time to on-board \u2013 there's always only so much we can do to really influence in here.","IFS has over 90% \u2013 right at 90% reoccurring revenues. So obviously, the ability to accelerate that material inside given 12 months is a little tougher. But as far as long-term guidance, we'll certainly share that with you in the upcoming investor update in May.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","If you look at some of the puts and takes, we've got headwind in Corporate and Other that will continue to diminish over time, 100 basis points, now 50 basis points looking into 2019 and 2020 continued further diminishment in terms of its impact on growth. The other common would be, while we have removed ourselves from some of the higher revenue growth through divestitures, we also have much lower margin business connected to that. So you're seeing our margin profile increase significantly, although it puts a little bit of a damper because some of those were higher revenue growth even though they were very low margin businesses.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And last one for me. I wanted to just ask about your view on P2P, and I guess on Zelle in particular. Definitely seeing an aggressive marketing campaign for Zelle here in the Metro New York area and also some nice volume growth being reported. Could P2P in general evolve into a longer-term contributor for you? And are you seeing any traction in particular on that Zelle relationship?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Let's just go payments broadly. There's so much going on in payments right now. We'll be giving you guys a full update in May on all that. We're very excited about all the changes that are coming in payments. And I think P2P is just one of many opportunities out there to really accelerate the growth in that area.","As far as sales success, we've been very successful. We've already on-boarded a lot of clients into that, enabling them to offer Zelle. We've got a very full pipeline. So I think we'll continue to see that on-boarding. What we want to see, and I love to see the marketing campaign is real transaction growth that's going to then accelerate everybody's revenue.","And so we'll certainly be keeping you apprised of that. But right now, we've had very good success in the sales cycle and a very full pipeline. We've had very good success with on-boarding clients. So we've got a lot of clients in production now with Zelle.","And so as we watch the marketing impact kick in and some movement of those transactions and increasing those transactions that will naturally drive our revenue stream. But there's a lot more going on payments other than just P2P. And we'll certainly be giving you guys a real thorough update on that in May.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you for joining us today and for your ongoing interest in FIS. We are pleased to deliver another year of strong profitability performance and earnings growth.

Frank?","Frank R. Martire","Thanks, Mary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll begin today's business review with a summary of our financial performance and business highlights. Gary will follow with the business and operations report, and Woody will provide additional insight into our financial performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2013.","Turning to Slide 6. We delivered solid organic growth in the second quarter, with a 4% increase over prior year. This marks the 14th consecutive quarter of organic growth, which underscores the strength of our business model and our strong client relationships.","Adjusted EPS increased 8% to $0.71 per share. For the 6 months ended June 30, organic revenue rose 4%, the margin expanded 40 basis points, and EPS grew 11%. We are pleased with our financial results through the first half of 2013, which are in line with our expectations.","We are also encouraged by the ongoing sales execution, including the addition of new clients, such as Sainsbury's Bank in the U.K., as well as expanding relationships with existing clients, such as KeyBank and Sterling Savings Bank in North America. In addition, we are excited about the opportunities we are seeing in emerging payments, such as the Merchant Customer Exchange. These wins lend additional accredence to the depth and breadth of our solutions, the strength of our people and our ability to provide long-term strategic value to our clients.","Continuing on Slide 7. The business strategy that we outlined in February of 2012 continues to drive benefits to our company, our clients and our shareholders. Our strategy is summarized as follows. First, we remain committed to optimizing performance through organic growth, with an ongoing focus on double-digit growth and earnings per share. Second, we are delivering strategic value to our clients through solution innovation and transformation. This includes expansion of our mobile capabilities with the acquisition of mFoundry and leveraging our existing infrastructure to develop new and innovative capabilities for the industry. Finally, we are highly committed to enhancing shareholder value through a combination of strong financial performance and meaningful share repurchases and dividends.","We returned $353 million to our shareholders in the first half of 2013, and we have returned approximately $1.5 billion to our shareholders since the beginning of 2011.","We remain very excited about the future of our company and our ability to deliver superior performance. On behalf of the management team, I would like to thank our clients and shareholders for their ongoing support and our employees for their dedication in driving our continuous success.","Now I will turn the call over to Gary for the business summary and operations report. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross","Thanks, Frank, and thanks, again, to everyone for joining us this morning. FIS continues to drive solid results, demonstrating our ability to deliver consistent performance and manage our strategic plan. As Frank mentioned, we continue to generate solid growth and drive strong revenue performance. We're pleased with our first half of the year results, which are in line with our expectations.","My remarks today will cover 2 main areas. First, I will discuss our overall sales performance, highlighting the continued demand for our full breadth of solutions in each of our key markets. Separately, I will highlight ongoing solution innovation through our new commercial agreement with the Merchant Customer Exchange. This significant win demonstrates our ongoing success in enabling business innovation and transformation and illustrates the value of our leverage in investments in enabling payment services.","I will start with our global sales performance on Slide 9. Overall demand for solutions and services has remained consistent over the past several quarters. Financial institution bookings are up year-to-date, and we perceive further upward momentum. Demand is broad based around core enhancements, mobile solutions, emerging payments and services. Also, significant transformational activity is occurring across all channels and regions as many institutions improve their overall customer experience, build brand loyalty, streamline operations and reduce costs. This momentum is being driven by cross-sell opportunities created from our innovation-focused client events and the execution of our go-to-market strategy.","Please turn to Slide 10. In North America, our comprehensive solutions suite enables us to deliver strategic value to our clients. We see continued activity around core upgrades and replacements, continued strength in consulting services, increasing demand for our mobile solutions and exciting new opportunities around our payment capabilities. Demand for FIS core solutions underscores the need for updated technology, with an emphasis on improving the overall customer experience through the realtime integration across all channels.","For example, an $8 billion financial institution located in the Southeast, which operates hundreds of branches across 17 states, recently selected FIS commercial and retail loan processing solutions to replace the bank's 15-year-old technology. The upgrade will provide more robust feature functionality, the ability to streamline processes and enhanced platform integration.","In contrast, Texas-based Industry Bancshares has opted to replace its core banking system, which it installed just 4 years ago, with a more robust solution from FIS. The bank will also deploy our auto-processing and branch automation solutions. These enhancements will enable it to expedite customer service and provide clients with real-time access across all delivery channels.","These new clients continue a steady trend of core processing wins, with 30 new deals in 2012, followed by additional new signings in the first quarter of 2013, including Beneficial Bank, USAA and GE Capital.","In addition to our leveraged core processing capabilities, we also assist clients with business planning and new product development. A good example of this end-to-end approach is KeyBank, which is launching a new payments channel for its commercial customers. Working with the bank, we developed a customized prepaid card solution that aligns closely with their commercial payment strategy. As part of this new multi-year agreement, FIS will provide outsourced transaction processing, integrated voice response and card fulfillment services.","Turning to mobile. Accelerating adoption of digital channels is driving continued strong demand in cross-sell opportunities for our solutions, as financial institutions move to strengthen consumer loyalty and engagement through this dynamic and fast-growing channel. We are very pleased with the increasing penetration of our mobile solution within our client base.","As an example, we are partnering with Sterling Savings Bank, a $9 billion institution based in Spokane, Washington. Sterling migrated their core solution in 2011 and will expand their relationship with FIS by deploying a wide range of digital solutions that include mobile banking, remote deposit capture and mobile prepaid. In addition to mobile, the bank also is enhancing its business e-banking offering by augmenting its consumer online banking channel to include account origination and deposit capabilities. These and many other similar engagements offer continued endorsement for the breadth of our capabilities, as well as our go-to-market strategy in North America.","Next, I'll cover international markets on Slide 11. Our business continues to perform very well. Revenue is up more than 9% year-to-date, and the international pipeline is the strongest in our company's history. In the quarter, results were driven by strong growth in Latin America, consulting services in Europe and new client implementations in Asia. Based on the robust pipeline and our past success in the international market, we believe FIS is well positioned to continue to drive higher growth in domestic-only providers.","With that as a backdrop, earlier this month, I attended our third annual international conference in London. Overall attendance was up 50% over last year with clients from 45 countries around the world. The event centered on the changing buyer for financial services and the need for financial institution to evolve to new customer interaction models, a sentiment embraced by the international participants. Much like our North American conferences, we expect this client event to influence deals and create new cross-sell opportunities.","Specific to our markets, in Europe, banks continue to face a changing environment, as economic headwinds, increased regulation and a changing financial services landscape persist. While overall IT spending is expected to remain flat, these market dynamics are directing more investment spend to third-party providers like FIS. Our European consulting business continues to generate strong growth. We are engaged in more discussions around our outsourced processing solutions and service capabilities.","As an example, in May, Sainsbury's, a leading retailer in the United Kingdom, announced plans to acquire the remaining 50% ownership in Sainsbury's Bank from Lloyds Banking Group. Sainsbury's also announced the selection of FIS as the bank's new technology partner, whereby we will deliver realtime core banking and back-office processing support on an outsourced basis. We have executed the heads of terms and are generating revenue under our current arrangement. We are very excited about this opportunity and look forward to providing additional details once the bank receives regulatory approval and all agreements have been finalized, which we expect to occur in the third quarter.","In Asia, new banking requirements and the next wave of technology replacements are aiding our core solution opportunities. In addition, financial institutions are increasing their investments in specific channels, including unified payments and serving the underbanked. For example, we continue to see strong increases in our Payments business as we expand our footprint throughout Southeast Asia and India. The India ATM initiative is progressing as planned, and transaction volumes are ramping up in line with our expectations. In addition, we are benefiting from growth within existing clients, such as Karnataka Bank, which also is broadening its ATM presence to reach the underbanked market. Given our experience and successful track record in deploying and managing ATMs in India, we are very optimistic about further expansion in the region.","Turning to Latin America. Brazil continues to be a strong source of growth, and we remain bullish on the region. Our card business continues to deliver double-digit increases, driven by new client additions and continued growth in card usage and adoption. This, in turn, is driving higher demand for our cardholder support services. Having just returned from Brazil, we are very pleased with our performance there. We are encouraged by the opportunity to further expand our offerings in Brazil and across the region, where we have lower penetration.","Next, if you will turn to Slide 12, I will provide a brief update on our go-to-market strategy for global financial institutions. As we discussed on the first quarter call, our target group within this market includes more than 25 of the largest global and multinational financial institutions. To better serve this market, we have built a highly experienced and dedicated global team to focus exclusively on these clients, where we have strong C-suite relationships. This team is highly complementary to our existing bench of financial technology and consulting professionals and will be instrumental in helping us to maximize opportunities in this key market. We look forward to sharing additional details as this plan progresses.","Finally, if you will turn to Slide 13, I will provide additional details about our new commercial agreement with Merchant Customer Exchange. This is potentially one of the most significant payment deals for the industry in the last several years. MCX is the consortium of leading retailers who seek to offer an integrated mobile commerce platform that will enhance the customer experience and strengthen customer loyalty. We are very excited to support this groundbreaking initiative, which, once again, is a testament to the breadth and scalability of our payment solutions. This encompasses the ability to integrate and interface with multiple platforms, our expertise in payment network management and our strong relationships in the financial institution and retail markets.","This strategic agreement includes the design, build and ongoing management of the MCX network within the existing FIS payments network infrastructure. FIS will provide payment processing, payment network infrastructure and payment rails, including the switching, routing and settlement functions. This will enable MCX to authorize and execute transactions in real time. MCX will govern the network rules and economics.","The total financial benefit to FIS could be significant, depending on the overall success of MCX in the broader market. However, under the minimum contractual fees, this is a large sale for FIS and will generate reoccurring revenue spanning the next 7 years. This endeavor is a great example of our ability to leverage our core competencies, technology investments and broad solution suite to drive customer-specific innovation.","In closing, consider the key takeaways outlined on Slide 14. We're confident in our global business strategy and are committed to delivering our plan of operational excellence. We are pleased with our first half performance and remain focused on driving profitable organic revenue growth, which we have seen for 14 consecutive quarters. We continue to drive new sales, as evidenced by the growth in financial institution bookings. And we are encouraged by the strength of the global sales pipeline. Overall, we believe the powerful combination of FIS technology solutions, service capabilities and consulting expertise, coupled with our global scale, offered an unparalleled value proposition in the market.","Again, thank you for joining us this morning. Woody will now highlight our financial results.","James W. Woodall","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 16 with a summary of our consolidated results. Consolidated revenue increased 3.8% to $1.5 billion and grew 3.7% on an organic basis in the second quarter, after normalizing for currency and acquisitions. These results include approximately $14 million in previously disclosed termination fees related to M&I, which partially offset the related loss of high-margin account processing revenue. As we discussed last quarter, these termination fees will decline in the second half of the year.","EBITDA grew 2.8% to $450 million. The EBITDA margin was 29.8% compared to 30% in the second quarter of 2012, reflecting a less favorable revenue mix and higher information security costs. Incremental information security costs reduced the margin by approximately 60 basis points. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 5.5% to $209 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 7.6% to $0.71 compared to $0.66 in the 2012 quarter.","Consistent with our guidance for full year 2013 and as we discussed in last quarter's call, we did not expect the rate of organic growth and margin expansion that we saw in the first quarter to carry forward into the second quarter, given the strong weighting of termination fees early in the year.","For the first half of 2013, revenue increased 4.2% on a reported and organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.5% to $878 million, and the margin expanded 40 basis points to 29.4%. Adjusted earnings per share rose 10.8% to $1.33 per share. We are pleased with our strong first half results, which are in line with our expectations.","Next, I will continue on Slide 17 with the segment review. Financial Solutions revenue increased 4.2% to $587 million in the second quarter and grew 2.7% organically, driven by strong growth in e-banking solutions, global commercial services and consulting revenue. Financial Solutions EBITDA increased 7.5% to $231 million, and the EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points to 39.4%, driven primarily by increased termination fees and higher license revenue compared to the prior year quarter.","While we continue to anticipate mid-single-digit revenue growth within this segment for the year, we expect growth in the third quarter to remain challenging due to the deconversion of M&I accounts in October of 2012.","Turning to Slide 18. Payment Solutions revenue increased 2.8% to $623 million. Revenue increased 4.2%, excluding the check businesses, driven by growth in e-payments and output solutions. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 5.3% to $263 million in the quarter, and the margin increased 100 basis points to 42.2%, driven primarily by higher termination fees. As a reminder, our Payments business follows a seasonal trend of lower revenue in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, due to the increased volumes for processing of tax payments in the second quarter.","Now I'll cover our International business on Slide 19. Organic revenue grew 7.9% in the quarter, led by strong growth in Latin America, including double-digit growth in our -- in Brazil, our European consulting practice and new client implementations in Asia. Growth within our International segment was affected by lower license revenue and a client deconversion in Germany, which caused a 4-point headwind for the quarter.","We expect organic growth in the second half of 2013 to be much stronger with the onboarding of several new clients, such as Sainsbury's, FirstBank of Puerto Rico and Vietinbank, as well as the ongoing ATM expansion in India. We continue to anticipate double-digit growth in International for the year.","The currency impact on International revenue was $6.6 million in the second quarter or about 2 points, resulting in reported growth of 5.6%. Slide 27 in the appendix provides a composition of International revenue by local currency. International EBITDA increased 2.7% to $65 million in the second quarter. EBITDA margin declined 60 basis points to 21.4%, primarily due to the items I described earlier, which impacted the International margin by 190 basis points. The earnings impact from foreign currency rates was not material.","Corporate expense increased $19 million to $109 million in the quarter, driven by increased investments in information security risk management and higher-than-anticipated medical costs. We anticipate corporate expense of approximately $105 million per quarter for the balance of the year.","Next, I'll provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share on Slide 20. GAAP earnings totaled $0.31 per share compared to $0.52 per share in the second quarter of 2012. These GAAP results are adjusted to exclude $0.14 of acquisition-related amortization and $0.14 related to refinancing activities completed in the second quarter. The remaining $0.12 represents an adjustment to the estimated future Capco earnout, driven by the strong year-to-date results and improved expectations about the future performance of this business, which increases the earnout liability. We continue to see strong demand for consulting and services work. This brings us to adjusted earnings per share of $0.71, which is a 7.6% increase compared to $0.66 in the prior year quarter.","The effective tax rate was 30% compared to 29% in the second quarter of 2012. Both periods reflect the favorable resolution of certain tax positions taken by the company. We continue to anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 32% to 33% for the full year 2013.","The average diluted share count declined to 294.3 million in the quarter compared to 298.3 million in the second quarter of 2012. Basic shares outstanding were 292.1 million as of June 30.","Moving on to cash flow on Slide 21. Cash flow from operations totaled $199 million in the second quarter of 2013, after adjusting for the $52 million bond premium payment and the $10 million net change in settlement activity.","Capital expenditures totaled $83 million or approximately 5.5% of revenue, which brings us to free cash flow of $115 million compared to $178 million in the prior year quarter. The decline resulted from higher cash tax payments in the current period. We still anticipate free cash flow for the year to be in line with adjusted earnings. Our use of the free cash flow during the second quarter remained consistent with our capital allocation priorities of investing for growth, returning cash to shareholders and strengthening the balance sheet.","As depicted on Slide 22, we returned more than $188 million to shareholders in the second quarter, including $63 million in dividends and $125 million in share repurchases. We repurchased 2.8 million shares in the open market at an average cost of $44.25 per share. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $225 million. Approximately $424 million remains available under the existing share repurchase authorization.","As we discussed last quarter, we refinanced a portion of our debt in April and issued $1.25 billion in new bonds. In May, we completed the redemption of the $750 million of 7 5\/8% bonds that were due in 2017.","Debt outstanding totaled $4.8 billion as of June 30, up from $4.6 million as of March 31. The weighted average rate declined to 3.8% at quarter-end. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.7x at quarter-end. This is slightly above our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which is at or slightly below 2.5x. We anticipate reaching our target by the end of the year.","Before opening the lines for questions, I will summarize a few key takeaways for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 23. We're pleased with our first half results, which are in line with our expectations. We remain encouraged by the stable to improving macro trends in the market, as evidenced by continuing demand for consulting and services. We are maintaining our outlook for 3% to 5% organic revenue growth and 4% to 6% reported revenue growth. Due to the continually strong demand for consulting and services, we anticipate the EBITDA margin to trend towards the lower end of our guidance for 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion in 2013. We continue to anticipate adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 to $2.87, which is an increase of 11% to 15% over 2012.","Free cash flow is expected to convert at approximately 100% of adjusted net earnings for the full year, and we remain focused on deploying cash in value-enhancing ways, including investing for future growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.","","That concludes our review of the second quarter results. Operator, we can now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Guys, it looks like pretty good execution here. My question is with regards to the 4% to 6% revenue growth range. At this stage, half the year being done, what causes you to be at the lower end of the range versus the upper end of the range? How would you kind of bias that? I understand 3Q is weaker than 2Q, and then that's kind of seasonal, and then you end up with a stronger 4Q, but any comments there?","James W. Woodall","Again, look, our organic revenue for the first half of the year is 4%, and it's in line with our expectations, and we're pretty pleased with it. We continue to see strong demand in services and consulting revenue and have pretty good visibility into the back half of the year. With regard to reported revenue growth, we had mFoundry in there, which has got some growth in there and some of the acquisitions from last year that's driving some additional growth. So we're pleased with our first half of the year and feel comfortable with our growth, but we're not at a point, Ashwin, where we're ready to increase the revenue guidance at this point.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, Ashwin, just to build on Woody's comment, I mean, you're seeing it every quarter. You're continuing to see our sales coming on in very highly, reoccurring, outsourced leveraged transactions. When you look at the Sainsbury's example, when you look at MCX, these take time to convert, take time to ramp up. And we're really seeing a continued decline in bigger license deals, which -- so long term, it's a great outcome for us as a company, but those deals just continue to push and may take longer to onboard and start putting to the revenue line.","Frank R. Martire","And on top of that, we have a very strong pipeline.","James W. Woodall","Yes.","Frank R. Martire","To go with it.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. So as I kind of take those comments and think forward into the rest of this year and 2014, would -- is it safe to kind of say that, as we think about the next 18 months, that hole that's left by M&I is going to be filled at this point?","James W. Woodall","Well, we're not giving '14 guidance at this point, Ashwin, but as we've talked about on previous calls, and as you've seen on this call, we're very pleased with our sales success. We may not get it exactly the way it came of, but a combination of the India ATM deals, Bremer Bank, Webster Bank, Guaranty Bank, Sainsbury's, MCX deal, this [ph] and all these wins are items that will help us fill that hole in 2014.","Gary A. Norcross","Exactly right. I mean, we never thought that we would fill like-for-like on the M&I platform. We knew that our strength of the company is our diversification of product, our diversification of platform, diversification of market. And so you'll continue to see us log these big wins around the globe, and all of those things will help us as we go into 2014.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. And then one last question, information security, obviously, a 60-basis-point hurt to costs this quarter. How much of that is onetime expenses versus things that become part of the base of costs?","James W. Woodall","Yes, I think as we annualize through 2013, it will be more of a normal run rate, if you will. I don't think you've got a lot of onetimes. From an information security and risk standpoint, in Q2, it's much more business as usual. As you read the paper and look at the news, globally, information security and cyber attacks are more prevalent and complicated, more sophisticated than ever, and we have to be prepared to repel and defend against these attacks. So we continue to invest in that area. Information security has always been a top priority for FIS and will continue to be that.","Gary A. Norcross","But there's not a lot of onetime in this. And as Woody said, this is really the new norm, and everybody in this industry are going to be subjected to making those investments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions for you. It seems to me that you guys are having a lot of success on the big deals. But as you had a little bit of a mix headwind, and I think that was probably expected as you move -- had more and more success in the bigger banks and with Capco. In our view, that should give us more confidence on the Street that you have potential upside to sort of the 4%, 5% type organic growth. So as we look forward, should we feel more optimistic on potential upside for the organic growth but just know that they may come with not quite a large margin expansion as we've come to expect? Is that kind of a way to think about the medium term for you all?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, Brett, this is Gary. I think that's well said. I mean, we have forecasted over now for multiple quarters this move towards outsourcing, this move toward services. Certainly, our consulting practice leads the way with an indicator of what's going on in the various markets. And we see that the very positive aspect as well that we're signing these larger, more complex, more transformative deals. I mean, clearly we have the M&I grow-over that we have to deal with, but we deal with grow-overs every year. This one's just -- this one's a little more chunky. But we feel good about our go-to-market. We feel good about the success we're having. We've said also in multiple quarters, the rate at which our license fee business had dropped off was a little faster than I think we thought. We actually don't see that as a bad thing. Once again, I think clients are looking for ways to transform their environments, get costs down, go with a provider that has the scale and capabilities for them to be successful in the future. And we're seeing it in not only our pipeline, as Frank mentioned, which is very robust, but in the signings that we're having every quarter.","Frank R. Martire","Brett, the thing is our clients are looking for the servicing capability. So we have the products, but fortunately, we're well positioned with our servicing offerings that we could give to our clients today. And that's what they're looking for. They're looking for that mix not only of products but all the servicing capabilities.","Gary A. Norcross","So to your margin question specifically, clearly, those -- these larger opportunities come on at lower margin than a license fee transaction. As you know, historically, FIS has always done an excellent job at controlling our costs and getting our costs out margin expansion. But we're always looking for good profitable revenue growth. And so if we have to take a little less margin expansion to get that, we see that as a good outcome. But we'll continue to stay focused on the cost side of the equation as well because we know, as these deals in our pipeline continues to transform, there's going to be areas that we're going to be able to pull down investment and\/or reduce our cost structure to help augment that.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","All right. And just the second question, can you give us any numbers on the bookings this quarter? It sounds like they're going well, although I know it's very hard to think about what MCX and all kind of stuff could potentially be. But could you give us that number? And is there any impact that you're seeing from any additional FDIC or lenders or the things going on there? Could you address that?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, no, it's a good question. We're going to try to not talk about where we are at bookings year-to-date every quarter. But as I said in my prepared remarks, they are definitely up year-to-date and actually up very nicely. When you talk about our Report of Exam, as you know, that's confidential document, but certainly, we're working with our clients on that and, at this point, monitoring it very closely. Our pipeline is very strong, and our booking success was very strong in Q2. We feel we're going to have a good solid Q3 results as well, but we're going to continue to monitor that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","The first one, I just want to drill down on International a little bit. It sounds like Brazil was fine, still on double digits. And I guess most of the somewhat smaller growth, the 8% organic was Europe. And if I heard Woody right, it sounded like a 4-point headwind from a German bank or a client deconversion. Could you just sort of talk through that drag? And was that kind of known and that you kind of expected heading into the year? It sounds like a pretty large client. And then how do we get comfort -- you seemed very confident that will accelerate meaningfully in the back half. How do we get comfort there?","James W. Woodall","I'll take your first big part of the question first. Brazil did see double-digit growth again. We continue to see good growth down there in both new client adds, as well as card adoption and usage, so saw a good growth in Brazil. I think there were some people worried about some of the macro trends down there. We have not seen it to date, so very positive on Brazil. In Europe, our European business did lose a client in Germany. That, combined with lower license fees, were about a 4-point headwind. As Gary and I have talked about with you guys the last couple of quarters, we continue to see a shift between onetime license fees more to ongoing outsourcing revenue, which will be lumpy from quarter to quarter, from time to time. So we did see a client deconversion. We saw some lower license fee in the second quarter. That's not necessarily a bad thing, with the change to license -- to outsourcing from license, but it did have about a 4-point headwind in the quarter.","Gary A. Norcross","Glenn, to build on that, our confidence in Europe -- to your point specifically, while our confidence in Europe, I mean, we definitely don't do this. It's very rare for us to talk about a potential client signing, but since Sainsbury's Bank actually announced that we're the vendor of choice, that certainly -- and we've already got a fairly significant staff engaged there and working on the implementation, we feel very good about Europe in general. We've forecasted that for the last several quarters. With all the consulting activity, we continue to see that grow and rise every quarter, and so we feel good about that. Now we're starting to see some of these large transformational deals we talked about. Now of course, Sainsbury's has got to get regulatory approval, and we got to get the final agreement signed, but they are -- and we do have people engaged there, a fairly significant amount, and they are paying us. So we feel good about where Europe is going.","James W. Woodall","And in the back half of the year, we're still very comfortable with double-digit growth in International.","Gary A. Norcross","Absolutely.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that probably -- and that include both double-digit in Brazil and in Europe?","James W. Woodall","That's aggregate International segment growth double digits.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. I'll take a little bit of that offline. But one more question, the $50 million adjustments related to Capco, and it sounded like related to earnouts?","James W. Woodall","Yes.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about that a bit, like how that's determined, what it's based on and kind of if you have the visibility toward that?","James W. Woodall","Yes, if you look at when we did the acquisition of Capco, there was an earnout connected to revenue and profit performance over a several-year time horizon. As we've looked at Capco's ability to drive additional services in the LFI space or the GFI space, our viewpoint around that division has improved. We believe that their ability to grow the revenue and the profit has improved from our original base case. And what that does is it requires a change in the estimated earnout liability or an increase to the estimated earnout liability. So that's really what drove that acquisition.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So you had initially taken that down, I recall, and now you're taking it back up...","James W. Woodall","That's correct.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Because the outlook looks better?","James W. Woodall","That's correct.","Frank R. Martire","Yes, Glenn, it's actually a win-win situation for us. It's very good for the company, and it's excellent for the Capco personnel also.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you bracket for us what the 3 large contract wins or expansion of existing clients might mean for you long-term? If we look at, for example, Sainsbury's, KeyBank and MCX, how big could these contract signings be, either on a TCV basis or an annualized revenue contribution?","Gary A. Norcross","David, this is Gary. I mean, we're going to try to avoid giving specifics around these contracts as they're confidential. I can certainly -- we feel confident that Sainsbury's will be the largest core banking deal done in Europe that we're aware of, from a sizing standpoint. MCX, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, even just under the minimums to operate the network will be a significant win for us. We judge significant wins as contracts greater than $25 million, just to kind of give you some scoping. Obviously, these would be much larger than that. So -- but in general, these are very, very nice transactions for us and can produce meaningful movement for us.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","When you say greater than $25 million, do you mean TCV or $25 million a year in revenue?","Gary A. Norcross","Correct, TCV. When we've started looking at large contracts, when you get a total contract value of greater than $25 million, we consider that a fairly large transaction. We have -- given our size, as you would imagine, we do thousands and thousands of contracts a year. And so a deal of a size greater than $25 million over the term is a fairly significant deal for us.","James W. Woodall","And David, I mean, Sainsbury's and MCX, both on any metric you look at, they're significant deals.","Gary A. Norcross","Exactly. Exactly.","Frank R. Martire","They're both very significant deals. And it's not only about what they are today but what they could -- potentially could be in the future for us.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. And then just as a quick second question, Gary, could you give us a sense of unit pricing trends in the core financial services business, let's say, starting with kind of community banks, credit unions and working your way up to your larger bank customers?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. It's been pretty consistent, David, and it really has not changed much. We continue to see some price compression on the unit costs. That renewal time around existing services, we typically guide it somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points of headwind. But we also continue to see us take much more wallet share during that process, the renewal process, or throughout the agreement. And so we continue to see renewals as an opportunity to do our cross-sell and up-sell. That's what typically is going on in the community markets, both credit union and community banks. As you move up into, really, the large financial institutions in International, those tend to be much more services-oriented and much more complex transactions, so the whole concept of unit costs are a little different in that market. It tends to be geared around the service of capability, a person or delivery. And those deals are of the size that is just really driven by the market. There's not unique trends because those, when you get the best size, tend to be unique. We shared the unit costs in India. That was an exception when we went through the India process, and as you know, that ended up being -- we disclosed that one, a $0.5 billion CV. And so -- but that one -- those unit costs were very, very profitable. Considering all of the circles that went, they were on the higher end of those circles.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess just the first question I had is on FX. It's pretty straightforward just on the revenue side. But the one nice thing you've got is the big Indian footprint of expenses that we would've expected to help -- just the recent rupee movement to help the expense base a little bit. I'm wondering, maybe you can give -- how big of your -- like what percentage of your expense are in rupees and maybe what that impact is or some sort of formula to help us understand what the impact of the rupee benefits can be.","James W. Woodall","Yes, let me just take you back, looking at revenue, it was about $7 million for the quarter, so a relatively small impact for us, net 2 points on the international growth rate. For earning -- the earnings impact, in the aggregate, was very, very small, minutiae basically. We haven't given out specific India cost base with regard to our exposure or the benefit that we might get out of India. I can tell you for the second quarter, our overall earnings impact around FX rates was just not material there.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. And then the second thing, just reviewing the timing of the M&I termination fees, if I remember right, last Q4 was kind of the beginning of some of those, and then Q1 and Q2 of this year were maybe the highest, and then the back half of this year much lower, and then they're gone by Q1 of '14. Is that about right? Maybe you could size it a little bit.","James W. Woodall","That's right. I think in October, really, it was the actual deconversion. So fourth quarter, you'll definitely see an impact. You will see an impact because we had some heightened services in the third quarter of 2012. So until we annualize that into the fourth quarter, you will still see it as a bit of a headwind in the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones on the technology front. Maybe just to understand a little bit more about the work with MCX that you guys are doing, can you just talk a little bit about the capability itself? Is this a PIN debit offering, an ACH offering? Will there be any credit card functionality? And then lastly, is mFoundry incorporated into the solution that you guys proposed for MCX?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, all good questions, Julio. Let me just start at the top and tell you what it is. Basically, what we're doing is leveraging our network services infrastructure, so we're doing all switching, we're doing all routing, we're doing all settlement, we're doing all network management. If one of our clients happens to be the issuer, then also we'll do the authorization, as you would expect. As far as -- so that's what's in it from an FIS standpoint. So basically, we're running the entire network. We do that -- a lot of that, as you would expect. We do it not only for ourselves. We own a couple of networks, but we also do it for some third parties for some large -- other large networks out there. So this is not a difficult process for us but leveraging a lot of our capabilities, so it's a great win. As far as is mFoundry involved in this transaction today, no, but there are certainly some opportunities as we continue to evolve with mobile, with PayNet, with some of those other things. Today, we -- as I said, it's just that we're doing all the infrastructure work for them. MCX is really going to drive what is offered amongst this network. So we bring value in financial institution exposure. We will help MCX with a lot of financial institutions who want to join the network. But they will decide whether credit will be offered as well today. Certainly, the capabilities are there to offer credit. The -- today, it's going to be a debit-oriented platform, and it's going to be a mobile wallet offering, so more of a card not present at the start. But MCX will be laying out more of their vision and timing for it to roll out in those things.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Will it also have an ACH component?","Gary A. Norcross","There will be a potential for some ACH there as well. As I've said, MCX will drive how they want to settle those transactions. And obviously, if the financial institutions -- once they are a member of MCX, there is definitely going to be a realtime settlement as well.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just staying on the technology themes, a little bit of an update on EMV in terms of what you're seeing with your large clients and your own rollout efforts around EMV.","Gary A. Norcross","Well, we've talked about this on prior calls. Given our size and scale internationally, EMV is not something for us to be worried about. We've been doing EMV for years outside of the U.S. We certainly are rolling it out now domestically. Some of our larger clients are starting to roll that out on a small scale. We are ready for EMV when the market is ready for it. And we continue -- as I said, we do have some limited rollout in the U.S. now, especially in their larger scale clients, where they have a lot of international travel.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just lastly, anything on the regulatory investments side? Would that create any opportunities or tailwind to start thinking about '14 and '15 and the kind of post-Dodd-Frank world, with the increased compliance requirement disclosures? Are you guys seeing any momentum on that front, though, yes, from a demand perspective?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, we've done a number of tuck-in acquisitions recently, right? We've -- and we've got a lot of capabilities to help train our clients around compliance and regulatory. We continue to see consulting services drive across that. Will it be a tailwind for us? We always think that -- we've always said, traditionally, regulatory change is a good thing for FIS. And having been with the company 25 years, I mean, look, over a long period of time, but any time there is a significant regulatory change, it tends to be very positive for FIS.","Frank R. Martire","And we're clearly well positioned for it, Julio, so we do have the products and the capability.","Gary A. Norcross","Absolutely.","Frank R. Martire","And servicing arm to do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Williams with UBS.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of quick ones. First on the deal environment, you had the Harland deal that just came through last week. I know you said it's not a big priority for you to do deals or buy anybody else at this point. But I'm just curious to know what you're just seeing in the environment right now in terms of pricing, in terms of what assets might be out there that could potentially be interesting for either you or potentially anybody else.","Gary A. Norcross","John, I think we're going to stay pretty -- we continue to be committed to our strategy. We think it's a strategy that works. Obviously, we've done a lot of very large transactions over the last 10 to 15 years, culminated with Metavante. Since that time, we're really looking for stuff that really brings us new capabilities or breaks us into new markets. So we're looking more for stuff like mFoundry. We've seen mobile as a great opportunity. We made a minority investment there for years as mobile ramped up. And we think we timed that inflection point of when now mobile is really accelerating. You hear that in our comment. Buying other companies that have other core banking systems, it just brings too much overlap to our client base. And frankly, for us, given where our assets are today and the strength of those assets and the success we're having around them just really brings us a problem. And so we're not interested in doing those kind of transactions today. They just don't -- they don't fit our strategy. But we continue to look for things that do bring us new technology, accelerate and augment things where -- that we already have in our portfolio.","James W. Woodall","Just to add some color around that, again, domestically, we just don't see anything on the horizon. We do continue to look internationally if we can find new markets or new opportunities that can supplement that large growth market.","Frank R. Martire","So, John, if you look domestically, we just have highly competitive core products that we feel really good about. And we just -- honestly, as Gary talked about, and Woody right now, we absolutely don't see the need to acquire or bring in other core products to compete against what we have when, in fact, right now, we feel we have the best in the marketplace.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Just in terms of -- just kind of logical follow-on, I guess capital allocation, it looks like leverage ticked up a bit. Just could you run through your priorities, how you think about using capital at this point and what your intention is surrounding paying down some debt versus doing anything else, like the dividend?","James W. Woodall","Yes, again, we continue to keep it on 3 legs, right, investing for growth, spending 5% to 6% of our revenue back and investing in the business through CapEx. We anticipate keeping our targeted debt at or slightly below 2.5x. It was slightly up on Q2. That's really more seasonality. We tend to tick up slightly in the second quarter and then drive that back down, which we anticipate to drive down the 2.5x or so by the end of the year. And then we've continued to look at share re-buybacks -- or share buyback as an additional way to give value back to shareholders. We bought $100 million in the first quarter, $125 million in the second quarter and have $425 million or so remaining under our authorization. So our capital allocation priorities have remained consistent.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So it does sound like a slight change, though. You had been saying I think 2x to 2.5x, so it's fair to say it's probably closer to 2.5x for the foreseeable future then?","James W. Woodall","Yes, I think we're kind of targeting trying to get down to 2.5x. And then longer term, the target will be at or slightly below 2.5x.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one other confirmation on -- you said international growth, it was FX adjusted. You said you can do double digits there. That was the plan still?","James W. Woodall","That's correct. We still feel very confident in double-digit growth for the full year internationally.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Do you guys see any impact, either directly or indirectly, from the European Commission payment regulations that -- at least the proposed regulations that were put out there recently?","Gary A. Norcross","We really don't. No, Ramsey. I mean, we always monitor that -- those kind of changes, regulatory changes worldwide. But at this time, we don't see any impact.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us an update on the rate of decline, the rate of volume decline you're seeing in your check business? In other words, is it flattening out at all? Or are you still seeing a pretty consistent, steady decrease in the growth rate in that business year-over-year?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, 2 things. So let's -- we always want to make sure we're clear about our check business. There's really 2 check businesses. We have the check authorization at the point of sale. And then we have the -- what we would consider the back-office check processing business for financial institutions. As we've shared with you, we think that the check authorization business at the point of sale will continue to decline, although we are seeing that decline starting to slow. Interesting, on the back-office business, we've also forecasted and we're starting to see that, where our financial institution check processing business is really starting to shallow, we're faster, so the decline is actually slowing. We are actually starting to see -- maybe that's going to even be a headwind for us or turning into a headwind because -- I mean, tailwind, excuse me. As clients start getting their volumes down to a certain level, they are naturally going to want to outsource that function to us. So we actually think, while we said before this is not a business that you would necessarily get into in 2013, given our scale and size, it's going to be -- it's a good business for us. As these volumes continue to come down, more and people want to outsource us.","Frank R. Martire","Right, because as they're losing volumes, the unit cost is going up so high, they're looking to see if they could outsource it.","Gary A. Norcross","That's right.","James W. Woodall","To be specific on the numbers, too, we've typically gotten more of a 10% year-over-year decline. First quarter, I think you saw that more of a 3.5% to 4% type decline. Again, we said one quarter doesn't make a trend, but we have seen second quarter also being that same range of 3.5%, 4%. So...","Gary A. Norcross","Definitely slowing.","James W. Woodall","It's definitely seems to be slowing a bit.","Gary A. Norcross","Which is exactly what we've predicted. As you get more and more personnel volume out of the mix, it's just being augmented. The business volume is not falling off as rapidly.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's great. That makes sense and just really helpful. One last one for me. There's been some coverage in the press lately about NYCE's ability to process signature transactions -- signature debit transactions in a PIN-less format for smaller tickets, sort of sig over PIN as opposed to VISA's PIN over sig kind of capability. Is that something that you see as a potential growth opportunity? Or are we going to see PIN debit network, including NYCE, potentially taking signature share? Or is it still pretty -- is it something you're thinking just kind of pretty nichey.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, Ramsey, at this point, I'm going to put it under the niche column. I couldn't speak to specifics on it, but we'd certainly going to circle back around and follow up with you on it. But the PIN, has not been touting that as a huge opportunity at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on the MCX, obviously, a good win there. I'm just curious how -- there's been a lot of question -- how bank-friendly is the initiative? I'm assuming your core bank customers will obviously be watching it to understand the network infrastructure, the gateway that you're doing. But how are you -- how do you plan on balancing both sides?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, I know, it's a great question. And as you would expect, Tien-Tsin, we've gotten a lot of calls from our financial institution clients. I think, one, what our clients are telling us, there really couldn't be a better partner MCX could have chosen because we are so financially institution-centric. And what I think one of the things MCX saw was our ability to access a very high volume of financial institutions. So I think a lot of the financial institutions are in a wait-and-see, right, exactly what is MCX going to become, what is the volume that is going to get pushed across of it. They see us as a great opportunity to be an intermediator and help negotiate good pricing for the network. So I would tell you the response has been positive, but there is a lot of questions on exactly what MCX is. We're giving our long-standing relationships of driving highly bank-centric networks. They certainly see us as a strong advocate for them to get to a win-win.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. That's a good win. It's definitely a good win. Just on the International, I caught the second half pickup back to double-digit. Anything in the backlog there we should consider that will definitely push it into the double digits?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, I mean, Woody and I both counted Sainsbury's coming on. I mean, that's going to continue to ramp up. That's a very large deal. You're seeing Vietinbank that we doubted coming on. The India ATM rollout is going very well. I'm just very pleased with the results that team is producing. Brazil continues to stay strong. So we think that's going to continue to be a tailwind for us as well. So we're bullish on International for the back half of the year.","James W. Woodall","I think, the back half, it's just the strength in the International pipeline.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, absolutely. Sure.","Frank R. Martire","A combination of pipeline. And if you look at these 3 or 4 significant deals, their opportunity to grow over the next few years is significant.","Gary A. Norcross","Absolutely.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good. Just want to make sure that those are coming, as you suggested. The last one for me, just I caught the question-and-answer on the Europe regulation stuff. Any chance that, that could -- on any change in rules or what have you, any chance that could help Capco from an advisory standpoint? It seems like that's an area where you could help with adopting.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then also put a freeze on spend in the region as well as we're trying to figure out what to actually do. And if I can see both sides of it, just trying to assess if that's the situation.","Gary A. Norcross","Well, I'll tell you, I mean, our consulting business, Capco, it continues to grow very, very nicely, all right, in both Europe and the U.S. So we're very pleased with the growth you see in our accrual we have to make on the earnout. Certainly, activities around regulatory compliance and being able to meet the needs of those regulatory changes or great consulting engagements for our team. We've got some of the -- obviously, we've got -- we feel we got the best consultants in the industry, and so it aligns very well with that. So I think you're right, it can continue to grow further engagements and continue to help propel growth in Europe.","Frank R. Martire","That's a good point because that's really a sweet spot for Capco.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. And then how about just a push towards outsourcing? I can see an argument for banks wanting to cut costs but then also maybe take a wait-and-see view on things.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, well, what happened is we've actually got evidence historically, Tien-Tsin, if you look back -- I don't know if you remember the Barclays announcement several years ago. There was a major regulatory change around lending, and they weren't able to implement it through their legacy systems in time to meet the regulatory challenge. So we were able to pick up Barclays through that transaction on an outsourcing basis. So I think there's going to continue to be opportunities like that. As I said, historically, regulatory change has always been a positive for FIS. You start with the consulting engagement and the training around it, but then customers have to adopt those regulations, and that plays typically very well into our platforms. And since we're the leader in the outsourcing space, it tends to come on in an outsourcing manner.","Frank R. Martire","So it's generally a clear movement towards outsourcing, and that plays well for us.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just one more question. I wanted to make sure I understood or heard you right, the new deal wins, I think you're using the term significant as anything over $25 million in, I think, value. Can you just reiterate what you did say on those? I know you don't want to get too detailed, but can you just reiterate that for us?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. I mean, we view a significant contract, Brett, as anything that's got total contract value of $25 million. Clearly, we signed a lot of deals that are a lot larger than that. The India ATM deal was worth $0.5 billion just on TCV, and that should suggest to you guys we're conservative in nature. So when we calculate this internally, we look at what are the minimums that have to be paid under that contract, not what the future could hold, right, to judge the sizings. And so certainly, when we look at Sainsbury's, when we look at MCX, these are substantially larger than what we would -- what we consider a large transaction for us.","Frank R. Martire","And that's what's in the minimum...","Gary A. Norcross","Right.","Frank R. Martire","Outside of the potential for growth.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And so the India deal is $500 million total contract value to you guys or in total for the whole thing, and you got a chunk of it?","James W. Woodall","No, to FIS.","Gary A. Norcross","That's for FIS. And so once again, those are -- we adjust that off minimums or from a conservative standpoint. So we would expect nothing but upside when we talk about contract sizing.","Frank R. Martire","Potential should be larger.","Mary K. Waggoner","Thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Mary Waggoner, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Mary K. Waggoner","Thank you, Paul. Welcome to everyone joining us today for our second quarter earnings report. Joining me today are Frank Martire, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Gary Norcross, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hayford, Chief Financial Officer. Today's news release and supplemental slide presentation have been posted to our website at fisglobal.com. A replay of today's presentation will be available shortly after the call.","Please refer to the Safe Harbor language on Slide 3 of the presentation. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.","As a reminder, today's discussion will focus on results from continuing operations, reflecting the reclassification of our Healthcare business as a discontinued operation. Also included in discontinued operations are expenses related to our former BPO operation in Brazil.","Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide more meaningful comparisons between the periods presented, as outlined on Slide 4. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachment to the press release and the supplemental slide presentation.","Now if you will turn your attention to Slide 6, I will turn the call over to Frank Martire. Frank?","Frank R. Martire","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll begin today's business review with a brief summary of our financial performance and business highlights for the second quarter. Gary will follow with the operations report and Mike will provide additional insight into our financial results and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","We are very pleased with our strong second quarter financial results. Organic revenue growth was 5.1%, driven by continued solid performance across all businesses. EBITDA increased 7.7% and the EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points to 30%. Earnings per share totaled $0.66, which represents a 22% increase compared to the second quarter of 2011. As you can see from the chart on the right, we have seen steady improvement in organic growth, driven by execution of our business plan and improved confidence within the banking industry compared to 2009.","I will now continue with Slide 7. In June, we announced a definitive agreement to divest our Healthcare business. The sale is consistent with our primary focus on serving financial institutions and operating in markets where we have meaningful scale. We expect to complete the sale by the end of the third quarter. We'll provide additional details regarding the transaction later on the call.","We continue to maintain a strong focus on serving our clients and expanding relationships. I recently visited with several key clients and business leaders across the United States, as well as Europe and Brazil. The feedback from these meetings provided me with even greater confidence that our time, efforts and resources are focused in the areas that are most important to our clients and that the overall business strategy is working. Finding new sources of growth, improving overall profitability and differentiating through institutions from the competition rank high on our clients' list of priorities, as do managing risk and regulatory compliance. Our proven ability to deliver industry-leading solutions and provide value to our clients through leverage and scale are among the many advantages that FIS brings to our clients.","During the second quarter, I met with several clients to provide them with an update on our business and the improvements we are making in the area of information security and risk management. These conversations have been very productive. Gary will provide more detail later on the call. I am very pleased with our strong performance through the first half of 2012, and we are positioned to achieve our full-year objectives.","As always, our management team and employees are focused on serving our clients, executing the strategy that we communicated at our Investor Day in February and driving value for our shareholders.","Now I will turn it over to Gary for the business report. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross","Thanks, Frank, and thanks to everyone for being with us today. My presentation begins on Slide 9. I'll cover some of the business highlights for the quarter and provide updates on information security and the status of the M&I migration plan.","I'll start with North America. Ongoing client engagement is the top priority for our account managers and sales team. As we have discussed in the past, this direct engagement is one of the many ways we identify and close cross-sell opportunities across our client base. In May, we hosted our large financial institution client conference in Milwaukee. Similar to our community bank conference in April, the atmosphere was focused on the future and how FIS can help our clients be more successful in this challenging economic, regulatory and competitive environment.  We are seeing continued strength around demand for professional services, outsourced technology and consulting expertise. The demand is being driven by several market trends that are forcing financial institutions to reevaluate their business models, including emerging mobile technologies, increased regulatory compliance costs and higher capital requirements.","These trends are also driving growth within Capco, which delivered solid revenue growth and margin expansion in both North America and Europe in the second quarter. The team has worked through the large client loss in North America, diversified the client base, and the business is performing in line with our expectations.","We continued to add new clients in the quarter, including several new core processing relationships. As we have discussed in the past, these relationships drive strong reoccurring revenue and provide cross-sell opportunities for additional Financial and Payment Solutions.","For example, Cadence Bank, a long-time FIS core processing client, recently expanded its relationship through the deployment of several new solutions, including our debit, ATM driving and fraud management solutions.","I am also very pleased to announce a new 7-year agreement with a leading provider of indirect automotive loans and leases in North America. This new relationship, which further confirms FIS as the leader in global auto finance technology, includes outsourced consumer loan and lease processing, as well as our default management and sales and service solutions.","As Frank mentioned, risk and compliance are key areas or the focus for our clients, particularly given the current regulatory environment. Our recent acquisitions of ICS Risk Advisors and Memento are resonating very well with financial institutions as they work to manage their higher workloads associated with risk and regulatory compliance. ICS has increased its sales over the prior year, including cross sales to existing FIS clients. We have also received strong interest from clients regarding Memento to -- which we expect to translate into new business.","We are also seeing solid demand for our wealth management solutions. We added several new clients in the first half of 2012, including the new agreement with First Farmers and Merchants Bank, which we announced last week.","As we discussed last quarter, we have seen growth within our NYCE debit business as a result of the Durbin Amendment. Looking ahead, we are somewhat more cautious in light of Visa's aggressive pricing. To put it in perspective, while NYCE is a great business, it generates less than 3% of our total revenue.","We have seen improved growth and strong margin expansion within our Payments business over the past 3 quarters. We expect the second half of 2012 to be somewhat more challenging due to a planned client deconversion, more difficult comparisons and some uncertainty related to the Visa pricing changes that I mentioned earlier.","Overall, sales in the first half of the year were comparable to the first half of 2011, driven by new sales to nonfinancial institutions. I am pleased to announce that we will soon begin providing mainframe computing services to one of the country's largest mobile phone carriers. Opportunities like this leverage our processing environment and provide profitable, long-term, reoccurring revenue streams.","Sales to North American financial institutions declined in the second quarter relative to the prior year. Although we believe the letter that regulated financial institutions received in the first quarter may have caused a delay in closing some deals that we expected to sign in the second quarter, we think it's a timing issue. And we do not believe we have lost any significant new business as a result of the letter.","One of the benefits of having a broad solution set and diverse client base is that the success we are having in signing new global commercial and international clients is helping to offset some of the delays we experienced in sales to North America financial institutions in the second quarter. While we will continue to monitor the North American financial institutions sales activity, we are very encouraged with the overall strength of the sales pipeline.","Turning to Slide 10. I will provide an update on the status of the M&I migration project. As we have discussed throughout 2011, FIS provides multiple core and payment solutions to both M&I and BMO Harris. We have been working on a plan to consolidate the respective core and payment platforms since BMO Harris announced plans to acquire M&I approximately 18 months ago.","In the second quarter, we gained more clarity around the migration plan. As we have stated in the past, we will continue to have a substantial relationship with the combined entity going forward. While we continue to negotiate terms and service agreements for the various solutions, we now expect to transition the legacy M&I accounts from our fully outsourced core processing solution to the bank's in-house FIS platform in the fourth quarter of 2012. The bank will continue to license our software and FIS will provide ongoing support and professional services under an application management agreement.","As we've previously discussed, we do not expect any significant impact to our 2012 results. Based on discussions in the second quarter, we continue to anticipate a revenue impact in 2013. Also, given the magnitude of the overall relationship and the opportunity to provide more services to BMO in the future, we anticipate foregoing a short-term benefit in 2013 in favor of a long-term strategic relationship with the eighth largest bank in North America. Mike will discuss the expected financial impact later in the call.","As we discussed earlier, we are very encouraged by the overall strength of our sales pipeline. We will continue to work aggressively to drive new sales to backfill any excess capacity created by the change in our ongoing relationship with BMO.","Next, I will provide an update on our international business on Slide 11. In May, we hosted our second annual international conference in Dubai. Overall attendance was up 20% compared to last year, with clients from 26 countries around the world, representing all international regions. Topics touched a broad range of industry issues, including innovation in banking, managing risk and compliance as well as leveraging FIS capabilities around outsourcing and services.","We are pleased with the continued sequential and year-over-year growth trends in our international operations. As we expected, organic revenue growth improved to 10% in the second quarter and the margin increased by 110 basis points. All major regions delivered solid performance.","Our European business continues to perform well. We are seeing demand for professional services, including the ING implementation project, which began in the fourth quarter of 2011. As we have discussed in the past, the majority of our core processing and payment solutions are mission-critical and enable our clients to operate on a daily basis. Our European business is focused primarily on Northern Europe, and less than 1\/2 of 1% of our consolidated revenue comes from clients in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain.","Similar to what we are seeing in North America, the challenges created by increased regulation and a difficult economy continue to drive demand within Capco's European practice, which has experienced strong growth since we acquired the company in 2010.","We continue to pursue opportunities in emerging markets, including Brazil, India and China, as overall growth within these countries is expected to outpace the U.S. by anywhere from 2x to 4x. Our Brazil joint venture continues to perform well, driven by continued growth in card issuance, transaction volumes and support services.","We are also making good progress to expand our presence in the Asia Pacific region. I am very pleased to announce that we recently completed a large core implementation project for BAAC, which has approximately 20 million customer accounts and operates more than 1,000 branches in Thailand. We are also excited about opportunities to grow our Payments business throughout the region, including India, where we currently support nearly 4,000 ATMs.","Next, if you will turn to Slide 12, I will address our continued focus on information security. Over the past year, we have spoken about the cyber attack that occurred in the first quarter of 2011 and the personnel and technology improvements that we have made to our business in 2011 and 2012. On our first quarter call, we also acknowledged the receipt of a regulatory letter that was distributed to our regulated financial institution clients in March of 2012.  We continue to address the recommendations described in the letter and are taking additional steps to strengthen our information security.","We have also engaged additional third-party experts to analyze the security of our systems, including ongoing assessment and monitoring with respect to the 2011 cyber attack and to validate to our customers the improvements that we have made or continuing to make -- and continuing to make to information security.","The security issue has created opportunities for us to proactively engage with clients to solicit their feedback and to discuss how FIS can assist our clients in meeting their future business needs. Information security will remain a top priority for FIS in 2012 and beyond.","In closing, I'd like to leave you with the following key takeaways, which are outlined on Slide 13: We continue to deliver on our plan to drive revenue growth and margin expansion, as evidenced by the 5.1% organic growth and 120-basis-point margin expansion in the second quarter and our strong performance year-to-date; we expect to transition the legacy M&I accounts from our fully outsourced solution to an in-house FIS licensed solution in the fourth quarter of 2012.","While we will face some near-term headwinds, the good news is that we expect to have a long-term relationship with BMO, and we are optimistic that we can further expand our relationship with the bank over time.","And as I stated at the beginning of my presentation, we remain focused on generating new sales and driving value to our clients.","Again, thank you for joining us this afternoon. I'll now turn it over to Mike for the financial report.","Michael D. Hayford","Thanks, Gary. As a reminder, the Healthcare business has been classified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented as a result of the definitive agreement that we executed on June 25. In accordance with GAAP, revenues and expenses from discontinued operations are collapsed and classified as a separate line item on the income statement.","In the second quarter of 2012, we -- and EBITDA by approximately $32 million and $11 million, respectively and reduced earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.02. We furnished an 8-K on July 3 to recast our historical financial results to reflect the Healthcare business as a discontinued operation.","I'll continue the presentation on Slide 15. Consolidated revenue increased 3.1% to $1.5 billion in the second quarter. Organic growth, after being normalized for currency and acquisitions, was 5.1%, driven by growth in processing volumes, higher professional services and consulting revenues and payment transaction growth. Second quarter EBITDA increased 7.7% to $438 million. The EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points to 30.0%, reflecting organic revenue growth and disciplined cost management.","Next, I will provide additional detail on the operating segments, starting with FSG on Slide 16. Financial Solutions revenue increased 9.1% to $563 million compared to the second quarter of 2011 and grew 7.8% organically, driven by growth in account processing, professional services, consulting and global commercial services.","As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with the improved performance within Capco's North American consulting practice. The team has done a nice job of selling through the large client loss in 2011 and improving profitability.","Financial Solutions EBITDA increased 3.2% to $215 million compared to $208 million in the 2011 quarter. The EBITDA margin was 38.2% compared to 40.3% in the prior year, reflecting higher professional services revenue and consulting revenues and growth in the global commercial services. The margin was also impacted by the increased spending related to security and infrastructure improvements.","Next, I will provide some additional details regarding the M&I core migration project. At the February 14 Investor Day, we stated that we expected a revenue impact in 2013. We also stated that we anticipated being able to preserve the earnings from the M&I relationship in 2013 based on our contract.","During the second quarter, as Gary mentioned, we gained more clarity regarding the M&I migration plan. We expect to complete the core migration in the fourth quarter of 2012. Although we do not yet have a new agreement, we are currently estimating approximately $60 million decline in annual EBITDA run rate. We expect the impact in 2013 to be about half of that.","Just to be clear, we are not providing guidance for 2013. We are simply updating what we now know about M&I, specifically that we anticipate giving up a portion of the contractual fee in 2013 in exchange for a long-term relationship with BMO. Consistent with our prior communication, the impact on 2012 is already included in our guidance.","As showing on Slide 17, Payment Solutions revenue increased slightly to $606 million. Revenue increased 2.7%, excluding the check businesses, driven by continued growth in electronic payments, including our PIN debit network and EFT processing and bill payment. Payment Solutions EBITDA increased 8.6% to $250 million compared to $230 million in the second quarter of 2011. The EBITDA margin increased 310 basis points to 41.2% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 38.1% in the second quarter of 2011, driven by growth in electronic transactions and cost management initiatives.","Turning to international on Slide 18. International revenues declined 1.9% on a reported basis and grew 10% organically, excluding a $35 million currency impact. The increase was driven by growth in our European processing and consulting businesses, higher card issuance and usage in Brazil and our expanded presence in Asia, including the BAAC implementation that Gary discussed.","International EBITDA increased 3.4% to $63 million compared to $61 million in the prior-year quarter. The margin improved 110 basis points to 22% compared to 20.9% in the prior year. Foreign currency exchange rates reduced revenue by $35 million in the second quarter. There was no material impact to our consolidated earnings as the currency benefit related to our Capco operations in India helped to mitigate the impact of currency on our international results.","Please turn to Slide 19 for a reconciliation of net earnings. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations totaled $156 million in the second quarter. Adding back the $42 million in an after-tax purchase amortization resulted in adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $198 million, which is an increase of 18.1% compared to the prior year. Weighted average shares totaled 298 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 311 million shares in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 22.2% to $0.66 a share compared to $0.54 per share in the second quarter of 2011.","The effective tax rate declined to 29% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 32% in the prior-year quarter and 34% in the first quarter of 2012. The lower rate is due to the favorable resolution of certain tax provision -- positions taken by the company. We now anticipate a full year effective tax rate of approximately 33% for 2012, which for modeling purposes, equates to 34% in the third and fourth quarters.","As shown on Slide 20, cash flow from operations totaled $259 million in the second quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures increased to $91 million compared to $68 million in the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to the additional investments we are making in information security. Free cash flow, which excludes settlement activity, totaled $178 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared to $185 million in the prior-year quarter. The decline was due to a required payment of $28 million to our Brazil joint venture partner in the second quarter of 2012.","Next, on Slide 21. We continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy, which includes ongoing investments in business, strengthening the balance sheet, returning excess cash to shareholders and acquiring new products to cross sell to our clients.","Total debt outstanding as of June 30 was $4.9 billion and the weighted average interest rate declined slightly to 4.6% compared to March 31. During the second quarter, we paid off our term loan B, which we believe is another step on the path to investment grade.","Debt to EBITDA was 2.9x -- sorry, 2.8X at the end of the quarter.","During the quarter, we paid $59 million in shareholder dividends and repurchased 1.5 million shares at a cost of $50 million. We returned approximately $270 million in cash to shareholders in the first half of 2012. We have $950 million in remaining share authorization under the existing plan, and we expect to use our operating cash to buy approximately 50 million of stock per quarter for the remainder of 2012.","We also completed the ICS, Memento acquisitions in April for a combined cost of approximately $45 million. We will continue to look for additional product-focused acquisitions to drive higher cross sales through our global distribution channels.","Now if you turn to Slide 22, I will provide additional details regarding the sale of our Healthcare business, which we announced on June 25. We expect to complete the sale by the end of the third quarter. As Frank described, the divestiture is consistent with our strategy to focus primarily on businesses where we have scale and can utilize our global distribution channels to sell additional products and services.  The transaction was valued at $335 million in cash, and we expect to receive net proceeds of $220 million after tax upon closing.","The sale is expected to reduce full year 2012 earnings from continuing operations by up to $0.07 per share. We expect to use the proceeds from the sale in a manner that is consistent with our capital allocation strategy to offset the dilutive impact. As a result, we do not expect the sale to have a material impact on earnings per share in 2013.","We expect to incur an after-tax GAAP loss of approximately $55 million or $0.19 per share upon completion of the sale in the third quarter. The loss will be included in discontinued operation.","Before opening the line for questions, I will provide a few key takeaways from today's overview, as summarized on Slide 23. We are executing the strategy that we communicated at the February 14 Investor Day, namely, driving organic growth and margin expansion, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and focusing on tuck-in product acquisitions.","While sales to North American financial institutions declined in the second quarter, we believe it's a timing issue. We do not believe we have had significant losses of a new business as a result of the regulatory letter.","In the second quarter, we gained additional clarity on the M&I core migration plan. As we have discussed in the past, we do not expect any significant impact on the 2012 results related to the planned fourth quarter conversion. We anticipate a future EBITDA run rate impact of approximately $60 million a year, and we expect that the impact in 2013 will be reduced by approximately half that amount due to contractual fees. Again, this impact is specific to updated information regarding M&I. We will provide overall guidance for 2013 during our next year's investor conference.","We are off to a good start for the year. While we expect a more challenging second half due to the planned client deconversions and more difficult comparisons in our Payments business and ongoing investments in risk management, information security, we are well positioned to deliver on our 2012 growth targets and EBITDA margin expansion.","Last, as outlined on Slide 24, after adjusting our previous guidance for the sale of the Healthcare business, which is now expected to reduce our overall earnings in 2012 by up to $0.07 a share, we are raising our full-year outlook from continuing operations to $2.45 to $2.55 due to more favorable effective tax rate.","Operator, you can now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, and I guess first of all, just a little more clarity on the M&I, Harris relationship. I think I remember back when Metavante was acquired, you were at about $120 million revenue run rate, and I know Harris adds a little bit more to that. But it seems like a pretty high incremental margin if you're only losing part of that revenue and to lose $60 million of EBITDA. I mean, is that just it, that it is very high incremental margin?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. David, this is Gary. Obviously, one of the benefits to our environment is when you operate fully outsourced environments on highly leveraged platforms, those incremental margins can be very high. We'll continue to have a significant relationship with BMO Harris going forward. In fact, they'll still be a top 10 client. We certainly think we'll drive higher revenue through our professional services engagement as well. And obviously, we'll continue to sell additional clients onto that platform. But at the end of the day, we're going to have a very strong relationship with them going forward.","Frank R. Martire","David, that's right. That's very important to us. They're clearly a top-tier bank and one that we really want to build a very large relationship with and one that we've had a great partnership with over many years.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, okay. And there's no reason over a long period of time that you couldn't build it back up pretty significantly, right?","Gary A. Norcross","Absolutely.","Frank R. Martire","Absolutely, that's what we'll do.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then the second one is last few years, the second half EBITDA margin has usually been about 3% better than the first half EBITDA margin. This year, the way the guidance is kind of setting up is for a little less. It looks more like 200 basis points better, maybe even a little less than that in the second half relative to the first half. Is that because some of the -- the growth might be coming on at a little lower margin? Or is it conservatism? Or maybe you can kind of fill us in on that.","Michael D. Hayford","Well, I think we had a very strong start to the year, obviously. We had some -- particularly in payments, we had some revenue come out at very strong margins. And so I think it's a great start to the first half of the year. I think we've got, as we referenced, some challenging comps in the second half, and we have some clients who have been deconverting. So it's a little bit different than we saw last year, but that's how we anticipate the year to fold out.","Operator","We have a question from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding sort of the pipeline and sales activity. So maybe this question is for Gary. If I heard right, North America sales was down a little bit year-over-year. But in aggregate, you were sort of saying sales was kind of flat year-over-year. Maybe you can just sort of give me a little bit of help on sort of the environment and, sort of more importantly, pipeline activity.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. No, it's a great question. I appreciate you asking for the clarification. All in all, our sales were on par for the full year when you look at our international sales, our nonfinancial institutions sales. Clearly, within North American financial institutions in the second quarter, we saw a little slowdown. As we mentioned, we don't feel we've lost any business due to our clients getting a letter from the regulators, although we will say we've had a number of conversations, and we do think that some of those deals got delayed into the third quarter. But we're very confident based on our pipeline, not only in financial institutions, but also in nonfinancials and international, we're going to continue to end the year very strong.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So other than the letter that went out, I mean, I guess a lot of people are sort of concerned about the macro environment, sort of spending activity levels, and there's -- obviously, there's been a lot of mixed messages from a lot of the big IT services companies regarding North American financial services. So was there anything beyond just sort of the letter kind of stemming deal closures?","Gary A. Norcross","We're not -- we're -- not really. I mean, at the end of the day, we actually -- the number of deals that we had signed to financial institutions were actually up. So our clients are making decisions. We think some of our bigger deals just got pushed into the third quarter because we're having other conversations. And so, at the end of the day, our clients, especially financial institutions worldwide, they're all dealing with regulatory challenges, frankly, unprecedented regulatory challenges. They're generating a very, very, obviously, difficult economy. But even as the economy rebounds, they're trying to figure out how to reinvent themselves. So we saw strong growth in our professional services business. So we can't lose sight of that as well. So all in all, we still think we can get back what we missed in the second quarter on the full year within financial institutions. And we think nonfinancial as well as international is going to continue to have a strong year.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then how about, quickly, an update on Capco, sort of thinking both North America and Europe and particularly interested in activity for transformational larger deals, sort of leveraging both Capco and FIS products.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. Well, Capco was up significantly. They had a fantastic quarter, and it was both in North America and in Europe. And we continue to see Capco's consulting business, as I said, grow very strongly, and most of it is around more transformative type consulting engagements. I'll tell you, the way our teams are working, our sales teams and our business lines with Capco, both in North America and Europe, we're very pleased with. And that organization is certainly performing within our expectations at this time.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Any way to put a number on the Capco growth?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, I mean, we haven't really carved Capco out. What we shared last year is they were a little behind our expectations and plan. And we're excited that in second quarter, they're ahead of the plan and expectations for them. So the size, you saw the size. We acquired them, it was around a little over $200 million. And so, obviously, we saw growth from that point.","Operator","We have a question from David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Mike, could you quantify some of the underlying drivers of the 310 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in Payment Solutions in the quarter? And if you adjust for the BMO Harris fourth quarter anticipated impact, to what extent are some of these underlying drivers onetime in nature or sustainable?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, I mean, the PSG margin, you could see we had some revenue growth, but we clearly had much stronger EBITDA growth in that business. And the teams continue to find ways to drive efficiency in PSG. So these are activities and actions that we have taken in the last fall heading into 2012. And then, quite frankly, they had some decent transaction volumes. We had good volumes, nice first half of the year. We had good volumes in our debit issuing business. We had good volumes in bill pay. So those transactions come on at very high incremental margins. So that's what's driving the PSG side. The BMO Harris fourth quarter, we had -- looking at where we're going to be for the year, where we're going to end up, we declared in the second quarter, we feel comfortable with where we're at in '12. And that business comes off, and then as Gary talked about, team's got to go out and refill the hole, if you will. We've got to bridge in '13, and then we've got to put some new clients back on those platforms and that's -- the teams are out looking to do.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Any specific large buckets of efficiencies to point to, whether it be data center consolidation or procurement?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, I think it's a little of everything. We talked at Investor Day that we're kind of finalizing the activities that we've done on the merger synergy plan with Metavante. It's now blocking and tackling a lot of little things. So the team continues with the consolidating, particularly like in item processing, where the volumes are going down, they've done an outstanding job of consolidating the number of centers that we operate. They'll keep doing that. But whether it's center cost or procurement or the operating cost, they're just good execution right now.","Gary A. Norcross","David, we do that as a course of business, always. And then we'll have a little bit more focus on this during the budget process.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. And, Mike, could you quantify the annual increase in information security spending that we should expect?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, I mean, we talked about -- we didn't do a specific number, but we talked about reinvesting some of the incremental margin improvement that we would have seen in '12 back into the business, specifically infrastructure and information security. So it's a number that has an impact, obviously. And we've talked about some of the things we're doing to improve our environment. But we'll continue to spend throughout '12, and there'll be spending going forward. But there's obviously a little bit of a bump in '12 as we catch up some activities.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. David, this is Gary. And then, obviously, this is just something that is part of the business now. And I mean it's a -- the bar has been raised, it should be. And all providers are going to have to make investments in this space going forward.","Operator","We have a question from Greg Smith with Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to be sure I understand the BMO, M&I issue. So it's $30 million of EBITDA that you're going to lose in 2013? And then the full run rate, $60 million, all things being equal you'd lose in 2014?","Michael D. Hayford","So the $60 million is the annualized run rate. And again, we're talking specifically to the consolidated impact of BMO Harris and M&I consolidating the environments together. So the $60 million is a run rate next year with -- and again, we're getting information it's not finalized because we haven't finalized the deal with them yet. But we anticipate in '13 that $60 million will be mitigated by half due to our contractual arrangement.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And is that -- how does that time throughout the year?","Michael D. Hayford","Again, the activity would end -- most of the migrations would be done by the fourth quarter of '12. And then -- so we will have that spread probably throughout '13.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just thinking about the impact of currency, it definitely seemed like you had benefited from your captive in India. Is there any way to size that, what the total number of expenses are in India?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. We obviously -- and again, that is --  it's predominantly captive activities we do there. We use it to support our product sets that are based in the U.S. And because of that, it was favorable to us. Obviously, that gave us kind of a hedge against some of the diminution we saw in other parts of the world. But it's a small number. At the end of the day, the delta between what the impact was in the international side versus the benefit we got from our captive probably netted out less than a few pennies.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just as we think about currency exposure in other markets, I guess, Brazil and then thinking about Brazil and then Capco, are things pretty well matched up where in Brazil, you have significant expenses there matched against the revenue, and same for Capco. I mean, therefore, you're always somewhat hedged on the expense side? There's no big mismatch, is there?","Michael D. Hayford","No. I think that's to -- really, around the globe for us that Brazil is very matched. The expenses we have driving that are based on in Brazil. Our European operations, whether it's Capco, whether it's the other centers that we operate, the costs are in-country, so same currency. So the only one that's mismatched has some benefit for us right now, which is India.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then what -- just, Mike, do you have a rough estimate for the tax rate in 2013, which we...","Michael D. Hayford","Wow. No, I mean, we -- again, we're excited about the benefit we got in the second quarter, but it changes the rate to our -- to the good. But why don't we wait until we do the whole '13? And we've been in the 33% to 34% range now a couple of years, but we got to do a little planning before I give you a number.","Operator","We have a question from John Kraft with D.A. Davidson.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I wanted to go back to that mobile telco win you talked about. And I guess my question is if there is an opportunity to leverage it into a new vertical or is this just a one-off, I guess particularly in light of your plans to divest out of the health vertical?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, John, this is Gary. Obviously, we have been committed to these types of businesses for a number of years. We're -- really what we're doing is selling computing services to adjacent markets that leverage our existing structure. So we deliver a lot of mainframe services to financial institutions, as you would expect. So the ability to leverage that excess capacity and underwrite our overall delivery cost at very nice margins to nonfinancial institutions. So no, we have no plans of divesting this type of business. It's just a natural leverage for our significant data processing footprint in North America.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And there's opportunity for other potential telcos, you think?","Gary A. Norcross","Absolutely. It's been a high-growth area for us. That team has done a very good job finding opportunities that leverages our existing capacity, and I think that's something very important that we focus on in the sales cycle. We're not after looking for non -- for services that we don't already have scale in. So mainframe is a great example where we bring significant scale.  Server management's something where we bring significant scale. And so these are opportunities that allow us to underwrite our delivery cost to the financial institution marketplace, allows us to help us expand our margins as we're bringing more scale on the platform, getting more efficiencies out on it.","Frank R. Martire","And John, we execute very well there, so we have a good reputation.","John Kraft - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess just one more, if I could on the M&I conversion.  Specific to the move from the -- or to the in-house license that will happen, I guess, in Q4 this year, is there a -- I know it's in guidance, but is there a revenue chunk that you'll get from that conversion?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, John, I mean, M&I -- keep in mind, we've had a long-standing relationship with M&I on an outsourcing basis. We've had a long-standing relationship with BMO Harris. Some things, on an outsourced basis, the core banking system has been run in-house for years. So as you would expect, when we do -- when our clients do acquisitions, a lot of times they engage us through professional services activities to help convert those clients onto their platform. So we have -- that's very typical for us, and that's one of the drivers of our professional services numbers. Ongoing, we're going to continue to have a very large relationship with BMO Harris. And so all we were doing was bringing clarity that getting an extension in a contract and a long-term agreement with the eighth largest bank in North America is proven, given the size of our company and where we think the market's going. So we'll have a good, long-term relationship with them.","Operator","We have a question from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to maybe just start off real quickly with the financial services segment and outsourcing in terms of demand. Can you just parse through a little bit on the demand side, large clients versus small clients? Any distinctions to call out there in terms of the cadence?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, clearly, in the smaller market, we're seeing massive movements to outsourcing. We've been saying that for years. And I would tell you, we continue to see that trend. We've also continued to see a very large trend towards outsourcing in the large financial institution marketplace as well, but it's not near as advanced as what you would say in the classic community markets. Also, when you're in the large financial institution, we're seeing a lot more services business driven there. So every quarter, we've seen growth in our professional services business, and we think that trend is going to continue. But we do think there's a big opportunity in the large financial institution space for outsourcing business. We've signed some significant outsourcing in the LFI space all so far this year. And fact of the matter or even a very -- a deal that we had in the second quarter, we\u2019re counting on the second quarter, got pushed into this quarter. We actually signed today. So we'll be announcing that here over the next several weeks. So we're seeing good movement in and around outsourcing, for sure.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just on the nice part of the business segment. I think you guys said that it was around 3% of revenue. Is there some thought there on whether that business can get any bigger or any way to think about the growth potential of that business? Or is this just a business that just stays under the kind of pressure that we're seeing right now given some of the competitive dynamics there?","Gary A. Norcross","We think it still has opportunity. The team has done an excellent job coming up with both offensive and defensive strategies in that business, as we've shared with you over the last couple of quarters. We saw some nice growth through the Durbin Amendment. Obviously, we're seeing some of our transactions slow with some of the deep end pricing. But we've got a number of strategies ourself we're deploying. And we feel good about some of the early results of those strategies. So we think that solution has -- still has some growth in the future for us.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the international side, big bead relative to our numbers on the margin front. Can you just walk through what drove some of that upside in the international margins or at least relative to the numbers that we had?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, at the end of the day, keep in mind, our international business -- and we've talked about it for years, so our international margins have always been less than what we've seen in the domestic U.S. But what we've consistently said is as we build scale in the countries that we're focused on, right, we're going to continue to see expanding margins of that. So the team has done a great job selling. Frankly, we're continuing to see a move towards outsourcing, even in international. And I think you're starting to see our overall software license fees continue to get smaller. And so as that scale comes up in those various countries, whether it's Brazil, whether it's Europe or the U.K. or in Asia, some of the deals we mentioned, those transactions and those accounts and those new clients come on at very high margins for us. So -- and also, the team does an excellent job controlling costs. I mean, Frank talks about it. We execute our business every day looking for opportunities to become more efficient, and then we continue to drive our sales force through incentives to close as much business as possible. So really, it's nothing more than good sales execution, good cost control and scale in the markets we're operating in.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So barring a large contract award or some new investment initiative, this level that you guys have reached should be sustainable?","Gary A. Norcross","Oh, yes. No, we -- absolutely. And we still think there's opportunities to grow our margins, keep in mind, in all of our markets.","Operator","We have a question from Peter Heckmann with Avondale Partners.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I had a follow-up on -- and I know that some of these negotiations are ongoing, but it sounds to me as if the M&I-BMO Harris consolidation, maybe that a portion of that $60 million loss of EBITDA is coming from a onetime contract termination payment. And if so, which quarter would we expect that to come in?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, again, what we're doing with BMO Harris, because we had really relationships in -- on both sides of that, so we're really taking a contractual -- typically, if you have a relationship and your investment gets acquired, you have a termination fee in that situation. Here, we have an ongoing relationship. So we've really tied together the ongoing portion, and as Gary talked, an extension of that relationship with the migration of M&I. So it's a little different than a typical termination works, because it's not termination in this situation. And so it'll -- we just don't anticipate a onetime bump that will hit a specific quarter as opposed to just kind of a transition through the current relationship down to where we just give you an expectation then after '13.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for some of the big pieces that you may be able to win in terms of that relationship, can you identify any big pieces of the combined M&I, BMO Harris that you don't currently have, like bill pay, for example?","Michael D. Hayford","Well, I mean, so a lot of the business we're still going to keep, right, probably be a different name. But bill pay, we actually will have. There's -- the core, the deposit loan, customer systems, we are operating 2 platforms, we're going to be operating one. It's going to go an in-house platform that Harris and M&I are going to operate on. There's been some noise around the credit card, as an example.  We never processed credit cards for M&I. So they really didn't have a decision there. We had a flow-through as part of our relationship with another organization, and they kept their card processing there. So the bulk of the applications we're still going to process for them. It's going to be generally an in-house. Obviously, you can see from the numbers that the numbers are going back down quite a bit. But the relationship is still a very large relationship. It's a great organization. We have a great relationship with them. And as we talked about, we felt it was an opportunity to extend the relationship as opposed to have a terminating type of situation.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. And just to add onto that, keep in mind, we're talking about BMO Harris, which is the U.S. subsidiary of BMO in Canada. And so we think there's a lot of opportunity to leverage some of our capabilities in the Canadian operation. And so we've got a lot in that environment. We do very little with actual BMO in Canada. And we talked to them about a number of fronts, whether we could leverage a lot of our payment technologies, our core processing technologies. And so, as Mike said, having a long-term relationship with BMO Harris and actually extending that, we think, makes a lot of sense. But then, what we've been able to do through this process is really tap into overall BMO in a significant way for the first time. So the dialogue has been very positive around working out this situation. But we think what that's going to do is, obviously, open some doors to allow us to talk about BMO, the larger enterprise in Canada, on some of our capabilities going forward.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just one last follow-up. I think you had mentioned ING when you mentioned some of the consulting work and the project that has started in the fourth quarter of '11. I believe that's another large bank merger where you have the core at both ING Direct and Capital One...","Gary A. Norcross","No. Keep in mind, we were talking about ING as an international client over in the Netherlands. So we're working with them. They've actually sold ING Direct to Capital One, which, you're right, we do have both Capital One and ING Direct. But our reference in the earnings call was dealing with ING, which we announced in the fourth quarter of last year, where they're actually migrating all of their country-specific core processing systems onto our technology. And so that's obviously continuing to drive professional services business for us internationally as we help them with that deployment and migration.","Peter J. Heckmann - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then any early insight in terms of Capital One ING Direct which core they may migrate to as a consolidated entity?","Gary A. Norcross","Well, you got 2 totally different enterprise, right? So you've got Capital One, who's actually bought ING Direct, which is one of the largest direct banks. And so we've got a very strong relationship there, and we're just going to continue to work with them through their strategies. And as they decide how they're going to carry forward their business, obviously FIS will be there to help them. And so we enjoy seeing our clients grow and grow through acquisition, because it usually means great things for FIS.","Operator","We have a question from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish, calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. A quick question on the Financial Solutions segment that delivered another solid quarter. And so how should we think about this growth going forward? Do you think this growth is sustainable going into second half, considering all the headwinds that you spoke about? And just to follow up on that would be the deals, the deals that got pushed out to third quarter.  Would that have any impact on the near-term revenues?","Michael D. Hayford","I mean, I think FSG had a pretty good string here that the comps in the last half of last year were a little off. But they started out last year real strong in the first 2 quarters, and then the -- through those comps, we're going to have pretty good third and fourth quarter. First 2 quarters this year were solid. I mean, we've talked about FSG has really come back pretty strong after a slow '09 and '10, where we had -- kind of the slowdown due to the financial crisis and just good steady growth. We get a little bit of noise quarter-to-quarter because of comps or because of something moving around. But as Gary referenced, we feel pretty good about the growth opportunity. I don't - the third-- the second quarter sales, again, we think is more of a delay than losses, and Gary referenced that -- one of the deals we actually got signed here already in the third quarter. So I think we still feel good about FSG. It's kind of quarter-to-quarter. It's going to have a few up and downs. But as we look year-over-year, we still think it's come back strong and it has the opportunity to keep growing.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, I can't agree more. I mean, at the end of the day, if you look at our -- once again, our software business continues to decline because of the trend towards outsourcing that we've been now talking about quarters -- for just many quarters. And as a result of that, it's a much more predictable business. So FSG doesn't have quite the impact that, say, our PSG segment does with transaction volumes and some of those things. So we feel good about FSG in the second half of the year, and we feel good about the sales success in that area as well.","Frank R. Martire","All right. As Gary and Mike said, if you look at the last 2-year results and how strong our pipeline is today, we can't help but feel good about FSG and how it's performing, how we believe it will perform.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. One quick question on the FX. So -- and this is more particular -- this isn't particular to the FX impact on the top line. So I believe you said the impact was roughly $35 million on the top line for international segment. And the Brazilian real as well as the euro has significantly weakened. How do you -- like if you stay at this current conversion rate, how do you think about FX going forward? I was wondering if you have done any kind of calculation, or can you provide any kind of insight into it?","Michael D. Hayford","Yes. I mean, we try to look at that. I don't have a number in front of me in terms of \u2013- kind of project out the FX. Again, we try to give organic numbers, which eliminates the FX impact. And then, at least most of those countries have a natural kind of hedge and balance. And then in terms of if we have a negative impact there in terms of lower margin coming back, right now, we've got the benefit with India. So without trying to predict what's going to happen with the currency swinging in the future, I don't really have a specific number. But if you look at the second quarter -- and we don't think we have too much exposure there on the bottom line.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue.","Mary K.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. The instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Pete Gunnlaugsson. Please go ahead, sir.","Peter Gunnlaugsson - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FIS' second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Turning to slide 2; Gary Norcross, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, will begin today's call with company highlights for the quarter. Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with the financial results. This conference call is also being webcast, with today's news release and corresponding presentation available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Turning to slide 3, today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. I refer you to the Safe Harbor language on the slide.","The materials presented today will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide more meaningful comparisons between the periods presented. Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided as attachments to the press release and in the Appendix of the supplemental slide presentation.","Turning to slide 4, it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Gary to discuss the business highlights for the quarter. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Pete. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to announce today that FIS delivered another solid quarter with results in line with our expectations. We continue to see strong client engagement around investing for the future, signaling increasing demand for our solutions. Sales momentum continues to be strong with a solid pipeline and growth in our revenue backlog.","Our strong first half results, combined with our visibility into the second half of the year, and accelerated growth in our Integrated Financial Solutions segment, allows us to raise our EPS guidance for the second quarter in a row and push our EBITDA margin to the high end of the range for the full-year. Woody will provide more financial details in his remarks.","We continue to make solid progress towards our data center consolidation, solution modernization, and other operating efficiency initiatives. These programs will drive long-term operating results, scalability, growth, and resiliency.","Turning to slide 5, key themes in the quarter focus on improving sales, strengthening pipeline, and continued trends towards outsourcing. Turning to our segment results, our Integrated Financial Solutions segment saw another strong quarter of organic growth with accelerated growth sequentially. As expected, we saw a nice rebound in our payments business, while demand remains strong for our retail banking, wealth, and digital solutions. Processing volumes also accelerated across the segment.","As an example of key wins in the quarter, in a competitive core takeaway deal, a mid-tier commercial bank based in the Midwest chose FIS for our advanced core banking solution to support its long-term growth. This is significant, because our client was being acquired and the acquiring bank chose to convert to FIS solutions, given the strength of the overall solution suite. This example continues to underscore FIS' strength in the large complex banking sector. Additionally, we won an exciting contract to significantly expand our work with a leading provider of tax preparation solutions, making us the company's exclusive IRS payment provider for taxpayers.","Finally, and showcasing the strength of our solution scale, a $20 billion financial institution expanded their existing relationship with us by converting to a new FIS core banking platform, which includes new digital channels, a full data conversion, and numerous back office solutions, including item processing, electronic funds transfer, and output solutions. This deployment occurred over a single week and with flawless execution and seamless onboarding. As we discussed on our last call, the IFS spend environment remains robust. We continue to build on the positive sales results established over the last several quarters, creating momentum into the back half of 2018 and into 2019.","In our Global Financial Solutions segment, these results reflect a large grow over in license fees in 2017. They also reflect a continued swing towards long-term processing agreements instead of on-premise licenses. This swing to outsourcing is a very good outcome for the business, driving much higher revenue predictability in the future. We continue to be pleased with the transformation of this business, which over time will evolve to operate more like our IFS segment. Based on the quality and breadth of our solutions, coupled with continued strong demand, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of this trend.","For example, a large regional bank expanded its relationship with FIS by signing a new agreement for a hosted solution to help the bank real-time payments and connect to The Clearing House real-time payments network. As announced earlier this quarter, we now provide certification services for all financial institutions that want to participate in these real-time services.","A second North American institution is leveraging the power of FIS to launch its new direct bank. This FIS hosted offering is leveraging end-to-end solutions from our entire portfolio, including digital banking and component-based core processing. This new direct bank continues our leadership role in launching direct banks across North America. We also expanded our relationship with the global investment bank by providing outsourced risk and compliance solutions for its listed and cleared over-the-counter business.","As a final example, in the UK, a financial services company recently became our first client to go live on our cloud-based Payments-as-a-Service offering. This innovative API solution enables the market to digitally offer any payment type to their customers, including new faster payments, as well as traditional payments, such as wires and ACH. Given the current pipeline and sales success in the first half of the year, we expect GFS to drive stronger growth during the back half of 2018.","Turning to slide 6, overall we continue to drive solid momentum and are making very good progress on executing our strategy that will drive long-term transformational results for us and our clients. We outlined a number of these actions for you at our Investor Day in May, including focusing our investments in accelerating our initiatives to provide the most modern solution set in the industry, remaining on track to operate more than 50% of our technology solutions within our private cloud by the end of the year, and continuing driving increased efficiencies within our operations.","We just completed four large events hosting thousands of clients from North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our continuous focus on modernization and value-added solution integration aligns with client demand and has been at the forefront of our sales success and growing pipeline throughout the year. We are pleased that our clients are enthusiastic about our strategic focus areas and the benefits they will bring to their organizations.","We also just completed our third annual FinTech Accelerator program, which was again focused on sponsoring and shaping high potential FinTech start-ups. This program, which has been extended for another year, is solid proof of our innovation strategy in action.","Client feedback across all these events, coupled with our first half results, underscores confidence in our strategy and investment decisions, and gives us clear line of sight into our ability to deliver on our goals, which are to drive long-term growth through innovation, increase sales through solution differentiation, and continue to build our global scale. We remain very confident in the value we are delivering for our clients and believe that the value will continue to translate into consistent and profitable results and strong returns for our shareholders.","Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on slide 8 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the second quarter, revenue increased 1% to $2.1 billion on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA increased 1% to $757 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 260 basis points to 35.9% for the quarter. Excluding divestitures, EBITDA would have grown 2.5% and margins would have expanded approximately 60 basis points.","Adjusted net earnings was $408 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 18.3% to $1.23 per share compared to $1.04 per share in the prior-year quarter. For the first half of the year, revenue increased 2% on an organic basis to $4.2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA grew 3.5% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 300 basis points to 35%. Excluding divestitures, EBITDA would have grown 5.6% and margins would've expanded approximately 100 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share grew 24.2% to $2.31 per share.","Moving to slide 9, in the second quarter, IFS revenue grew a healthy 4.3% on an organic basis. EBITDA grew 5.6% to $492 million versus $466 million in the prior-year quarter. EBITDA margins expanded 90 basis points to 43.8%, driven primarily by operating leverage on revenue growth and cost efficiencies. For the first half of the year, revenue increased 3.7% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $943 million, a 4.2% increase compared to the prior-year period.","Turning to slide 10, banking and wealth grew 5.1% for the quarter. The strong performance was driven primarily by wealth and output solutions, as well as an overall increase in processing volumes. As expected, payments rebounded in the quarter and grew 2%. As we discussed on our last call, we're seeing increasing transaction volumes in our debit and fraud solutions. This growth was also driven by growing demand in our market-differentiating loyalty solutions.","Corporate and digital grew 6.5% in the quarter, with strong growth in both groups. Term fees were $19 million in the quarter versus $11 million in the prior-year period. We still anticipate full year term fees to be relatively flat compared to the prior year. As Gary expressed, we're very pleased with the IFS performance for the first half of the year.","Turning to slide 11, in the second quarter, GFS revenue declined 3% an organic basis. EBITDA declined 7.5% to $314 million, primarily as a result of divestitures. These divestitures enabled margin expansion of 370 basis points to 34.9%. For the first half of the year, revenue increased 1.1% organically; adjusted EBITDA grew to $618 million, a 2.5% increase compared to the prior-year period. This represents 500 basis points of margin expansion to 33.9%.","As previously discussed in February and May, GFS growth for the first half of the year was impacted by the known timing of natural license renewal due to the adoption of ASC 606. Consistent with this messaging, we still anticipate second half acceleration for the segment.","Moving to slide 12, for the quarter, our institution and wholesale business declined 5.1%, primarily driven by lower license revenue recognition. Banking and payments was flat, with increased transaction growth in our payments group, offset by lower license revenue in our banking solutions. We are seeing an acceleration in demand for our outsourced processing arrangements versus upfront license sales, while this trend creates a short-term top line headwind and improves the long-term recurring revenue base and is a positive from a business perspective, as our GFS segment continues to operate more like our IFS segment. We are pleased with this market trend, which creates higher predictability for our GFS segment. As a proof point of this positive trend, for the first six months of the year recurring revenue increased to about 75% from approximately 70% in the prior year.","Moving to slide 13, Corporate and Other revenue in the second quarter was $84 million with an EBITDA loss of $49 million. The Corporate and Other segment results include $62 million of corporate expenses for the quarter compared to $75 million in the prior-year period. This represents a 17% reduction in corporate expenses, primarily driven by results from our data center consolidation program and ongoing cost management efforts.","Moving to slide 14, free cash flow for the quarter was about $350 million and we still expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 110% for the year. Debt outstanding as of June 30 was approximately $8.9 billion, with the weighted average interest rate of 3.5%. 95% of our outstanding debt is at fixed interest rates.","During the second quarter, we returned $305 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We paid $105 million in dividends and repurchased 2.1 million shares. Through the end of July, we have repurchased 8.1 million shares for approximately $800 million year-to-date at a weighted average price of $99.45 per share. We have approximately $3.1 billion remaining of our existing share repurchase authorization. Our weighted average diluted share count was 333 million at the end of the quarter, and our basic share count was 329 million.","Last quarter, we began to disclose our backlog in our public filings and we'll continue to do so. For the last few quarters, we have discussed strong sales results. These have contributed to an increase of approximately $500 million to our backlog compared to the prior year.","Before I move to a review of our guidance, I wanted to give an update on FX. Since our last call, the dollar has strengthened, especially against the Brazilian real, which created an $18 million top line headwind in the second quarter compared to our expectations in May. Through the end of July, this trend has continued.","For the last six months of the year, we currently anticipate a negative revenue impact of about $40 million due to FX. To help with modeling, we expect the third quarter to be impacted slightly more by this headwind than the fourth quarter. We still believe the impact to earnings per share is immaterial.","Moving to slide 15, this morning we reiterated our full year consolidated revenue growth guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% with a 1 point shift from GFS to IFS. We now expect both, IFS and GFS, to grow 3% to 4% organically. This 1 point shift from GFS to IFS was driven primarily by the previously discussed increase in volumes and demand in our IFS segment and an acceleration in market trends from upfront license to outsourcing agreements in our GFS segment, both of which we believe are positive backdrop for each segment.","We're also guiding EBITDA margins to the high end of our prior range, or approximately 37%. And finally, primarily driven by the increased margin profile of our business, we are increasing the bottom end of the EPS range by $0.04. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be $5.18 to $5.34 per share, representing 21% to 25% growth.","Before I conclude my remarks, I'd like to provide a little color on EPS for the remainder of the year. Compared to our expectations, consensus estimates are too high in the third quarter by roughly $0.05 and too low in the fourth quarter. Moving to slide 16, we will continue to leverage our market leadership to produce predictable top line growth, exceptional margin expansion, double-digit EPS growth, and strong cash flows. These strengths allow us to invest for the future growth and return value to our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Hey, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. So first of all just on GFS, obviously, slowed in Q2 and that was as you expected, I think, due to timing. But the shift to more outsourced long term, high margin relationships, that takes a little time to go through. So, I guess, I'm just wondering the back half, you're expecting 4% to 6% growth I think in the back half. Is there anything different in Q3 and Q4, and why such a quick kind of return from Q2?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think we tried to outline it both in February and May. The impact in quarter for Q2 and really first half for GFS around the recognition of renewals under ASC 606 impacted us. That trend reverses particularly in Q4 of this year, so we get a net tailwind in Q4. If you go back and look at the commentary from February, we tried to outline that and let you know this was coming. We're certainly seeing that in terms of the recognition of renewals just from adopting 606.","To Gary's point, we did see some shift in upfront license to outsourcing. I think that trend will continue. I think it's probably accelerating a bit from our original expectation, but again that's a good long-term outlook.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No, to build on that, Dave, you saw it in Woody's comments around the reoccurring revenue. You've seen GFS accelerate from 70% to 75% in reoccurring in a year, and this is just that trend that we've been signaling. But we've got a lot of our clients now not only looking to take advantage of our software, but how do we take advantage of FIS' processing ability and really lower their overall total cost. So it's a great outcome for the business, because over time you'll see GFS move more like an IFS number. Those margins will continue to accelerate as we get the economies out of \u2013 delivering that out of our data center environment. So it's a good long-term outcome for the segment.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. It seems great for margins over time.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","(00:18:46).","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And, I guess, just a follow-up. So it sounds like if the back half in GFS \u2013 I think to get to guidance it has to be 4% to 6% \u2013 we should assume the lower part of that for Q3 and the higher part for Q4 based on what you just said, is that fair?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","That's exactly right said a different way. When we start October 1, we're looking at some growth just from re-recognition under 606. So that's exactly how we would think about it is Q4 being a little higher and Q3 being a little lower.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","But if you always look at the historical context of that business, Q4 has always been a big quarter...","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","...in sales. And it's very traditional that our clients enter into agreements so they can kick off the new year with a big project or big program. And so, Q4 has always been a big quarter in that business specifically.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you. Great, thanks. Great job.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, Gary. Good morning, Woody.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, Dave.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Gary, you called for a turn in IT spending growth for banks in Q1, and it looks like this is the third consecutive quarter of strong bookings growth. Can you drill down a little bit into the areas of specific strength you're seeing in IFS? You called out digital, is that sort of online and mobile banking, payments? What are the key spending priorities?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No, it really is. We're really feeling good about the IFS segment. Frankly, about in general IT spend across the entire sector, both IFS and GFS, we've seen three quarters in a row of strong sales across both segments, to your point. And specifically within IFS, we're seeing good sales really across several areas. Frankly, payments has been strong, but it's been more in adoption. So we're seeing accelerated volumes. We're seeing our sales success come across, frankly, next-generation core banking. We highlighted a number of those wins in the prepared remarks. We're also seeing strong embracement of digital channels, so mobile and, frankly, omni-channel, as we roll out our Digital One capabilities, which is really an omni-channel deployment across both the segments. We're seeing our clients clamor to that to try to take out cost out of their back office and actually also drive a better interaction with their customers.","So it's really, Dave, across multiple product lines. I think it does show the strength of FIS' overall product portfolio, and that's also resonating. So we highlighted another big digital bank signing on with us. We've become pretty much the standard in digital bank deployment in North America. And, once again, that speed to market, that ability to drive a more open core componentized architecture with open APIs allows people to get quick to market. So we're pleased with the trends we're seeing across our sales channels.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up. On GFS, particularly for the institutional wholesale business, if we strip out ASC 606 impacts, strip out the shift to outsourcing from software license, are there any underlying trends in terms of demand in I&W to call out after making those adjustments?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, it's interesting. We had a very strong sales quarter in I&W specifically. In fact, we've had three strong quarters in that. And from a sales standpoint, from a true new total contract value of our sales engine bringing it into the firm, we're ahead of where we were last year. And so we're feeling really good about the demand that we're finding for our products. When you really boil it down \u2013 we talked a lot about this in the SunGard acquisition. So if you back up, you remember, we saw an opportunity to actually put these products together and form more end-to-end solutions, and we're seeing a lot of success with that.","I think that is also some of the things that's driving people wanting to take this software or this solution now as a service, because they're now entering into contracts with us where we'll take multiple products and really give an end-to-end total solution, and therefore drive it through our data centers. But the sales engine's operating very well in GFS and has consistently for the last year. And so we're pleased at the sales results for the first two quarters.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you very much.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Two questions. Number one, Woody, you mentioned, I think, in your comments that part of the margin expansion in IFS was from cost efficiencies. I think we're used to hearing that more on the GFS side, but wondered if is that a \u2013 is there a change that's gone on or is that just sort of normal matter of course, and it's finally just hitting the numbers. Or can you give us a little insight on that?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think if you go back to the dialogue we had at Investor Day around the data center consolidation and the early results around that, you heard some of that in my prepared remarks in corporate, we're certainly seeing that flow through IFS and GFS. The margin profile was definitely strong in IFS this quarter, and it was really clean. So I think you're seeing early results of that as we anticipated and we'll continue to see our ability to drive margins in that area.","The other thing that we've talked about a number of times is just operating leverage within that business. As you see organic growth accelerating, like we have the last couple of quarters, the operating leverage really pushes to the bottom line and the profitability.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I'm going to build on that a minute, Brett. As we talked about at Investor Day, by the end of this year we'll have $100 million in run rate out of operating savings just through data center consolidation. And by the time we're complete with that program in early 2021, we'll have $250 million of run rate.","So, you're going to see \u2013 that's why we had so much confidence at Investor Day about the margin projections of this business going forward. We're really getting the benefits of this leverage. The team's working together very well. We've seen the operating leverage for years in the IFS. So by nature, as the business grows faster, you'll naturally see a higher contribution margin that will also pull those margins up.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then just one more detailed question on GFS. Thanks for the insight. I get that the 606 thing is, I think, going to impact folks maybe more than everybody thought. Were there a handful of deals that kind of swung that for the quarter, or was it kind of a gradual thing? Was there any sort of like trigger point that really made the difference in terms of changing your view on that guide?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","No, it's really around timing of renewals there. That was what we saw and we anticipated and tried to articulate to the market in February and May that we were going to see a low watermark in GFS in Q2. That's certainly come to fruition. We anticipate that to have the opposite effect in Q4 as we see the natural re-recognition of those renewals under 606.","So said very clearly, we anticipated roughly a 1.5% to 2% decline in GFS in Q2. We saw about 3%. The other point was roughly the change in move towards outsourcing versus upfront license, which really helps drive that backlog increase that we talked about and gives us some confidence going forward, but those are the two shifts. The shift between outsourcing and license is really the primary change in lowering the GFS guide in terms of its 3% to 4% now.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Brett, as we've been through this process before multiple years ago with IFS, and IFS used to be a heavy oriented license business, and as you're going through the sales process, you first sell the prospect on the product itself or on the solution itself. But to Woody's point, I think the surprise for us was more of those customers that would have traditionally licensed the product really have pushed more towards outsourcing in a somewhat dramatic way, and then 70% reoccurring to 75% is a big bump in a single year. If you look at the back half of the year, we're continuing to model that license fees will continue to be there, but we also recognize this outsourcing trend, which is a good thing, will continue.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. As we build the backlog, I'll tell you it just gives us more confidence in the outlook that we gave you back in May. So we see that backlog grow and have more recurring revenue to build on.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. One last question for me, just to slip it in. You guys have been working on modularity of your core processing systems to try and kind of migrate folks in a less difficult big bang switchover way. Can you give us any update on that? Were some of the wins that you announced earlier in your comments, Gary, a function of that new \u2013 or that updated strategy of modernization?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, it was, Brett. We're having a lot of success. As we talked about at Investor Day, this is a journey. We're multiple years into that investment now and now you're seeing the results of that and actually starting to see some wins. In fact, we'll be launching our fully new componentized solutions and we'll continue to bring more and more of those to bear. But we're also taking advantage of that investment and modernizing our existing platforms as well over time. And so our clients will get the benefit of that as part of doing business with FIS as we take them through the natural upgrade cycle. So we're excited where the teams are on that development effort and we're also excited to start seeing this actually come into market now.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks, appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question will come from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thanks, guys. Look, just to be clear, without the impacts of 606 this specific quarter timing-wise and the shift to outsourcing, maybe you could just give us exactly what you think the GFS growth rate would've been now. And then just higher level, Gary, you talked about 4% to 5% growth for this business longer term, GFS in particular. Is there anything you're seeing now that might have changed that view, or when do you expect we'd get back to that profile?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, if you look at stripping all the other things out, I'll tell you, looks very close to in line with what we've talked about in our long-term guidance, which is around 4% to 5%.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","That's what we outlined in May. That's what we've been seeing over a number of quarters and feel good about in terms of outlook. We do have some lumpiness, as we tried to outline a couple of times this year to let you guys know we're going to see that with the adoption of 606, and we can't do much about that.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","That's right.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","The underlying health of the business is solid in GFS.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Absolutely. And so, as you think about that, the lumpiness comes in the form of license fees. Now that we've got 606, historically we were able to remove clients early, right, and pull in those license fees. So that gets normalized through 606. To Woody's point, in the back half of the year you'll see that re-recognition. Honestly, Darrin, as you look at the percentage of reoccurring revenue increase, it actually gives us more confidence in the guide, not less. And you're going to see that accelerate not only in the back half of the year, but into 2019 and beyond. So we're very comfortable with the business. The sales performance has been very strong. And as we onboard this and \u2013 onboard these large processing agreements, it's going to accelerate the growth.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Now that's good to hear. I mean, I guess, just to follow-up on that, the conversion to revenue, I think someone asked this before. But that should play out over the next probably, what, 12 to 18 months. I guess, we had some last year bookings strength, that would be generating revenue in the second half of this year is what's giving you confidence?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Absolutely. It's a very consistent model. As people come on into this SaaS offering, just like IFS, you've got a 12- to 18-month onboarding cycle, and then you've got high reoccurring revenue, a good solid contribution margin...","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","...throughout the lifecycle of that contract.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Very good. Just very quickly, IFS showed strength. Obviously, was very good in the quarter. Just want to be clear there was nothing sort of onetime about that. This is a sustainable trend right now?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","No, that's the reason we actually increased IFS on the guide too. Spent a lot of time talking about GFS and the decrease there, but IFS was very strong, sequential increase of 90 basis points. And we see good growth outlook for the back half of the year and going forward as we continue to see strong sales conversions, processing volumes, all those things that we really like.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","That's good to hear (00:32:26).","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","And to your point, Darrin, we saw good solid sales in Q4 last year, Q1, and now Q2, all in IFS. So that stuff is all going to be onboarding in the back half and early part of next year. So we think it's a real good news story and the quarter was really just about as straight down the fairway as you can get.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's great, guys. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. I was just following-up on that. Just what inning would you say you're in in converting to processing from licensing? I heard the 75% from 70%. How high could that go and how quickly?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, if you look at IFS, now it's roughly about 90%, right? So you'll continue to see \u2013 it really depends on how quickly people quit taking on-premise license software. I can tell you historically that was kind of a 10-year transition over IFS, so it was long term as the market moves. But there's very clearly larger and larger institutions are looking to get more leverage out of their purchasing power with their suppliers, and one way of driving that is getting the benefits of our data center investment. You hear how much we're investing in cloud-based technologies, as an example. There really is no sense for our clients to replicate that spend. They should come with us. And as we move more and more of these technologies into our private cloud, we can just do it at a much more cost effective rate than they can. So you'll continue to see this movement over the future quarters.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","So would it be fair to say that this is opening up the pipeline overall and expanding your TAM as banks are looking to transition off of on-prem and looking for as-a-solution providers?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think it's fair that you'll see larger and larger contracts being signed out of GFS with a much higher reoccurring revenue, especially as our clients start embracing the solutions that we're putting together for more end-to-end capabilities across the I&W landscape. So I do think you'll continue to see that revenue backlog grow. Woody highlighted significant growth in it this quarter-over-quarter, and you see it in the reoccurring as well.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thank you. So my last follow-up, just $500 million the backlog being up versus the prior year, is that primarily within that GFS trend you're talking about or is it more broad based than that?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","It's in both segments. It's in both segments, but I would tell you, GFS was a little heavier in terms of backlog build than IFS. But it was in both.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Good to know. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question here will come from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. On the sales activity, good again this quarter. Could you just give us some sense how much stronger sales have been over the last few quarters compared to some prior period? I know we have the backlog number, but I think that reflects multiple years of revenue. So just any more color on the magnitude of the improvement would be great.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Chris, we haven't gotten into disclosures quarter-on-quarter, but it was definitely very strong. We saw the sale success definitely double digits growth, and so we're very pleased where it is at this point in the year.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the flipside, Gary, could you talk about trends in client and revenue attrition and what you have line of sight into compared to prior periods?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. The big metric that we look at there is really our term fees. It's very hard to predict when acquisitions are going to occur. Right now we're still modeling our term fees to be flat year-over-year. So we're not seeing \u2013 we haven't seen an increased exposure to that, at least based on our forecast over last year. But it's certainly something that we continue to watch.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to circle back on just the accelerating shift to outsourcing. I know you hit on it a lot. But I'm wondering is there something about the way you're able to structure these outsourcing deals relative to your legacy license that's enabling you to do more cross-selling. Like, are the ways in which you're able to kind of promote that cross-selling opportunity, do they tilt more towards these outsourcing type of transaction?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I think there are several things driving it, Dan. If you think about it, let's back up. One of the things that we did was we pulled the sales organization out of the individual product lines as we went through the SunGard integration. We got a lot of benefit of that. We got a lot of leverage out of the sales force. By doing that, we also then started putting products together, especially across the I&W landscape, to form more end-to-end solutions, which historically that market had bought more front, middle, or back office and very discrete buying decisions. We're now seeing more end-to-end capabilities, and we've highlighted a number of those wins over the quarters.","So then when you add the fact that FIS, given our scale in data center operation, we talked a lot about that, almost all of the IFS business is now taken in a SaaS model. There's a couple of minor exceptions, but in general, the entire IFS segment's a SaaS model. So now we've given not only a solution ability, but also access to world class data centers, which we've talked a lot about. And when you go to our clients and we're looking at prospects and working with them, it really is not only the capability of the product or solution, but how can they drive their total cost of ownership lower.","And what we're seeing, and we've highlighted this for quite some time, we're seeing more and more of our clients push themselves to look at alternative ways to lower their overall cost, and just by leveraging our scale in the processing environment. And frankly, we drive a lot of best practices around that. So not only can we drive at a lower cost, we can do it very well. We're just seeing more and more of our customers open themselves up, our larger customers open themselves up to that kind of capability.","So part of it is just more arrows in the quiver for our sales force that prior SunGard organization really didn't have this capability at the level we do. Part of it is getting the sales force out of the product line, so now they realize they can sell an entire solution and aligns their compensation models more effectively. And then the third is really a trend in the market, where people are just looking to lower their overall total cost of ownership. So I think all three of those things combined is really driving some of the outcome we're seeing.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's great. And then just my quick follow-up. Are there any callouts specifically as you think about different geographies around GFS? Just commentary around certain areas of strength, certain areas of weakness, given kind of different geopolitical risks, currency movements? Thanks.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Nothing particular to call out this quarter one versus another. If you think about currencies, right, the Brazilian real has certainly weakened against the dollar, and that's probably the biggest change we've had from an FX perspective. We also saw some offsetting benefit in the UK pound on the cost side and the rupee in the cost side, given it's kind of an immaterial point of view around earnings impact. But those would be the major areas.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Cantwell with Guggenheim Investments. Please go ahead.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Hi Jeff.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question. You've touched on this, but I wanted to see if you can give us a little more color on the outlook in IFS for the back half of the year. It looks like the front half of the year, the contribution to revenue growth was driven by banking and wealth, which also drove some modest margin expansion. So, I guess, I'm wondering is if the mix shifts in IFS in the back half, would we see a greater degree of margin expansion in the segment than we saw in the first half. Could you just comment on that or any additional color you have on how we should think about contribution to revenue and segment EBITDA margins as we contemplate the back half of the year? Thanks.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think one of the things you see, and we talked about it earlier, we saw an improvement in payments on the revenue growth. We were down in Q1, we expected that. We were up 2% in Q2. Talking about a rebound, we do anticipate continuing to see payments increase as we get through some easier comps in the back half of the year on card production. But overall I would continue to expect to see good growth across both the sub-segments beyond that, both corporate and digital, and banking and wealth. I'm very pleased with where IFS is right now. The sales are converting and things are going very well in IFS right now.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Appreciate that. And then I have a high level one. I wanted to ask you about what you're seeing in international and Europe in particular. One of the things we've heard pretty consistently is that Brexit is creating a lot of unknowns for FIs, which is constraining their technology spend. Just wanted to hear your thoughts on that. Is this perhaps something that we should be aware for you over the medium term, which is as we move past Brexit eventually, we could start to see your backlog over there growing as FIs start to shift more towards a front foot posture with their budgets, and where we could potentially see that coming through as revenue, new revenue for you guys?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No, it's a good question. Honestly, we have had \u2013 and we've talked about it on a number of calls, we've had the whole European market return slower than we would like over the last several years. We have seen good momentum recently in our sales and our backlog. We highlighted a very nice win of launching a new client on our Payments-as-a-Service offering in the UK, which is all cloud-based and API ready. We've had a lot of success (00:42:53) rolling out our new API gateway to meet some of the regulatory changes. So I do think you'll continue to see Europe strengthen for us over the coming quarters and coming years. I do think the environment is improving.","Jeff Cantwell - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc.","Arvind Anil Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. You talked a lot about your progress on digital. Can you maybe kind of outline some of the factors that your digital solution is winning competitively versus some of the other solutions available? And also if you can maybe kind of highlight three or four kind of features that's certainly kind of driving sales in digital offering.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No, it's a great question. We've actually highlighted in a number of our conferences. So if you think about the evolution of digital, we would argue we're heading into the third major generation of digital deployment. We've been in digital dating all the way back to just mobile banking or Internet banking, which was well over 10 years ago, and we're on the forefront of that. Over the years, we've taken a number of steps through our digital architectures and today we're very, very competitive across mobile, Internet, also small business, et cetera.","What we see the next wave is really what we've talked about with our clients and we're getting a lot of traction around this is really an omni-channel deployment. So how do you take all of the both assisted and unassisted channels and bring them through a common architecture? It's really a way for our clients to start not only leveraging the digital channels, but how do you leverage that into the branch environment as well and frankly, where the consumer gets a seamless experience. So that's resonated very well with our clients. And as we invest in that new capability, in that new technology, you see a lot of our clients getting on that journey with us to take advantage of that.","Arvind Anil Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And if I can just a quick follow-up on that. Are you assigning new logos as a result or a lot of it is taking existing clients and essentially kind of selling into them for these new offerings (00:45:33)?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","It's all of the above. Given our client base and given how large our client base in the U.S., a lot of our sales come in the form of cross-sells to existing customers. But we've also been taking new logos in market. So it's really a combination of both \u2013 across both of our segments, both IFS and GFS.","Arvind Anil Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question this morning will come from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Hey, George.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Gary and Woody, just wanted to ask, when you look at the strong sales pipeline and, I guess, maybe specific to IFS, it sounds like, obviously, there are macro tailwinds. But just curious competitively, are you seeing more \u2013 any sort of change competitively in the market with your ability to win more business? And then, Gary, at the Investor Day, you talked optimistically about maybe servicing larger FIs from a core processing standpoint. Just curious as to any progress on that front.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No, George, we really are seeing our modernization focus resonate with our clients. And, frankly, as you look at financial institutions as they get larger and larger in the space, especially banks specifically in North America \u2013 I'm addressing IFS specifically now \u2013 as those banks get larger and larger, our market share becomes greater. And if you look at the capabilities of our existing solutions, I would argue they're best-in-class in the large bank market. If you then layer on our next generation capabilities that we've been investing in for a number of years, you're just starting to see us take \u2013 not only take share, you're just seeing our customers get on that roadmap to move to a more modern capability.","We highlighted an example in the prepared remarks, where very unusual for one of our client \u2013 not unusual for one of our clients to get bought. We all know consolidation occurs in the industry. But it is unusual for the buying entity to actually convert to the acquired bank's solution. And we highlighted an example of that in core banking in this quarter. That's several times that now has occurred over the last couple of years.","So as these banks grow to $5 billion, $10 billion, $20 billion, you're seeing more and more of a need to really take advantage of the FIS strength and functionality and capability. And we're seeing that in our pipeline signings. We're seeing that in not only our sales signings, but also in our pipeline. So we feel great about the banking market in the U.S. We feel really good about the investments we're making. We think it plays for a solid outcome for FIS in the future.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for that. And if I could just end, Woody, in a more sort of drab accounting question. It looks like there was a bit more of an add back, I guess, tied to Capco, call it about $0.02 or so in terms of the adjustments that were added back. It doesn't look like you've changed the outlook though, the $2.10 to $1.95 add backs for the full year. So just to be very clear, the increase in your EPS guide, that is tied to fundamental improvement. There's nothing sort of below the line from an adjustment standpoint that's different than what you were thinking about, right?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","No, fundamental, fundamental improvement in the business; higher margins, higher revenue growth, and good fundamentals.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you for joining us today and for your ongoing interest in FIS. We're pleased with the operating performance of the first half of the year, which allows us to raise our earnings per share guidance for two quarters in a row. Importantly, our robust pipeline positions us for strong results in the back half of the year and into 2019.","In closing, I'd like to reinforce our core fundamentals. We have a proven market leadership position driving continuous innovation for modernization and improving your capabilities. We are serving healthy and improving market segments and have a very strong financial fundamentals with a proven track record of generating shareholder returns. And we believe our business continues to have a compelling investment thesis and we look forward to delivering on our commitments.","I'd like to thank our loyal clients who depend on us to keep their business running and growing every day.

Please go ahead.","Nathan Rozof","Thank you. Good morning and thanks to everyone for joining us today for the FIS fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. This call is being webcasted. And today's news release, corresponding presentation as well as webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Gary Norcross, our Chairman, President and CEO, will discuss our recent business trends and describe our quarterly operating performance. Woody Woodall, our Chief Financial Officer, will then review FIS' financial results and provides first quarter and full-year 2020 guidance.","Turning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

These are important financial performance measures for the company, but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information are presented in our earnings release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary, who'll begin his remarks on Slide 5.","Gary Norcross","Thanks Nate. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to be able to announce our fourth quarter and full year results. 2019 was a transformational year for FIS. We successfully closed and are well down the path on integrating the largest financial technology transactions in our industry. This, along with outstanding sales production, delivered strong organic revenue growth of 6% for the full year. All three segments performed exceptionally well for the year as well as the quarter. Our record sales and integration activities positioned us for an even stronger 2020. Later, I'll talk about our strategy and monetization, and how that is led to some very large noble wins that exemplify how our strategy is working, as well as driving increasing demand for our solution suite. This includes signing three of the largest banks in the country this quarter on our core banking solutions.","In the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate accelerated to 7% resulting in $3.3 billion in revenue. Our new sales results were the largest quarter and year in our history, resulting in an increase in more than 20% in new sales for the year. Our installation backlog as well as pipeline continued to expand.","Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 470 basis points, primarily driven by the high contribution margins resulting from the installation of our new sales, growing transaction volumes as well as the outstanding execution of our team to overdrive performance of cost and revenue synergies.","As we think about integration synergies, we exited the quarter generating $80 million in revenue and $465 million in cost synergies on an annualized run rate basis. When including interest expense savings, we have already exceeded our initial cost synergy target. As a result of our strong performance, we are increasing our future expectations for both revenue and cost synergies, which we will detail later. With our impressive momentum heading into 2020, we expect continued acceleration in organic revenue growth and ramping earnings accretion.","Turning to Slide 6. I want to talk about our strong sales results and client value propositions. Several years ago, we embarked on a transformational modernization journey. We began an ambitious new software development cycle, re-architected our solutions to be open, modular and cloud-based. And we also began modernizing and consolidating our technology delivery platforms. We did this because we believe that the financial services industry was moving towards its own transformation, and we wanted to be able to empower our clients in the broader industry to change. Disruptive technologies and new business models are forcing the industry to evolve by embracing future ready innovations like automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning, cloud-native technologies and digital omni-channel.","Client demand as evidenced by our new sales results, demonstrate that our thesis about the industry is correct. The investments we've made over the past several years are yielding results for our clients as well as FIS.","In our Banking segment, I'm very excited to announce that three of the largest banks in the country were combined total assets of more than $600 billion had embarked on the journey to transform their legacy core banking environment with FIS. This includes a top 10, a top 20 and a top 30 bank. MUFG Union Bank, a top 20 bank that we recently announced as well as a top 10 bank both selected our Modern Banking Platform for their transformations. They selected us because of our ability to deliver an innovative, personalized and next-generation solution as well as our ability to consistently execute large scale complex implementations.","The Modern Banking Platform is entirely new and built from the ground up. It was developed with state of the art containers, digital first capability, open APIs and cloud-based delivery through a SaaS model. This next-generation highly flexible platform enables the innovative financial institutions to transform the future of banking, and clearly represents a significant milestone for the industry.","I'm also pleased to announce that we signed an agreement with First Republic, a top 30 bank, to power its modernization program with our IBS core banking platform, including our industry leading open API framework Code Connect.","IVS continues to prove why it's the leading SaaS core banking platform for large regionals throughout the US. First Republic is known for its strong growth and outstanding client experience. They chose FIS over the incumbent provider because of our open scalable platform, which will better serve the needs of the bank's existing client base, as well as allow them to continue to expand and meet their growing consumer and business clients. These three pivotal wins are the start of what we believe will be a decade-long global transition of core banking systems from legacy in-house applications to cloud-native open banking deployments.","Turning to our Merchant segment. We are winning due to our superior client value proposition, strong integrated systems and continued flexibility on deployment. For example, one of our marquee clients, a top global search engine, continues to shift shared us after developing a proprietary routing engine that evaluates their processors for authorization and fraud rates, as well as cost of acceptance. We consistently demonstrate exceptional results across these categories leading the client to choose FIS for additional volumes across many of their U.S. businesses. In addition, a large global retailer who is number one in their category selected FIS to deploy omni-channel payment technology across Europe, covering both in-store and online payments. The company was looking to consolidate multiple acquirers and turn to FIS because of our unique capabilities and global reach.","In our Capital Markets segment, our ability to simplify clients\u2019 complex needs with our end to end solution suite is driving demand. Our modernization strategy has resulted in a very strong sales year, and we saw exceptionally strong growth in the fourth quarter.","We continue to see increasing demand for SaaS deployment, and the team is doing an outstanding job balancing that demand with our on-premise license business. For example, we entered into a SaaS agreement, one of the world's largest asset managers. In this instance, we will be providing a bundled investment solution with the next generation digital offering and data visualization tools. I'm also excited to announce that one of our premium payback clients, a large oil and gas company, is expanding their relationship with us include our cloud-based solution for their corporate treasury, cash, liquidity and risk management needs. This further proves that our ability to cross-sell and up-sell large enterprise customers to help their business on numerous levels.","Turning to Slide 7. In addition to these new wins, we are also accelerating our achievement of revenue synergies. While initially expecting to reach $100 million of annualized revenue synergies by the end of 2020, we have already achieved $80 million in annual run rate synergies in the first five months after closing. As a result, we're increasing our revenue synergy targets to $200 million exiting 2020, and $550 million exiting 2022. This reflects the faster than expected ramping of our multiple cross-sell opportunities.","During the fourth quarter we continue to see meaningful volumes ramp across our debit networks as well as ongoing traction for a premium payback solution. We signed two very large premium payback clients during the fourth quarter as we're experiencing significant demand for this innovative solution.","First, we will be partnering with PayPal to enable millions of online consumers to redeem earned rewards at checkout by allowing them to pay with points from thousands of U.S. banks. Second, I'm excited to announce that we entered into agreement with the top 3 U.S. retailer to help innovate its customer loyalty program with our premium payback solution. Together, we're enabling this client to deepen its relationships with millions of consumers across its 3000 locations.","We also signed another large merchant referral agreement during the quarter. We continue to be very pleased with our ability to take share from incumbent providers across our midsized and regional bank clients. In the first five months, we are well ahead of our expectations regarding merchant referral sales agreements, our pipeline and sales activities continue to grow. And we think this sales opportunity will continue to exceed our initial plans.","Now that we are well into our integration execution, we continue to discover new opportunities to cross-sell and bundle offerings as we go-to-market, giving a strong confidence in our newly-raised targets. For example, our joint prepaid solutions have emerged as a new cross-selling opportunity into the Worldpay client base. We've already signed a partnership with the global solutions provider to develop re-loadable fair cards for transit systems. Together, this partnership has already won our first large metro client and expect more to follow.","With our very successful achievement of expense as well as revenue synergies, we are running a full 12 months ahead of our original integration schedule. Due to this accelerated timeline, we are also taking earlier steps to further streamline our organization to drive a much more functional operating model. Some of the changes we've recently implement will allow us to better leverage our go-to-market strategies between our Banking and Merchant segments. We believe this will not only further accelerate our revenue synergies, but also allow us to drive innovation into these markets.","We have also consolidated technology development for our Merchant and Banking businesses within our combined Chief Operating Officer organization. This alignment will allow us to increase suite of development and deployment in this highly dynamic industry, creating what we believe will be a best-in-class software engineering organization. As you can see, we feel great about how the companies have come together. And this momentum and success gives us great confidence for an even stronger 2020.","Moving to Slide 8. We have a highly resilient business model that is differentiated by our market-leading solutions across our segments. In Merchant Solutions, we're clearly a leader in global e-commerce and integrated payments. As we continue to grow, these channels have expanded by approximately 45% of our merchant business mix, up from 37% of Worldpay in 2017. Due to the high secular growth trends in these markets, we expect them to maintain their high rates of growth and continue increasing as a percentage of our revenue mix, reinforcing the durability of our organic growth profile. In Banking Solutions, we're differentiated by our comprehensive portfolio of next-generation solutions. These uniquely position us to help large global financial institutions as well as community banks and credit unions to transform their business models and to provide seamless customer experiences. Therefore, as the financial services industry continues to evolve, we will be the primary beneficiary of the growing momentum towards outsourced cloud-based technology from legacy in-house software.","Finally, in Capital Markets, our investments in Advanced Technology and RegTech are paying dividends. We develop bundled offerings to enable our clients to simplify their complex front-, middle- and back-office processes with an end-to-end automated workflow that is helping us to win market share.","In addition, by using the SaaS delivery based model, we have an opportunity to further increase our revenue growth profile by driving an increasing mix of predictable recurring revenue streams.","In order to reinforce our reporting segments and drive increasing rates of organic growth, our priorities for 2020 are as follows. First, we will continue to invest in sales, innovation and delivery to capitalize on our growing new sales pipelines. Clearly, our investments over the past 5 years are driving the landmark new wins, and we're going to continue to lean into the strategy in 2020. Second, we will seamlessly execute the Worldpay integration in order to achieve our revenue and cost synergy goals. We are already well-ahead of schedule and will look to further accelerate our momentum in 2020. Third, we will continue to drive efficiency through our data center consolidation program. Last, we will continue scale on our high growth sector of the markets in order to reinforce the durability of our revenue growth profile.","As you can tell by our exciting wins and accelerated synergy realization, 2019 was a transformational year, and we have line of sight to achieving even more in 2020.","I'll now turn the call over to Woody to round up the financial discussion before he opens the call to questions. Woody?","Woody Woodall","Thank you, Gary. I would also like to welcome everyone to today's call. This morning, I'll cover our 2019 financial results and 2020 outlook. But before I take you through this, I would like to recap some of the financial highlights that we achieved in 2019, beginning with Slide 10. ","During 2019, we transformed our company and positioned it for continued acceleration and revenue growth and ongoing margin expansion with an eye toward creating superior shareholder returns both now and into the future. First, we accelerated our organic growth profile by executing the most significant and transformational acquisition in our company's history. We also reinforced the durability of our growth profile with record new sales and notable client wins like the ones Gary mentioned earlier. These reflect the outcome of our investments in innovation and technology that we made to benefit our clients. Given our success, we will continue to make these investments. Second, we expanded margins by aggressively driving cost synergies through our integration efforts, as well as ongoing internal expense initiatives that were in place well before the Worldpay acquisition. Third, we enhanced these operating savings with disciplined management of our below the line items. For example, we generated $275 million of annualized interest expense savings by strategically managing our capital structure. Finally, we generated $2.1 billion in free cash flow according to 20% of revenue. We anticipate free cash flow generation to accelerate and expect approximately 24% to 26% conversion to revenue in 2020. We used our phone free cash flow generation to not only pay down $1.4 billion in debt since the transaction close, but also the fund investments in innovation and integration as well as to continue to pay our dividend.","For example, we recently acquired a majority of stake in Virtus Partners. Virtus is a small, but strategic tuck-in acquisition within our capital market segment. It provides high value, managed services and technology solutions focused on the credit and loan markets, which is an area of rapid growth. While it's too small to have a material impact on our consolidated results, it will further reinforce the capital market segments accelerating growth profile.","Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize debt repayment in order to reach our 2.7 times leverage target by the end of 2020. Our strong cash will allow us to continue investing in technology and innovation to drive new sales and to make strategic tuck-in acquisitions even as we delever. As we move into 2021 and beyond, our capital allocation priority will shift toward reviewing strategic M&A opportunities that will increase our scale in secular, high growth markets. Absent M&A opportunities, we will return capital to shareholders through ongoing dividends and resuming buybacks.","As you can see, based on our accomplishments in 2019, we are doing what we said we would do and even more. First, we initially expected the Worldpay transaction to be modestly diluted in 2020, before turning accretive in 2021. Today, we announced our formal adjusted EPS guidance for 2020, and the entire range is now accretive. Second, our initial revenue synergy target was $500 million. Today, we increased our revenue synergy target about 10% to $550 million. Further, we increased our 2020 revenue synergy target by 33% to $200 million. Third, we initially expected cost synergy is $400 million, which we raised again today to $675 million. Finally, we continue to see accelerating revenue growth in 2020 and beyond. These accomplishments demonstrate the hard work of the team and further increase my confidence and our strong outlook for 2020.","Turning to our results on Slide 11. We finished the year on a high note exceeding our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 7% an organic basis to $3.3 billion with strong top-line performance across all three of our segments, which I'll summarize in a moment. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.5 billion during the quarter and our margins expanded by 470 basis points to 45%. Reflecting our strong operating results, adjusted EPS was $1.57 per share.","I'll now provide some color on our segment results on Slide 12. Merchant Solutions\u2019 organic growth accelerated sequentially to 10% as expected, and e-commerce and integrated payments saw continued strong growth in the mid to high teens. The segment generated EBITDA of $584 million in quarter, representing a 52% margin. As we look at 2020, we expect this segment to grow in the low-double digits as underlying business trends remain robust, and we expect revenue synergies to ramp throughout the year.","Our Banking Solutions segment generated 5% organic growth for the quarter and 6% for the year, primarily driven by continued demand for our market leading solutions. This segment generated $682 million and adjusted EBITDA for a 44% margin. We expect Banking to continue to generate strong mid-single digit growth in 2020, and our impressive new wins provide increase confidence in the recent trends.","Capital Markets\u2019 organic revenue growth was very strong, accelerating the 6% when excluding a onetime item that drove approximately two percentage points of growth during the fourth quarter. This segment generated $339 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 51% margin. For 2020, we project capital markets to show modest acceleration over 2019 and improvement from our firm messaging, as we continue to drive growth in recurring revenue.","Turning to Slide 13, we have made significant progress on our cost synergies as our integration of Wordpay is running ahead of schedule. We exited the fourth quarter generating $465 million in annual run-rate cost synergies, including $275 million of interest expense savings, and $190 million in reduced operating expenses. We're making substantial progress in reducing duplicative corporate costs, as well as consolidating our merchant and issuer platforms to generate the operating expense savings, which are also running well ahead of plan.","With all of the progress that we've achieved already, we are increasing our 2020 cost synergy target to $600 million in annual run-rate cost savings. We are approaching hard to accelerate costs synergy attainment and complete our integration plans as fast as possible. By completing these efforts along with deleveraging our balance sheet in 2020, we'll be able to focus even more of our energy and driving revenue growth, and be ready to execute strategic M&A as we enter next year.","Before I provide the details of our 2020 guidance, I would like to set the stage on Slide 14. We have significantly accelerated our organic revenue growth profile and expanded our adjusted with our adjusted EBITDA margins over the past three years. Revenue topped $10 billion for the first time in our company's history in 2019. And we are highly confident in our ability to further accelerate organic revenue growth in 2020 and beyond. Over the past three years, organic revenue growth increased from 2% in 2017 to 3% in 2018, and now 6% in 2019. With the multiple revenue synergy opportunities and accelerating sales momentum that Gary described earlier, we have significant visibility into the year and are increasingly confident in our expectation for organic revenue growth to approach 7% in 2020 before moving higher in the out years.","Turning to margins. We have expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by more than 700 basis points over the past 3 years and we project another 300 points of expansion in 2020. This consists of ongoing initiatives and synergy achievement to generate approximately 400 to 450 points of underlying margin expansion, which will be partially offset by 100 to 150 basis points of additional investments. We are re-investing a portion of our below-the-line interest expense savings back into the business as increased investment in innovation, sales and delivery. All of these investments are targeted at driving continued acceleration of revenue growth. We are making these investments in order to capitalize on a significant momentum that we are seeing in the market right now. Our new sales pipeline is the largest I've ever seen, and I want to make sure we are positioned to win. In addition, we have a largest implementation backlog I\u2019ve even seen, as you would expect following record new sales capped up with the big wins that we announced this quarter. Therefore, I also want to invest and delivery so we get our clients utilizing these new capabilities faster and start converting those big wins into revenue.","Finally, I'd like to provide details of our first quarter and full year guidance on Slide 15. Based on current business trends, we expect revenue of $13.55 billion to $13.675 billion, and adjusted EPS $6.17 to $6.35 per share for full year 2020. This represents organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% and adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 13%. We expect to increase our adjusted EBITDA margins to approximately 44% for the full year, and we will provide more planning assumptions on the bottom of the slide. Our new sales momentum, substantial backlog and multiple cross-selling opportunities provide significant visibility, which gives me high confidence in achieving our guidance ranges.","Turning to our first quarter guidance. We expect revenue of $3.180 billion to $3.210 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.30 to $1.34 per share. This represents organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 16%. As a reminder, we faced a tough comp during the first quarter after receiving about a point of one-time benefits during the first quarter of 2019, which we'll have to grow over in 2020. After the first quarter, we then expect revenue growth to ramp toward the upper end of our 6% to 7% range for the remainder of the year.","Before we open the line up for questions, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks with the following. We are well-positioned to continue delivering substantial shareholder value in 2020 and beyond, as we continue to increase revenue momentum, expand margins and generate significant free cash flow. 2019 was a transformational year, and I'm looking forward to even stronger financial performance in 2020.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do have something from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey. Good morning guys. Really nice results here in the quarter. So, I just wanted to refer the 2020 EPS guidance a little bit further. It looks like share count may be a little bit higher than the stream is estimating which kind of is what it is. But on the margin front, you talked about that 100 to 150 bip of additional reinvestment. Woody, I just wanted to see if you can elaborate a little bit further, maybe by segment, where you're going to be concentrating some of those reinvestment dollars?","Woody Woodall","Yeah, I thought it might be even helpful to walk you through the margin bridge we expect for 2020. We closed out 2019 with about a 41% margin. We are seeing synergies both revenue and OpEx driving a little greater than 200 basis points of improvement. We've got normal operating efficiency and scale in the business driving roughly 50 to 100 basis points of improvement. The data center consolidation efforts are driving about 50 basis points of improvement. And then the impact of having Worldpay in the business for the full year is driving about 100 basis points of improvement. That aggregates to about 400 to 450 basis points. Then we talked about the investments, roughly 100 to 150 basis points offsetting that to get you to about 300 basis points of expansion or an expectation of about 44% for 2020. When you specifically think about the investments, I think a lot of its being driven towards delivery. Those are -- those big wins Gary talked about are significant dollars of revenue sitting in the implementation backlog that we want to get those capabilities in there faster and get the wins turning into revenue. They would flow across both Banking and Merchant, primarily in terms of the incremental investment with incremental sales flowing in Banking and Merchant as well, as we see a very, very robust pipeline, particularly in some large opportunities in the marketplace right now.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Understood. And just as a follow-up, the $250 million increase in the run rate of cost synergies for 2020. Is that mostly all OpEx? Or is there a little bit more interest expense in there too? I think you had that incremental refined in December.","Woody Woodall","We expected it to be almost every dollar OpEx related.","Gary Norcross","Absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. And next, we will go to line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller","Hey. Thanks guys. Nice results. Look, we saw strong revenue trends of about 7%. I think it was really driven by Merchant at 10, and Capital Markets really strong at 8. When we look at these synergies rolling out and notwithstanding the tough comp in first quarter, can you just touch on the range the 6 to 7 versus the fourth quarter run rate? Notwithstanding the first quarter tough comp, it seems like there should be a trend towards the better end of that seven, if not higher. And then, maybe if you just give us some scenarios that would be at the high-end and the low-end that you could see playing out through the year? Thanks.","Woody Woodall","Yes, I think, I even called it out in my prepared remarks. After the first quarter, we anticipate to be at the high end of our growth guidance for the remainder of the year. Again, consolidate you are placing about a point of growth that's where the 5% to 6% came from. Beyond that, we would expect to be towards the high end of that range.","Darrin Peller","Okay. I guess what I'm wondering is if like what specific scenarios could run you to the end or potentially in the low end, beyond, just the timing and the cadence, timing on synergies, perhaps. Maybe just some examples of how revenue synergies are going? What led you to raise the revenue synergy targets?","Gary Norcross","Yeah, no, we raised \u2013 it\u2019s great question, Darren. We raised the revenue synergy guidance just because of our actual cross-sell wins. What propels us to the upper end of that will clearly be the timely on-boarding of these large implementations that Woody discussed. And as you see, like we have in the past, we\u2019re accelerating some investment into this growth curve as the growth curve accelerates and our backlog builds. Obviously, we want to make sure that we have the personnel necessary to install the solutions. But the response to our solution capabilities is just really been tremendous across both Banking and Merchant -- we feel -- and Capital Markets for that nature. We highlighted across the winning Capital Markets with our premium payback in prepared remarks. So really across all the segments, we're just seeing really good solid demand for next generation solution suite. Our pipeline continues to grow, and our sales, more importantly, and we continue to close the business. And all of that pushed us to raise our revenue guide. We exited the year with $80 million in run rate. And that's installed in producing revenue. So that's well ahead of our initial $100 million target for them to 2020. So when you look back into that we are already at $80 million through the first five months, when you look at the sales that we even just highlighted in Q4. And as those on board in the first half or through the first three quarters of the year, plus with our pipeline, we feel really good about revenue synergies. And to Woody's point, feel very confident about the upper end of those guidance ranges.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. If I just squeeze in the two big banks you won, First Republic and Union. Those are really large wins that we don't see often. So can you just give a little quick color on that? And then I'll go back to the queue. Thanks.","Gary Norcross","Yeah, we talked a lot about on this call about \u2013 one, there were three significant wins. There was a top 10 that we didn't name, but there was also the top 20 and top 30 that you just mentioned. We talked a lot about on this call is that there is a tremendous amount of pent up demand in the marketplace. And this is a global statement of very large financial institutions that are tied to extremely old legacy platforms. And we talked a lot about when we'll see that market finally starting to transition to a much more modern, much more open architecture to allow them to continue to compete for the next several decades. And I think this quarter was a significant moment in the industry where we saw, as I said, a top 10 institution and top 20 institution, and top 30 institution, all makes that decision to go through a transformation as a core banking. And in many instances, they're going off very multiple decades old type legacy capabilities to a much more future modern architecture. So we're real excited about what we're seeing in the industry. I can honestly tell you the pipeline is full as I've ever seen for core banking on a global basis for next generation capabilities. And we feel very good about the fact. We started this investment cycle. Three, four years ago, we've been investing heavily into these next generation capabilities, and really feel like we're in a very good spot, as far as timing the industry for when that transformation is going to begin.","Operator","Thank you. And next, we will go to the line of Tim Chiodo with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Tim Chiodo","Thanks a lot guys. So my question is on the Worldpay e-commerce acquiring business, clearly, a leader in global e-commerce acquiring. And then, also Worldpay in many, many in-store markets, sort of a good number of key markets globally. But there does seem to be an opportunity to expand in store acquiring into new international countries. And just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about how we should think about that expansion, rough timing, what the opportunity is? And just a confirmation, that potential upside is not actually in the formal revenue synergies?","Gary Norcross","No, again, that's a great question, and you're exactly right. It's not in the revenues synergies upside. And we are actively working through those strategies, and we will be pushing into those other markets as you described. We're very excited about the Merchant team and how it\u2019s come together under FIS. We're very excited about the combinations that we're seen between our banking relationships and our broader merchant relationships. And so, like everything we do, we participate on a global basis. We've already been seeing up the countries that we're focusing on building out those market strategies, aligning our development initiatives to correspond of that. And so more will be coming on that. But that's absolutely upside to the future of the company.","Operator","Thank you. And next we will go the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thank you. Hi, guys. Hi, Woody.","Woody Woodall","Hi, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hey, good solid 4Q \u201919 results. I\u2019m kind of -- I was hoping that since you stood by the future 8% to 9% growth, I'm hoping you can kind of bridge the 6% to 7% this year, and thinking this is going to be closer to 7% like you mentioned in the earlier question. To bridge that gap, with regards to how much of that close from incremental synergies versus some of these larger wins? It seems like they're more -- they seem to be longer events because they're very large like, a top 10 bank, for example, might take longer. Could you talk a little bit about that?","Gary Norcross","Yeah. No, I think, you're exactly right. Obviously, these larger programs do take a longer period of time to implement. We've talked about that multiple times on the call. It\u2019s not uncommon that goes through 12-plus month sale cycle, and then you got receptacle 12-plus month implementation cycle. What makes us excited about driving our growth rates beyond 7% and upper single-digits is not only the demand that we're seeing on cross-sell in revenue synergies, we talk a lot about that, and we continue to not only raise the dollar amount of that. We've also raised the timing of it being falling it in earlier than what we thought. But we also, when we talked about this now for multiple, multiple quarters, we're in well over a year now, a really rapid sales growth around our newer technologies. And that's whether it's on the Banking business, on the Merchant business or on the Capital Markets business, the demand we\u2019re seeing for our cloud-based deployments, our ability to lower the total cost of ownership of these large institutions and drive a real differentiating value proposition is playing out very well in the market. So you've got this combination of revenue synergies. But more importantly, this combination of being able to compete and take share and drive significant new sales wins across all of three of our verticals gives us a lot of confidence that our growth profile is going to continue to accelerate in the out years as Woody discussed.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. And I might have missed it, but did you -- from just clarification perspective provide either the TRA terminations included in the tax rate outlook and I might have missed the e-commerce growth rate if you specifically provided that within Merchant?","Woody Woodall","Yeah, I'll touch on both of those. On the e-commerce growth rate, e-commerce and integrated together grew mid to high teens with e-commerce growing higher over the average, and integrated grown slightly lower than that average, rolling back to a mid to high teens. With regard to the TRAs, the structure of the deal is only giving an immaterial benefit to EPS in 2020 and 2021 with further EPS benefit in 2022 and 2023 just on the way the deal was actually structured and the timing of actual owner ownership of the TRAs, Ashwin.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning, Gary and Woody.","Woody Woodall","Good morning, David.","David Togut","Good to see the Merchant Solutions growth returned to 10% organic in Q4. If you could break down your expectations for 2020, what do you call low-double digit organic expected for merchants. What would your outlook fee for e-com and integrated as kind of one bucket, and then sort of the other channels kind of growth rate for 2020?","Woody Woodall","Yeah. If you think about Merchant, I think we would still anticipate e-com and integrated to be in the mid to high teens from a planning perspective. Growth in the fourth quarter was strong, expectation and pipeline is strong, so we still feel very good about that. With the profile of the remainder of the business being similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter on the growth profile, obviously, we're hoping to see some of those synergies flow into both Banking and Merchants. So you've got to balance them around 2020. Our expectation around revenue synergies blends roughly 50-50, going into the Banking segment versus the Merchant segment. But yeah, we're still pleased with the overall growth, certainly pleased with the acceleration in the fourth quarter, and are looking for low double digits, all of 2020.","David Togut","Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. I think what historically you model in about 150 basis points of revenue headwind annually from consolidation in pricing pressure. Can you kind of share with us your expectations on that front for 2020 and are there any specific consolidations that are kind of baked into your guidance?","Gary Norcross","Yeah, we would have similar levels of competitive headwinds that we always baked into the model, so no real change there. David, I would say at this point, we don't have anything specifically outlined, other than historical trends.","Woody Woodall","Yeah, no, when we think about consolidation in the industry, we think obviously across our client base is primarily impacting the banking capital markets group that's going to continue, but we're not, we're not, we're not projecting that's going to accelerate dramatically from where, from what we saw in 2019. So it's been, it's been a fairly consistent trend. One of the nice things about that FIS' position is because we're typically positioned in the large regional market. Those tend to be the customers that are doing in the consolidating. So we've been in a lot of instances the beneficiary of that, of those combinations. But we'll continue to watch it closely and but modeling pretty well consistent behavior over 2019 on that front.","Operator","And next we will go to the line of Dave Koning with Robert. W. Baird. Please go ahead. ","Dave Koning","Yeah. And I guess, first of all you know when you first gave the accretion to the $6.60 number, maybe a few quarters ago or so, I guess since then we've had, what we think maybe $0.30 of benefit from just better synergies, lower refi, tax rate, I think a little better. Is it fair to think of the bridge that that would have maybe brought it up $0.30 or so, put these incremental investments and then what looks like no real use of cash in 2020. It looks like you're not really trying to push the share count down at least in guidance. Those two things maybe are what's bringing it back a little bit down, is that a fair bridge?","Woody Woodall","That's pretty close, yeah. When we guided accretion and I think in the third quarter, we didn't anticipate the second round of refi benefit. We absolutely we're pleased and being able to go back into the market and grab another $135 million or so of interest savings. We saw that as an opportunity along with the sales execution that was delivered in the fourth quarter to reinvest that in sales and delivery, which we kind of described before. We certainly are not buying back shares at this point until we reach our deleveraging targets. So those are primarily your two big deltas, Dave. You got it pretty close.","Dave Koning","Okay, good. And then two really quick modeling ones, the size of that acquisition and when that hits and then, is the tough comp in Q1 is that solely in the banking segment.","Woody Woodall","The tough comp in Q1 is in the banking segment. The small acquisition was roughly revenue contribution of about $75 million in 2019. And we closed it relatively early in Q1.","Operator","Thank you. And next, we will go to the line up George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead. ","Georgios Mihalos","Hey guys, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Gary and Woody, I'm not sure if I missed it, but did you give what the increase in backlog is year-over-year. I think it was up 9% last quarter. Just curious if you have an update on that, and any color on any specific segment strength that may have been surprising to you.","Woody Woodall","We didn't give a specific dollar amount of backlog, that will get disclosed in the 10-K. What we did talk about was the implementation backlog component of that overall backlog was the highest I've ever seen. While we didn't give a dollar amount, it certainly connected to the three or four, the three big wins in core banking that Gary described plus some of the big wins in Merchant.","Gary Norcross","Yeah, we really saw great strength in the quarter. And frankly, for the whole year across all three of our segments really saw great growth in capital markets around our Reg Tech solutions and some of the things we're doing through our SaaS model and cloud-based technologies. The Banking business saw strong sales across our next generation solutions, our next-generation digital, our omnichannel things we're doing there. Obviously, we highlighted, what's going on with our core banking transformation. And then Woody has talked about several times on the call the strength we saw across e-comm and integrated in the merchant business. So we're very pleased with how '19 unfold, and obviously all of that pushes us into 2020 with a lot of, a lot of new sales we have to deliver on, which is good.","Georgios Mihalos","Well, that's great. You guys really build up on the opportunity. And just as a quick follow-up, if we can kind of shift gears a little bit just to the merchant side. I'm just curious, your perspective has been some more consolidation in Europe now curious if you think that will have any impact on the business whether competitively or from a partnership standpoint and then Visa looking to adjust interchange and potentially raising it I guess on the e-comm side. Just curious if you think that will have any impact on the legacy Worldpay business. Thank you.","Gary Norcross","Well, look we continually focus on all kind of all the combinations going on, any M&A activity, any partnerships and obviously we watch that very closely. At this point in time, we feel very good about our position across the globe, especially in Merchant and our ability. When you look at our -- when you look at our scale on merchant and our ability to truly be the only global provider of e-comm at scale, we feel very good about our positions, but we'll continue to -- we'll continue to watch those things. As far as these typically we pass on all of those through our fee structure very transparently. So obviously, we're working through those changes. But we don't see any impact at the moment.","Operator","Thank you. And next, we will go the line of Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tim Willi","Yes. Thanks to you, and good morning. I had two questions. The first was, again back to the Merchant, a little bit. Thinking about again the capabilities that you talked about with Worldpay and the omnichannel, and over the last four years to five years, whatever it is, retailers have been investing substantially in digital commerce platforms. When you think about pipelines for sales activity, are we at a point where retailers are sort of reevaluating what they've now built sort of focusing on the back-end side, the operational aspect of this. Some of them got to consumer side, correct. And sort of wondering if there is an escalation in RFPs or something you might see coming down the pipe for sort of global omnichannel that might be different now than even a year ago, year and a half ago, so we farther down this journey with the retailers.","Gary Norcross","Tim, it's a good question. What I would tell you is obviously we've only been involved now, a little over five months to six months. What I'm telling you -- what we're seeing in the sales cycle, yeah, I wouldn't say an increase in RFP activity, but what I would say is, we're seeing increased pipeline and increased demand for our capabilities. And so we're obviously leaning into that. Worldpay had made some significant investments around omnichannel leading up to our combination. Obviously, they had made some significant investments in e-commerce. They had also made some, some significant investments in the UK on the new acquiring platform. So when you look at all of those things, what they had done on the consolidation between Vantiv and Worldpay, all of that is playing in very nicely into our sales success and allowing us to compete on a global very effectively. So we're seeing very good strong pipeline growth and good solid sales success especially across the e-commerce and omnichannel as I highlighted, one in Europe in my prepared remarks.","Timothy Willi","Great. And then my follow-up and I'll hop back in the queue is on sales, you talked a lot about cross-sell on this call and I know you guys are always looking at the sales force and optimization and making through your cross selling and selling effectively, has there been any changes as you move through this integration with Worldpay in terms of sales structure compensation for cross-selling. Anything along those lines that maybe is kicking in and help think to elevate the performance that you highlighted on this call?","Gary Norcross","You know on prior calls, we actually highlighted the fact that we didn't want to change any commission plans. We want to make sure that everybody was very focused and prepared to execute and got the same credit they got before the combination pulled together. That's always been an important step for us because the last thing we want to do is create any confusion across our sales force. So I think the cost of those because we haven't made any changes and because we're now giving everybody an opportunity to pull these other products. That's helped to increase our pull-through. I think the other side of it and we highlighted it on the call in the prepared remarks is we're just finding more and more capabilities across the two companies that resonate with those existing customers.","So I highlighted our prepaid opportunity. That was something we really didn't identify during due diligence. But what that came out of a cross-sell into an existing Worldpay customer that now has allowed us to create a whole new opportunity and we see a lot of growth in that opportunity now as we've built that out. So I think those two things just pulling the teams together because we're a full 12 months ahead of where we thought we'd be on integration. The benefits of the team coming together and working as a team and identifying those opportunities, you're just really seeing that pay through in the cross sells.","Operator","Thank you. And next we will go to the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead. ","Craig Maurer","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First is, I wanted to understand what's assumed in underlying UK trends to allow you to hit the guidance this year as we've seen some significant call-outs of the weaker UK from Visa Barclaycard etc. And just secondly, there was a meaningful uptick or at least significantly more than higher than our expectation in stock-based compensation, and I wanted to understand the trend there. Thank you.","Gary Norcross","Well, on the UK front, as we talked about in prior calls, we've modeled -- frankly our UK volumes are already pretty much at recessionary levels. We saw a little softness in quarter on the UK, but we've modeled that end. We've really modeled in no recovery. But we've also modeled in the volumes at about where they were in Q4. In other words, we're not modeling them to -- to fall off a significant amount. We feel very comfortable though with our, with the business that we are signing. We've also got some new leadership in the UK. So we think there is an opportunity that really grow our share in the UK as well. So we're pretty excited of what the team is coming together on that front. But the quick answer is for 2020 we pretty much modeled the UK consistent with what we saw in 2019.","Woody Woodall","On the stock compensation comment, the vast majority of it is around accelerations related to severance activity in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And next we will go to Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ramsey El-Assal","All right, thanks for taking my question. I guess dovetailing with Craig's question just before mine, can you comment on external and macro factors that you have baked in the guidance, obviously we've been hearing a lot of that for coronavirus but also the IT spending environment and we have the election year impacts on bank budgets just what are you presuming in the context of your guidance.","Gary Norcross","Yeah, let me take a few of these and then will let Woody get into the details. But the quick answer is we've modeled a fairly consistent 2019. I would say it that way and our pandemic taskforce is obviously very focused on the coronavirus. Right now we don't see any material impact for us throughout the Asian region. If we do have any impact at all, it would just be a matter of a few million dollars in Q1, but we're monitoring it very closely and frankly we're very comfortable that but that's not going to be an issue. So we continue to watch those things. But as far as when we look at the growth rates around the world we are minor modeling consistency through 2020. Any other comments, Woody?","Woody Woodall","Yeah. As we've talked about in the last quarter, we continue to see a model softness in the UK and Europe broadly. We have not put anything in our 2020 plan with regard to some outcome from the election. The remainder of it has been relatively status quo in terms of the underlying health of the global economy.","Ramsey El-Assal","Okay. And then secondly, and lastly from me, could you give us kind of a status report on some of the key revenue synergy buckets. I think you mentioned that the debit opportunity was now at scale. I think that was introduced in the press, in the presentation, which I presume is somewhat fully executed upon. What about the other key synergy buckets, what inning are you in terms of the Premium Payback realization of synergies and maybe also on the card-not-present authorization rates progress there. I think you mentioned that a little bit on your prepared remarks but ...","Gary Norcross","Yeah. No, no, Ramsey it's great questions. I would say we're just, obviously we're just getting started with our revenue synergies. While we're excited about $80 million, we've got a long way to go to reach our range targets. We feel great about our targets and obviously we feel great about the sales success we've had. I would tell you, I even put in my prepared remarks, our debit routing has done very well and so that continues to contribute. We actually saw good volumes, additional volumes incoming through in the quarter.","So I would say we are not completely finished there, but as you highlighted in late innings and those were some very early wins. Premium Payback, we're just getting started. I mean we had some very significant signings. You don't want to trivialize a top 3 merchant and PayPal. I mean those are, those are just huge opportunities. Obviously, we got to deploy those next year. So we haven't started seeing revenue growth but more important than that we're seeing really large pipeline and additional sales around Premium Payback. So that's, those aren't the only two that we've signed.","We've now signed a number of customers. The one that has surprised us is merchant referral program across our regional banks. We actually didn't predict the response that we're seeing on that base in our larger institutions, which is a very pleasant surprise. As far as the authorization rates and fraud rates, we've talked about that on prior calls, really just working on the models, working on the data consolidation. So I would argue those results have not even started at this point and we're doing the work, leading up to doing the work that will then drive the results in late 2020 and 2021. So very early stages on a lot of these things, but feel really good about the early results, the signings to date in the pipeline.","Operator","Thank you. And next, we will go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff","Good morning, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.","Woody Woodall","Thank you.","Brett Huff","I know we're getting near the end of the game here on the Q&A. So I'll just ask one, a little more detail on the core wins. So we've been doing this a long time, and we've been hearing about the big banks going to do their core transformations for what 15 years. Is it just really the beginning of that? And you guys got three of the big ones but I guess my question really is, if we're finally at that tipping point, what is your visibility into the other big banks that you serve also doing the same thing?","Woody Woodall","Yeah. I'll add some color, Brent. And then let Gary follow on. Even if you go back to the Investor Day, a couple of years ago, we had one of the questions in the audience was, will you ever see a top 20 or a top 30 bank outsource to a company like FIS. This quarter we saw three. So I want to say it's really important that we're seeing some of this as a tipping point as I've described, the pipeline is very full and we're feeling very optimistic about it.","Gary Norcross","Yeah, no, I really do. I think it's just a matter, we talked about it in the past. We're really seeing a transformation around technology that frankly none of us have seen in our careers. And so with this transformation in technology, a lot of people talk about the fourth Industrial Revolution. But the reality is these newer technologies are going to require a replacement. You're not going to be able to iterate your legacy technologies, you're going to have to go through a conversion that really take the advantage of these new open standards, this new scaled standards, this new availability standards. And so, yeah, Brett, I think we really have as I said in our prepared remarks, we are seeing a significant milestone in the industry when you've got a top 10, a top 20 and a top 30 bank all making their decision to go through that transformation.","Woody's points are dead on. We've had a lot of early success with our next generation core banking system, modern banking platform but what we are. But now frankly that's one of the reasons why we're investing so much in delivery. We've got a very, very strong pipeline and active discussions going on. So we don't expect these to be the only big deals announced. So we're excited about it, and we do believe this is a global issue. I was just over in Asia earlier in January, and every customer I met with and even in Q4, when I was outside of the country, every CEO, I was meeting with is talking about this issue. And so this is a global opportunity for FIS and I just think we're very well positioned and just getting started. And I think for the next 10 years, you're going to see this kind of transformation is going to occur across core banking.","Brett Huff","That's I needed. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","James Friedman","Hi. Thank you. And let me echo the congratulations. I'll just ask my two upfront in the interest of time. So with regard to the 100 basis points and 150 basis points of reinvestment related to delivery, what should we think about that is one-time in nature or will it go away in '21? And then while we're making our models on a quarterly basis, thank you for the call-outs about Q1, are there any other call-outs that we should remember about the other quarters in terms of non-recurring? Thank you.","Woody Woodall","Yeah, I think your second question first. I think the only other call-out would be fourth quarter 2019, we called out about 2 points of benefit in capital markets that we don't anticipate. We actually normalize and set the underlying growth of 6% versus 8% that you see on some of the charts. Beyond that no other call-outs. If you go back to the original question would we continue to invest or is this one time? I certainly hope we continue to invest here. If we continue to see sales, particularly in some of these larger institutions outsourcing their core banking, I'd certainly be happy to continue to make this investment in delivery.","Gary Norcross","Yeah, look, we want to make sure, James, whatever we do is that we continue to invest behind our growth to continue to accelerate that growth curve. So like we've seen in the, we've got a real unique opportunity here where we really do see the market moving through our sales results and our sales channels across all of our segments. So they need to have ability to invest in that and deliver on these capabilities and get them in market and help further accelerate our sales team, we're investing in sales resources, as well. So Woody talked about that, it is not just all delivery. Right now we've got a tremendous amount of demand, we want to make sure that we have the necessary people in markets that can capture and capitalize on these opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now go back to Gary Norcross with any closing remarks.","Gary Norcross","Thank you. I'm proud of our outstanding results in 2019. I also want to recognize the work our team has done to accelerate our integration timeline by a full 12 months. I would also like to thank all of our associates across the globe who are working hard every day to advance the way the world pays banks and invest.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Pete Gunnlaugsson. Please go ahead, Pete.","Peter Gunnlaugsson - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the FIS's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. Turning to slide 2, Gary Norcross, President and Chief Executive Officer will begin with performance highlights for the company. Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. As always, today's news release and corresponding supplemental slide presentation are available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Turning to slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release and in the appendix of the supplemental slide presentation.","Turning to slide 4. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Gary to discuss the business highlights for the quarter and the full year. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Pete. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am very pleased to open this morning's call affirming another strong quarter for FIS, concluding a very good year of performance and earnings growth.","Turning to slide 5. In the year, we exceeded our financial goals delivering total shareholder returns of 27%, and more than doubling the returns provided by the S&P 500. This was accomplished by delivering full-year financial results, encompassing 11% EBITDA growth, 19% adjusted earnings per share growth, $1.5 billion in free cash flow, and $341 million return to shareholders in dividends.","We're significantly improved the revenue and margin profile of our Global Financial Solutions segment. With the full year of SunGard results through consistent growth of high margin, IP-led solutions, and cost synergies, we exceeded our integration commitments putting FIS ahead of schedule allowing us to increase our synergy targets twice in 2016.","As part of this call, we're increasing them again, with the current overall target to now exceed $275 million exiting 2017. This continues our track record of delivering on and exceeding our synergy targets on large, transformational acquisitions. We also successfully divested the public sector and education businesses, bringing us capital to pay down debt, as well as to reinvest into our long-term core businesses within IFS and GFS.","Turning to Q4. Our results were underpinned by the strongest sales quarter of the year and despite ongoing financial institution consolidation, we built on the positive momentum established in the prior three quarters allowing us to exit the year with solid sales performance.","Strategically, we are investing in the business to drive innovation into our different markets to deliver long-term growth and superior shareholder returns. Our SunGard acquisition, one year later, has been a meaningful value creator for our shareholders. Our strategy has been to continue to expand our broad array of IP-led solutions built for the financial services industry.","In 2017, we will continue driving the strategy, focused on our three growth levers. First, we will continue to execute on our investment strategy to deliver new, differentiating capabilities, leveraging digital technology and advanced analytics to help our clients progress their competitive position. This multi-pronged investment strategy encompasses reinvestment back into our existing solutions, as well as increasing investments in new innovative solutions to meet the growing demands of the markets we serve.","A proof point of this strategy is our continued execution of our data center consolidation strategy as previously discussed at our May Investor Day. A key component of this strategy is the accelerated deployment of our FIS private cloud. Our cloud strategy is focused on re-platforming the legacy server-based technology to new cloud technologies to gain the benefits of speed, efficiency, and scale, which allows us to maintain and grow our margins. In 2016, we concluded the year with over 20% of our server-based client systems running in our private cloud. And we anticipate this percentage to nearly double by the end of 2017.","Second, we will continue to capitalize on our expanded scale, operating leverage and our disciplined integration to fuel growth. We have captured a steady stream of new wins and expanded business through cross-sell and upsell of our new portfolio assets from the SunGard acquisition. This further allows us to meet pressing industry needs for efficiency and growth with FIS integrated solution suites. Third, our strong cash flow generation enables us to invest for growth, continue to pay down debt, and return capital to shareholders. This strategic focus allows us to compete effectively to meet client and market demand.","Turning to slide 6 to review segment highlights, our Integrated Financial Solutions segment drove strong top line organic revenue growth of 5% for the year. We are very pleased with these results, as they are at the high end of our three-year outlook. In the quarter, our IFS segment signed several new competitive takeaways encompassing our core Banking, Digital and Payment Solution offerings.","For example, a northeast community bank with more than $2 billion in assets selected FIS to provide a complete suite of Banking and Payment solutions, spanning our digital payments, item processing, and commercial treasury offerings to help drive its growth through next generation technology. Additionally, a fast-growing Texas bank serving 25 communities will be implementing FIS core banking, bill pay, digital banking, and item processing to support its growth and efficiency goals.","Our digital and corporate liquidity business had an exceptional quarter, growing by double-digits. Demand for our corporate liquidity solutions by both banks and non-FI organizations continues and is highlighted by a significant new fourth quarter win with a $40-plus billion global business. In addition, consumer demand for mobile innovation continues to drive strong growth, resulting in double-digit growth in digital, primarily driven by new client wins and continued user adoption in the market.","Within our payments business, we renewed our largest outsourced bill pay client, a bank with more than $140 billion in assets for another multi-year term, continuing a strong relationship that began in 2011. As we discussed in previous quarters, while our EMV deployment continues, we will experience grow-over challenges throughout 2017 from the initial adoption period, but we're confident in the underlying fundamentals of our payments business and continue to see increased demand and adoption for our new payment innovations. In October, we announced a significant new agreement with oil and gas giant, BP. This real-time loyalty program enables consumers to redeem points for discounts at BP stations nationwide in the U.S.","Next, our GFS business recorded top line organic growth of 5% for the full year, and significantly expanded margins through strong, high margin product sales. This positive trend is reflective of the material improvement to the structure of this operating segment, largely attributable to the SunGard acquisition and the successful integration work to date. As expected, our Institutional and Wholesale business delivered its strongest sales quarter of the year, primarily driven by robust sales for our buy side, risk and compliance solutions, with growth contributions from all major business lines. I&W's year-end growth surpassed our expectations and validated our acquisition diligence findings. Refocusing the I&W business on solution-focused sales is beginning to show true benefits.","During the quarter, we signed a new strategic agreement with one of Asia's largest independent financial services groups. This new win integrates more than a dozen offerings into a solution that can be replicated with other clients. For the quarter, we realized exceptional license growth from both the timing of large renewals as well as new and add-on sales. We also signed a significant multi-year agreement with a large U.S. insurance company for our managed services solution that allows them to efficiently operate their mission-critical back office platform utilizing our software.","The FIS derivatives utility continues to see positive gains, anchored by two significant global financial institutions, Credit Suisse and Barclays, running live in the utility for a full quarter. As expected, our consulting business delivered strong double-digit growth in Q4 due to an easier comparable, as we have discussed. We are pleased with the new leadership team and their execution to refocus on strategic management consulting engagement.","Turning to slide 7. Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize today by re-emphasizing that we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results. Our outlook for 2017 is positive, despite increased disruption from new market entrants and uncertainties posed by potential governmental policy changes, including potential changes to regulations, interest rates, or corporate taxes.","To meet our 2017 goals, we will continue to focus on our SunGard integration efforts with high intensity, driving profitable growth through new sales, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders.","Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. I will begin on slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and for the full year of 2016. Today, consistent with our prior 2016 earnings announcements, all adjusted numbers and calculations are on an adjusted combined basis, as if SunGard was owned in both periods.","In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 4.8% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to $846 million, a 15.2% increase compared to the prior year. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $377 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 22.6% to $1.14 per share.","For the year, revenue increased 4.6% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to $2.9 billion, an 11.1% increase compared to the prior-year period. EBITDA margin expanded 220 basis points to 31.2%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 18.6% to $3.82 per share. We finished the year marginally exceeding our run rate synergy goal of $200 million for 2016.","Moving to slide 10. In the four quarter, IFS revenue grew on an organic basis by 2.5%, while EBITDA grew 5%, primarily driven by a favorable shift in revenue mix, coupled with executing ongoing cost management initiatives.","For full-year 2016, IFS revenue increased 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA increased 4.2% compared to the prior-year period. Adjusting for the absence of incentive accruals discussed in the prior quarter, EBITDA would've increased 5.7% for the year, reflecting margin expansion of 20 basis points on an apples-to-apples basis.","Turning to slide 11. Banking and Wealth was relatively flat for the quarter. This was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the completion of the previously disclosed professional services project. Absent this, the IP-led product business grew approximately 3%.","Payments grew 1.1% for the quarter. As we've discussed previously, EMV growth comparables will become more difficult in the second half of the year. We issued 7 million EMV cards in the quarter. When combined with the previous quarter's EMV results, approximately 50% of our clients are EMV-enabled. As we've discussed previously, we expect the remainder of cards to be EMV-enabled in a natural reissuance cycle as they expire.","Corporate and digital produced growth of 12.5% for the quarter. This growth was driven primarily by strong sales for corporate liquidity and continued double-digit revenue growth in digital solutions. In addition to the large contract Gary mentioned, our corporate liquidity solutions had strong license revenue, contributing to the growth. As discussed in prior quarters, we did not expect IFS results in the second half of the year to replicate the exceptional growth in the first half of the year. We are pleased with the organic growth of 5%, and profitability results for the year.","Turning to slide 12. In the fourth quarter, GFS revenue grew 7.7% organically while EBITDA grew 31.3%. For the quarter, this represents 700 basis points of margin expansion to 36%. For full-year 2016, revenue increased 5% organically. EBITDA grew 17.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting 380 basis points of margin expansion to 30.4%. This was driven by higher margin product sales and cost synergies.","2016 margin results exceeded our expectations and marked an important milestone for the SunGard transaction. As we outlined in previous calls, we expected to exceed 30% margins over time in this segment. We're very pleased to complete 2016 at just over 30%, which was faster than anticipated.","As discussed earlier this year, the GFS segment has shown significant structural improvement as a result of the SunGard acquisition, which improved the revenue quality, increasing the amount of revenue tied to recurring IP-led solutions. This improved revenue mix and the execution of our integration plan contributed to significant margin expansion in the segment. As discussed in May, we continue to expect margin expansion of 100 basis points to 150 basis points annually for the segment.","Moving to slide 13. Our Institutional and Wholesale business grew 8.7% for the quarter, driven by buy-side and risk and compliance solutions. This result aligns with our previous commentary related to quarterly seasonality for this business, which has heavier sales activity in the fourth quarter. Banking and Payments grew 2.5% organically. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased card processing volumes in Brazil and payment strength in Australia, resulting from completion of a client conversion in the quarter.","Consulting results for the quarter were in line with our expectations of double-digit growth, primarily driven by easy comparables to the prior year quarter. As we discussed throughout 2016, we continue to see softness in discretionary spending going into 2017. Macroeconomic events during 2016 such as Brexit and the U.S. elections have not altered our expectations of continuing softness and demand for people-based services at this time.","Moving to slide 14. Corporate and Other revenue for the fourth quarter was $159 million, with an EBITDA loss of $44 million. The Corporate and Other segment results include $88 million of Corporate expenses for the quarter, compared to $77 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven primarily by higher incentive accruals in the quarter.","Moving to slide 15. Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow. Free cash flow was $435 million for the quarter and $1.5 billion for the year. In the fourth quarter, our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings was 115%. We reduced our debt by approximately $1 billion in 2016, and had approximately $10.5 billion of debt outstanding as of December 31. In 2016, we returned $341 million in dividends and ended the year with weighted average shares outstanding of 330 million on a fully diluted basis. In line with our previous guidance, the effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter and full year.","Turning to slide 16. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our public sector and education businesses. As we recently announced, the transaction closed on February 1, 2017. Based on the timing of the close, this transaction created a $0.13 adjusted EPS headwind for 2017, net of interest expense savings. For the purposes of modeling, full-year 2016 EBITDA for PS&E, was approximately $80 million. The transaction produced approximately $500 million of net cash proceeds, which was used to pay down debt.","We also announced we will redeem our $700 million, 5% interest senior notes due 2022. The redemption of these notes accelerates our deleveraging efforts and reduces our interest expense. We anticipate using free cash flow in 2017 to eliminate all our remaining prepayable debt, reducing our outstanding debt below $9 billion by the end of the year. Finally, due to our 2016 performance, we recently announced a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share.","Looking forward to 2017, due to the strategic nature and scale of the IFS and GFS segments, I would like to provide some additional color on segment drivers, which guided our planning process for the year. We are also providing guidance on IFS and GFS revenue growth in 2017. IFS will continue to serve our U.S. market, consolidating at the higher end of its historical trends.","We also continue to see aggressive competition across all our solutions. These factors are driving us to the lower end of IFS long-term organic revenue guidance. GFS will continue to see strong growth in institutional and wholesale, and an improvement in our Banking and Payment Solutions. We expect single-digit growth for our consulting services for the full year. Specific to the first quarter of 2017, both IFS and GFS faced difficult comparisons, primarily driven by a previously discussed people-based project, and the anniversary of accelerated EMV card production in IFS, and a large license renewal in GFS.","For the full year, Corporate and Other segment, which houses our non-strategic assets, we created approximately 1% top line headwind to consolidated organic revenue growth. This decline is primarily driven by a loss of the client, who was acquired in late 2016, continuing decline in check volumes at the point of sale, and loss attributed to the planned divestiture of the public and sector (sic) [sector and] (19:31) education revenue growth. To be clear, organic growth is adjusted for the divestiture of PS&E, but the loss of higher growth from this business will be a headwind during the year.","Finally, in addition to our debt payments and dividends, we expect to generate excess cash in 2017. This will create flexibility for other cash uses beginning in late 2017 and into 2018, including, but not limited to, share buybacks.","Turning to slide 17. For 2017, we expect consolidated organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%, IFS organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, GFS organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.04 billion to $3.12 billion, implying reported growth of 3% to 6%, or 6% to 9% adjusting for the impact of the PS&E divestiture. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.30 per share representing growth of 9% to 13%, or 12% to 16% adjusted for the impact of the PS&E divestiture and does not include any share buybacks.","Finally, exiting the year with a cost synergy run rate in excess of $275 million, an increase from our previous target of $250 million. Similar to last year, we have also provided additional assumptions to better assist your modeling efforts for the year. These are found in the appendix of today's presentation. Of note, I would like to call out our effective tax rate assumption for the year, which is 32%. This 300 basis point reduction from the prior year period is driven by efficient tax planning strategies, growth in lower tax geographies, and the impact from changes in accounting treatment of stock-based compensation.","Current consensus estimates do not fully reflect the impact of the public sector and education divestiture. Further, to help with modeling, the quarterly spread of our expectations for 2017, we expect first quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.83. For fourth quarter of 2017, our expectations are up to $0.05 per share above current consensus estimates. This reflects the full-year impact of the divestiture of PS&E, the previously discussed grower risk (21:54) in IFS and GFS in the first quarter, as well as higher seasonality in the fourth quarter and timing of synergies.","Similar to last year, we have a conservative view on the overall macro conditions and have not assumed any improvements in conditions in the markets we serve. We are confident in our guidance for the year and our ability to continue to drive value to our shareholders through compelling business model and strong cash flow generation.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you now may open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, Dave.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Could you help us gauge the impact of President Trump's executive order last week to repeal elements of Dodd-Frank? In particular, I'm wondering about the possible impact on regulatory and compliance-related spending, which has been a nice growth tailwind for you over the last couple of years; and secondarily, whether this generally reorders bank IT spending priorities.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Dave, that's a good question, and frankly, we don't know what the outcome's going to be and what the impact's going to be overall for FIS. As Woody talked about, we've been very conservative and assume that there'll be no impact. We do believe that if some regulatory reform did occur, that you could see some improvement in IT spending in financial institutions, but also keep in mind the nature of our sales cycles, the nature of our implementation windows, you really wouldn't start seeing any of that impact really until 2018. But we're going to continue to monitor it but, at this point in time, we haven't seen any impact.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. And as a quick follow-up, net interest margin has expanded nicely for banks since President Trump was elected. Could you talk about CEO confidence and whether that is going to impact IT spending at all over the next 12 to 18 months?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I've met with a number of CEOs over the last quarter and actually already into this year, and I will say that there is a genuine sense that the CEOs are getting more confident in the execution of their business and the profitability of their businesses. Obviously, with that, you do hope that that would turn to increasing spend towards IP-led type solutions, deployment. You still have the same need, though, that they still have to continue to lower their cost, improve their overall efficiencies, even in an expanded net interest margin environment.","So once again, all these things would be good things that would indicate and push towards the \u2013 not only the end of 2017, but into 2018 if we start seeing the results of that. Q4 was our largest sales quarter of the year. We talked about that. We've got good pipeline coming into this year, so a number of these things will be attributable, but as I said, those things, even after you book them, you start seeing the revenue after implementation, which is typically a 12-month, give or take, period.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. Just a quick final question for me. Woody, I think you called out a late 2016 client loss tied to an acquisition. Can you bracket for us the impact that'll have on 2017 revenue growth, and is that all IFS? And then is there a contract term fee associated with that as well?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes, that sits in the Corporate and Other segment. It was a commercial services customer, David. The impact to consolidated organic growth is about a point with a combination of that loss and declining check volumes in that segment. The IFS and GFS segments were not affected by this. Again, their growth being in line with what we talked about back in May. And there was a relatively small term fee associated with the transaction.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you very much.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question, it'll come from the line of Dan Koning (sic) [Dave Koning] (26:26) from Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. Yeah, I guess my first question, I guess, is if that Other segment is $400 million of revs, is it actually going to be down like the what, $90 million, $100 million, or something like that? I mean that's kind of the dollar figure to think that little segment's down to create a 1% headwind to the total company.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","That's correct, Dave. It overall is a drag on total company organic growth in that zone.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you. Okay. And then the tax rate, I mean, you guys have done really a nice job there. Is there anything one-off in the 32% this year? And then I guess corollary to that, is this a tax rate that can keep coming down in future years from the 32% to be lower?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, a couple of things. One, I tried to highlight the components of what's driving it. Of the 300 basis point reduction, about 1 point or 100 basis points is really driven by the accounting change in stock comp, where everybody should get some level of benefit there. 200 points is really driven off of tax planning strategies and lower rate geographies. It can continue to go down in the current environment, as we continue to work through tax planning strategies, and as our international revenue base continues to grow.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you. And then finally, just a real quick one. The way to start thinking about the base of 2016 revs to grow from is basically something right around $9.2 billion, I believe, right? That's what your guidance is predicated off of the reported number less the divestiture?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. You've got three moving parts around reported to organic. You've got the $9.2 billion base you're talking about. If you remember, we had a deferred revenue acquisition adjustment around SunGard of about $200 million. We've got expectations of around $75 million of currency impact being a negative, and then the PS&E sale being about 3 points and that would drive you from reported of 1% to 2% to organic of 2% to 3%.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got you. Great. Thank you.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question now comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys. I guess my first question was to \u2013 and you might have mentioned this. I hopped in a little bit late on the call. The fiscal 2018 range that you talked about previously, are we still on track to \u2013 what part of that range, if you can clarify?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. As we talked about in May, we really gave 3% to 7% organic revenue guide over the horizon, with 13% to 18% earnings per share growth. I would not anticipate changing that guide. We do have an adjustment associated with PS&E. But the individual earnings per share growth per year we think is very close to that. If you adjust out PS&E this year, you're in 12% to 16% underlying growth in the business.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Absolutely.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And I guess what I meant was the $4.70 to $5.10 EPS.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, if you remember specifically, we tried to give you an implied number associate, but we're trying to give percentage growth over that horizon. It will be difficult to get to that full $4.70 number, Ashwin, with the sale of PS&E, but we do anticipate in that 13% to 18% EPS growth.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just to clarify, it will be difficult to get to the range or the lower part of the range?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","It will be difficult to get to a $4.70 number with the sale of PS&E. The growth, we believe, will be in the 13% to 18% range for 2018.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Our percentage guide on EPS, Ashwin, we feel very, very comfortable with, but obviously, now that we've sold or divested that business then that number wouldn't participate in that growth percentage. But we're very comfortable with the ranges we gave in May and, frankly, very comfortable with the underlying business and how it's operating.","When you look at the sales pipeline, you look at the sales closures, you look at the concentration now, and the increase of the percentage of revenue that's highly recurring, it just gives us a lot of confidence, not only going into this year, but in our long-term guidance we've provided.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And last quick question, the divestiture that you had in December, PS&E business, can you explain sort of the difference between the $500 million of net cash proceeds versus the gross amount. That $350 million gap seems rather large. We get a number of questions about that. And also, your debt pay down does not seem to include anything further beyond the proceeds of that divestiture. Is that roughly right? The $350 million net expense, I can't get that.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, the $850 million was a gross number on the proceeds. We ended up with a net number of around $500 million. What that read-through is that you had very little tax basis...","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","That's right.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","in the PS&E assets through SunGard and our tax-free acquisition of SunGard. So, you ended up having a tax bill associate with that. Beyond that, we're prepaying all our prepayable debt in 2017, combination of PS&E proceeds, as well as free cash flow, and then anticipate continuing to have additional cash to be able to use for other purposes later in 2017.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the comments around new market entrants and aggressive competition and whatnot. Is that a Global comment? Is it more IFS-specific? And then I'm curious if you can just maybe quantify what that might mean to the growth outlook for 2017.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, we talked a little bit about it, Tien-Tsin, but yeah, no, it's a very competitive environment. We're seeing record levels of money flowing into new start-ups, new disruptors. And frankly, we're competing very effectively with them. If you look throughout 2016, we had a very strong year. We got a very strong pipeline. We were just trying to point out the fact that you are dealing with a very competitive market, frankly, across IFS and GFS. There's a lot of technology innovation going on.","Certainly, we talked about what we're doing with our private cloud to address some of that, not only our cost structures, which allows us to compete effectively and grow. But in IFS, you've got a further issue with consolidation. So, we want to give a balanced view of what the market is and a balanced view is you've got consolidation in IFS, you've got strong competition across both segments, but when you look at our guide, our long-term guide, we're very comfortable with it.","When you look at our earnings per share percentages, as Woody talked about, we're very comfortable with it. So, we've got the portfolio necessary to compete in the market, but we're going to have to continue to drive our innovation in a similar manner. And one of the things Woody highlighted in the deck is our 6% to 7% of revenue back investment into the products and to new innovations, and that's going to continue.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful to hear. Just as a quick follow-up, I guess I've been curious about India and the demonetization and what impact that might have on the ATM work that you're doing there.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, no, we're kind of fortunate in how we structured a lot of our ATMs. A lot of our ATMs are tied to more of a flat fee approach on deployment, and so we don't have as much transaction exposure on it. So, it really had very minimal impact to us. We have now converted well over 90% of all of our ATMs for new currencies. So frankly, it's been business as usual for us this quarter, so we really didn't see much exposure at all on that.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. That's great to hear. Thank you, Gary.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Hey, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","I have one question on Brexit and any update on that? It seems like the consulting business kind of came in as we expected, and I know that's a little bit of the canary in a coal mine in that, but any further commentary on that? I know you said kind of single-digits or maybe high single-digits for consulting this year, so it sounds good but just want commentary on that.","And then I have a second question on the tax rate. I think 300 basis points is worth about $0.15, and so, that means that you guys are getting a $0.15 tailwind, which is included in your guidance, and that just makes that revenue growth guidance seem a little more conservative than maybe I thought it was. So, if you guys could address those, that'd be great. Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, on the Brexit front, certainly, I wouldn't say we're seeing a massive tailwind on our consulting business with related to Brexit. I will say that our European consulting group has performed very well, and we continue to see growth there. We still \u2013 the opportunity for that to be a tailwind certainly exists, but I wouldn't tell you that we're attributing Brexit as a major growth engine for us in 2017.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","If you go into the tax rate, Brett, if you go back to May, we looked at the bridge of earnings growth over the next couple of years. The tax rate was a component of that. We're just getting it a little faster than we anticipate. And to your comment with regard to revenue growth, we wanted to make sure we put together another conservative guide that we felt very comfortable being able to meet or exceed.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. That's what I needed. Thanks, guys.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. On the SunGard acquisition, maybe could you give us some color on what phase of the synergies you're in at this point and where your key focus is.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, Joe, we started on this journey, as we've talked about a number of times. I mean FIS has a very clear playbook that we like to execute on these large transformational acquisitions. That takes us about two years. At the end of two years, what we would tell you is by then the companies are so integrated it's really hard to determine what is truly based on synergies and what are just operating efficiencies that our teams continue to drive in. So, we're really halfway through the process at this point in time.","2016 was an outstanding year from an integration standpoint. We raised guidance on our synergies twice in 2016. Frankly, at the time we started this, we thought there were $200 million of synergies. Over two years, we got that in year one on an exit rate, as Woody talked about. We just raised it again now to we think we'll exit 2017 with $275 million. So, we've got roughly 11 months to go here, left on where we're really focused on what I would say executing our plans and playbook, and then it'll just become part of the operating unit. But we're very focused on it.","We think there's a lot of opportunity. I think I've shared on prior calls, this has been the best combination we've been through as a company. The teams have come together very well. The cultures have come together very well. The clients have been very receptive. We're actually starting to see some nice cross-sell and upsell across the existing SunGard base.","Frankly, we've talked about where they had not pooled their products up under common sales forces to get cross-sell and upsell of their own solution suite. I highlighted a couple of those on the call today. So, 11 months ago, but I would tell you, we're very confident in continuing to integrate this company, and the teams are very focused to continue to discover opportunities to get cost out and operate more efficiently and drive value back to our shareholders and also to our clients.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And my second question, Gary, can you talk about where you're seeing the most strength in that 4Q sales quarter and provide just a little bit more color on the I&W business for 2017? Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, well, we're trying to help everybody kind of understand the new norm in our product portfolio mix. When you really look at the Institutional\/Wholesale side, it's always going to have a strong quarter in Q4. And that's very traditional with license businesses. You've got people wrapping up their budget years. They're wanting to sign on and license products and get projects kicked off so that they can then get deployed throughout the next year. So, you'll always see Q4 being a heavier weight on Institutional\/Wholesale. Frankly, we saw it across the board in that group. I mean very strong production out of the asset management group, out of a lot of our risk and compliance solutions. So, we're just very pleased with where that revenue flowed in, and frankly, the results of the team.","I think some of it is we are starting to get cross-sell and upsell across the SunGard portfolio, which would push that growth rate a little higher. The leadership team has done excellent. The sales team consolidating that. We've got a fantastic sales leader over that group and really driving the team appropriately. So, it really came in as expected, but from that standpoint, with regards to the quarter, but it was across all the major business lines.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk \u2013 and apologize if I missed this before \u2013 talk a little bit about the magnitude of the impacts that the customer consolidation is going to have on your results in IFS, please.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We don't have a specific one. We talked about in May, if you look back to the guide, we talked about in May, what would drive to the lower end of the 3% to 6% and what would drive you to the higher end of the 3% to 6%. Continued higher levels of consolidation would drive you towards the lower end and that's where we're at. We're still at a high level of consolidation and there's very little to no de novo activity in the marketplace.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Right.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Fair enough. And then can you maybe just remind us about in terms of the outlook for the kind of capital markets, focused business, and GFS, whether you're basically assuming the same level of capital markets activity as you saw in Q4? Or are you assuming that maybe it's at a lower normalized clip and maybe as you saw back in the first quarter of 2016? Just trying to get a handle on that piece.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","The business, as I talked about earlier, Jim, the business really does run. It's got a seasonality effect to it. So you'll see the quarters of I&W behave very much like they did last year. We did have a very large license fee on a renewal in Q1 last year. You won't see that repeat. But that's just due to timing of the renewal. Frankly, the business, the pipelines are very strong, but expect the seasonality in this business to follow very similar to what you saw in 2016. So once again, this year we'll have a very large Q4, heavily weighted around license fees, which is traditional in the business, but the other quarters will follow pretty much in alignment with last year's.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I want to follow up on that a little bit. So, IFS running at the low end of the guidance range. Woody, you're just saying that's a function of consolidation that's pushed it down to that? And then, how do you reconcile that with the commentary around increased competition coming in? If you're talking about new startups and fintech money, these are not huge companies. Are they pressuring your pricing or are they actually winning business or like \u2013 I'm just trying to reconcile why that would be the case?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I think the broader commentary is really going to be around continued consolidation. You've seen IFS running in the lower end of that for a few years. We've got some tailwinds specifically this year in EMV and the people-based project. But we think that that lower end, that 3% to 4% zone, is where you're at really given consolidation being the broader driver there.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Dan, just to build on that. I mean you're really seeing consolidation run 5% to 6% per year, no de novo activity. We've only had two de novos, what, since 2010. So, you really have no additional customers coming in.","The new disruptors \u2013 I want to be careful about that \u2013 we're not seeing an increased level of competition in 2017 that we didn't see in 2016. So, the reality is we do, as we've talked about for years, see pricing compression in this segment, but I would tell you when you look at our guide for 2017, there really is no material changes in expectations from our standpoint. We're not materially seeing increased competition over 2016 or increased pricing compression. We're also not seeing a decline. We haven't modeled the decline in compression. And as we talked about in May that just naturally pushes IFS to the lower end of that range we gave. We think the guide says, as Woody said, conservative for the year because, frankly, we want to make sure that we have something we're very comfortable in meeting. But we haven't seen any material shift in it but it is the fact. That's what's going on in the industries right now.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And can you just outline again for me this one quarter, first quarter 2017, kind of drawdown relative to the consensus numbers? What are the main drivers of that again? I mean, obviously, we've got some stuff with PSF (45:08). Our model reflected that. So, it was still a little bit lower than that. So can you hit me with like the top three major drivers to that difficult comp again, please?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes. You had a people-based services project in IFS that was completed in the third quarter that won't recur in the first quarter. You've got accelerated EMV growth in first quarter of 2016 that will be a difficult grow over in 2017, and we had a large license renewal in the I&W, the Institutional and Wholesale Group, and global trading that will not recur in the first quarter. Those are the three biggies that are headwinds for Q1.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's super helpful, and then the last question from me. To the extent that banks do pivot a bit away from their kind of regulatory mentality and framework \u2013 and I understand they got to still spend on that, but they're going to pivot more towards growth at some point. And the question I have is, do you think your product portfolio from a competitive position is well suited for that pivot? Or are you thinking about using some of that capital now that you've divested this asset to look for some tuck-in to maybe satisfy what the banks' growths are going to be? Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Now, in 2017, certainly, let's answer your first question, we believe we've got the strongest solutions suite in the industry, in both Retail Banking Payments and Institutional\/Wholesale. So, we're very confident in the capability. Frankly, the sale of public sector, we disclosed that as we were pulling together the SunGard acquisition. We said we're going to look at our non-strategic assets and see if we can find a more strategic home for those assets because they don't fit in the company, so that's just us following a very focused strategy and deployment.","When we look around, are there going to be some tuck-ins that need to be occur? Frankly, we don't have those on the whiteboard at this point. We see some investment that we're making in our products. I highlighted the stuff we're doing around our private cloud deployment that's going very well. We also have very, very strong growth in our digital capabilities. Some of our next generation payment capabilities as highlighted with BP are doing very well. But even in our traditional businesses, we continue to sign and take share. So, we're very comfortable with our product suite. We're very comfortable where we compete. And so, 2017, we're going to look to repeat what we did in 2016 with that and sell very aggressively in the market.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of George Mihalos from Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Woody, just wanted to go back, I think it was to Ashwin's question. If you could just maybe clarify what your outlook is now, not to jump the gun, but for 2018, given the divestiture in 2017 and your outlook for sort of continued double-digit growth in EPS?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I'm glad you asked the question because I think I actually misspoke to on Ashwin's question. I want to make sure we've got it clear. This year we've got a $4.15 to $4.30 range I just outlined. We believe we can grow that 13% to 18% in 2018, which I still think that collective will imply $4.65, $4.68 to almost $5.00. That guidance has stayed intact. What I was trying to isolate was PS&E around the original guide would be difficult. But our range of $4.15 to $4.30 should grow 13% to 18% in 2018, to be clear. I think I misspoke earlier. I'm glad you asked the question to clarify.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. Thanks for that. That's very helpful. Just two quick ones, if I can sneak in. Firstly, just again to be clear, the organic revenue outlook to 2% to 3% for 2017, that's off a $9.2 billion number adjusted for the sale? And then the consulting business, should that grow in line to the 4% to 5% you're looking for for overall GFS growth? Thank you.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, the reported number, $9.2 billion, $9.241 billion is the base to grow off of. Again, you have got three moving parts. You've got the sale of PS&E of about 3 points negative. You've got our deferred revenue acquisition adjustment from the SunGard acquisition, and then we've got about a $75 million expected headwind from FX. So, you definitely got that right in terms of your base there.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. To add, as far as on the consulting business, as we talked about, George, in prior remarks, very comfortable with the leadership team, very comfortable of the refocus back towards transformational consulting engagements going very well. Certainly, as we talked about on prior calls, that business will continue to grow in alignment with FIS's numbers going forward so very complementary to our solution set, engaging them in opportunities where we also have product penetration, and that's working very well.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to get your perspective on how to think about the future of your non-strategic assets, the check in the commercial business, granted the growth profiles, they're probably not as attractive as the PS&G (sic) [PS&E] (50:50) business. But are you attempting to divest them? Is that something we should think about as more permanent or something that may go away at some point?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Ramsey, it's a good question. We've talked about it a lot. Certainly, we wanted to isolate our non-strategic businesses for our investors so they could get some transparency around it. What remains in that business is our former \u2013 our Certegy Check business, which we all know what's going on with the declines around checks, especially at the point of sale. You've also got a global commercial services business, which is really just IT infrastructure sales, both of them a non-strategic force at this time.","In a perfect world, if there was a valid divestiture to be had, certainly, we would do that. But we're also, at FIS, we're not going to make a bad business decision. Frankly, we've got good leadership over both of those groups, very focused on serving the clients. And so, they'll deal with the macro issues that they're facing very effectively. But if there was an opportunity that presented itself and it made financial sense, we absolutely would consider it.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Okay. I noticed that the retail check processing organic growth rate in the quarter was positive. Is there a pass there? Is that something that we should expect to continue or was there some driver there that sort of bounced it positive just this quarter?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Pure play, holiday play. You always see a bump in Q4 around the holidays because you see some volumes come in and nothing more than that.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We still expect that to be a decliner over time.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay. And then last quick one from me, when should we contemplate you guys potentially getting back in the market with buybacks? Is that something we could see towards the end of this year or is that more of a future-looking thing?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, we tried to add some color around the commentary. We believe we'll be able to prepay all our prepayable debt in 2017 and still generate excess cash flow that in late 2017 and into 2018, we could be buying back shares.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","All right. Got it. That's all for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And please go ahead.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you for joining us today, for your questions and your continued interest in FIS. We are very pleased with our results, concluding a very strong year of performance and earnings growth. We had a solid pipeline heading into 2017, and we are confident in our strategy and our business model.

My name is Mary Waggoner, I'm Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for FIS. I'd like to welcome all of you who have gathered with us in Orlando this morning. Thank you for making the trip. We'd also like to welcome, and thank those of you who are participating via webcast. We've modified the format of this year's event in a couple of ways. First, we are hosting FIS Investor Day 2012 in conjunction with our Global Leadership Summit. So in addition to our guests from the investment community, we are joined by more than 300 of our leaders from around the world. We're very excited to have all you with us and hope that you will find today's presentation insightful and informative. Second, we will begin the day with a discussion of fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. The earnings press release and supplemental slide presentation have been posted on our website at fisglobal.com. The 2012 presentation will be posted on the website in approximately 30 or 40 minutes, and we'll make copies available in the room at that time.","Joining me on stage are Frank Martire, Chief Executive Officer; Gary Norcross, Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hayford, Chief Financial Officer. The next 30 minutes or so will include prepared remarks read by Frank, Mike and Gary on our -- covering our 2011 operating and financial results. Then we will transition to the 2012 strategy discussion and financial outlook. There will be a 30-minute Q&A session for the investment community at the end of both presentations, and we ask that you hold your questions until that time. We'll take questions from the leadership team later this afternoon and tomorrow. And we will conclude today's -- this morning's event with a topic table reception, where members of the investment community will have an opportunity to interact with several additional members of our leadership team. And that will be in the Crystal Ballroom, just immediately across the hall, where you all were for breakfast this morning. ","Now I'd like to direct your attention to Slide 4 for the Safe Harbor commentary. Please note that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements. The statements are subject to risk and uncertainties as described in our filings with the SEC. FIS undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future or otherwise, except as required by law.

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results are available in the earnings press release, which is located on the tables in front of you, and are also posted on our website, fisglobal.com. ","Now, I'll turn the presentation over to our CEO, Frank Martire. Frank?","Frank Martire","Thank you, Mary. Sorry, I didn\u2019t leave time for the applause there. Thanks, Mary. Good morning. I'd like to welcome you to the event, the investment community to Orlando. Thank you for being here. Those on the webcast, all the FIS global leaders out there, welcome. We hope you find it to be, as Mary said, very informative and insightful. We're pretty excited about our company and our future, and we hope you will be too. I will begin the presentation with a quick overview of our financial results and business highlights for 2011. Gary will follow with the operations report, and Mike will provide additional insight into our fourth quarter and full year results. ","2011 was another strong year for FIS, and I'm pleased with the progress we are making to execute our global business strategy. We continue to build global scale, finishing the year with more than $5.7 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion in EBITDA. We generated adjusted net earnings of $698 million and $1.2 billion in operating cash. The team is doing a nice job executing our business plan, as evidenced by 5% organic top line growth and 12% growth in earnings per share in 2011. Organic growth has steadily improved since 2009, led by strong results within our international business. International revenue increased to $1.2 billion in 2011, and grew 22% organically for the year driven by strong performance in both the FIS and Capco businesses. Our international business continues to play a key role in our growth strategy, and we are excited to have surpassed the $1 billion milestone. ","Importantly, we maintained our focus, generating new sales and expanding existing client relationships. We are very pleased to announce our new agreement with the Royal Bank of Canada to establish this new direct bank in the U.S. This is the first of what we believe will be many joint initiatives between FIS and Capco. Gary will provide more detail on the project later in the presentation. FIS has consistently delivered strong financial results in one of the most challenging environments in banking history. Revenue has increased from $3.4 billion in 2008 to more than $5.7 billion in 2011, or approximately 20% per year on a compounded basis. EBITDA has increased by 27% on average, and the EBITDA margin has increased 480 basis points during that time. And we have consistently delivered mid-teens EPS growth. These strong results illustrate the strength of our business model and our ability to execute. We have also been very disciplined in allocating capital. While we continue to invest for growth, our ability to leverage investments across our global enterprise has resulted in more efficient use of capital. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We've reduced our debt by $382 million in 2011, and improved the leverage ratio to approximately 2.8x at year end. And our strong free cash flow enabled us to return approximately $460 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2011. As noted in yesterday's press release, our Board of Directors increased the annual dividend to $0.80 per share and also approved the new $1 billion share repurchase program. These actions reflect our confidence in our business outlook and our commitment to further enhancing shareholder returns.","We continue to feel very good about our business. As you will hear throughout today's presentation, we are highly focused on driving growth and margin expansion, while continuing to invest in the future. We will continue to be very disciplined in managing our capital, and we are committed to enhancing shareholder value. Our success is tied directly to the hard work, dedication of our employees and how well we serve our clients. I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank our leadership team, many of whom are with us this morning, and our 33,000 employees worldwide. I would also like to thank our clients, who depend on us and trust us to keep their business running every day. ","Now, I will turn it over to Gary for the operating highlights. Gary?","Gary Norcross","Thanks, Frank, and thanks to everyone for being with us today. We have a lot of material to cover, so I'll provide a brief overview of the fourth quarter operating highlights in order to spend more time discussing our business strategies in the next presentation. ","Overall buying decisions strengthened in the fourth quarter both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. We continue to experience solid demand for outsourced processing, back office support and professional services as clients seek to leverage our scale and broad service capabilities. As we discussed during last year's investor update and all throughout the year, we think we have a great opportunity to gain more share in the large financial institution market space. We experienced strong sales growth within this market in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year and sequential basis, which points that the investments in our sales force for this market are paying off. We continue to be the provider of choice for direct banks in North America. Barclays Bank, one of our large outsourced clients in the U.K., will use our core solution for their new direct bank in the U.S. And as Frank mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to announce that FIS and Capco were selected by RBC to assist in establishing its new direct bank to serve its cross-border clients in the U.S. The project scope, which included defining the targeted operating model, building interfaces between multiple internal and external systems and operating the core banking platform on an outsourced basis, demonstrates our ability to deliver transformation in the market and clearly differentiates FIS from other technology providers and large-scale system integrators. Both RBC and Barclays are great examples of the power of our global go-to-market strategy.","The investments we had made to integrate our solutions continue to provide FIS with a key competitive advantage in all the markets we serve. We supported more than 100 core platform conversions in North America during 2011. As we have discussed in the past, these relationships drive meaningful pull-through revenue including payments, back office support and professional services. We continue to invest in early-stage and emerging technologies to drive innovation. We experienced strong growth in our mobile client base throughout 2011, including People's United Bank and BMO Harris in the fourth quarter. We surpassed 1.5 million mobile endpoints in 2011, and we continue to expect rapid growth within this channel. ","We are also having great success with our bill payment solution. We converted more than 270 institutions to our platform during 2011, and have a strong conversion pipeline heading into 2012. In addition, we are seeing continued strength in our Internet banking and next-generation core solutions.","Our international business continues to produce very strong results. As Frank discussed, international revenues surpassed the $1 billion mark in 2011, and now represents 20% of the total company. We continue to benefit from strong card growth in Brazil, where we are processing more than 50 million cards. We also saw strong growth in Europe in both the traditional FIS business, as well as Capco's European practice. We continue to view Europe as a great place to do business given the size of the market, the strategic relationships that we have with our clients and the opportunity to capture additional share. ","I am very pleased to report that ING recently committed to FIS as its enterprise-wide core banking provider. We are making great progress leveraging our Payment Solutions internationally. We continue to win share in debit, and are also pleased with the success of our U.K. prepaid platform, which we acquired through the Metavante acquisition. We added 20 new clients to the U.K. platform in 2011 and were recently named the leading prepaid organization for the U.K. in Europe.","In short, it was another good year for our company. We continue to execute our global sales strategy. ","I'd like to leave you with the following thoughts before turning the discussion over to Mike. ","We continue to see investment decisions being made and are encouraged by the fourth quarter sales and solid momentum going into 2012. We are winning new deals and expanding existing client relationships. We believe international will continue to be a growth engine for our company. We remain bullish on our European business, and we are excited about the opportunities we have for continued growth in all the markets we serve. Our focus on innovation, new product development and enhancements including mobile, bill pay and loyalty offerings is producing tangible benefits and driving strong profitable growth for our company. While we believe that 2012 will continue to be a year of transition for the financial industry, we believe the outlook is improving, and we are confident that we will continue to win share and lead the market. ","Now I'll turn it over to Mike.","Mark Owen Davey","Thanks very much, Mike, and good morning, everybody. Mike just asked us to spend a few minutes talking about what leadership means for FIS and particularly, I think it's important in the context that the meeting this morning, which we\u2019ve just had, which is about our earnings results, and of course, the meeting we've got coming up right now, which is about our strategy, are just 2 meetings in a series of meetings we're having this week. Right after we finish this meeting, we have our annual leadership conference, which is a conference we have every year, where we assemble the top 300 people in the company, who really set the tone and direction for the organization overall. And putting 300 people together in an event such as this from literally all around the world, from Brazil, London, Singapore, Australia is a real big investment in terms of time but it shows really, how seriously we take leadership as an organization. ","And our conference this year actually has 3 themes. And these 3 themes are out of our guiding principles, which really drive everything that we do. The first one we're going to be talking about -- the first theme, which we're going to take is about our strategy and the execution of our strategy, and you'll be hearing more about that in the next presentation. Secondly, we're also going be talking about some of the operational things that we're doing as an organization to further improve the quality of service and the quality of the products that we offer to our clients. And the final thing is, we're actually going to be talking about our focus on clients. And we're actually going to be hearing some of our clients and sharing their opinions and views about us, how we can actually continue to improve those relationships that we have with our clients going forward. So it's a very exciting time for us. And as part of that agenda, we actually are really looking forward to sharing our ideas and our thoughts and actually driving the strategy of the business as we go forward. After the leadership conference, we're then moving on. And we actually have a sales conference, which is our Global Sales Conference, where we get together all the people who are involved in sales for the company and we plan for next year as well as celebrate, of course, the success of 2011.","So with that, could I ask Jim to go through comments about his views on leadership.","James Susoreny","Thank you, Mark. My name is Jim Susoreny, I'm an Executive Vice President. I manage the sales and client management function here at FIS. So as Mark just referenced, this is a big week for us here, all week long. But now that we've been ranked #1 on the annual FinTech 100 list as a company, we continue to become the company that our clients and prospects come to and look for, for not only the IT solutions but for strategic thought leadership. So these companies from the standpoint of an institution size, all institutions, from de novos to the largest global institutions. They can be confident with our leadership position that the projects that we engage with them will have a successful completion, and these are projects from transformational-type industry projects to company transformation projects, all the way through to department transformation within a company. Being the leader really does one thing for us. It gives us access, so that as a sales and client management force, we can get access to the decision-makers, to the executives, not only of our current client base but of our new account opportunities. As you all know, a significant amount of our business comes from our current client base and cross-sell. ","So I'll tell you, the key for us though, is once a prospect becomes a client, it's to nurture the relationship and nurture the relationship not only around solutions and service but more importantly around people and strategic thinking. And one way we do that is in a meeting like this, as Mark mentioned. But in the sales meeting following, what we do is educate. We train and we arm our sales and client management force with the tools necessary for them to not only complete their annual plans but to work on the strategic multiyear plan with their clients. All meant to meet our clients\u2019 business objectives. I want to personally thank you all for your time today, and I want to turn it over to my colleague, Rob Heyvaert.","Rob Heyvaert","Good morning. My name is Rob Heyvaert, I'm the Chairman and CEO of Capco, and it's a real pleasure to be here. I joined the family about a year ago. And they've asked me to make a few comments on leadership and actually mainly leadership looking into the future. What does the future hold for banks, and what does the future hold for a company like ours and how important is it to be a leader and how important it is to have scaled size global reach to get there. In order to understand that, I think we need to have a backdrop. And the backdrop is the financial services institutions are, really, today in an area they've never been before. The margins are compressing. There's huge regulation coming from every side. There's actually, I would even argue, a tremendous amount of confusion for what's going on in the industry. The return on equity is going down dramatically, and it's really not sustainable. Often people think that a recovery will make and fix everything. This time around, for financial institutions, it's a very different story. It's a story about cost takeouts, but it's also a story about keeping up to hyper-connectivity and social media. As a result of that, a company like ours have never been more relevant than today. There is tremendous transformation going on. ","You could probably argue, you could compare it to the manufacturing industry, where financial institutions have stopped doing everything the same like bank A, like bank B and like bank C is doing for the very simple reason that they cannot afford it. It's unaffordable. As a result of that, a company like ours, who gets in very early with the Capco acquisition, having a conversation at the top of the house with a C level executive going all the way to the execution of operations and technology. That full stack is what we call leadership. That full stack implemented at a local level in Canada, in the U.S. but at a global level in Asia or Europe. As a result of that, I would argue that this company is better positioned than anybody else to be a trusted partner and have the scale to work with financial institutions. As a result of that, institutions will stop doing a lot of stuff themselves. They will rely on FIS, its ability to run in a secure way operations and technology businesses for the clients. We will have a difficult market for banks in the future, but FIS will profit tremendously, we believe, from that difficulty. And we will help financial institutions to take out roughly $500 billion of costs because that's what it takes to get back to return on equity. We feel very bullish about the future. ","It's a pleasure to have you, and I hope my colleagues will give you an interesting morning about the future of FIS. Thank you.","Mary K. Waggoner","Okay. We're now ready to move into the 2012 strategy discussion and financial outlook. I'm going to stall for just a moment because the 8-K has not yet been filed with the 2012 presentation. As soon as that is up and available, we'll pass out the books. But we can go ahead and get started with the beginning portion of the presentation. ","We will -- Frank will lead off with a strategy discussion followed by Gary Norcross. And Mike Hayford will come up again to talk about business strategy, growth strategy and financial outlook. Then we will have an executive panel to handle Q&A for about 30 minutes, and then proceed on over to the Crystal Ballroom for the topic table discussions. For the investment community, there are surveys for you to fill out. We would really appreciate you're doing that, we value your input. Anything we can do in terms of timing flow, format, information that we provide for next year's Investor Day, we would welcome your input. So if you would fill those out as we go throughout the day, Laurie [ph] and team will pick those up and will summarize those results and use that for feedback for the next event. So with that, I'll ask Frank Martire to come back up to the stage.","Frank Martire","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, again. Thanks again, Mark, Rob and Jim. Very nice job of talking about leadership and our company and our future. So I thought I'd give you an update on our key strengths in the company and our strategy and our focus, always a focus on our performance. ","I'll start with our key strengths. The question always asked, why? Why invest in FIS? Our market leadership position. Jim talked about it a little bit a few moments ago. Our clients know who we are. Even ones who aren't our clients know who we are, they respect us. They know us, they know we'll deliver and we get references from our clients every day. That is so powerful to us in the marketplace. ","We have high recurring revenue. Over 80% of our revenue is recurring. Stable growth, consistent stable growth in a company. And we know that will continue because we have the confidence in our company and the confidence in our clients. ","Strong EPS growth. We do mid-teens EPS growth historically. We don't talk about the future and what it's going to be. We talk about our history and what we've done because that gives credibility when we do talk about the future. ","Very strong cash generation. We generate cash, strong cash flow, and value-enhancing capital allocation. Our $1 billion share repurchase announcement and agreement and authorization, $1 billion. And we increased our dividends from $0.20 to $0.80 a year. Commitment to our shareholders, commitment to add value. ","So where is FIS today? Our revenues, $5.7 billion. EBITDA, top line\u2019s growing, bottom line growing. EBITDA, $1.7 billion. Very strong operating cash flow, $1.2 billion. Over 14,000 loyal clients in over 100 countries worldwide and 33,000 of the best employees in the world. Our leadership position has been recognized. We're #1 on the FinTech 500 -- 100, #1. We're in the Fortune 500, the Forbes 2000. And Barron's is an interesting one that we're very proud of. We rank #3 ahead of some very, very prestigious companies. And it's based on cash flow return on investment, primarily cash flow return on investment over a 3-year period of time, we rank #3. Very proud of those results.","We are a global company. But when we talk about it, we don't talk about being in different regions and having a client or 2. We're talking about meaningful in each region, a meaningful presence in each region. So if you look at North America, we're a leading core and payment processing company. 15,000 employees, 80% of our revenue, as I talked about, recurring and focus obviously in the U.S. and Canada. ","If you look at Europe, again, core and payment processing. Over 2,000 employees, large presence. Focus in the U.K., Germany, France, Western Europe, no exposure in some of the less financially stable countries like Greece. We\u2019re in Western Europe and growing in the U.K., Germany, France.","You look at Latin America. We're the #1 third-party processor in Brazil. #1, second to none. Asia Pacific, we do core and payment processing. 6,000 employees. Australia, India, China, Thailand, large presence. We truly are a global company. We have a very strong track record of execution. At the end of the day, it's what have you done and then what are you going to do for me. So let's talk about what we've done. ","We've grown from $3.4 billion to $5.7 billion from 2008 to 2011 top line. 20% CAGR. What about the bottom line? $800 million to $1.7 billion, 27% EBITDA growth CAGR. 27% 2008 through 2011 and 480 basis point margin expansion. And I talked about it, mid-teens EPS growth. So that's what we've done, consistently grown this company, top line, bottom line. ","We're first in financial technology. We're very client focused. Anybody you talk to in this company will talk about our focus on our clients. They are our future. We have the domain expertise. We know the business. We know the banking business, financial institution business, we know it. Our clients expect us and respect us for that. We have thought leadership. Rob talked about it a little bit. Our clients want to know how we're going to keep them competitive, not just today but 3 years from now and 5 years from now and what they need to do. And then, that we'll have the innovation of products to get them there. But clearly, that we know how to help them get there. ","Our employees, we get the best. Top talent in the industry. Results-oriented people. We give them career advancement opportunities. We take care of our employees because they're our most precious asset, and they are our future. We're the investment of choice, we really believe that. Look at our financial performance historically and what we talk about going forward. We have disciplined capital allocation. You've seen that, we've delivered on that on our capital allocation, talking about the share repurchase authorization, talking about our dividends increase and superior value creation for our shareholders. We keep our shareholders in mind all the time. We focus on our clients and we focus on our employees because we know and we truly believe at the end of the day, if we do those 2 things, we will clearly take care of our shareholders.","Moving on to our strategy. So look at FIS and what's happened over the last decade, the last 10 years. We were in a major acquisitive mode. We did a lot of acquisitions 2003 to, say, 2009. So why did we do that? We needed size, we needed scale. We needed to grow our market presence. We needed products for our clients. The way to do that and get there as fast as possible was by being acquisitive, and that's what we did. That was our focus. But then our clients said to us, you\u2019ve got the products now, you have the scale, you have the size, you need to integrate it all for value to us. So we spent that time, 2009 to 2011 approximately, integrating, integrating, integrating, making it seamless for our clients. Adding true, true value for our clients. ","Now what we've got to do going forward? We're going to optimize that environment, make it cost effective, cross-sell our products, generate new revenue, optimize our expense base. So if you look at it, it's 3 phases strategically. One from an acquisitive phase, one through an integration phase and a build and then one clearly to an optimization.","Our 4-point strategy. Expand our client relationships. We'll buy, build or partner to add solutions. Lead market through transformation and continuously improve and drive margin expansion. I'm going to talk briefly to each.","So we're looking to expand our global reach with all of our clients, in all the regions of the world. So look in North America. I'll give you a couple of examples of clients. People's Bank in Bridgeport, Connecticut is about a $28 billion institution. And they converted in our system in 2010, and Jack Barnes is the CEO there, and I've got to meet Jack in 2008. And Jack said to me, \"You know what, we've never outsourced in the long, long history of People's Bank in Bridgeport, never outsourced, we ran in-house. That's what we do. Why should I even consider being able -- outsourcing with you besides cost optimization, being cost effective, why should I be able to trust you?\" We started that dialogue in 2008, and the reason why I bring it up is, you don't just go out to these large institutions and say overnight, I could save you money. I could save you a few dollars, so come with me. They got to get to know you. They got to get to trust you. They have to believe in you and your people and your products before they'll even consider going on our system. Those are the types of relationships we build. ","First Niagara Bank, $30 billion institution, keep growing that. John Petrey is going be here with our leadership team. Gary has known him a long time. Built a long, long-term relationship with him. Talking about the benefits of this partnership with FIS. RBC, we've got the existing new direct bank agreement. Fantastic agreement for this company. How do you build them? You build them on strong relationships.","Europe. ING has committed to FIS as their global platform. Think about that. ING, as their global platform, phenomenal for us. The National Australia Bank. We have relationship with them, not only in the U.K. and in Australia, and Bruce Jennings is here from the U.K. Mark Davey has built a long-term relationship with him, and he'll address our leadership team also. Tremendous loyalty. ","Latin America. We process more than 50 million cards through our JV there, 50 million. Bradesco, who our partner is there, launched the ELO card earlier this year, private label card. They\u2019ve signed already over 400,000 people to that card base. We continue to outsource there. We continue to build the business. We continue to have a great leader there for us in Brazil in Reginaldo Zero, who's with us today. Just fantastic growth business for -- a great story for FIS.","Asia Pacific. Bank of India and Union Bank, they're driving approximately 3,000 ATMs with us. We've launched a new prepaid card for Woolworths, Australia's largest retailer. In China, we do core processing for about 15 banks. In Thailand, 8 of the top 10 banks do their core processing with FIS. ","So when we talk about our presence in all these regions, we're not talking about a small presence or having a few people land it. We're talking about significant presence and significant growth opportunities.","Buy, build or partner. This is pretty easy for us. We do all 3. Whatever brings the product to our customers, with the optimal product as quickly as we can and as efficient as we can is the way we'll go. We're not prejudiced to buying, building or partnering. We will do what we need to do to take care of our clients and we will invest, and we will continue to invest into the future.","And we're leading through transformation. Rob talked about the thought leadership. Our clients come to us and yes, we have to have product. But they start by saying to us, okay, help me get where I need to be. And maybe sometimes, where exactly do I need to be. We depend on you, FIS. You need to help us with these answers. You need to partner with us. As to where we need to be, how we're going to get there. Where we are today, where we need to be, how we're getting there and then, do you have the products to make sure that we could be highly competitive and that's what we do for our clients. So that truly is a transformation. We're not just out there selling products. We're selling thought leadership, okay. We're being -- truly being the partner and then we have the domain expertise. You have to have it. You have to have the industry knowledge. You have to have the leaders in your company from the very top on down, spending their career in the financial institution business. That's where they should be because that's what they expect of us, not being in some other industry. This is the industry they expect us to have knowledge in.","And continuous improvements to drive margin expansion. You know what, day-to-day. We talk about optimization, cost optimization, driving expansion and I talked about the 480 basis points of expansion. And you say, how do you get there? Do you just sit down and say, this is it for this year or the next year. No, we do it during the budget cycle. We do talk about it, but we do it every day. We make sure we optimize our business every day in the best interest of our clients and the organization and the shareholders. And we discuss it during the annual budget cycle, so we have targets. And we're talking about a target going forward in future years, of 30 to 50 basis points improvement every year. And that's what we expect. We expect our organization to deliver and our leaders, and we do. And we do it in such a fashion that we give even better service to our clients.","One final thought, our focus on performance. So you look at our company, we have high recurring revenue. We've demonstrated that in the past, we will continue to in the future, with stable growth, over 80% recurring. Continuous margin expansion. The 480 basis points we talked about, the 30 to 50 going forward, continuous margin expansion. Strong EPS growth, mid-teens EPS growth. Very, very strong cash flow. And we focused on the use of our cash flow. Our debt repayment, we discussed today. The dividends going from $0.20 to $0.80. The share repurchase authorization of $1 billion. Focused on enhanced shareholder return. So as we look at our company, why are we excited? We're excited because we have over 300 leaders here today, talking to you with excitement and how excited they are about the future of this company. We're excited because our clients are so loyal to us, and our clients go out of their way to give references to us and talk about this great company. That's why we're excited about the future of FIS. ","I want to thank you for your time. And now, I'm going to turn over to Gary Norcross, our Chief Operating Officer. Thank you.","Gary Norcross","Well, good morning. I'm really looking forward to spending the morning with you. As you guys might know, my name is Gary Norcross, Chief Operating Officer. I've been with the company 23 years. And before I get into the presentation, I'm kind of just cut to the punchline. When you look at our position in markets, as many of the people have talked about, when you look at our solutions set, when you look at what's going on in the economy and how everything is driving in our direction of this company we built out, I've never been more excited in my career to be part of a company. And I think if you look around at more than -- our more than 300 leaders, it clearly defines the results that Frank talked about earlier, has been brought by these people in this room. We've got the finest leadership group in the industry, bar none. I'll put them up against anybody. And so the outlook is very, very bright for FIS, and we're very excited about where we're going.","But that being said, I do want to talk about a number of areas for us. I want to talk about market and market positioning. I think it's important to understand, there are different markets in the financial institution place, in the financial institution marketplace. And a lot of people talk about their desire to go in international markets or go into LFI. You can't understand how much time that takes and how much commitment that takes. Some of these markets take years or decades to break into. And I want to talk about our positioning in those. I also want to talk about our strategic execution. Frank laid out at a high level our strategy, but how do we implement it. How do the 300 people in this room, how are they going to go forward and implement this strategy and we're going to talk about that. And then finally, how do you drive performance through that. How do you get the margin expansion, the free cash flow that continue to allow you to invest back in solutions. ","So with that, let's jump into the market segmentation. This is how we view the market. So if you think about it, all of these markets are very strategic. We feel it is very important for us to participate in all markets because there are certain markets that might have issues that others don't and for us to be distributed across all the markets is a key differentiator for us. If you look at less than $10 billion, clearly, very strong competitive position and I'll talk about the attributes of each of these markets in a minute, but we've got a very strong competitive position. There are a lot of competitors here. As I mentioned, we did over 100 conversions in this space last year. We talked about in the earnings call. Our large financial institution market's a very important one. We're going to give you some framework of what's going on in that market, the growth characteristics of that market, some things we're very excited about. Clearly, we've got the leading market position there, and it's growing based on our 2011 results. We've talked so much about international but international is such a key differentiator for us. Under the leadership of Mark Davey and his team and the Capco European practice, what we're accomplishing in the international markets are really second to none. ","And then non-financial, I won't talk a lot about non-financial today, not because it's strategic. The reality is, what we're doing in non-financial is we're going into adjacent markets where we can leverage our assets and technology. So a great example of that would be we\u2019ve, obviously, built out the largest outsourcing footprint in North America. We've got the largest, most strategic data centers that exist in the industry. We take that industry footprint, and we're able to deploy that into other markets, at really very nice revenues and very nice margins. What that allows us to do is underwrite our costs, right, for delivery back into the financial institution marketplace and allows us to drive leverage. So non-financial is a very strategic area of focus for us as well.","Let's look at the various attributes of the markets. Less than $10 billion, talked about this, large number of institutions in North America here. We're seeing this market segment decline at a rate of about 3% to 5% per year whether it's FDIC closures or acquisitions, this market's going to consistently decline at about that rate. Lots of competitors in this space. In a minute, we'll talk about the evolution of the markets and where people are and their buying habits. But at the end of the day, these banks are looking for single source providers. They're absolutely looking for ways that they can compete with the large institutions, and they have to leverage their buying power with a single solution provider. At the end of the day, our advantage is very, very strong market position here. Very highly rated products. Frank talked about, we do a lot of surveys through our clients. And we get valuable feedback from our clients on how we're performing. What's their loyalty to us, but not only that, just how our product\u2019s functioning and what comes back year in and year out is just how much our products mean to our clients and how well they perform. We're increasing market share in here. As I said, over 100 conversions just last year alone. The great thing about all of these markets I'm talking about is really our sales force and the ability to deploy our sales force across these various markets but more to come on that later.","If you look at the $10 billion, I should have mentioned on the less than $10 billion, projected spend of about $24 billion, you'll see various numbers. You can see the source of what we're including there. Not as fast a growth there. Frankly, we still have some elements of clients that are less than $10 billion that are struggling to hold on, right? I mean they're struggling to figure out how to survive. We're starting to see a lot more clients buy in that space but still an element of clients that are struggling. In the greater than $10 billion, about 100 institutions, 98 to be exact today, very sophisticated buyers. As you get larger and larger in that space, clearly, the buyers are very sophisticated. They understand their product needs. They understand their solution needs. They're starting to spend more and more around services. As Rob talked about, a lot of things going in this segment, specifically, where they've made some decisions that are very tough for them. So at the end of the day, we're seeing a lot -- very high increase in services spend. We're seeing more and more clients look towards outsourcing or ways to get leverage out of this. The nice thing about where FIS is positioned, and this is why I'm so positive on where we are as a company, is our market strength is growing here and we truly do have credibility here. Frank mentioned People's United Bank. If you think about large-scale transformation projects that have gone on in the last 2 years, I really can't think of anybody other than FIS that\u2019s delivered them. And that reputation is building. And there are countless examples of failed implementations in this space. And so at the end of the day, if you're going to make a decision to go for a transformation project, you want these 300 people pulling on your rope for you. You want them to get that implementation installed and across the line, and we've got a proven track record of doing that. So very, very important and with that credibility, we're able to continue to cross sell. We actually, last year, talked about redeploying some of our resources in the sales engine under Jim Susoreny and focus more on LFI, which is one of our strengths of our leveraged sales force. We did that. And interesting enough, our sales increased by almost 60% in this segment alone last year on contract value. So you see the benefit and the flexibility of our sales force. ","When you think about international, very important segment to participate in as well, and one of the things I tell everybody, as I mentioned earlier, these things take time to get into. You can't sit around. When our competitors say, \"Hey, we're going to go international,\" I immediately think I'll see you in 20 years. It takes years to build out, decades to build out a presence in these countries, a solution set that will meet these individual country needs, to gain credibility and break in those markets. Clearly, our largest competitor here is in-house developed in the international market. We've seen limited outsourcing to date, but then when you look where outsourcing is occurring, FIS is the chosen solution provider, whether it's our joint venture in Brazil where we\u2019re the largest third-party outsourcer of card processing, the Barclays Bank that we talked about where we've outsourced consumer lending. And we've got countless examples of that but still, outsourcing is more at its infancy. Very large market at $131 billion, certainly our highest growth area, and make no surprises, it's going to continue to be our highest growth area as a company. Our global distribution network that we built out is really second to none. Going forward, we want to continue to expand our products, but we have the broadest products available now in the international market place, and our size and scale are definitely differentiators and advantages. ","So I\u2019ve talked about the sales force. Let's tee this up. I mean, at the end of the day, we have more than 650 sales professionals. And as Mark and Jim mentioned earlier, they're coming here on Wednesday. So we've got our leadership community in over the next 2 days, we'll be talking about our strategy, we'll be talking about execution against 2012 and beyond, product innovation. Now -- then we'll bring in our sales force, more than 600 people will be here, and we'll be discussing our go-to-market plans, redeploying resources in where we see market activity that's appropriate. How to drive new product through that engine. We've proven, and I'll talk in a minute about our innovation around our product life cycle. We've proven the more products that we produce that meet our clients' needs, putting it through our sales force really is an unprecedented advantage for us, and we see great lift. And as I mentioned earlier, just being able to shift those resources from certain markets to LFI last year, seeing that 60% bump. So those are the kind of things that this engine allows us to do, this distribution capability.","What's interesting is the economy is helping. I mean, Rob was talking about the economy and some of the things that banks are dealing with. And if you think about it, it could be pretty dire, right? I mean, how are the banks going to survive in this space. I can assure you they will, but there are a lot going on. There's multiple pressures coming from every angle. A lot of banks in the large FI and in international markets are struggling with past decisions. When their profitability was growing, they really didn't reconcile in their mind what is my underlying solution architecture need to be. How do I need to pull this together so I can deliver future value and compete. These past decisions are weighing very heavily. In fact, recently, I was at a very large bank in North America and they were simply wanting to leverage and launch their mobile solutions. The problem is, their series of bad decisions that they had made over the last 5 years was really a major impediment to do something as simple as launching mobile tablet in the marketplace and therefore, they were struggling with how to retain their clients with that need. Great problem for FIS to solve. I mean, the first thing we do there, obviously, engage Capco in that engagement, come in, build out a transformational plan on how to take them from where they are today over multiple phases and get them where they need to be, all while embracing these new product launches. So a great example of how the power of FIS truly is the only company out there that can come in and help these institutions transform. ","It's really also these market pressures are playing to our strategic focus. In a minute, I'll talk about the shift towards outsourcing. It's not a new slide. We talk about this every year but the economy is speeding this up. I can tell you today, we're having more conversations in the LFI space about outsourcing and how to get leverage and leverage the scale of FIS than we've ever had in the history of our company. So these economic issues are pushing these banks very hard, and we're in the perfect position to take advantage of it. If you look, as I've mentioned, we've talked about this a number of years. Clearly, I've been with the company 23 years. When I started with this company, everybody in the industry was a pure monoline player. Single product delivering for a single problem. What we saw over the years, is we saw an evolution of where various markets started going to buy broader solution capabilities. And so as Frank mentioned, we did a series of acquisitions and we did those series of acquisitions to build out the broadest application suite in the industry, and we did it to serve all the market segments that exist. I'll tell you today, we're very well equipped with our arsenal of products and services and our leadership team and our markets and very comfortable. So we don't have the need to go out and do the large-scale acquisitions to continue to grow the businesses we serve today. But what we saw was the markets had continued to evolve. So they've gone from point-to-point solution to application outsourcing to solution outsourcing, right? And now, we see a large demand for transformational services, all driven, frankly, by the economic needs. There was a point in time where a $50 billion bank would sit and look at you and say, \"I have no desire to fully outsource everything I have. I have scaling better than you guys can do it.\" Today, that's no longer the answer. Today, the answer is, I'm burdened by all the investment. My costs are going through the roof. I'm shutting down branches to get cost out of my infrastructure. My IT costs continue to accelerate. I'm not getting the lift I need to be able to invest in new products. I can't come back and invest in new products without doing a giant services engagement because of all these fragmented solutions. FIS, as I said, plays to our strengths and allows us to participate in those conversations like no other.","So if you look, wrapping up our market positioning, clearly, we're well established in all markets. I hope you see that. And then as I said, we've been in these markets for decades and in many instances, as I shared with you, this is not something that you just decide you want to enter. It takes that amount of time to build out the relationships Frank talked about and others. Economic issues are really playing to our strengths, all right? So while a lot of people -- we would love to see the economy turn around faster, we would love to see all financial institutions return back to their normalized buying habits and frankly, Mike's going to talk about our long-term guidance. We think we need that market lift in order to get to the higher end of our guidance as we've discussed in the past. But right now, the good news is, the economic issues are pushing very large institutions to make decisions different than what they've made in the past. The shift towards outsourcing, where we are a clear leader. Every conversation, we just do not have conversations anymore about licensing software. It is always about some type of outsourcing engagement, some type of professional services engagement, some type of broader, much more broader solution. So with that, after looking at the markets, let's talk about and focus on the strategy and where we're going with the strategy Frank discussed.","Our strategy focus falls in really 3 distinct areas and every area is meant to increase drive, increase profitable growth, period, end of story. I think it's important that we require focus on all these areas and because of all these things, it really does allow us to outpace our competitors. The first area of focus is one around solutions, all right? So if you think about it, this breadth of capability is a requirement. Monoline players are struggling for survivability every day in this market. If all you can bring is a single or a couple of product solution, it is very, very difficult to compete. And so people are struggling with this. The breadth of capabilities, we have more than 300 products and services today. That breadth is absolutely key. In a minute, I'm going to talk to you about our portfolio management process because it's very important for you to understand how we take that $300 million of capital and invest back in our software. Obviously, we have to develop -- and so that's all geared around our fundamental business. We also have to develop an innovation, and we're going to talk about innovation and the importance that innovation is playing in our company today and then this area around services. ","So very focused on our solutions, but we can't be just focused there, we have to further penetrate the large financial institution marketplace. So if you add the broader solution, the advantage is deploying that across more markets. The more markets you can deploy it across, obviously, the more growth you can get, the more profitable growth you can get, and so that is key. And we've talked about the difficult nature of penetrating some of those markets a few minutes ago. So it's very important to further penetrate our LFI. And then finally, we have to grow geographically. We cannot be a North American-based company any longer, we have to look globally. We talked about our global marketplace being 20%. But I also talked in our earnings calls of examples where we had a large strategic relationship with Barclays. Barclays decides to come to the U.S. and launch a direct bank, who do they look for but their partner from Europe, or from the U.K. to help launch in the U.S. And so it's key to think about the full geographic reach, all right? ","We're going to dig into all 5 of these sub bullets. But before I do that, I really want you to kind of understand our thought process around portfolio management. We think it's a key differentiator for our company and one that we are very proud of. The very first thing is, there are certainly some very well-established solutions that we have to offer. We talk about them all the time, our integrated cores, our traditional payment offerings. This is where our traditional R&D is spent here. Obviously, these are slower growth-type product offerings for us but very, very strategic. These are the kind of relationships that allows that sales force I discussed earlier, those 650 people, to come and deploy across that broader group. So very established solutions are very key. But we also focus on emerging solutions. This is an area where we do development, and where we've done some really exciting tuck-in acquisitions and, frankly, you'll hear us talk about doing future tuck-in acquisitions in this space. These are the things where we saw an opportunity years ago, invested heavily, and now they're paying off. A great example of that would be, almost 6 years ago at investor update, we talked about next-generation core processing. We talked about online real-time straight through processing, platform independence, all of these things and the importance of that and we saw an inflection point in the market. Now our profile suite, clearly, the fastest growing core product in our company today. Very strong internationally. The standard in direct banks in the U.S. and we're starting to see opportunities in the large retail marketplace with it. We wouldn't have that solution had we not seen that opportunity almost 6 years ago and started making those investments ahead of the curve. We also saw it in integrated channels. When you start thinking about what's going on in the channel marketplace, people want to bring mobile, people want to bring a wallet. People want to bring all these various things, having an integrated channel strategy wrapped around your solution to allow you to easily plug what's the next applicable channel is very important. Once again, made those investments over 5 years ago, started then, built through the curve and now we're seeing phenomenal growth through our TouchPoint suite. Think about some of the tuck-in acquisitions last year, 2 very small ones. We did Gifts [ph], which was an international wire product, money movement product. We did Compliance Coach, that took advantage of the issues going on in regulatory compliance and education needs. Both of those companies have performed exceedingly well, well ahead of our pro forma expectations on the acquisition and that's just a reflection of being able to put these kind of products in [ph] their distribution engine. ","There's a third area that we like to talk about in our portfolio management strategy, and this is early-stage solutions. Frankly, we choose to partner invest here. There's a lot of people that are doing irrational acquisitions in this space. I mean, I\u2019m really viewing them as irrational. Very, very large dollar amounts paid for very small revenue streams with no predictability on what the outcome\u2019s going to be in the future. We choose to partner and make minority investments here. We'll take a small minority position. We'll take a board seat. We'll direct development. We'll let a lot of spend go on with those companies, frankly, without a revenue stream outside of the company. We'll build a practice around it. A great example of that would be some of the stuff we're talking about in mobile, some of the stuff we're talking about in wallet. We've been able to build a very profitable business around our mobile activities meanwhile, while everybody -- where the people that are building these solutions are dumping a lot of irrational money, because we're not sure exactly where all that\u2019s going to end out. At the end of the year, we've broken through 1.5 million users. Obviously, we think we're at an inflection point and that'll still grow. Mobile wallet is still, obviously, another great example. We're not sure what's going to win. Is it going to be in SAE [ph]? Is it going to be 2D barcode? No one knows exactly what's going to win. And so at the end of the day, by making these small investments, partnering first, putting it through our sales engine, letting your customers who want to take advantage of that early adoption do that gives tremendous growth for us. What you need to understand is this is a cyclical activity. So at one point in time, next-generation core was in the early-stage solution category, right? And so if you think about it, things build up and circle through this. What I think's real interesting, it might surprise you, is more than 15% of our revenue now is coming from these type of activities and in a minute, we'll talk about in 2012 seeing almost $900 million of revenue come out of this area at very profitable numbers.","So let's break down some of those 5 key areas. When you think about the fundamental business, very, very strong clients here. Very predictable, high recurring revenue, allows us to look out and make key strategic investments in some of those innovative solutions, very high scale and leverage, incremental margins are very strong as we bring on new products and services. Our focus here is very clear. Cross-sell, cross-sell, cross-sell. As Jim talked about, in the U.S. markets now, we're more than 14,000 clients. The majority of our sales come from cross-selling additional products and services to existing clients. We have to drive product efficiencies here, so we do need to do some investment to keep our efficiencies going and further help drive our cross-sells. So great example of that would be in our fundamental business, we're doing some investment to help integrate our Internet banking product more tightly and allow it to become almost the de facto standard for Internet banking and it allows us to further drive that. I was talking to the leader of Internet banking not too long ago, Susan Hawkins, and we were talking about that. She really feels we still have even 3 to 5 years of white space just in our existing base to continue to ramp those kind of products, and it's through that integration that drives that value. Innovation, we talked a lot about it. But at the end of the day, this is a business that has grown at almost an 11% CAGR. So you got 15% of the company revenue growing at more than twice our overall growth rate. The pace of adoption here is clearly accelerating. There's a lot of people clamoring for these type of innovative solutions to retain clients but that\u2019s one of the things we didn't talk about in those markets, those financial institutions are seeing new incumbents coming in that are nontraditional competitors. And for that, they have to have the type of technology that allows them to keep and retain clients. So this is a great business for us. We've always focused our development here. I mean, very traditionally, our fundamental business, we really just keep in regulatory compliance. We do minor enhancements to drive integration. We funnel our investment on this area, and that's why you see the kind of high growth. The distribution network is the key. If we didn't have the more than 600 sales resources, couldn't drive these kind of products. But we've proven through our tuck-in acquisitions, through our net new development that running it through that sales force, we can certainly drive superior results. A great example, we've talked a lot about mobile. We've chosen a partner here. We got 2 very strategic relationships. We\u2019re monetizing within foundry, both of them very, very strong companies. In that instance, just over the last 18 months, per our sales force, we\u2019ve signed more than 400 clients on our mobile application. So you see the kind of opportunity that occurs.","So with that, let's talk about services. We talked about this multiple times; about 3 years ago, we were talking a lot about services. And once again, this is an area where the market has kind of come to us. About 3, almost 5 years ago, when we first got into the offshoring business, we realized that the fundamental labor arbitrage business didn't make sense for us. It was not a sustainable business model. What we chose to do instead was to build expertise around our own personal products and services and then drive that expertise strictly towards those areas and as a result of that, we've now built out more than 20,000 professionals. You see the growth since 2008, more than 25% CAGR. We see this continually growing. The demand for this is very, very high and very important for us. It leverages our core competencies. We understand the products we develop better than anybody else. We understand about how to run large outsourcing engagements. It's only natural to tack on the knowledge outsourcing around these functions. And so, as you see, we're continuing to see very, very strong growth here.","When you think about the large financial institutions in greater than $10 billion, you can see the spend, it's significant. 73% of the total spend in North America continues to drive here. So that's why it's a very, very important space for us to focus on. We have credibility though, over 28% of our revenue already exists in this space. I talked about us redeploying sales resource, and we got a 62% lift. I should have also shared with you, we didn't see a degradation in sales performance in our other markets as well, right? So it's important though, when you see those inflection points to take advantage of them. We've got significant conversations in this space. Once again, I was in a recent very large institution, and we were talking through their issues. And once again, they had made a series of very disparate investments. So once again, we were able to come in, propose to them a full-blown outsourcing engagement, focus on them a transformational way to pull some of their investments together, get more cost out of their infrastructure but also be able to offer more services. So just a lot of opportunity in this space. ","The final area of strategic focus we want to talk about is international. So at the end of the day, a lot of people talk about, are you concerned about international competitors coming in North America? We\u2019re worried about all competitors, right? But at the end of the day, North America is an extremely difficult market to break into. International is also an extremely difficult market to break into. They're both very different. And as I said, we had decades. We actually entered the international market in 1988. So we've had decades of experience building out this practice and now, you're seeing the returns of those investments. Scale and global presence are a requirement. I think you ask any of the people here in the audience from the international group, they'll tell you, if we don't have a critical presence in the country we're dealing in, it's very, very difficult to sell. You have to have globally relevant solutions here. So we're very focused on making investments in solutions that we can take into the international markets, leveraging our North American expertise. Global partnerships are certainly expanding. I gave you the Barclays example, which is so key for us and we\u2019re seeing more and more of that going on. So at the end of the day, if you think about it, we've got 20% of our revenue now, growing at 18% CAGR. We've got 15% of our innovation revenue, growing at 11% CAGR. You start seeing a pretty compelling story of higher growth in a lot of our assets. ","So in conclusion, we have a very, very strong platform for growth in the strategic execution area. We think at the end of the day, our solutions are unparalleled regarding breadth and expertise and ability to deliver. We have ongoing product innovation and investment, and it's paying off. That 15% is going to grow. You need to expect that. We expect that to continue to be a high-growth area, but we expect the percentage of our revenue coming out of innovative solutions to grow in the future. We've established a presence in all the high opportunity markets, and we have critical credibility in all the high opportunity markets. And our ability to assist clients, transform their business, we think is unparalleled. Once again, thinking about any large-scale project that's going on in the industry, really, FIS is attached to it and something that I just couldn't be more proud of the leaders in this room. ","So the question is, you see the market positioning, you see the strategic execution, now really, how do you do that and still drive your margins up? So what I want to talk about, Frank talked about this, but over the years, we were rolling up the industry. I mean, we talked about starting back in 2003, all the acquisitions we did, we did go through a period of time where we integrated a lot of companies. We built a lot of global scale. All the while, since 2008, increasing margins by 480 bps. So at the end of the day, we have a proven track record of doing it. The people in this room are very, very comfortable of expanding margins in our business. We know we have to do it. Mike's going to come up and talk about not only do we have to expand margins for our shareholders, we have to make sure we redirect enough spend, so take spend down in certain areas so we can redeploy it for innovation. So we know we have to invest back in the business, all the while getting expansion. ","If you think about where that comes, really, there's 3 areas that we target to optimize performance. Everybody wants to go to cost-cutting, that's the boring side of it. Really, a key area for us to focus is revenue. We have a proven ability to lead the market in revenue growth and we see that continuing. We'll continue to refine our model. We'll continue to move our resources in the appropriate place, and we'll continue to grow our distribution channel of more than 650 people. We spent most of last year taking out $260 million in cost, but there's still an opportunity to even take out more efficiencies as we grow. When you think about value-based pricing, we always like to talk about pricing compression. There is some pricing compression in certain markets. There's a lot of markets that we're actually seeing price inflation. Where we're seeing such a demand for services that we're actually able to raise our professional services rates in order to meet the demand. We're driving enhanced sales tools across our distribution channel to help them identify opportunities and close those opportunities, and we've talked a lot about alignment. We have to also leverage scale to get margin expansion. Resource realignment is a key. Last year, we saw some demands in services and what do we do? We took resources from non-revenue-producing areas to revenue-producing areas. I have to caution, we've got to make sure we don't do that all the time and we can do that temporarily to take advantage of an opportunity but a key back to our continued growth is investment back in the system. And so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we're just not short-term looking for very, very quick revenue and very quick profits at the sake of long-term profitable growth. ","We see a lot of opportunities in technology efficiencies. When we pulled FIS or Fidelity Metavante together to form FIS, we clearly consolidated a lot of our data centers, all right? And so there's now an extra turn. Now that we've consolidated the physical facilities, now there's an opportunity to consolidate the physical platforms within the facilities. That takes obviously product consolidation. We've done a very, very good job of that. We've talked about that on prior earnings calls, our ability to move our Bill Payment Solutions from the former Fidelity one, the former Metavante one, to the new FIS one with tremendous success. So we've done and we have a lot of examples of that. But as we consolidate more product that benefits our clients, it's going to naturally drive more efficiencies in our scale. And we also need to leverage development. We have -- we've done a good job historically of leveraging it, but we've got to take it to the next level. We've got to make sure that we're building it only once and making sure that we're deploying it all across those markets. And this team is certainly signed up to deliver on that.","The third area is cost management. Clearly, we got to leverage our buying power. We do a great job of this every year. But every year, we got to come back to our solution providers and make sure that we're getting our services at the lowest possible cost. We've got to proactively manage discretionary spend and we continue to look at those areas. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we're hiring in areas that drive strategic growth and profitable growth, and make sure that we're holding firm in certain areas. But all of that, we believe can easily drive 30 to 50 basis points of annual margin expansion. ","So with that, wrapping it up, we have a great business with amazing fundamentals. We're very, very proud of what we've built over the years. The market trends are in our favor. We really do feel the market is coming to us. We've made a tremendous amount of investments over the last decade, and we see the market pushing in this direction. We have very strategic clarity. I'll tell you, over the next 2 days and by the end of this week, we won't have a leader or sales rep in this organization that won't have clear insight to exactly where we need to go and how we're going to get there. We're going to continually take market with our sales engine. Leveraging that sales engine, cross-selling, upsell and growing that every single year like we've historically done and that will continue to happen. And then finally, we do have an opportunity for operating leverage through our portfolio management approach and our focus. So with all of that, we know we'll continue to deliver superior performance over the next several years.","So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Hayford, and Mike will give you some more insight to the financials. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Good morning. I'm David Togut with Evercore Partners. Two questions. First related to margins. You highlighted the rapid growth of the services business, which includes some lower margin, more labor-intensive businesses like Capco. How do you reconcile the fast growth in that business with your desire to achieve 30 basis points of margin expansion annually?","Frank Martire","It's a good question. You have to understand why we did Capco. So at the end of the day, when you look at Capco's presence in Europe and you look at Capco's presence in North America, and you look at the strategic relationships they have in that LFI community, what we're driving with Capco is really large transformational deals. RBC would be a great example of that. So there's an example where we brought in solution -- Capco brought in solution expertise, helped define the problem in the transformation, we were actually able to come in to that engagement and provide a breadth of services at very nice margins for us. So it's back to the majority of our Services business. At the end of the day, Capco is $300 million out of a $5.7 billion-odd company. So at the end of the day, the services that we're bringing wrapped around our products are coming in at much higher margins. And it's that differentiation, bringing that intellectual property to bear that allows us to do that. So really, they\u2019re getting their foot in the door that actually allows us to build that higher gross services business.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a second question on competition. Total System Services has indicated that they intend to make an aggressive push in the community bank and credit union market in terms of card issuer services. They also want to expand their footprint in Brazil from Carrefour on the private label side into more of general-purpose credit card issuer services. So have you seen them enter those 2 markets yet? And what sort of countermeasures do you have in mind?","Frank Martire","We see all of our competitors. But in fairness, we've not seen them in a material way in those 2 markets yet. I mean, the reality is, you have to understand what you're saying, it's back to that market positioning. So if you want to get into the credit card processing business and community markets, you're dealing with institutions that are on average are going to issue less than 10,000 cards, right? You're also going to deal with institutions that are going to need a full-service platform. What I mean by that is the ability to underwrite those things, board those cards, deal with cardholder concerns, 24\/7. It gets very difficult to build a business model out on that one customer at a time. Today, we have almost 3,800 clients in that market space. So we're able to do that and serve that market back to our scale, because we look at that as a unified portfolio. So I would tell you, that's a very difficult market in community markets to enter if you don't have scale or unless you\u2019re really prepared to go for a very long time and through organic growth one at a time, pick up 500 cards here, 8,000 cards there. Very difficult to build a business. When you look at Brazil, we're very comfortable with our position there. We're the largest third-party processor in Brazil. We've got long-term engagements with our partners. We recently extended some of our back-office work we're doing for Santander as well. So we feel very comfortable in our positions. Obviously, everybody is very focused on Brazil, right? I mean, it's a hot economy, it's a hot market. I always like to laugh and say, we were in Brazil for 15 years. So I mean, if that's good timing, I guess we'll take it. But the reality is, it took us a long time to build out that market. But we see competition across all of our industries. And we're going to be prepared to compete very hard on the service we provide, on taking care of our clients, and I think that's -- you see that bear out in our growth, and you see that bear out in our retention of our clients.","Gary Norcross","And you can see we're not stopping, right, we keep building on our scale, on our size and our reputation.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Dave Koning at Baird. So I guess first just to focus on some of the big clients, I think BofA and Bradesco reach about 5% of revs, M&I's maybe 2%. When we look out longer-term, do you expect these to continue to grow within your guidance? And then maybe you can talk about how long these are locked up for and any risks, I guess just thinking about over the next couple of years.","Frank Martire","Well, BofA is not that large of a client for us. Obviously, Bradesco JV is large. Our relationship we have down there, it's a very unique relationship, I think we're very confident in terms of the agreement we have, not just as a commercial relationship, but also the partnership in the JV. And M&I\/Harris\/BMO, we've talked about that in the past, it's a combination of M&I and Harris. If you think about 1 plus 1 equals 2, it will not equal 2 for us, it will be less than 2. Somewhere between 1 and 2. We'll be handling revenue stream. We continue to work with them. Anyway, we have a great relationship, we have a great relationship at a senior level, and they've got a path they're going to go on to snag. We've got products on both sides. So with core, they're going to end up in our core, you're going to have on a core platform, a single core platform versus historically they had split that between the 2 institutions, Harrison and M&I. But that's something we don't -- the timetable for that is going to be towards the very end of '12. We don't expect much impact in '12 from that consolidation of M&I and Harris. When we go into '13, there's going to be some revenue impact, but with our contract and our term fees, we think we'll be able to preserve all of the earnings from that relationship going into '13, and so now you're back into '14. We knew about this at the end of '10. So our expectation is we will have grown through the impacts by the time we get to '14.","Frank Martire","Yes. I mean, and that contract's got a number of years left on it, but you have to understand the strategic relationship there. One, as I shared with you in some of my prepared remarks, the largest single payment implementation in Brazilian history went on there, leveraging onto our platform, the efficiencies they were able to gain, then if you get into the labor issue around unions in Brazil, the ability to outsource that function is very beneficial to us. So it's very, very strategic. They were able to increase their growth in credit card deployment, they were able to lower their overall cost and we were able to provide a superior end-to-end service. So we, and what also people seem to forget, when you look at our JV, we've got a number of other clients on that joint venture as well that are true commercial clients. So very strategic relationship, several years left on that contract. Here. Right here.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. I heard a comment, I think you said that you don't have conversations about licensing software anymore. So could you sort of give us the background on what has licensed software been as a percent of revenues, historically, what's been the revenue growth in margin profile? And as you go more from just selling software in that I guess, 5%, 6%, 7%, 10% of your business to wrapping services around it, how do you see the implementation and the accounting of it affecting the numbers?","Frank Martire","Okay and just to clarify my comments and build on some of Mike's. What I was talking about was in the sales force, when you look at the buying habits as Mike said in that less than $10 billion market, very, very low software activity and typically, where we have software sales now it will be with a client that we formerly sold software to in the past. So our net new wins, our growth, is really all coming through that outsourcing side. And because of the economy and other things, we're seeing that trend come into the large FI and international markets where those larger institutions were typically biased to license and run it themselves. They're now asking themselves the question, what's the differentiator in me owning a data center, what's the differentiator in me leveraging it. So obviously, that, we're seeing most of our conversations in our sales engine going towards that deployment method.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, understood. The second question I have is around M&A. And as you do mainly tuck-in acquisitions now, are there specific areas where you see a need to go acquire versus partner? What areas might those be?","Gary Norcross","Yes; I think honestly, we're not going to comment on what some of the gaps, what some of our perceived gaps are in the future. That don't make a lot of sense for us. I mean we, we're very comfortable when you start looking about some of the emerging technology, some of the innovation that\u2019s going on with next-generation payments, some of the interesting channel deployments out there, there's also some interesting ways to drive benefits for our customers' financial institutions to retain clients so we're looking at a lot of different areas. But to Mike's point, we've been very strategic with our acquisitions, hopefully timing in, in time for the inflection point. Compliance Coach is a great example of that. We talked about that. We saw the pending regulatory change, we saw all the discussions, made the acquisition ahead of that curve and then rode through it and are riding through that regulatory curve. We're doing it also, when you start looking at some of the international mining movement, given our global presence and given that some of the things that are going on to more efficiently move money. And so you look at the GIFTS acquisition. Once again, small tuck-in, being able to deploy it across 650 institutions. So at the end of the day, those are the kind of things we're looking for. We're, when we're looking for acquisitions, we're looking out a year, 2, 3 years out of what we think, where we think the market's going to go and we want to time those acquisitions appropriately. As Mike shared with you, we prefer to build. So let's just be real clear about that. And we do a lot of internal building that we're very proud of. So if there are times when we aren't able to build it fast enough because we see the inflection point or what we think is going to be the inflection point, then we'll do a nice product acquisition and we'll look through the distribution channel appropriately.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. One last quick modeling question on the buyback, the $1 billion buyback, is that, I see a share count number in here. Was that the average share count, or year-end share count for the 295 million? And is that the pace at which you might expect to do the buyback for the next couple of years?","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","'12 [indiscernible].","Barton B. Hooper - Wallace R. Weitz & Co.","It's Barton Hooper with the Weitz Funds. Just a question on your sales coverage. You\u2019ve got, yes, I think you said 300 products, 600 sales people, 14,000 clients. Do you have enough coverage to get the wallet share that you want? I realize it's skewed by a lot of the community banking but for some reason, it seems light with 33,000 employees.","Frank Martire","Actually, because of our -- it's a great question. Frankly, we've gotten a lot of efficiencies out of our distribution channel. If you look at, traditionally where our competitors will house those organizations, is they'll house them under the business lines, which is a very inefficient process. So what we've done is we've picked those sales resources up and put them across the enterprise of the entire company, and then we've invested heavily in our subject matter experts. So we're driving those people to get the doors open to then allow our subject matter experts to come through and sell appropriately. So it's a very efficient model. I have to warn people, it's a very time-consuming model to implement. We started this almost 8 years ago. And so we built that model every year building it out. So what you're seeing is the efficiencies that we gained through it as well. And I'd also point back to historically, every year, we've had record sales from the standpoint of new sales, net new revenue and data or existing customers or new clients. So we feel very comfortable with it. We continue to evaluate various markets, as I've shared with you. The LFI market, we saw back in late '10, we saw that there was going be a real opportunity as the economy started to recover and we needed to focus there so we moved resource into that, but as I said, we saw no degradation in the community sales engine as well. So we were very pleased with that result and that nimbleness is what allows us to be competitive with those number of resources.","Gary Norcross","And I think over the years, we've proven that we get the business units to work together with the sales force as one, and that takes a while. But that's working very well for us. Jim, we do have a couple of people been waiting a long time up here to ask a question.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Just wanted to ask about the payment services segment. I was a little surprised that the revenue growth will be a little bit down to the mid-, I guess, low-single digits for next year, what's driving that? Is it all check or is there another change in growth factors there? Maybe if you guys will give us an update on debit while you're at it?","Gary Norcross","And let me just add, I don't know if everybody fully understands. So our PSG, Payment Solutions Group segment, so if we look at last year is at 2% or about a 2% spread between reported, we got 2%, 2% to 3% between paper and reported. It's what it's been running. So low-single digits, add a couple of points to that, you're going to get close to mid-single on the electronics side. So the paper is kind of defined headwind that we've been sharing with you guys. Another thing to keep in mind if you look at our PSG compared to our closest competitor's PSG, and I've said this before, they stole the label but then they got the components wrong. So if we take out item processing, which is in our PSG, it's not in theirs, pushed it over to FSG, Anthony's going to love us for this, and then you take eBanking, which is in their PSG, not in ours, I think you're going to see what our numbers are going to be. I know Frank D'Angelo used to send me an e-mail every year showering that our numbers were better than their PSG numbers. I haven't done the math yet, but I suspect it will be the same this year. So you can't really compare those 2. Our payments for all the reasons we've talked about, we've done a great job of driving earnings and keeping the margins very solid, as Gary pointed out. But it's a different collection [indiscernible] everybody else out there. Okay. Here's the mike.","Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Greg Smith with Sterne Agee. Mike, just back to PSG though, the margin in 4Q stepped up quite a bit year-over-year. Was there anything unusual in that?","Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then from all your comments, should we interpret it definitely as Misys is off the table, so it doesn't fit to where the...","Frank Martire","What was that again?","Frank Martire","And we are very prudent about that we do, you know that at the end of the day, and the last large one we did was Metavente.","Greg Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then just lastly when we look at that competitive landscape slide, the sort of, the elephant in the room to me is IBM, they're sort of missing in some key areas that you or another core processor could fill in. Do you expect IBM to make an acquisition of a core processor potentially?","Gary Norcross","We sort of like our future the way we are today, and we're very comfortable with what we're doing.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","Kartik Mehta with NorthCoast Research. Gary, in your presentation, you said you're able to raise prices in certain areas. Could you talk about maybe what those areas are, and what percentage of the company that might be?","Gary Norcross","Yes. Well, we're starting to see so much demand in some of our professional services engagements. I mean it really is supply and demand. There's a lot of demand for high-end resources in these transformation services, many of which Capco delivers. But in the LFI space, we're seeing an increased demand for implementation services, transformation services, building out releases and product functionality and so yes, we're seeing where we have the ability and have increased some of our professional services fees in those areas. Because simply, the supply of that particular type knowledge is not enough to meet some of the demands. So we're actually investing in those areas. We're hiring more people in those areas, we're training people in those areas. That's primarily been professional services. All in all, I mean, it's a pretty small percentage of our business. But we do see continued growth in that area and the point being, when we're seeing that growth, that high, and we have the ability to implement price increases appropriately, and we've done that.","Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research","And then just the impact on your debit business, now that the Durbin Amendment's been implemented, what do you anticipate from your customers? And maybe what's happening now and what you anticipate going forward?","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. I wanted to follow up on Greg Smith's question. Clearly a pretty big change in strategic focus here of going more to building as opposed to buying. Obviously, that's been the legacy of your company. You clearly looked at the Misys acquisition s sort of midyear so I just was sort of looking for a little bit more color on sort of what sort of happened in the change in thinking. You're obviously sort of setting a new tone for the company from a growth perspective going forward. So maybe little bit more background behind the thinking on that change.","Frank Martire","Yes. To reinforce it, if you look at our products today globally, and you look at our distribution channels globally, we clearly do not have to do significant acquisitions anymore. And as Mike well put it, why would you pay up for acquisitions when you already have some of those things, and you spend the last 12 years or so doing that. And that's the position we're in.","Gary Norcross","Yes, and just to, just chime in as well. At the end of the day, we build our acquisition strategy off the people in this room and off our sales channels. And at the end of the day, the best acquisition is one generated out of the business lines because there's an identified need, or generated out of your distribution channel for identified need. There are going to be product acquisitions that are going to be identified that make sense. But paying up for a very large overlapping acquisition is not being driven out of our leadership team at the moment. And so as Frank mentioned, as I mentioned, Mike mentioned, we listen to the people in this room. This is who drives the company. And so at the end of the day, making sure that we give them the tools they need to compete is what's important for us. And so at the end of the day, we're very comfortable in the markets we serve today, which is important to understand the markets we serve. But in those markets we serve, very comfortable with our product suite and this team is not telling us at all that we lack the scale to compete, that we lack the product set to compete, when in growing the business.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","All right. And then, different direction, related to Capco. You obviously had the large client loss at the beginning of the year, how did Capco end up from a growth perspective in '11, and directionally, expectations for growth and margin expansions related to Capco for '12?","Gary Norcross","Yes. For growth, the U.S. was really got hit by that large client, the U.S. was a little bit slower. Europe was, I think 80% growth, 75% growth. Europe was very strong growth, combined I think, we're still on 30%, 25-ish percent organic growth versus where they ended up in '10, so they still had a very solid year, again with one client who got off, that cut the government financing, and so they kind of went out. But when we look at where they ended the year, again, we had that client kind of cut back right at the beginning of the year, made a decision that we thought we could redeploy fast enough to maintain margin. Well, that didn't work out. So we looked at the fourth quarter and where we\u2019re operating, we feel pretty good about where it sets up for '12. I would add to that though, again, so Robin's team have to focus on running their business like every other business unit on our industry. And they all have a budget, they have a plan, they get paid to make their number. But with Capco, in addition to making their number, it's all about Frank and Gary have been involved in these deals where they walk into a CEO or a CIO or the head of an institution, and they're talking about a different operating model, different business. And it's led by, let's start with how you can think of the world differently. So obviously, it was a good start in that direction because it's totally different business model for them in the States. But the discussions and dialogue we've had continue to be positive from our perspective on how that sets up to getting some opportunities in the future.","Frank Martire","And most of these large banks that we got to globally, Capco already has a relationship and a reputation, a very positive reputation which helps us and Capco.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. Are you expecting double-digit revenue growth from Capco in \u201912?","Frank Martire","Absolutely. That would be correct.","Gary Norcross","Yes, absolutely. Yes they did a nice job in growing through the loss of their customer, as Mike said, ended up the year strong. We see margins returning to where we originally expected as part of the deal. Conversations between our go-to-market  forces, have -- our distribution channel and our client management group, and theirs has never been stronger. So we're still very, very excited about the acquisition and why we did it.","Frank Martire","And Robin and his senior leaders are very optimistic about the future.","Mary K. Waggoner","We've got time for one more question.","Unknown Analyst","Just a -- I know how this impacts you long-term, but it seems like in memory database, big data, those types of conversations, does it make it more difficult or easier for clients that do things in-house to keep that business in-house? Does the technology make it a harder sell for you?","Gary Norcross","I would -- of course you're talking to Mike and Gary who are the most technical executives in the industry, so we should [indiscernible] I would say, any new technological innovation that's going to hit the industry. So the very big guys, it's really not about buying the technology, buying the hardware anymore, it's about buying the people and the expertise. So the big guys will go out and do that. But where do the big guys stop? Is it after the top 4 or 5, is it after the top 10, there's a line there that becomes a pretty sharp demarcation. People can't go out and hire the expertise to do the latest greatest technology, and it gets -- the thing about [indiscernible] say, we can give you the benefit of having better data warehousing, better access, better information, better analytics and do it cheaper and I would focus on solving your business problem. It's hard -- we\u2019re competing against the CEO trying to build out infrastructure, and I think we win those debates these days.","Mary K. Waggoner","Okay. With that, I think Frank wants to make a few closing comments, and I'll follow with a few housekeeping items before we move onto the next portion.","Frank Martire","Well, first of all, I want to thank the investment community for being here today. For those of you who made the trip, I really appreciate it, I know it's a lot of valuable time. I hope you find it valuable to you. The second, for the shareholders in the room, we thank you for your confidence in us. For those who are thinking of investing in us, hopefully, we gained a little bit more of your confidence today. But for those who cover us, thank you for the coverage on FIS, we really appreciate it. I think it's kind of an interesting experience when you have 3 people standing up there, talking with the confidence we do about a company that\u2019s our size and saying things about the future and how we feel about it. We say with confidence for just simply one reason, we have 300 leaders behind us with the same confidence and passion that we do for this company and our clients. And they have 30,000 people behind them with the same passion and confidence. That makes us feel good, that makes us totally confident that we could deliver and we will continue to. We are very passionate, we are very excited about this company. We know we have a great future. We\u2019d like you to be a part of it and have the same enthusiasm and passion that we do. Thank you for sharing your morning with us. We appreciate it. Thank you.","Mary K. Waggoner","Just a reminder to our investors and analysts, please fill out the survey that is on the table in front of you. For those of you listening via webcast, we will e-mail that survey to you, and would appreciate your input on today's event as well. Now, I would ask most of our leadership team to remain seated so that we can escort our guests to the topic table reception. And the topic table facilitator should exit to the Crystal ballroom now as well.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Pete Gunnlaugsson. Please go ahead, sir.","Peter Gunnlaugsson","Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Frank Martire, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will begin with a summary of our financial performance. Gary Norcross, President and Chief Operating Officer, will follow with an operations report. Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with a detailed financial review. Today's news release and the supplemental slide presentation are available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Let me remind you that today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements.

With that, I will turn the call over to Frank to discuss the third quarter financial highlights on Slide 6. Frank?","Frank R. Martire","Thanks, Pete. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I am pleased to report that the third quarter was another strong quarter for FIS, positioning us well to achieve our full year growth outlook. Our results underscore the strength of our business model and our long-term planned relationships, which drives significant recurring revenue and consistent profitable growth.","Looking at the details of the quarter. Revenue increased 7% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis to $1.6 billion and year-to-date of $4.7 billion. This marks our 19th consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth. Adjusted earnings per share rose 8% -- 8% to $0.80, in line with our expectations and year-to-date to $2.23. Sales execution was strong in the quarter, and we maintained a robust pipeline going into the last quarter of the year.","These results demonstrate the continuing successful execution of the business strategy we outlined in 2012. First, we are optimizing performance through organic growth with an ongoing focus on double-digit growth and earnings per share. Second, we are delivering strategic value to our clients through solution innovation and transformation. Third, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value through strong financial performance and disciplined capital allocation. Reflecting this commitment, we have returned over $680 million in dividends and share repurchase to our shareholders in the first 9 months of 2014 and over $2.5 billion since the beginning of 2011.","Before I turn the call over to Gary for our business strategy and operating highlights, I'd like to comment on the recent announcement of my new role as Executive Chairman of the FIS Board, effective January 1, 2015. I've had the extreme pleasure of leading this company for the last 5 years. I am very proud of what we have accomplished together. We have delivered consistently strong financial performance during a very challenging environment for our clients, achieved investment-grade status and driven shareholder returns of over 140%. Additionally, FIS has ranked consistently among the industry leaders' financial technology providers, including the #1 position in the annual IDC Financial Insights FinTech Rankings for 4 consecutive years. It has truly been my honor and privilege to have served as the CEO of this company.","Additionally, I'd like to recognize and congratulate Gary on the announcement of his promotion to President and CEO of FIS, also effective January 1. Gary is a 26-year veteran of FIS, and there is no better person to lead the company into its next chapter. I have a tremendous amount of respect and confidence in Gary, and know he will be immensely successful in his new role. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross","Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you, Frank, for the vote of confidence. I'd like to congratulate you on your new role as Executive Chairman, and thank you on behalf of our 40,000 employees and me personally for your exemplary leadership. FIS is now the leading global financial technology company with incredible talent, valuable relationships with over 14,000 clients globally and a track record of strong financial performance. I look forward to continuing this legacy, and I'm honored to lead this company in January as the new President and CEO.","Turning to Slide 8. As Frank discussed, the third quarter was another strong quarter of financial performance and strategic progress for FIS. We continue to capitalize on the increasing global market demand for scalable outsourced solutions and transformational services. In the quarter, we again recorded strong sales and strategic wins across all markets, with new bookings up significantly in the quarter and year-to-date. We further expanded our global payments portfolio to drive growth opportunities in key markets. This includes our recent acquisition of Clear2Pay, which I'll discuss in a few minutes. We generated positive momentum with existing deployments and expanding business with established clients, and we continued to affirm our investment strategy to better penetrate the global financial institution market, where we saw continued traction.","Turning to the markets. In North America, financial institution mind share continues to center on improving profitability and addressing regulatory compliance challenges. As a result, we see broad-based demand for strategic technology and outsourcing solutions, including strength in digital and mobile banking, emerging payments and enterprise risk and compliance solutions. We continue our success in growing our mobile business with over 28 million registered mobile users in Q3, representing 25% year-over-year growth. Additionally, we have driven strong volume growth in mobile check deposits, with both dollar volume and item volume up over 80% year-over-year.","Strong demand for FIS risk and compliance expertise and solutions drove strong growth this quarter. For example, we are currently engaged in a significant professional services project with a large financial institution to further enhance their enterprise compliance processes. Additionally, strong demand for our technology-based regulatory training and analytics continues with a top 20 financial institution selecting FIS industry leading and innovative online regulatory university solution to deliver regulatory compliance training company-wide and to their partner network throughout the U.S. Overall, it was a record sales quarter for our North American market.","Switching to our international market. It was another solid quarter of revenue growth with a number of significant new deals closed during the quarter. In Asia, the market continues to deliver significant opportunities with organizations looking to better serve the underbanked and emerging payments sector. For example, you will recall our success last year in launching Mahila Bank, India's first bank aimed at the financial empowerment of the country's women. This was followed last quarter by Shivalik Bank, who selected FIS to deliver a completely outsourced banking solution. This quarter, Bandhan Bank, India's largest micro-finance institution, selected FIS as their partner, outsourcing all technology operations for its new banking operation. Bandhan Bank plans to begin operation in early 2015, with approximately 600 branches and 10 million customers. Under a long-term outsourcing arrangement, FIS will provide a fully integrated banking and payments platform. This win builds on our current success in addressing the demand for outsourced solutions in the market.","Next, we continue to make good progress on our global financial institution market, and remain pleased with our early results, including the strong growth we are generating in our consulting and services business. We are pleased that after the quarter closed, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole entered into a 7-year outsourcing agreement with FIS, one of our largest outsourcing deals to date to provide a derivatives post-trade solution. This platform is designed to allow investment banks to share IT services and resources for cross-asset derivatives, thus reducing costs and increasing efficiency. This win combines the deep capital markets content of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole corporate and investment bank with the large scale financial technology capabilities and expertise of FIS.","Turning to Slide 9. In support of our growth strategy, we are pleased with our recent acquisition of Brussels-based Clear2Pay. Global payments are one of the fastest-growing segments in financial services. Clear2Pay has been a recognized leader in this segment over the last several years. Their solutions and payment hub capabilities supporting corporate and retail payments expand our payment capabilities, and position us to better address our clients' need across all geographies, particularly among large global institutions. Using service-oriented architecture on their open framework, Clear2Pay is able to help clients solve the demands of an evolving and complex global payments landscape, inclusive of high-value and cross-currency corporate payments, as well as ATM, point of sale, Internet, mobile, debit, prepaid and corporate card payments.","There are significant revenue synergies in combining Clear2Pay's assets with FIS' distribution channels and system integration capabilities. This strategic acquisition demonstrates our commitment to delivering the technologies and assets that will enable our clients to realize a modern payments environment, which encompasses all customer channels and simplifies payment operations.","Before I turn things over to Woody, and turning to Slide 10, let me take a minute to recap a few key points. We had a solid third quarter and strong year-to-date results, reflecting a combination of new wins, implementations and expanded client relationships across all markets. We continue to leverage the powerful combination of FIS technology, service capabilities and consulting expertise to bring transformational solution to our clients. We remain committed to optimizing our business and investing in the markets and solutions that are central to driving profitable growth.","Now I'll turn it over to Woody for the financial report.","James W. Woodall","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 12 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. Revenue increased 7% on a reported basis to $1.6 billion and 5% organically. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $488 million, and EBITDA margin was 30.4%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% from the prior year quarter to $0.80 per share. Year-to-date, revenue increased 5% on a reported and organic basis to $4.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $1.4 billion, and EBITDA margin was 29.6% compared to 30.1% in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $2.23 per share. As we anticipated and called out to you last quarter, our investment in the global financial institutions market, coupled with revenue mix and difficult comparisons in the prior year period, resulted in a margin headwind for the quarter. We anticipate margins to expand in the fourth quarter as we begin to anniversary difficult comparisons.","Next, I will continue on Slide 13 with a review of segment results. Financial Solutions revenue increased 9% to $633 million, and grew 6% organically, driven by growth in consulting and professional services, risk and compliance, and mobile banking. We also completed the Reliance Financial acquisition in July, which contributed to reported revenue growth. Financial Solutions EBITDA increased 5% to $251 million, while EBITDA margin was 39.6% compared to 41.4% last year. As mentioned earlier, this was driven by a change in revenue mix and lower termination fees compared to the prior year quarter.","Turning to Slide 14. Payment Solutions revenue increased 2% on both a reported and organic basis to $615 million, reflecting growth in network solutions, debit processing and software license sales. Payment Solutions EBITDA was $262 million and the EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 42.7%.","Moving to Slide 15. International revenue grew 12% to $358 million, and increased 9% organically. We continue to see strong growth in Europe and Asia. The macroeconomic trends in Brazil have resulted in slower-than-anticipated growth in Latin America, causing a headwind to our overall international growth rate in the third quarter. International EBITDA margin was 22.9%, down from 25.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting lower license sales and increased investment in the global financial institutions market. Corporate expense was $108 million in the quarter, and we expect approximately $110 million in the fourth quarter. Ongoing disciplined cost management has enabled us to reduce corporate expense about 3% year-to-date.","Moving on to a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP EPS on Slide 16. GAAP earnings were $0.53 per share. Third quarter 2014 GAAP results are adjusted to exclude $0.13 per share in acquisition-related purchase amortization, $0.09 per share for costs related to refinancing activities, as noted in the second quarter and completed in the third quarter, and $0.06 per share for acquisition, integration and severance cost. The effective tax rate was 31.2%, down from the prior year quarter, primarily due to realization of certain acquired loss carryforward assets. We expect an effective tax rate of 34% to 35% for the fourth quarter, yielding a full year effective tax rate of 32% to 33%.","Moving on to cash flow on Slide 17. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $287 million, and free cash flow was $201 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $86 million or 5.4% of revenue in the third quarter and $273 million or 5.8% of revenue year-to-date. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures between 5.5% and 6% of revenue.","Turning to Slide 18. We continue to invest for growth, including the acquisition of Clear2Pay, which closed earlier this month. In light of the accelerating demand for corporate payments, the additional capabilities afforded by Clear2Pay are expected to be a tailwind to our long-term organic revenue and earnings growth. We anticipate margins from this business to approach our consolidated margins once full run-rate synergies are achieved and the business gains scale. On a stand-alone basis, Clear2Pay is expected to generate revenue of approximately $135 million for 2014. The transaction was funded with a combination of offshore cash and borrowings from existing credit facilities. We anticipate this acquisition to be neutral to 2014 adjusted EPS and slightly accretive to 2015 adjusted EPS. Earnings per share accretion further accelerates in 2016, as full run-rate synergies are achieved. Additionally, in September, we entered into an agreement to divest nonstrategic assets from the Certegy check gaming business for proceeds of approximately $235 million in cash. We expect to close the transaction in April of 2015. Combined, these transactions are expected to be neutral to 2015 adjusted EPS.","Moving on to the balance sheet. As of quarter end, debt totaled $5 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%. Our leverage ratio was 2.6x debt-to-EBITDA, and we anticipate ending the year at approximately 2.5x, including the impact of the acquisition of Clear2Pay. In the third quarter, we returned $218 million to shareholders, including $68 million in dividends and $150 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have returned $681 million to shareholders, up 26% from the prior year period. Repurchase activity reduced our weighted average diluted shares to 287 million in the third quarter from 293 million last year. Approximately $1.5 billion remains under our share repurchase authorization.","Moving on to Slide 19. We are reiterating our revenue and EBITDA guidance, and narrowing the EPS range of our outlook for full year 2014. We now expect organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, adjusted earnings per share of $3.06 to $3.12, reflecting growth of 9% to 11%. This compares to our previous guidance of 8% to 12% growth. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings.","To summarize, this guidance is in line with our full year outlook we provided in February. We're on track to deliver another year of profitable growth, and we're optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. We will continue to focus on deploying capital in value-enhancing ways, including investing for growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And congrats too to Gary and Frank, both of you, great progress for so many years, so congrats on the transitions.","Frank R. Martire","That's very nice of you to say.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And so I guess just, first of all, you've had so many good wins in the last several quarters. Is there a time frame where we should look to see kind of the biggest impact of those wins coming on, on a year-over-year basis? Like, basically, we've had about 5% growth for a while now, and are we going to see in the next 2 or 3 quarters kind of a ramp-up just as all those deal wins really come together?","James W. Woodall","Well, Dave, I'll take that one. If you look back, our organic revenue growth this year has gone in line with what we outlined for the year. First quarter organic was about 4%. First half was 4.5%, third quarter 5%. So that acceleration we've been talking about for some time, we're starting to see it, and if you model that forward for revenue growth of about 4.5% to 6.5%, we anticipate continued acceleration into the fourth quarter. So I don't think you're going to see a shift on a dime in terms of the revenue growth curve changing, but we continue to see it accelerating as we anticipate it.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, Dave, I mean, just to build on a little bit of that. As you know, these are -- most of these deals, we're announcing are very large scale outsourcing deals. They take time to ramp up. We've talked about that on prior calls. So we're looking for, as Woody said, just steady improvement of our organic growth going into the future.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, the secondary question on that is, this year, margins have been down a little bit year-to-date, and part of that obviously is because of some of the new deal wins in consulting growth. Is margin something that you think from this year is kind of a base line that should expand over the next couple of years even as that revenue starts to accelerate?","James W. Woodall","Well, I think as we've talked about before, we made some specific investments this year that put some headwind on margin, and we had some difficult comparisons that put some headwind on margins. We anticipate fourth quarter to actually see some level of margin expansion as we begin to anniversary those comparisons, and while we're not completed with our 2015 planning, we do anticipate margin expansion going into the future similar to levels you've seen in the past.","Frank R. Martire","Absolutely. So Dave, we fully expect to see margin expansion into 2015 and beyond, okay?","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then just one quick last one. Do you think Apple Pay, they talk about how the banks might be willing to give up 15 basis points, like I just still struggle to know why they would give up what could be 15% of their interchange fee for something that doesn't give them that much of a benefit. I'm just wondering if you've talked to banks on that and why they might be willing to do it.","Gary A. Norcross","Dave, I think it's too early to really comment on Apple Pay. I mean, where we see the positives of it, it does raise awareness, right? It generates transactions, as you know, us having the hosting count, it gets back to us, and if it creates more volume, that will be a positive thing for us. It's early. There's going to be a lot of room, and some of the questions you're bringing up, we are discussing with our financial institutions, and I think a lot of people are trying to decide where that -- where all this is going to settle out. Clearly, Apple Pay is going to have a role, but there's room for -- there's going to have to be more than just 1 mobile payment provider in the industry, and so as you know, we're doing a lot with MCX under the brand currency. We've actually enabled some of our customers to utilize Apple Pay as well, but I think it's going to be early to see -- to be commenting on how all this is going to sort out and where the volume is actually going to end up.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Gary, should we expect you to do things differently as the new CEO of FIS?","Gary A. Norcross","David, it's a great question. And I've been here 26 years, and Frank and I have had a great partnership over the last 5. And so no, I would not expect any radical changes. We're very focused on continuing to accelerate our long-term growth and generating, expanding profits associated with that. So hopefully, you've seen over the last year, we've made some shifts, of rolling out our strategy, and focusing on what we see as 3 very distinct markets. Obviously, our biggest opportunity for expansion is in the global financial institution marketplace, because as we've shared in the past, we feel we're under-penetrated there, but we're going to continue to carry on the legacy that Frank has established and excited about the opportunity. So when you start thinking about capital allocation, Woody hit on how we're focused on driving our capital to help accelerate profitable growth, and we're going to continue to focus on the markets that we've been discussing.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Understood. If you could address some of the big growth drivers that you've touched on in the past, in particular, India ATM, if you could talk about the ramp of that contract; second, Sainsbury U.K.; and then third, if you could give us what the account growth was in the Banco Bradesco JV in the quarter.","Gary A. Norcross","Sure, I'd be happy to do that. Let's go -- let's just go in the order that you brought them up. So in India, the team continues to perform very well. That project is right on plan. The team's done a phenomenal job deploying our ATMs. We are continuing to see adoption raise -- rise on the curve that we had hoped. So everything is green with regards to our India ATM deployment, and we see no issues hitting our pro forma that we announced to the market when we signed that transaction. We've also continued to build on that as well. So it's not just that contract. We continue to drive additional contracts related to our India ATM business. But also, hopefully we've hit on a few things that what you're seeing with FIS is once we build credibility in these key markets, like India ATM, now we're moving into the core bank processing, and so we're very excited about some of the recent announcements in India outside of the ATM EFT business, whether it's Mahila Bank, Shivalik or the one we just announced, Bandhan Bank. These are 3 new banks essentially in India, and looking for a complete core banking and payment system, and there's been 3 that have come out and FIS has signed all 3. So I just -- I can't be more complimentary to our team in that region. They're just doing a great job. Sainsbury also continues to progress well. I know Frank was actually over there the last couple of weeks meeting with the executive team on one of his trips. And when you look at something the size of Sainsbury, you're always going to have some opportunities to improve the time line. You're also going to have some opportunities that'll come up you have to address, but there's nothing been out of the norm in the Sainsbury deployment. So we feel very good about our progress there, and we feel very good about rolling Sainsbury into production in the 2015 time frame, which we discussed. As far as Bradesco, Bradesco, we've seen frankly our international business, the economic issues going on in Brazil as a whole impacted our international numbers a little more than we expected. With that being said, transactions and cards were up in our Brazilian joint venture. We're seeing some things where we're actually moving some volume around, so we're moving some things out of our call center and moving that into more automated solutions, like our IVR, and that actually is providing a little headwind to our revenue, but all in all, given the macroeconomic climate of Brazil, we're pleased at what's going on in the joint venture, although it was a little more of a headwind than we expected in the quarter.","James W. Woodall","Said a different way on the Brazil, David, we did continue to see growth in transactions and card, just at a slower rate than we've seen in the past.","Frank R. Martire","That's right.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Understood, and just a quick final question. Woody, I think your 3-year guidance would imply a pretty substantial acceleration in revenue and earnings growth in FY '15. Are you on track for that?","James W. Woodall","We have not adjusted our mid-year -- or mid-term guidance. We're staying in line with the same guidance that we had, which was 4% to 7% on the top, 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion, and the EPS as outlined in our previous guidance.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Congrats to all those folks who are moving around up there. The -- I think you talked a little bit about this, but I wanted to dig in a little bit because we think this is a really important driver. It's the global financial initiatives that you mentioned already, I think, Gary and Frank. Can you give us just -- I know that these deals are big, and they're moving through the pipeline. Can you give us just some anecdotal examples of how those things are progressing, how those conversations are going, any particular wins that have come out of that, small or large, this quarter? And then incremental spending plans, I know that's something that if this thing works, that may need more capital, and then I think you answered the margin question by saying that you expert margins to expand, but any other color on GFI?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. Let me take that one and then also we can address the margin as well. Hopefully, Brett, what we're trying to do is, every quarter, bring you some examples. So let's first talk about the investment. As you guys know, we invested more than $30 million in our go-to-market strategies in GFI, and I would tell you when we made that investment at the early part of this year, we also announced we'd be looking for proof points for success, and what we're doing is every quarter, trying to come back and give the market some insight in those proof points. We started very early on with one of the largest investment banks in the industry. They're in a very large chain sourcing deal. That transaction has gone exceptionally well. The team has done a very nice job of ramping up that service, and you're starting to see that flow through in our growth numbers in both our FSG and ISG segment. We also announced the Jefferies transaction, which is a very exciting transaction. That, too, is a later stage signing, so it's obviously earlier in the deployment cycle, but that, too, that project is going exceptionally well. And then, of course, this quarter, that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole utility that we just announced is very significant. That's one of the largest outsourcing contracts we've signed, and as a company, you know we've signed some significant ones. What's interesting about this one, this is truly a utility that allows us to bring on other investment banks to deal with their post-trade derivatives, and so we're excited about that opportunity. We got a nice pipeline of additional customers that are looking at coming on to that. So I would tell you right now, we're very pleased with the investment we chose to make in the early part of this year. We're also pleased with the results we're seeing. When you build on now, then you have to layer on the recent announcement around Clear2Pay. Clear2Pay, I talked about in my comments how it brings next-generation payment capabilities across a broad swath of payment channels. What's most interesting for us is their early penetration into some of these GFI institutions. So now you've got very robust consulting. That's been a proof point for the last 3 to 4 years. You now see us lead with multiple very large services engagements, and now you see us bringing the Clear2Pay asset up under that distribution channel with some of their early wins over the last several years being a leader in, really, payment transformation in that market. So we think all of those things would make us very comfortable with the direction, the investment we're making and the future success and profits of that market.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just to be clear on the margin, I think what Woody, you said before, that you fully, and I think, Frank, too, you fully expect margins to expand next year regardless of the mix, whether it's GFI heavy or not GFI heavy, did I hear that right?","James W. Woodall","You did, and if you think about this year, the incremental investment and the headwinds, we've still kind of guided to flat margin. So we don't anticipate incremental investment in those same level of resources, and we don't anticipate the same level of difficult comparisons. Therefore, the underlying traditional model is going to generate margin expansion.","Gary A. Norcross","Exactly. I mean, Brett, if you think about it, right, we had a large loss with M&I due to the acquisition and anniversary-ing those difficult comps out. We also chose to make an investment to actually break in to really a new market, and what you're seeing now is we're having enough success that, that market will self-sustain investment going forward. And so we, as a company, have always been able to generate margin expansion on our business, and that's going to continue into next year as these things anniversary out. Now on the various markets, the margins will expand at different rates, right? Some markets that we're in actually are -- we're deploying a product once across many, many financial institutions. We can expect to see more margin expansion, but even in our GFI market with services and the products that we now see the capabilities of pulling into that group, you're going to see margin expansion across all of our markets.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Let me add my congrats as well to both of you, Frank and Gray.","Frank R. Martire","Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross","Thank you.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So a quick question on the international -- a quick follow-up to earlier question. So it looks like you have a solid momentum in Asia and EMEA, and then a slight slowdown in Latin America. But just as we think forward, how should we think about the FX impact and the momentum going into the business going forward in the international side?","James W. Woodall","Well, we're blended across the euro, the Brazilian real, the pound sterling and the rupee would be our major currencies. We do anticipate some headwind in the fourth quarter based on what the back half of September did in terms of currency movements. Again, we don't believe that to be significant to our earnings per share at this point, but it could impact reported growth by as much as 1 point, at least, is what we are anticipating. Again, our organic revenue growth, we pull that impact out, but don't anticipate it to be significant at the earnings level. Ultimately, because of the different geographies that we play in, we have some that are somewhat of a tailwind, somewhat -- some that are somewhat of a headwind, but at a blended rate, we don't see it as being a significant item for us at this point.","Gary A. Norcross","Okay. I think as far as the business goes, it's kind of the testament of our geographic disperse-ment. So if you think about it, Latin America or Brazil especially has been a very strong tailwind for us for the last several years. We've seen Asia as a very fast-growing market as well, but Europe has struggled, and we talked about that over the past. Now we see our European investments -- as we indicated very early on last year, we saw an early precursor of our consulting business was growing in Europe, and we said that's typically a precursor of now services contracts and then product, and now you've seen us lead with that very process, and you've seen Sainsbury and other big announcements that we've made. So now Europe's turned into a tailwind as the Brazilian economy's fallen a little bit. So really, it's our diversification, geographic disperse-ment of our business. It allows us -- comfortable to continue to maintain that double-digit growth in those markets on a blended rate.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. A quick question on the EMV card conversion, you had highlighted on the last call a large win there. I was just wondering if you could give an update on that as well as if you can talk about the opportunity there with the EMV upgrade cycle.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, no, I appreciate the question. EMV, as we've shared with you before, we think, has got some potential to push our revenue stream, and certainly, we actually signed some other EMV contracts this quarter. So we do continue to see momentum growing there. As far as the one that we mentioned last quarter, everything's on target, and we're starting to issue those cards. So we feel good about our capabilities in EMV. Once again, we saw this very early and made the investments very early on. Our systems have been EMV capable for years because of our international processing capabilities, so we feel good about that.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. And just wanted to clarify on the EMV. These are opportunities you are seeing, not just where you have a core processing presence, but maybe able to tap into these global financial institutions in the U.S., which may be doing the card conversion. Is that the right way to think about it?","Gary A. Norcross","Correct, correct, yes. We're signing more customers on to our EMV platform and generating EMV cards than just ones where we have core processing relationships, absolutely.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. That's great. On the payment segment, slight improvement there. How should we think about the fourth quarter, and then going into fiscal year '15, what are the puts and takes in that particular segment?","James W. Woodall","Yes, we saw some heavier volumes in our NYCE business, and our debit business actually performed well in the quarter. We did see some licensing this quarter that we don't necessarily anticipate. It gets lumpy. So hard to say, but I would just state we are still looking at sort of low- to mid-single digit in that segment in terms of growth in the near future and in the foreseeable future.","Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great. One final question on the acquisition. So you mentioned the combination of the acquisition and the divestiture of Certegy that will be neutral to EPS next year. How should we think about the revenue? So you mentioned $135 million from Clear2Pay this year. Can you just talk about the growth rate, growth profile in that business, and then how much is the revenue loss from Certegy?","James W. Woodall","Yes, the Certegy gaming business on a stand-alone annualized basis is about $50 million. So depending on when we close, you have to model it out from there. We anticipate closing in April, so you can kind of model it out from there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I know Clear2Pay is Belgium-based, but I think they have a number of U.S. clients as well. So I guess my question is, how will Clear2Pay's ongoing revenue sort of be divvied up? I mean should we expect a boost in the payment segment growth rate related to the company's U.S.-based clients? Or am I correct that there are -- there is a sizable U.S. business?","James W. Woodall","About 25% of the revenue currently is U.S.-based. You're correct, we do anticipate that to accelerate as we bring it into our distribution channel, and push it through our relationships and sales channels. So we do anticipate that to increase. The business, from a segmentation standpoint, is aligned based on geography. So that 20% will flow through the Financial Solutions segment, and the balance of the non-U.S. business will flow into the international segment -- I'm sorry, in the payment segment -- payment segment and the balance into the international segment.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. I wanted to revisit the EMV question. How are your unit economics different on an EMV card versus a mag stripe card ? I mean, I would assume that the EMV card is going to have a much higher ticket. How does the both sort of -- both the unit revenue and profitability for EMV versus mag stripe differ?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, no, it's a great question. You're exactly right. The ticket price is much higher on EMV, so you're going to see a nice revenue opportunity or we will in that business. Our unit volumes are still a lot less than what our mag stripe is. So profitability will rise as our volumes rise in that business, but we feel comfortable that we'll be able to attain and maintain the current profit margins we have in that business going forward.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a perfunctory question around MCX, any new developments you can share, any incremental color? I know there was some media chatter about a potential data breach on their system during this beta period. That didn't touch you guys, I'm assuming. Anything you can share on MCX?","Gary A. Norcross","No, it didn't touch us at all. We heard the same chatter. I think it was around some e-mail issues, but it had no relation to us whatsoever. As far as the pilot we shared with you, the pilot last quarter, the pilot continues to progress, and I think they're on target for the dates they've described. So we feel -- we still feel good about the relationship and the ongoing opportunity.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Sashi Tanuku with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's actually Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. My congratulations as well to Frank and Gary. My question is on Capco. If you could talk about how they're doing stand-alone as well as in terms of continuing to pull new projects and new contracts into the mix.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, no, I appreciate you asking. In fact, just last week, I was out meeting with all of our Capco partners. The quick answer is the group really just couldn't be performing better. We feel great about that acquisition, and what they've been able to accomplish. We've seen very strong year-over-year growth. We're continuing to see the number of customers, so actually, the revenues being generated from a far greater client pool than in past. The partners and all of the teams are executing very well. We've now grown that business to over 3,000 consultants, and it's still split pretty evenly between Europe and the U.S., and we continue to see and expect great things out of that group going forward. The team's excited about the results. You've seen it now move from just base consulting where they used to have a very short term turnover to now. We've got a much longer-term revenue stream as we're signing up much longer-term services engagements, and we're also seeing opportunities as we are starting to bring some product in. So all of that, I would say, that's been a fantastic acquisition for us, Ashwin, and it's going to continue to contribute strategically to FIS.","Frank R. Martire","And all the metrics we put in place, they've exceeded every metrics that we've established for them, so quite pleased.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's good to hear. The second question I have, probably one of the more frequent questions I get from investors is with regards to margin improvement at FIS. And as we look at some of these earlier GFI-type contracts that you've signed, do you see the prospect for margin improvement in that portfolio because many of those contracts are either international or consulting led, which means that the early margins from those ought to be lower, but do you see margin improvement in that base for the earlier signed ones?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, no, we do, Ashwin. So if you think about our business and where we're focused, you've got our North American business that we talk about quite a bit. It's a one-to-many model. You see the margins we generate there, and we'll continue to see margin expansion. We're going to get greater margin expansion there than we will in our other markets. Our international market, you'll see it come into more of the middle of where you would expect in between the GFI and in between the North American business. You're going to see that margin expand as well. We've got the India ATM deal. We're well into that. You're starting to see volumes ramp, and with those volumes, you'll see margins continue to grow in that group, so we feel good about that. GFI, specifically, actually, as we've grown the consulting business -- you're right, it is a lower margin, but as we've grown that consulting business and brought on more scale in that consulting business, we've seen the team's done a very nice job in consulting growing those margins, the services deal as well, those long-term nature, those come in at higher margins than traditional consulting but still lower to the overall company. Those margins will continue to grow as well, and then you've got the product capability. So that's a long-winded answer to we do believe that all of our businesses, while they'll have different margin characteristics, they'll all grow in the future.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's good to hear. If I could squeeze in one question on security because that's another very frequent question, what we call the data breaches and all that kind of stuff. The -- I guess the basic question is cost of opportunity, right. I mean, you guys need to spend more on security. To what extent can you monetize as well from either a sales standpoint or pass-through standpoint?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, no, it's a great question, and we've talked about this in the past that there is no such thing as being secure, right? We see the rise in continued attacks across all the financial services. As you know, we've gone through an amazing investment cycle ourself over the last 3 years. So I would say the quick answer is, as you do that ramp, any organization in the early days, it is a cost. It does then translate, and we're seeing that now translate into an opportunity for us. I think, as you make those investments and as you implement those best practices, the reality is that drives continued success and drives more business on to our platform. So it went from the early stage for us as a cost to now we talk about it through our sales cycle. People see the investments we made, the benefits that can grow to the financial institution, and I think that's one of the things that's helping us with our sales success. Is it going to continue to escalate? The answer -- in other words, is the cost going to continue to escalate? The answer is yes, but I think it's on a much more normalized rate, right. So now, there is a big ramp for all IT services company, though, to have to get their environments to where, frankly, most of the new standards have risen to, and we feel comfortable we're there, but we also know we're going to have to continue to invest. This is going to be an ongoing diligence that we're going to have to focus on, but certainly, our customers are seeing the advantage of that investment. Frankly, our prospects are as well, and we think it's one of the things that's allowing us to continue to grow and take share in the markets we serve.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back over to Frank for closing comments.","Frank R.

In the quarter, our IFS segment signed several new competitive takeaways encompassing our core banking, digital, and payment solution offerings.","For example, a Midwest community bank with more than $9 billion in assets selected FIS to help advance its digital banking and payment strategy through our new online banking, bill pay, and mobile capabilities. A second smaller Midwestern community institution with more than $750 million in assets is converting to an FIS-integrated solution suite encompassing core banking, branch automation, and bill pay, to gain operational efficiencies and enhance its customer experience.","Our corporate and digital businesses had another solid quarter supported by both new client wins and increased user adoption. Continued adoption to digital solutions will provide ongoing opportunities for FIS, as financial institutions embrace transformational change to a new digital user experience. An example of this trend, and the power of combined FIS and SunGard, is the launch of our new digital corporate payment solution.","This new money movement delivery model for commercial customers combines assets from both organizations into a new integrated payable offering, eliminating the need for checks and wire transfers. Although still in early innings, we see strong opportunity for adoption of this solution replacing traditional paper and commercial payments in creating new revenue synergies for FIS. For the remainder of the year, our IFS segment will continue to focus on sales execution, cost containment, and investing in digital technologies and services that will drive differentiating value for our clients.","Our Global Financial Solutions segment also delivered a solid quarter. This was driven primarily by our international banking and payment solutions. Our Brazilian card processing business signed a significant new agreement with one of the country's leading banks to convert and process more than 2.3 million cards on our card processing platform. As expected, our institutional and wholesale business faced a difficult comparable, primarily driven by a large license renewal in Q1 of last year. We expect this business to continue its historical performance growth trend in the back half of the year.","As discussed last quarter, we are seeing ongoing success through the bundling of solutions creating new offerings from our I&W business. These new offerings will have cross-product capabilities, such as data integration and a common workflow and user experience. We expect them to drive additional contribution within this segment and as another example of our ability to drive revenue synergies through our combination. Demand for our risk and compliance IP solutions remained strong in the quarter.","This growth was underpinned by several new wins with top-tier institutions, including a leading bank located in the Middle East, with more than $180 billion in assets has selected an FIS solution bundle to enhance its assets, liability, liquidity, risk and capital management capabilities. In addition, a leading financial institution based in Asia Pacific is teaming with FIS to improve its risk management capabilities within its insurance line of business. Our derivatives utility continues to perform well since the on-boarding of our second major client last year. We continue to see strong interest in the utility and are encouraged by its long-term prospects.","For the remainder of the year, our GFS segment will continue to focus on sales execution, cost containment, and creating solution bundles to provide our buy and sell-side clients a differentiating advantage within their highly competitive marketplace.","Moving to slide 11, these results confirm that executing on our strategy, including integrating and repositioning the former SunGard businesses into FIS, is delivering the desired results. Steady execution, coupled with constant improvements in our cost structure and overall performance, remains our focus to drive continued earnings growth this year. Strategically, we are investing in the business to deliver long-term revenue growth and consistent shareholder returns. Our investment focus remains on expanding our broad array of IP-led solutions that drive both efficiencies and cost savings to create modern day, digitally-based user experiences across all our markets.","Before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I'd like to summarize by reemphasizing that we are very pleased with our first quarter results. These results stem from our large and loyal client base. A few weeks ago, we hosted our annual CONNECT client conference, showcasing for the first time our combined portfolio of banking and payments and institutional and wholesale solutions to our clients and partners. We nearly doubled the attendance from 2016, and we saw strong interest in our core modernization, digital experience, and cloud-based solution investments. This strong client interest, combined with our strong pipeline and Q1 performance, gives us confidence in achieving our full year results.","With that as a focus, we will continue driving our strategy forward, with decisive actions against our three growth levers to deliver sustained value to our clients and our shareholders. First, we will continue to execute on our multifaceted investment strategy to deliver new, differentiating capabilities leveraging digital technology and advanced analytics to help our clients better compete in a crowded marketplace.","Second, we will continue to capitalize on our expanded scale, operating leverage, and our disciplined integration to fuel growth. Third, our strong cash flow generation enables us to invest for growth, continue to pay down debt, and return capital to shareholders.","Woody will now provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on slide 9. In the first quarter, revenue increased to $2.3 billion, or 1.7% on an organic basis, and adjusted EBITDA grew to $682 million, a 7% increase compared to the prior year. This represents 200 basis points of margin expansion for the quarter, reflecting continued growth and higher-margin IP-led product sales and positive impacts from ongoing synergy actions. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $286 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.86 per share, compared to $0.79 per share in the prior year period.","In the first quarter, we reported GAAP revenue growth of 3.4%, which was higher than our organic growth of 1.7%. This was primarily driven by deferred revenue variance associated with the SunGard transaction and the impact of the public sector and education divestiture, which was completed in the first quarter of 2017. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates for the quarter was insignificant. A detailed bridge of revenue growth from GAAP to organic is included in the Appendix material.","Moving to slide 10, in the first quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions' organic revenue grew 1.5% to $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $442 million, an increase of 4.3% compared to the prior year. EBITDA margins improved 110 basis points to 39.2% for the quarter, driven primarily by improved revenue mix and continued cost management.","Turning to slide 11. Banking and wealth grew 1.3%, which was in line with our expectations, due to the previously discussed completion of the people-based risk project. Absent this short-term project, banking and wealth would have grown over 5%, and total IFS would have grown over 3%. Payments was essentially flat for the quarter, driven by the anticipated grow over (10:55) of EMV card production. As discussed on our previous calls, we expect these two headwinds to continue through the second quarter of 2017.","Corporate and digital grew a healthy 6.1%. Demand for these solutions remains robust. Also, as Gary mentioned, a new integrated payable solution, which was created by combining assets from FIS and SunGard, was a contributor to the growth.","Turning to slide 12. In the first quarter, Global Financial Solutions' organic revenue grew 3% to $1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $283 million, an increase of 12.8% compared with the prior year, resulting in 240 basis points of margin expansion. We are pleased with the consistent margin expansion in this segment, as higher-margin IP-led solutions are driving growth, and ongoing synergy integration efforts continue to positively impact our margin profile for this segment.","Moving to slide 13. Our institutional and wholesale business declined 1.5%, in line with our expectations. Growth was impacted primarily by our previously discussed difficult license comparable in our global trading solutions business. Banking and payments produced strong organic revenue growth of 9.2%, driven primarily by payment volumes. We continue to see positive results from our European and Asia-Pacific markets, and Brazil continues to perform better than our expectations. Consulting grew 3.5%, and we expect to continue to grow in the single digits for the remainder of the year.","Moving to slide 14. Revenue from our nonstrategic assets and Corporate and Other declined 6.6%. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we expect this segment to create approximately 1% of top-line headwind to consolidated organic revenue growth for the year. Corporate expenses were $70 million, a 7.4% decline from the prior year, driven by ongoing integration and cost management initiatives.","Moving to slide 15. For the quarter, free cash flow was strong at $363 million, or 127% conversion. We repaid $1 billion of debt in the quarter, resulting in $9.5 billion of debt outstanding as of March 31, with $2 billion of debt repayment since December 2015. We remain focused on debt reduction and deleveraging the balance sheet.","As we announced earlier this year, the board of directors approved a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend, and we paid $95 million to shareholders in the quarter. We ended the quarter with weighted average shares outstanding of 333 million on a fully diluted basis. As expected, and previously discussed, our non-GAAP effective tax rate decreased to 32% for the quarter.","Moving to slide 16, I would like to provide some color on our expectations for the second quarter. In the first quarter, the business performed above our original expectations. It also benefited from an additional $0.01 to $0.02 of earnings per share that were originally anticipated in the second quarter. Therefore, we expect the second quarter earnings results to be in the range of $0.96 per share to $0.98 per share.","We're very pleased with the start to the year and remain highly confident in our ability to meet our full year guidance. We are reiterating our 2017 outlook for organic revenue growth, EBITDA, and earnings per share. As Gary mentioned, we are also increasing our expectations of synergies and now expect to exit the year with a cost synergy run rate exceeding $300 million. We remain focused on consistently improving cash flow generation, deleveraging our balance sheet, investing for growth, and returning cash to shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. . Looks like our first question comes from the line of Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. A nice job.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And I guess my first question, you reiterated guidance, but it seems like things are a little ahead of schedule, the synergies you raised, and it looks like FX is probably a little less of a headwind. So I'm wondering, I guess, are you just trying to build a little conservatism or maybe some of the synergy is really far more into 2018 benefit than 2017. Maybe you can just talk through those \u2013 a few of those puts and takes.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. On the $300 million increase, Dave, I will tell you, more of that benefit is going to drive into 2018 based on the timing of when we see the synergies coming out. The second would be, not dissimilar to last year, we're off to a very good start, but one quarter doesn't make a year, but we feel very good about the full year outlook. We had a $0.04 beat, very clean beat in my view, and about $0.01 to $0.02 of that was really anticipated in the second quarter. So we pull the second quarter down slightly from market expectations, but feel very good about the start to the year and meeting our full year outlook.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Dave, just to add a little bit to that. That's exactly right. We feel very good about the year. But to Woody's point on synergies, as you can imagine, we've talked about this on multiple quarters. We're now in the phase of integrating our companies, where we're really into some of the heavy-lifting projects and so these take time. And so that naturally pushes us more towards the back half of the year. The easier synergies that come out more cleanly, obviously, have occurred and we're very focused on not wanting to break the business. So, all of those things would push that run rate to the latter part of the year in 2018.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then my one just follow-up. In Q1, you called out a bunch of headwinds and you gave us a heads-up on these going into the year. Is it fair to say in aggregate, all those headwinds were maybe a few percent, in that Q2 is to going to look a lot like Q1 with a few percent headwind pretty similar, kind of a couple percent organic growth in Q2?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I think that's a fair outlook. We'll continue to face similar headwinds in the second quarter. And then you'll see the acceleration in the back half of the year as we anniversary those comparables.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. Nice job.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Nice start to the year. Just wanted to touch on, Gary, first, what you're seeing in terms of the environment. Obviously, we came out of last year with seeing steeping yield curves and potential for a less regulation. In your client base, can you give us a sense on the feedback you are having about potential for incremental spending? I know a lot of this may come later in the year, but what kinds of projects are banks looking to do now? Is there a pick-up at all? Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Darrin, it's a great question. And I would tell you, a lot of our clients are very optimistic that we're going to see some regulatory pullback, and we're going to see some other changes by the current administration. But I think in general, everybody is in a wait-and-see mode. What I would tell you, though, is we had a very strong Q4 in sales. Q1, we had nice sales across the board with some strength definitely in our I&W space. So we're continuing to be bullish on the sales environment.","The team is executing well. Pipeline is full. We're not seeing any real impact from Brexit and some of the changes at this point in time. There are some other regulatory changes that are being implemented around the world that, frankly, could be a tailwind for us as well. So we're continuing to monitor those. But at this point in time, I would say from business environment, it's kind of business as usual and we see a slow steady strengthening that we saw last year.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just when we think about the puts and takes \u2013 I know this just came up from the prior question, but when you back out a lot of the noise, the comps, the tough comps and some of the items around licensing fees, et cetera, you're growing over, and you consider the opportunities you've been able to see around cross-selling now with SunGard. I know at your Investor Day you had talked about maybe coming in at the high-end of revenue range over time if you can executive more on cross-selling. Could you just give us a little more color on what the actual underlying run rate you see in the businesses? I mean, on your guidance obviously 2% to 3% (19:20), and then there is some onetime items even in that. So, is this a 4% grower right now in your mind in terms of top-line? And is there \u2013 have you been executing as well as you would have expected yet on any of those cross-selling initiatives?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I think the organic revenue growth that we outlined for the segments, which IFS at 3% to 4% for full year and GFS at 4% to 5%, are in line with where we anticipated. They're in line with sort of the multi-year guide on revenue growth, organic growth there, and that kind of pulls the noise out there.","The 4% to 5% in the GFS, there is a couple of things. One, we are seeing some cross-sell opportunities between pulling SunGard assets together, even within their existing business across silos that we're breaking down. And then we're seeing some rebound in our international business with 9.2% growth for the quarter and a good outlook for the year. So I think we're confident in the numbers, but feel like the ranges we outlined a couple of the years ago in May are still close to where we think we're going to land.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, adding a little bit to that. I think, Darrin, when you back up and really look at the overall SunGard integration, we came in, obviously, getting very focused on cost synergies, because those are in our control and executable fairly quickly. As you've seen, we're now guiding to exit the year with more than $300 million. So we \u2013 I would argue, we're ahead of where we thought we'd be at this point in time.","When I look across on upsell, we've started to see some good pull-through in the former SunGard businesses, where those two \u2013 where they had products that could be bundled together as a solution and sold to clients. And I would say that we're actually on target with that with some nice growth opportunities. The one that I would say that we're a little ahead of where we thought we'd be at this point would be we're starting to see now opportunities of bundling SunGard capabilities with former FIS capabilities, as I referenced in the commercial payment opportunity. And those are early stages, but we think could really be nice revenue growers for us in the future.","So will they make a difference in 2017? No. But as you start looking out in 2018 and beyond, that could easily give us \u2013 push us more towards the upside of our ranges as long as there are other macro issues that we're seeing, right? That wouldn't be a headwind.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's great to hear. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. (22:03) $180 billion asset bank you signed in the Middle East, I'd like to understand a little bit more, I guess, their rationale for picking FIS. I know you've long targeted kind of the mega banks and this looks like a good proof point of success there.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. David, we've actually had quite a bit of success in that region for the several years. I think what's really exciting about that one, it's a great example where, prior to the acquisition of SunGard, we would have come in and sold them one or two products. If you look at that lift of capabilities that we're delivering, that's the exact example I was just mentioning with Darrin, where we're literally bundling capabilities, and therefore, getting a much larger engagement because of it.","So what we're seeing in that size, there is a lot of banks are really looking for ways to \u2013 they're dealing with regulatory change worldwide, right? They're dealing with increasing costs and accelerators worldwide. They're all dealing with legacy platforms that need modernization. And if you look at that bundling that we just accomplished, you're now \u2013 an institution of that size is really transforming those capabilities to FIS to next-generation solutions on a bundled basis that allows them to lower their overall total cost of ownership. So it is a great example and a good success point of just the power of this combination.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Can you translate that success to mega banks in the U.S. with the SunGard cross-selling?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I think we will. I think what you're going to see is translate that globally, right? So what we're doing, as we put these companies together, one of the first things we did was we pulled the sales organizations directly out of the individual product lines. And when \u2013 we elevated them up on an enterprise basis, and then we modified the commission plans so they drive \u2013 so it actually incents cross-sell and upsell and this bundling capability. So we believe we're going to see more and more of that and every quarter, we're trying to give some real examples of that success.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Got it. Quick final question. You called out the 2.3 million accounts that Banco Bradesco just signed. What's the timing of that conversion?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We're going to on-board those accounts throughout 2017. It goes in two waves and so, yeah, it's good to see that our payment capabilities continue to grow in that country.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thanks very much.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff of Stephens. Your line is open.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Congrats on a nice start to the year.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","On the free cash, it came in really strong. Woody, is that sustainable through the year or is that a timing thing? Any sort of commentary on that? And then, did you \u2013 can you remind us if you gave us a free cash growth range or target range for the year?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, two things on there, Brett. One, we have a little bit of timing around cash taxes, so say with the PS&E sale. But the good news is, we saw good working capital management, good improvement in DSO, and continue to think we can drive some benefit there for the year. We've guided more of a long-term view around about 100% conversion rate. I would tell you we're looking a little north of that in our forecast right now. Again, early in the year, but very pleased with cash generation right now.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then, in the Corporate segment, we've had some questions about trying to model the disposition of the PS&E. Is the run rate that we're \u2013 or the number that we saw in 1Q, compared to going forward, kind of how should we model that on a quarterly basis, both from a revenue and a profit point of view? I just want to make sure that we, on the Street, get that model right.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, try to give you some color around that. We did $111 million in the first quarter. PS&E had been about a $240 million a year contributor. We had one month in January. So if you pull that out, you're probably in a $90 million or so, Brett, of ongoing per quarter revenue. We think our corporate expenses are going to be in that $70 million zone, maybe ticking down slightly over the course of the year. So I think that gives you some color around what we think. As you know, we continue to have some headwinds in that area, based on the check business and our commercial services business that we talked about on the previous call, but that should give you some color around how to model that.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos of Cowen. Your line is open.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to start off, the strong margins and the outperformance that we saw in IFS on the margin side. Woody, maybe you can kind of bucket for us how much of that was synergy-related versus some of the more favorable revenue mix and some other things that drove the upside?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I would tell you, it was a little less on the synergy side. As you might imagine, we don't see as much synergies coming out of the IFS group as we do GFS, where more of the SunGard assets landed. But we certainly are seeing improved revenue mix. One of the items in banking and wealth that was a headwind was the people-based risk project that we talked about. Absent that, the remaining IP-led growth is driving higher incremental margin. So those are really the two components. Obviously, revenue mix being the larger driver, with a smaller driver in integration and cost management.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then, just as a quick follow-up. The $0.01 to $0.02 pull-forward from 2Q, is that all synergy-related, or is there anything else going on there? Thank you.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We had a small term fee we anticipated to close in Q2. It closed in Q1 instead. That's just under $0.01, was the primary item. And then just continued better cost management was probably the other.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just maybe overall, I'm curious just if there's a way to quantify TCV versus expectations in the quarter, because you did give a few nice wins like Brazil. Just curious overall how that came in versus plan.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Tien-Tsin, overall, we had a strong sales quarter. One of the nice things about our company is, we've got a very diversified revenue stream. So it allows us \u2013 as some things might have a soft quarter, other areas we're seeing areas where it picks up. But overall, the quarter was strong in sales. Our IFS business had a little slower start to the year, but frankly, that's coming off a very strong Q4. So that would be in line with what we expected. The institutional and wholesale business and the GFS businesses actually had a very nice quarter. So in balance it was a strong start to the year.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And just on the pull-forward, I know you just gave the $0.01 was term fee. Did you say which \u2013 Woody, which segment that was in? Just from a modeling standpoint, where we should think about 2Q versus 1Q there?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes, there were two small term fees, one in GFS, one in IFS. They aggregated to just under $0.01.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. It's relatively balanced. Thank you.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Gary, if you could start-off in terms of the outlook you see for client consolidation in the bank space. Clearly, with rates going up, it seems like there's a little bit more deal activity happening. So maybe give us your view on whether you expect any acceleration in terms of that? And then maybe, Woody, if you can little set us for what your expectations for total term fees this year is.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, on consolidation, Jim, it's a good question. We continue to see, frankly, record levels at least from a historical context throughout last year, and we've modeled that essentially throughout this year as well. I don't know that I necessarily see it accelerating somewhat dramatically. Although I do think deal flow and consolidation is going to be very strong throughout the industry, especially from a U.S. standpoint. That's going to maintain unless we see some recovery in the de novo activity, which right now there's little indication that you're going to see rapid acceleration there. So we've modeled consistent consolidation as last year, but with no real reduction.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","On the term fees, I think we gave some color that we would anticipate term fees to go back in line with sort of traditional norms, which I would tell you are in about $40 million to $50 million range. We're still forecasting and believe that's the right outlook. That's what we had in our plan and that's what we still see as the outlook right now as $40 million to $50 million full year.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, can you maybe talk a little bit about the pipeline you see for the Capco business? I know you talked about the 3% growth in the quarter and expecting to see similar trends for the year. Do you see a pipeline of new business in the consulting area building, such as you get to maybe high single digits by the end of the year, or is that too soon to call?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Jim, we're very pleased where we are with the turnaround of Capco. Lance and his team has done a great job of really transforming that back to traditional consulting. We see a very robust pipeline ahead of us. But we \u2013 as we've talked about on other calls, we're looking for that business to perform in that mid-single-digit kind of range this year and we think that's going to continue throughout the year. But we're very pleased with how the business has been performing. It performed well in Q4, well in Q1, and the pipeline looks really good. We have line of sight into a little outside of 90 days. Our book-to-bill is running very consistently. So the team is doing a very nice job with that business.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your digital initiatives. Any particular products you could highlight and how are you capitalizing on some of the opportunities there?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Joe, it's a great question. We're doing a lot in digital. Certainly, when you think about lot of our legacy platforms, many of them are in various stages of transformational with some kind of digital enablement context to them. We started originally several years ago in the whole mobile banking arena. We continue to see mobile digital banking grow very nicely for us. I highlighted that in the call, but your point is dead on.","Other legacy systems, as we're going through the transformation process, we've got a number of core banking initiatives going on. We've got a number of payment-based initiatives going on. We've got a number of institutional and wholesale initiatives going on. And all of them are leveraging our digital frameworks that we produced in the company. And that also bring us nice synergies as we go through that development pipeline. But over the next several years, you're going to see a lot of transformation on our platforms and most of those, if not all of them, will some have some kind of digital component to them.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. And just as a follow-up. I know it's a little early, but any thoughts on bank budgets for the second half of this year and heading into 2018, particularly around interest rates and regulations? Is there any loosening up of budgets? And do you expect any improvement in the back half of the year? Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We do see some improvement in the back half of the year. A lot of that's due to comparables in the first half. I would say, in general, there is a general sense across our clients of interest in growing and expanding spend. Several of them are in a wait-and-see mode though, as I've discussed earlier on another question. A lot of the things impacting would be significant regulatory reform, and they really are watching for that.","With that being said, as interest rates continue to go up and NIM continues to expand, dollars are available. So we're making sure that we're selling into that in the appropriate way and the sales teams are aligned around certain areas where clients have really been holding back over the years. But I think, frankly, we'll see a lot of this be more of a benefit in 2018 and beyond. I think it's just still early to determine what truly will be the regulatory pull-back, if any, what truly will be some of the changes, and that will take a while for the industry to digest and then free-up their budgets.","Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Condra, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And I just, I guess, wanted to get an update on the deleveraging just because it seems like it's progressing nicely. And so where do you think you'll be by the end of the year in terms of leverage? And maybe update on capital allocation and share repurchase thoughts.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, very pleased with cash generation, again. That coupled with the proceeds on the PS&E sale, we paid down $1 billion in debt in the first quarter, real pleased with that. As we've outlined before, we anticipate repaying all maturing and pre-payable debt in 2017. That will continue to deleverage the balance sheet. We added some color that we would anticipate being below $9 billion of outstanding debt by the end of the year and, obviously, above $3 billion in EBITDA. So you're looking at a sub-3 turns, working our way back towards that 2.5 times we've talked about. I would tell you, we won't get all the way there by the end of 2017, but we're probably going to end up in 2.75, 2.8 zone based on our projections right now.","Based on the timing of cash flow and the repayment timing of the debt, we do anticipate having excess cash in the back half of the year really approaching the fourth quarter. And we would look at that excess cash and try to find the best way just to drive shareholder value at that time. That could be a use and do share buyback could be inorganic, but we'll certainly have excess cash in the back half of 2017 and flowing into 2018.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on the GFS and the banking and payments, a good step-up in growth there and I was curious just to get your thoughts on how sustainable you think that is and maybe you can just kind of dive into the drivers there in a little more detail.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. The driver is really around payment volumes across Europe, across Asia-Pacific and into Latin America, We saw very good growth across all three of those. Our outlook right now shows us being a sustainable sort of a high single-digit kind of growth area for us this year. So feel very good about the start and the outlook in GFS banking and payments world.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Any issues with \u2013 any political issues in Brazil? Any kind of hiccups you're expecting or anything?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","We've really haven't seen any impact. We're, obviously, continuing to monitor that. Brazil continues to be in a very difficult economic crisis, and I was recently down there, a number of us were down there meeting with our clients. They're, like a lot of our financial institutions around the world, though, trying to deal through that, but also focused on how do I modernize my platforms? How do I roll out next-generation capabilities? Because while that's going on, the market evolves and consumer behavior evolves, so it's important to capitalize on those even during difficult times. So we're working with our clients down there, but the quick answer is we haven't seen any impact through geopolitical.","Paul Condra - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Next question from the line of Chris Shutler of William Blair. Your line is open.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","In institutional wealth, I know there was a tough comp, but it seems like that number is maybe a little lighter than you were expecting. Can you walk through what numbers would have looked like without the tough licensing comp? What you're expecting for Q2? And what kind of line of sight you have into the back half, given that Q4 is a pretty heavy license quarter?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I'd start out with, I think it was exactly in line with our expectations. If you pulled out the comp, it would have been a little over 2% growth for the quarter, and full year, we still think that's going to be in line with overall GFS growth, in that 4% to 5% zone. And it's, again, actually performing better than the original pro forma on the acquisition model. So, very pleased with it, absolutely in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, and I just want to clarify one thing, Chris. You're exactly right, Q4 is a heavier license quarter. But keep in mind, I mean, we've got license fees that flow throughout the year in this business. And so, we've said multiple times, this business will be a little more lumpy than what you've traditionally seen in the past out of FIS. It's still all IP-led, so profit margins are very high. But depending on when those license fees flow, you might get a little more lumpiness quarter-on-quarter. But all-in-all, as Woody said, it's performing exactly to expectations and, frankly, performing well ahead of where we modeled.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for the color. And then, secondly, on the SunGard cost synergies, can you just give us some sense what level of, in your cost saves, you're expecting to see this year? I think we had that number pegged around $100 million, just want to make sure that we're thinking about that neighborhood correctly.","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I think that was a fair number. As we increased the number to $300 million from a run rate perspective, a vast majority of that benefit is going to flow into 2018. So I think you're in the ballpark there.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Hi, Gary. Hi, Woody. Good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good start for the year. You had two \u2013 at least a couple of quarters of pretty solid sales growth, partially driven by digital. The question really is, is that digital growth incremental to overall growth, or is that partly a replacement to prior branch-related work? And if you could talk a little bit about the conversion of bookings to revenues, is that a similar cadence to traditional work?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yes, let me start with the cadence question. Typically, the cost of our sales are so IP-led that traditional 6 to 12 months of on-boarding cycle is fairly traditional across most, if not all, of our products. So, whether we highlight digital growth or something over an institutional wholesale, that on-boarding time period is pretty consistent. So, strong sales would be a precursor, obviously, for the future, at that 6, 9, 12 months out.","Your first question relating to, is digital really replacing branch automation, we definitely \u2013 in branch work, what I would tell you is, we definitely see consistent accelerated sales around digital platforms, and we definitely see adoption around digital platforms, and all of those, as you would expect, have those product lines and those business lines growing at a much faster rate than the overall company.","Is it at the sacrifice of traditional branch work? I wouldn't point to that, that's where it's all coming from. I would just say, more of our customers are focusing on more of the digital experience and how to drive that self-service mentality on the retail side through the consumer base.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And a couple of questions have been asked already about potentially higher levels of spending later in the year heading into 2018, because of regulatory and yield curve, higher interest rate, things like that. I'm more concerned about the nature of spend, of course, when banks, of course, loosen up their purse strings, what kind of spend do you expect to be? Is it going to be a little bit more professional services, more discretionary, or what are your conversations like today?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, I think it all depends on the segment, right? So when you start looking at GFS, I do think, as those purse strings start to expand, you're going to see two primary spends. You are going to see in-house developed software, where you're going to look for customers looking for more leveraged, modern, transformative capabilities, and we've given several examples in today's call. So, where they're just not going to be able to modernize their internally built software. We're also going to see some of those customers, who are running some of our legacy solutions, want to modernize those platforms. So that would naturally drive more into the PS realm. The first example I gave would drive more in the product realm.","In the IFS world, really, there's very little professional services. We've highlighted a couple of times some of the people-based businesses that exist in IFS, but they're really small in nature to the overall percentage. So, almost everything there comes in the form of product and product-related on-boarding. Typically, in that market, heavily weighted towards outsourcing, as you know, which is what we've seen in some of the margin expansions that Woody and I both have highlighted today.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. If I can sneak in one last one. Given the positive start to the year and I understand it's a little bit of the 1Q versus 2Q timing. But just given the positive start and the demand profile that's building and such, would you say that you are potentially more comfortable with maybe the upper part of the range that you'd given or is that \u2013 I mean, is that a fair comment?","James Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Look, I'd tell you, Ashwin, we are pleased with the start of the year. We went into the year with high levels of confidence and being able to make the ranges we outlined to the market. I would tell you, we continue to be highly confident in the levels of ranges we outlined to the market, and are pleased with the start to the year.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Absolutely.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thought I'd ask. Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you for your questions today and for your continued interest in FIS. Our deep focus in investment and financial services is allowing us to drive change in the industry. Our expanded scale, operating leverage, and investment focus on IP-led solutions that drive efficiencies, cost saving and transformation align to current client demand and are driving shareholder value.","I'd like to thank our leaders and our more than 57,000 employees for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Pete Gunnlaugsson. Please go ahead, sir.","Pete Gunnlaugsson - SVP-Corporate Finance & Investor Relations","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Turning to slide two, Gary Norcross, President and Chief Executive Officer, will begin with a business summary. Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with the financial results for the quarter. Today's news release and supplemental slide presentation are available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Please turn to slide three. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the Safe Harbor language.","Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide more meaningful comparisons between the periods presented. These non-GAAP measures are outlined on slide three as well. Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release and in the appendix of the supplemental slide presentation.","With that, I will turn the call over to Gary to discuss the second quarter financial highlights on slide five. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Starting on slide five, we finished the quarter with reported revenue of $1.6 billion, which is an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis and delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 while returning $224 million to shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned $447 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","We continue to invest for growth in order to consistently deliver shareholder returns and generate significant reoccurring revenue. We saw strong deal closure in the quarter and continue to drive long-term client relationships. We are pleased with the recent restructuring and re-segmentation of our business, which has allowed us to align our service and solution portfolio to address clients' unique business challenges. As we discussed in the first quarter call, we continue to experience lower than expected termination fees in 2015. This is a positive long-term outcome. Our earnings per share for the second quarter were better than expected and we remain on track with our current guidance for the year.","Moving to slide six, I'll speak to our segment activity in the quarter. As a reminder, our two segments were created to meet the demands of two distinct markets driven by different buying behaviors and growth profiles. These segments allow us to more effectively sell, deliver, and support the clients in these distinct markets. The Integrated Financial Solutions segment is comprised of U.S. financial institutions seeking comprehensive, integrated, and outsourced solutions. This segment drives high higher reoccurring revenue, generates significant cash flow and drives higher margins with expansion through increased leverage.","Our Global Financial Solutions segment is comprised of large global and international clients seeking tailored solutions leveraging a combination of products, consulting and professional services. This segment typically drives lower margin and has a higher revenue growth profile. In the quarter, IFS had 89% of its revenue recurring. Deal closure in IFS was solid this quarter with many new wins.","FIS was chosen by Pacific Western Bank, a $17 billion financial institution, to replace its retail and commercial banking platform including core processing, commercial lending, consumer and business ebanking, digital, mobile, EFT, item processing and branch technology. This decision was driven by the bank's desire to better position itself for future growth. And another long-term agreement, a $70 billion regional bank chose FIS to provide an end-to-end consumer loan servicing solution. This solution better positions the bank to grow and service its lending business.","Also UMB, an $18 billion institution, made the decision to partner with FIS on its loan portfolio. Moving for the first time from an internally hosted platform to an FIS-hosted processing model to gain processing efficiencies and more robust lending functionality.","Finally, we signed several new digital banking and payments agreements, including one with Centennial Bank, an $8 billion community bank, who was seeking a new strategic technology partner in support of the bank's initiative to upgrade its digital channels including consumer and business ebanking as well as wire automation solutions. All of these wins demonstrate our ability to capitalize on increasing industry demands for solutions that enhance an institution's ability to meet its strategic growth and operational goals.","Turning to our Global Financial Solutions segment, revenue increased 8% on a constant currency basis. We continue to invest for growth in this segment and continue to see steady progress in signing long-term deals. Deal closure was solid as we continue to benefit from the demand for our solutions.","In Asia, we saw strong growth from continued expansion of our core banking and payments presence across the region. During the quarter, we continued to expand existing relationships as well as sign multiple new engagements resulting in a growth rate of 29% on a constant currency basis for the quarter. In Europe, we continue to see new opportunities in the emerging challenger bank market. In the quarter, FIS became the strategic technology partner for the newly announced Atom Bank, the UK's first digital-only based bank. We also signed another significant agreement with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, the leader in consumer credit business in the Netherlands, expanding our existing relationship through the addition of real-time core processing capabilities.","In North America, a Top 10 U.S. bank signed a multiyear software and services deal to utilize FIS's leading consumer lending product. This continues to solidify our advanced loan system as the leading consumer lending package in large progressive banks throughout the world.","Turning to slide seven. I'd like to summarize the quarter before I turn it over Woody for the financial report. We continue to grow revenue and return cash to shareholders. The restructuring and re-segmentation of our business has allowed us to achieve operational efficiencies, leverage our scale globally, and better align our services and solutions to address clients' business challenges. We are confident that our proven execution and deep client relationships will continue to enable us to invest for growth, maintain the strength of our balance sheet, and return value to our shareholders.","Woody will now provide details around the Q2 performance. Woody?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on slide nine with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the second quarter, as expected, we continued to face difficult comparisons. Consolidated revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA was $453 million, and the EBITDA margin was 28.5%. Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $211 million for the quarter, and $397 million for the first six months of 2015.","Adjusted earnings per share was $0.74 for the second quarter. Our highly recurring revenue model combined with several new wins Gary mentioned earlier helped us make consistent overall results despite the continued low termination fees, increased investment in European capabilities and FX headwinds, particularly in Brazil and Europe. FX translation held back revenue by $63 million for the quarter and EPS by $0.03.","Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 per share for acquisition related purchase price amortization, $0.03 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs and a $0.25 per share gain related to the previously announced divestiture of our Gaming business. This sale generated $238 million in pre-tax proceeds.","We are continuing to provide certain check guarantee services to the buyer and accordingly are not treating this divestiture as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes.","I will now continue on slide 10 for second quarter segment results. In the second quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue was $969 million, which was flat to prior year revenue. EBITDA was $378 million, which was also flat to 2014. EBITDA margins were 39%, a slight drop of 20 basis points. This margin decline primarily reflects continued low termination fees, which were $14 million lower than the prior year period.","In IFS, year-to-date term fees are lower than 2014 by $42 million. As we've discussed in the past, lower acquisition related term fees have an immediate impact in terms of difficult comparisons, but create longer term value as we retain profitable long-term relationships with our clients.","Normalizing the quarter for one-time items including divestiture activities and lower term fees, IFS revenue growth would've been 3.6%, speaking to the strength of the underlying business.","Turning to slide 11. As you saw in the first quarter, the IFS business consistently produces strong recurring revenues with diverse offerings to deliver consistent performance within the segment. IFS again produced 89% recurring revenue.","Our Payment Solutions revenue was down 3%, this was driven by lower pass-through revenues, divestitures and pricing pressure, partially offset by transaction volume growth. Business Solutions revenue grew 5%, primarily driven by card production activities. Banking Solutions revenue were flat compared to the prior year driven by the difficult comparisons discussed earlier.","Turning to slide 12, in the second quarter, Global Financial Solutions' reported revenue was $619 million. The second quarter reported results for GFS reflect a negative foreign currency translation revenue impact of $63 million. The majority of FX translation impact was concentrated in the Brazilian real and euro.","On a constant currency basis, GFS revenue grew 8% for the quarter and 8% for the first half of 2015. As anticipated, we continue to see a strong U.S. dollar for the back half of 2015 and FX translation will continue to be a headwind.","Global Financial Solutions EBITDA was $123 million compared to $126 million in the prior period. EBITDA was $135 million or 7% higher on a constant currency basis in the second quarter 2015 compared to the prior year period. EBITDA margins were 19.8% compared to 20% in the prior year period.","Moving to slide 13. Year-to-date 2015, 70% of GFS revenues were recurring in nature consistent with historical performance. For the second quarter, Asia Pacific had strong revenue growth of 29% on a constant currency basis driven primarily by our expanding core banking and payments presence in India. As Gary described, we are pleased with several new signings, and the ability for the team to expand existing relationships in the region. We expect the Asia-pacific region to continue to be a strong grower for GFS. Europe grew 25% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by our continued success with the challenger banks in the UK, revenue growth from Clear2Pay, and consulting revenue growth.","We also expanded an already meaningful relationship with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole. In the North American region, the GFS revenues were $277 million, compared to $287 million in the prior year period. The primary driver of the change was our previously announced non-renewal of a contract discussed in Q1.","As Gary mentioned, the underlying business had some nice wins, including a large deal, in our end-to-end lending solutions. As expected, Latin America revenue growth remains modest due to macroeconomic conditions in Brazil. When we resegmented the company, in the first quarter, corporate functions directly supporting IFS and GFS, were moved into the individual segment results. Residual corporate expenses were $48 million for the quarter.","We expect corporate expense to trend down in the back half of the year, as we continue to focus on cost actions to improve profitability. Other income, included a gain on the sale of an investment of $7 million. The effective tax rate was 33.4% for the quarter compared to 30.2% for the prior year quarter. As previously mentioned, the prior year quarter included an approximate $0.04 EPS benefit due to a discrete tax benefit.","We continue to reinvest in the business, adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $197 million in the second quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $117 million resulting in free cash flow of $79 million for the quarter.","The $117 million in capital expenditure is higher than normal, primarily due to the timing of certain investments. For the year, we expect capital expenditures to be in line with our previous guidance of 5% to 6% of revenue. We still anticipate full-year free cash flow to approximate net earnings.","For the quarter, we returned $224 million to shareholders, approximately $150 million was returned to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.3 million shares in the open market at an average cost of $64.36 per share. The share repurchase program resulted in our weighted average diluted share count of 284.4 million. Basic shares outstanding at the end of the period were 280 million, approximately $1.2 billion remain on our existing purchase authorization program.","In addition, we returned $74 million to shareholders through dividends. Maintaining a strong balance sheet remains a key component of our capital allocation strategy. As of June 30, debt outstanding was $5 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of approximately 2.7 times debt to EBITDA. This is slightly above our targeted 2.5 times leverage ratio based primarily on the timing of cash flows. We expect our leverage ratio to be at 2.5 times by the end of the year. The weighted average interest rate was 3% at the end of the quarter.","Moving to slide 15, our sales execution in the quarter was a tailwind to our Q2 results, a few of the deals were signed more quickly than originally planned, helping to flatten out our back half of the year growth curve. For the full year 2015, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3%, margin expansion for the full year of approximately 50 basis points, 2015 adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.27 to $3.37, which is a 6% to 9% increase over 2014, and we expect full-year free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And first go line with David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Good morning, Gary and Woody.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, David.","Pete Gunnlaugsson - SVP-Corporate Finance & Investor Relations","Good morning, David.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Could you talk about the drivers of second half revenue in earnings acceleration, clearly given the earnings pre-release back in April, it's a back half weighted year, so maybe if you could address the drivers, and how much visibility do you have in those drivers both in terms of revenue growth and any expense initiatives, that would be helpful?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We think about it in four buckets, David, as we've been talking about. Primarily, we've got natural acceleration in the first half versus the second half. If you look over the past four years or so, that's been probably 3% first half versus second half, in terms of accelerated growth. The second would be term fees as we talked about. Term fees in the first half this year were about $42 million lower than last year. We do anticipate more term fees in the back half of the year and have pretty good visibility into them. Reiterating that, low term fees is a good thing for us, long-term. It does create some lumpiness, but it is a good thing for us long-term.","The third would be the cost actions. The cost actions that we took in the first quarter, you've seen some of that kick-in, in terms of the margin, in terms of the profitability growth, and we've got more cost levers in the back half if sales execution does doesn't come where we need to be. And then the fourth would be our contract delay that we mentioned in the fourth quarter as it's gotten back on track, you saw some lift in Q2 from it and we believe we'll see further lift in the second half of the year. So those are really the four main drivers, David, and we've got pretty good visibility into them, particularly on the cost lever side.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. Just as a follow-up, within GFS you mentioned 29% growth in Asia-Pacific. Is that primarily the ramp up of the India ATM contract? And if it is, how is that performing relative to your expectations?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, David, the Indian ATM contract is performing very well. We're very pleased with the team. We're very pleased with the rollout of the ATMs. As volumes continue to grow, that'll continue to be a tailwind for years in the future. But to answer your question, it's a combination of all the above. Frankly, it's the India contract, the team continues to do very well signing new agreements. We announced the signing of Bandhan. They're coming online, so there is just a lot of growth. Mahila continues to grow. We also do some very nice \u2013 we've done some nice add-on services to some of our existing clients in Thailand that we've announced around some of the channel operations.","So the team is executing very well. So it's really a combination of prior agreements, but it's also a combination of continued strong sales quarter-in and quarter-out in that region.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Quick final question. Big bank progress relative to your expectations when you stepped up investment about a year ago, Gary, where are you relative to your plan?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think as we mentioned in the first quarter, we've been disappointed with the results of that ramp-up to-date, but I would continue to say we continue to see signs of traction throughout. We announced as I said a Top 10 bank this quarter that pulled our consumer lending platform and that's huge to see a bank in that size transform all their consumer lending. So we see some bright spots in the execution, David. We're going to continue to monitor it.","As we said in the first quarter, we took that opportunity when we weren't seeing the product pull through that we necessarily wanted, we restructured the company and actually brought two major divisions together. We've seen some nice synergies come through that and operating efficiencies that Woody pointed to in the back half. But would I tell you we wouldn't do the investment again? No I wouldn't. It's an important market for us, being able to penetrate our product and services in those markets is going be a long-term success criteria at FIS. So, this quarter showed a number of good signs of product pull throughs.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hey guys, nice job getting back on track here.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dave.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And I guess my first question you called out, so within IFS, the banking part of that was flattish and you called out the headwinds from term fees, but in Q1 it was up 12% year-over-year and yet some of those same headwinds that might have even been a little bigger, so I guess just wondering why that decelerated so much?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think what you've got is an anniversering of some acquisition activity, Dave, that we saw benefit the first quarter, that anniversaries into the second quarter. So, that's really what you're seeing in terms of there. The slide 11 that you're looking at is a pure growth number, not necessarily an organic growth number. So, it included the Reliance Trust acquisition and CMSI in the first quarter, you didn't see in Q2.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, no that totally makes sense. And then how soon are we to having all three of those components, and I guess really the underlying question there is when is Payments going to turn positive again, do you have kind of insight into that?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well, I mean if you look at it, Dave, frankly, we've gotten a lot of noise going on in Payments, the term fees has hit significantly there in the quarter. We actually have had an accounting change, where Woody mentioned about our pass through revenues, so you've got some gross to net issues going on in there, and you've also got some compression. But, if you normalize all that, we think we'll see Payments can return to a low single-digit growth rate going into next year, and then accelerate beyond that. Also, keep in mind, we also had the divestiture of Gaming that was in that \u2013 in that quarter as well, that's in that number.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So Gaming did have some of a negative impact already in Q2?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It did.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We closed that June the 1, so you saw a little bit of negative there, again the pass throughs as well, and some level of price compression that we saw there. Now, the positive around this, we were offset by some transaction volume growth...","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...we were happy to see. We had about 2% growth in our overall transaction volume growth, you can see in some of the charting data that we've started to provide.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great, okay, and then just lastly, I know, last quarter, you gave us some context on Q2 given, the Street numbers at the time were a little too high. You didn't really call out Q3, are you basically saying that, the Street is at least, in the ballpark of kind of what you'd expect for Q3 and then Q4?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we were really clear on Q2 and Q1 when we came through this year because of just some of the deltas where you guys were versus what we were seeing in the term fees and the impact. We've got a pretty good ramp in the second-half as we've all talked about. But, I think, we're more aligned where our heads are as to what the back half of the year looks like.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Well nice job, thanks a lot.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, thanks Dave.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","The next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please, go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning guys, how are you?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Brett.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Two quick questions. I think you addressed the IFS question, so I won't ask that one. But in terms of margins, I sort of have two questions. One is, the margins are really good, especially given a tough revenue quarter, actually in both segments, so I wonder if you guys could address that and talk about, is that just sort of base incremental margins or is that cost cuts or sort of parse that out for us. And then number two, the second part of that question is, tell us about the incremental margins as we go into 3Q and 4Q, because again that \u2013 just addressing that back half ramp and profitability sort of implies really good incremental. So give us some comfort how we're going to see those incrementals pass through.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think, Dave, you did see a couple things in the second quarter. You saw some pull forward of deals into the second quarter. Those were a little higher licensing, which was helpful in terms of the margin profile. You are seeing some of our cost actions start to kick in, that are driving some incremental margin benefit, to answer your first question. To answer your second question, when you look at the back half of the year, a significant component of the back of the year growth is both in term fees, which we talked about, it's going to have very high incremental margins and the majority of the cost actions are driving benefit in the second half of the year.","As you heard me talk about trending corporate expenses down as well as and the operations are driving some expense reduction as well. Both of those will help drive margin in the back half of the year, giving us some confidence in that 50 basis points for the full year.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's all I needed. Thank you.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right.","Operator","Our next question is from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So \u2013 I appreciate the color that you guys gave back half, because that clearly is sort of the elephant in the room with regards to your acceleration. If I just look at normal first half to second half acceleration, I mean typically you guys do 46%, 47% of your revenues of your EPS in the first-half, and this year it looks more like 42%. So that's about a $0.27 gap to $0.27-$0.28 gap to the middle of your range, and I'm kind of wondering, I get $0.08, $0.09 of that from term fees impact, is the remainder of it cost action and what specific cost action are you taking that is going to have that sort of a benefit?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You've got two items outside of that, you're right on the natural acceleration. We believe it's there, we do have the term fees that we've talked about; so you've got that captured in correctly. The cost actions we've taken some cost actions in Q1, you saw some further cost actions in Q2, to the extent we don't see the sales execution that we're looking for, we'll potentially take further cost actions. We have other levers within our cost structure.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's right.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That could help us continue to make sure we maintain the profitability guidance, Ashwin, and protect the profitability guidance that we've given the marketplace. So those are the kind of the three big ones. The fourth would be to back to our contract delay. We've got some milestones that we'll meet in the back-half of the year in one of those larger deals that will add some incremental earnings per share as well. You add the four of those together, that is the bridge to the back-half of the year. It is a steep curve, but we are pleased with first, I mean second quarter, as we saw a little bit of the flattening of that curve, as we brought some extra EPS into the quarter.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We've also got a number of key deals, Ashwin, that we've signed as you know, given the nature of our long-term revenue streams and the high reoccurring revenue. Our deals that we sign also take often times a number of months or even greater than a year to onboard and so, you are seeing some of those large deals that we've signed historically that we've talked about come online. You can start seeing that in some of the numbers we've actually disclosed for like IFS, et cetera, where we've got some large core banking deals that have been coming on. So all of those things to Woody's point, the levers that help us control our expense line and profitability line and also just new sales and the on-boarding of prior sales, all give us some confidence going into the back half.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I guess one thing I don't understand is the term fee. How can you have visibility into term fees? I mean you can't possibly know what contract is going to terminate because of M&A or something like that. So is there a contract of size that, that you've lost or something like that because of M&A, could you provide some color there?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Actually, some of the term fees, we've already been notified on Ashwin.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Exactly.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But they are awaiting regulatory approval. So you've got an idea in working with the customer as to when the de-conversion time horizon would be, when you'd actually see them go away. So we do have some visibility into those term fees already. Your point is valid, on others we don't have every dollar lined up or have been notified on every dollar, but we do have pretty good visibility into a large chunk of those based on the conversion timeframe that the customer is looking at.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, as you mentioned, these termination fees are strictly related to financial institutions getting acquired or consolidating. So to Woody's point, we have to be given \u2013 we have \u2013 we're given notice, because we've got work to do to help them de-convert as they move on to their acquiring platform, which is the typical situation. We've had some situations where it's come the opposite direction that we've discussed on prior calls, but we get some pretty good visibility and typically, this is something that can get modeled pretty easily. What we were surprised by in the first half of the year is that, we didn't get that notification, which as we've said now multiple times that's a great outcome for the company, because we're retaining a very profitable client that's going to be buying more products and services from us.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Understood. One last question on Clear2Pay with regards to that acquisition, if you could provide an update on how that's progressing, what the client feedback is, and what the product roadmap is?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We've actually gotten some great response through that acquisition. As always, we put forward a very aggressive pro forma around growth as we accelerate it through our sales engine. We also put, always an aggressive target to make sure that we get the synergies necessary as we put \u2013 integrate these companies into our company. And I'll tell you we're right on plan on both of those. Pipeline is very strong, good deal closures, quarter-in, quarter-out, response from the clients have been very positive.","As we talked about we did that acquisition, one of the things that resonated us most was Clear2Pay, especially with their open payment framework, was the fact that they were already penetrating many of the Tier 1s through a single payment type around the world. And so what the opportunity there is, is you penetrate with a particular payment type, say ACH, and then you come in, and you add wires you add other types through the open payment framework. So we're very pleased with this acquisition at this point. It's integrated very cleanly into the company. GFS has done a good job of accelerating the product growth rate by putting it through our sales engine. So right now, it's still early, but we would say we are very pleased.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just wanted to ask on the \u2013 Good morning. I just wanted to ask on the \u2013 I think that you said that some deals signed earlier than expected. Is that related to the investments and other things that you're pushing, just curious what maybe drove that and how you feel just in general about accelerating pipeline and backlog conversion?","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, no, it's a good point, it is part of the investment. We feel very good about our deal closure. Year-to-date frankly when we look at total contract value on a new total contract value, we're up 10% over 2014 at this point in time. Frankly, if you adjust it for currency, that's greater than \u2013 that grossed around 15%; so we feel very good about it. From that standpoint our pipeline is very strong, and we are opportunistic of the opportunities as I've said on multiple cost, Tien-Tsin.","I look for deal flow through our pipeline, you're not going to be able to sign them all, but are we having really good deal churn and are we making sure that our sales teams are refilling that pipeline. And I would tell you we're seeing that. And as I said, the results are showing that we're up year-to-date against this time last year on new sales, and frankly across both groups. So all-in-all we're pleased with the results and pleased with the investment. And we've highlighted a number of those sales, when we bring a sale forward in our prepared remarks, keep in mind these are large multi-million dollar engagements; so the team's doing a nice job.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good to hear that the big deal activities is very healthy. Just one more for me, just on the, I guess the Other line, just was a little bit bigger, the $11 million, what drove that exactly in the quarter?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's, if you remember my prepared remarks, we sold a small investment, ended up being about $7 million in there, Tien-Tsin, and that was, the Other is just normal noise in there, but $7 million was a small investment gain.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks so much, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks again, guys. Listen, I just want to start off with the organic revenue. I mean, you talked about still maintaining your EPS, which again I think is great to see given the ramp needed, and all the one-time items was helpful, but when we look at the guidance you had given initially for the year being I think 5% plus for organic constant currency with all the add backs and moving out, can you just \u2013 I didn't hear, if that number was updated or maintained or what. And then I just have some follow-up questions on some of the large deals that you're announcing.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We would still say that's exactly where we think we're going to land still in that 5% to 7% range, Darrin. Given what we've done to-date and talked about the back half of the year, it may trend towards the lower end of that, but still in that 5% to 7% range. So yeah, I think it's still there.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. That's good to hear. Look, I just want to ask one follow-up, on the large deals you're mentioning, first of all it's good to see a $70 billion and $17 million (sic) [billion] deal. I mean, are there others in the pipeline like that and then I guess the next question is on Cr\u00e9dit Agricol, you mentioned an add-on in terms of new additional opportunities there. Just if you can expand a little bit on \u2013 is that an expansion to what you pre-existing had already with them? And then lastly is there anything like another Cr\u00e9dit Agricole or Sainsbury in the pipeline for these large transformational deals that you're doing in the GFS segment.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, to answer to your question on the first part about the multi-billion dollar financial institutions and signing those large deals, are there are others in the pipeline, the answer is yes. I think, what you've seen over the last several years is, we've consistently executed on those. I mean, I will go back to (35:10), I will go back to the Citi announcement. All of these are big engagements with very large multi-engagements, CIT last quarter. So I mean, if you think about it, we continue to sign and close very nice transactions in that size. If you look in GFS, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole is a great example, where we started with consulting engagements, led to a professional services engagement. We're now engaging around the product side. So good growth of the way we think that GFS will head and the way we \u2013 the investments we've made. So there is other large deals in the pipeline that we continue to pursue. Of course, we don't sign them all, right, but that goes back to my deal flow comment in the earlier question. So all-in-all, we're pleased with the size of institutions we're signing. We're pleased with \u2013 we're starting to see product pull through in the GFS organization and IFS continues to execute very effectively.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, guys. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thanks, Darrin.","Operator","And our final question will be coming from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to look at constant currency revenue growth for IFS and GFS going forward in the third quarter and fourth quarter, just some of your expectations there. I think I heard a comment that maybe the third quarter and the fourth quarter would be pretty equal in growth rate profile, so just curious to see how it maps out between the two groups.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think fourth quarter typically if you map out the path, has a little bit of a higher growth rate as the institutions are working through their capital planning and capital budgeting process. So we do see them flushing some capital budgets in the fourth quarter, that's historic in terms of both IFS and GFS. So you will see a little bit of a ramp there...","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I also would add on that. You always see nice transaction spikes in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's exactly right. And so, you will see a little bit higher in the fourth quarter, but that's more normal trend line if you will there. Beyond that, we don't have a significant other transaction change or volume change that we haven't already discussed in terms of either term fees or sales execution.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And any comments individually for the two segment, IFS and GFS, on what to expect on constant currency for the third and the fourth.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, IFS really has very little if any currency impact in it. So nothing there in terms of that constant currency. And then you can back math where we are, where we're going to be, sort of 5% to 7% in the aggregate for the full year, what we've got through the first half of the year at about 3.2% for the quarter. You can kind of back math it and see what your models say.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So the increase to get to 5% or 5% to 7% from 3% is going to come mostly through GFS or GFS and IFS both accelerate in third quarter and fourth quarters.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It will be some of both because some of the term fees are flowing through IFS. We're getting over some of the comps that we've talked about and then GFS would also have some acceleration of the deals we've talked about signing.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay and then can you size the term fees for us that you're expecting for the second half of 2015?","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we've kind of outlined, we've talked about full year we thought we'd have about $50 million. In the first half of the year, we've had about $11 million. So very small. So we do anticipate term fees to be much more significant in the back half of the year. And I can't reiterate this enough, I know you guys are looking quarter to quarter. I can't reiterate this enough that lower term fees is a good thing for us long-term. We maintain the customer relationship, we cross sell, we up sell, and we keep the profitability line.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then just remind us what the term fees were for the second half of last year. Just so we can compare.","James W. Woodall - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think the last year it was about $20 million, with a full year 2014 of about $75 million.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But as we said earlier in another question, you just can't predict when these things are going to happen. So M&A is going to \u2013 you know consolidation is going to occur at different times. And so there is always lumpiness around these kind of fees.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right.","Operator","And that will conclude the Q&A session. I'll turn it back to the company for closing remarks.","Gary A. Norcross - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you for your questions today and for your continued interest in FIS.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. Turning to slide 2, Gary Norcross, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will begin with a business summary.

Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release and in the Appendix of the supplemental slide presentation.","Turning to slide 4, I will turn the call over to Gary to discuss the business highlights. Gary?","Gary Norcross","Thank you Pete. Good morning everyone and thank you joining us on today\u2019s call. I am pleased to report that we exited 2015 with solid momentum as the team\u2019s focused on execution and driving further improvements in our cost structure and overall performance, delivering continued earnings growth. ","We were in the right markets empowering our clients of all sizes, whether here in the US with community and regional banks or globally. Our long term strategy has consistently driven year-over-year performance results, and we remain committed to our strategy. ","Turning to slide 5, we continue to build global scale in 2015, finalizing our acquisition of SunGard and finishing the year with revenue increasing 7% on a constant currency basis to 6.6 billion, growing adjusted EBITDA 8% on a constant currency basis to 2 billion, and producing adjusted earnings per share of 6% on a constant currency basis to $3.22. ","We generated 921 million of free cash flow in return to 605 million to shareholders. Strategically, we are investing in the business to deliver long term growth and superior shareholder returns. We are entering 2016 focused on three growth drivers; first, the acquisition of SunGard broadens our solution portfolio allowing us to expand and renew in adjacent markets and provide deeper value to our clients. ","Second, we will continue to capitalize on our expanded scale, operating leverage and our disciplined integration to drive earnings growth. Third, our strong cash flow generation allows us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders. ","Turning to slide 6, our SunGard acquisition which closed on November 30 is a meaningful value creator for FIS. As we have discussed in the past, the industry is continuing to move towards fewer providers due to the complexity of solutions and regulatory oversight. ","As a result, our strategy has been to continue to expand our broad array of IT led products build for the financial services industry, augmented with the right transformation services components needed to bridge the gap between these complex systems in the new digital age. ","The SunGard acquisition is another key component in implementing this overall strategy. In addition to opening complimentary new markets, this combination positively impacts the revenue mix, creating a more profitable, product centric revenue base and the ability to accelerate margin expansion by implementing our leading go-to-market delivery approach as well as significant cost savings around administration and technology expenses. ","This acquisition expands us beyond our traditional retail banking and payments footprint in to the institutional and wholesale side of financial institutions as well as other buy side organizations. ","On a combined basis, our share wallet with our common global clients increased dramatically due to this combination, allowing us to become a more strategic solution provider. This comment has been substantiated multiple times over the last 60 days as we\u2019ve engaged with many of our global clients regarding the combination.","The benefits of the transaction do not stop with our global banks; it also significantly expands our existing solutions and client base in wealth management, treasury and corporate payments. These are in high demand among our regional and community institutions and has been a significant focus area for FSI as our clients look for ways to replace their fee revenue due to continuing regulatory change and increased oversight. ","As we look at the December results for SunGard, we are pleased with the momentum the sale organization maintained throughout the month, and are also pleased with the health of the overall pipeline that we acquired. While still early, we are also excited about how the sales teams are collaborating and building further opportunities within our robust client set which further substantiates the strategy and why we put these two companies together. ","Finally, this transaction brings a very strong talent and increased leadership to FIS, with market-specific expertise. This further positions FIS as the clear leader in financial technology globally, strengthening our ability to deliver for our clients and help them grow their business. ","Turning to slide 7, based on the significant strategic rationale discussed, the cultural environment has been equally strong given both companies been a center on developed products for financial services. This cultural alignment has allowed us to accelerate our integration efforts and we are very pleased with our initial progress integrating these two great companies. ","For example, we\u2019ve already rolled out a streamline organizational structure, transitioned our North American payroll and benefits plans and completed the rollout of the rebranding of SunGard. Given our current pace and results to date, we are ahead of schedule to exit 2016 at our synergy run rate goal of 100 million and are confident in our ability to exit 2017 with the synergy run rate of 200 million.","FIS has a proven track record of meeting or exceeding our synergy targets and based on progress to date this record will continue. While that wraps up my comments regarding the strategy and integration of SunGard, the company had other notable successes in support of our growth. I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes discussing some of these key results. ","Turn to slide 8 to review the segment highlights; our integrated financial solutions business continued to cross-sell and upsell additional products and services to our North American client base leveraging the strength of their portfolio. In particular, we saw a continued demand for our digital solutions, wealth and card production and institutions of all sizes. In addition, we expanded our relationship with a large online retailer in the fourth quarter resulting in double digit growth in our high margin network services business.","Our multiple businesses continues its industry leading position, growing its number of registered users by 19% year-over-year and delivering 27% year-over-year growth in our postpaid service model. Overall in our digital finance we grew to greater than 250 million in revenues at margins greater than 40%.","Card production increased 12% to a 112 million cards inclusive of (inaudible) and EMV. EMV grew sequentially 15% from Q3 to Q4 in 2015, resulting in a full year production of 12.5 million EMV cards. We continue to build traction among mid-tier community institutions signing several new long term core processing partnerships in the quarter and full year. ","The success we saw in core processing signings for the year was almost double the number of deals in 2014. These wins in 2015 create positive benefits for 2016 and beyond. Also in the quarter we signed the bank with assets greater than 200 billion to consolidate its debit processing and associated product related services. The decision was driven by the banks\u2019 desire to improve operating efficiencies and increase service flexibility with a common solution across its expansive retail and direct bank business. ","This significant multi-year agreement demonstrates FIS strength is serving the payment needs of institutions of all sizes around the world. 2015 was a transition year for Global financial solutions business. We responded to the challenges presented to us in the year whether they were due to global economic issues, overall softness in market demand for people based services or execution. ","We made leadership changes to address execution issues and refocused the impacted businesses. Regarding our consulting business, Capco, we are seeing progress and building our pipeline for consultative deals but continue to expect a slow recovery in the first half of 2016, with increased performance in the back half of the year.","As we discussed in the strategic rationale for SunGard, our non-product led businesses now make up less than 10% of our total revenue. Globally, our Clear2Pay business showed very strong momentum growing over 20% for the full year, fueled by solid demand for real time payments and a clear competitive differentiation in this space. ","We acquired Clear2Pay in 2014 with the strategic view of the market\u2019s direction and it is another illustration of how disciplined acquisitions and careful integration can enhance our client value proposition and earnings growth profile. During the quarter our GFS segment signed a bank in North America with assets greater than a 100 billion to a new multi-year agreement for a new (inaudible) providing an end-to-end integrated solution for core banking, fraud solutions, back office and call center services. ","This key win underscores our ability to deliver innovative technology solutions that empower our clients to better serve the customers in today\u2019s digital age. In Brazil, we were encouraged to see one of our key clients pursue the purchase of a large card portfolio expanding their franchise for future growth, even in the difficult macroeconomic environment. ","This acquisition expands our ongoing business in Brazil and we are already seeing the benefit in our revenue stream as we provide professional services expertise to onboard these accounts in the back half of the year. ","In Europe, we continue to show positive sales momentum especially in the UK and Germany where we saw important wins across the year that will fuel continued growth in 2016. Our strategy within the region is building momentum around our expanding relationships by leveraging existing strings within the FIS and SunGard portfolios.","We are making strong progress in the Sainsbury engagement. We recently delivered the new bank platform which is a key milestone in the project. Testing is underway and we now plan to start to migrate customers under the new platform later this year. ","We are proud of our partnership with this client and we look forward to empowering them as our strategic partner and we look forward to empowering them as our strategic technology partner over the next decade. We also signed the first all-digital bank in the UK as we helped this client prepare for their upcoming launch in 2016.","Asia continued to have strong growth throughout 2015, and we are pleased that SunGard acquisition more than doubles our sales force in the region, which allows us to continue to address to demand for FIS products and services throughout the high growth region. ","Turning next to slide 9, before I turn the call over to Woody for the financial review, I\u2019d like to summarize by emphasizing that our competitive positioning is strong and our long term earnings growth story remains intact. To meet our 2016 growth and financial performance goals, we will continue to focus on driving profitable growth, maintaining a strong balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders and continued acceleration of our integration efforts. ","With that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Woody for additional details on how\u2019s the financial results for the quarter and full year. Woody?","Woody Woodall","Thanks Gary. I\u2019ll begin with slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and then for the full year of 2015. The fourth quarter and full year results included the impact of the SunGard transaction, which closed on November 30. Those results are reported in the GFS segment. ","Today unless otherwise specified, I\u2019ll be referencing percentage changes in our metrics on a constant currency basis. Also reconciliations of non-GAAP measures can be found in our press release and our earnings deck which is posted on the investor relations page of website. ","In the fourth quarter, revenue increased to 1.9 billion or 18% and adjusted EBITDA increased 21% to 624 million. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 13% to 278 million and adjusted earnings per share was $0.93. ","In the quarter, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by 63 million, EBITDA by 12 million and earnings per share by $0.02. For the year, revenue increased 7% to 6.6 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to 2 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to 930 million, a 6% increase and adjusted earnings per share was $3.22.","For the year, foreign currency translation negatively impacted revenue by 243 million, EBITDA by 45 million and earnings per share by $0.07. ","I will now continue on slide 12 for segment results. In the fourth quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions grew 4.4% on a normalized basis to 1 billion. EBITDA increased 3% to 405 million compared to the prior year period. We are pleased with the results of this segment and the underlying business continues to perform well. ","For the year, IFS revenue on a normalized basis increased 3% to 3.9 billion and EBITDA increased 2% to 1.6 billion. Turning to slide 13, our IFS growth was driven by our digital and RISC solutions and by an increase in EMV card production volumes. Recurring revenue composition remains very high in IFS. ","Turning to slide 14, in the fourth quarter Global Financial Solutions revenue increased 38% to 902 million. SunGard contributed approximately 300 million of revenue and approximately 100 million of EBITDA. Excluding SunGard on a normalized basis, GFS revenue decreased 30%. This decrease was driven primarily by softness in professional services demand and a difficult comp to the prior year period. ","GFS adjusted EBITDA increased to 259 million, representing a 58% increase. EBITDA growth in the quarter was driven restructuring comp sanctions taken in the first half of the year and the inclusion of SunGard for one month. For the year, GFS revenue increased 16% to 2.7 billion, excluding SunGard on a normalized basis, revenue grew 3%. EBITDA increased 25% to 629 million. ","Moving to slide 15, we are presenting the results in the region including SunGard to give some credit in to their regional impacts. Although we noted that SunGard\u2019s impact is only for one month. Given that, my following commentary on the regions excludes SunGard and focuses on the GFS segment standalone performance. ","For the first fourth quarter, North America declined approximately 50 million to 252 million, almost half of this decline is a result of the previously discussed contract non-renewal followed by continued softness in professional service dominion and a difficult license [sale] comparable in the prior year period. ","For the year, North America revenues was 1.1 billion, as of the non-renewal of the contract, full year revenue decreased 1% reflecting professional services softness in the second half of the year. In the quarter, Europe grew 1% to a 198 million, for the year Europe\u2019s revenues increased 14% to 757 million. The fourth quarters\u2019 results included the anniversary of our Clear2Pay acquisition and the impact of softness for people based services in Europe.","We are pleased by the results in Latin America and the contract expansion in Brazil with a nice win in the quarter and should help Latin America in 2016 in spite of difficult macroeconomic backdrop. ","As Gary indicated earlier, we remain bullish on the long term impact of the Asia Pacific region. The teams have done a nice job of growing the business in this region. The addition of SunGard creates contribution from IT led solutions which we believe improves the visibility and predictability of results for this segment. ","Moving to slide 16, for the quarter free cash flow increased 12% to 399 million or a 143% conversion of net earnings, and for the year, free cash flow increased 7% to 921 million or 99% conversion of net earnings. We are highly focused on paying down debt and deleveraging the balance sheet. The effective tax rate increased to 33.4% for the quarter compared to 32.6% in the prior year period, driven by acquisition related items. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 33.1%. ","Moving to slide 17; in 2016 and going forward, we will quote revenue growth on an organic basis. Organic revenue will exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translations. We believe this will be a better visibility in the underlying operating results of the business. ","For 2016, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, adjusted EBITDA of 2.84 billion to 2.9 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $3.70 to $3.80, representing growth of 15% to 18%, free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings. ","As we think about the quarter-to-quarter flow of the operating plan, we generally expect 15% to 18% EPS growth each quarter and expect the impact of synergies and interest savings to increase over the course of the year. ","There is more information regarding our planning assumptions in the appendix material, and I will highlight a handful of them here. We assume net interest expense of approximately 370 million, a 2016 effective tax of approximately 35%. We believe that by implementing tax planning strategies over the next 24 months, we can drive the effective tax rate down by 200 basis points or more. ","Capital expenditure is approximately of revenue, reaffirming our goal of exiting 2016 with 100 million or more in run rate cost synergies. ","Moving to slide 18, in conclusion I\u2019m highly confident that our operating plan and our ability to deliver double digit earnings growth in 2016 and 2017. We remain focused on multi-year earnings growth and cash generation and believe our business model will create long term shareholder value and we continue to invest for growth and strive for leadership in the markets that we serve. ","That concludes our prepared remarks, operator you may now open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question today comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Togut - Evercore ISI","Glad to hear that the SunGard integration is running ahead of plan. Can you provide details around your cost stakeout assumptions for SunGard for calendar \u201916, in other words, what\u2019s embedded in the guidance for the full year and then to the extent you have a target for calendar \u201917 that would also be helpful?","Woody Woodall","David, again we\u2019re exiting at 100 million or more, I want to tell you for planning purposes, I\u2019ll use the 100 million exit run rate. If you think about the flow of the operating plan, we\u2019re trying to get some color around 15% to 18% each quarter. If you think about how the synergies will flow, I would lean towards the 15%; moving towards the 18% over the course of the year as the synergies come through and interest cost are reduced as we pay down debt. For 2017 David, we are still targeting a 200 million exit run rate and we will have that at least ratable at this point of time. ","Gary Norcross","Yeah David, this is Gary, obviously at this point we are highly confident in achieving that. And as I said in my prepared remarks, when you compare it to the really last big transaction we did which was Metavante back in 2009, we are ahead of where we were at this point in that process. So we\u2019re going through a number of already very significant milestones with the restructuring, the conversion of payroll and benefits and the other things we mentioned, and now we\u2019ve just got the line of sight in implementing the plans over the course of the year. So we\u2019re in really good shape on the integration and it\u2019s gone very smoothly at this point. ","David Togut - Evercore ISI","Any color on the demand environment for SunGard, they have a very strong capital market focus and clearly seeing a lot of volatility now in capital markets. Is demand holding up in this environment?","Gary Norcross","You know that was my point I was trying to make in my prepared remarks. I was real pleased with the month of December and our SunGard execution. When I look, forget every opportunity to really take the foot off the gas. I mean they could have gotten distracted with the combination; we had a lot going on at that time. The teams stayed very focused through year-end and executed very well. So that was positive. ","When I look at the pipeline, going in to this year, the same thing exists. The pipelines are growing, the teams are executing, they\u2019re very excited about being a part of FIS and I think that\u2019s translating in the client base. I can\u2019t tell you how many comments I\u2019ve gotten over the last 60 days from clients just talking about being up under FIS, our ability to invest and focus for the long term. And so the customers are receiving it well, our sales teams are receiving it well, and that\u2019s projecting in to the results. So we feel really good about it. ","The secret\u2019s going to be, as now since November 30 as we\u2019ve started to put or sales teams together and they\u2019ve started to have some conversations about joint selling in to the account. We\u2019re also seeing some good tractions, not only in the global financial institutions, but as i said when you look at treasury and wealth and many other products that SunGard have that are applicable for regional and community banks, we are starting to see strong traction there as well. ","I mean, of course as you know, our consulting groups started in the capital markets area of the industry and so being able to ramp that kind of consultative engagement around product is going to be differentiating for us going forward. ","David Togut - Evercore ISI","And then if you could give a little more color on Capco. You had mentioned towards the end of last year, Lance Levy taking over the business, repositioning it to focus more on high-end transformational consulting. What\u2019s the current growth for Capco and then why do you think it could be exiting \u201916? ","Gary Norcross","We sold mid-single digits growth on Capco for the full year last year, which was obviously substantially less than what has been done in the prior years. As you mentioned, Lance has taken over the helm of the consulting group. We really rallied the partners around, engaging more in to the transformational consulting side which drives a higher margin, and also is more complimentary to help differentiate some of our product IP.","The back half of the year was slow as we retooled it. We\u2019ve actually seen growing in to the first half of this year a nice ramp in the pipeline and we\u2019re starting to see some results of that early on. I do think with the first half of 2016 is going to be slower from a growth standpoint, but then when we get in the back half of the year as that continues to ramp, we\u2019ll see capital to start returning back to a more normalized double-digit growth rate for us. ","Woody Woodall","To be clear Dave the organic 3% to 4% for the consolidated company, we\u2019ve got Capco for the full year in a mid-single digit zone. ","David Togut - Evercore ISI","Just two quick final housekeeping questions, what FX impact you have built in to the 2016 guidance and then what is your forecast for termination fees?","Woody Woodall","Yeah, if you look at the assumption package there are some details on slide 20 that\u2019s further in there. Right in here we baked in about 150 million headwinds that are really driven primarily as a Brazilian real but still having some headwind in the Euro right now. ","With regard to term fees, we exited 2015 with about 40 million. We\u2019ve got less than that in 2016 that would bear you probably 20% less. ","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc. ","Just a little bit more detail on the guidance, I think that we\u2019ve been trying to figure out and I think others have been trying to make sure we understand and then guide. Can you give us a little more detail or ballpark on what your SunGard assumption is for revenue and maybe even profitability and I know going forward there\u2019s probably not going to be as much detail. But I think we and others are just trying to make sure we\u2019re modeling this right here on this first year out. So any help on that would be helpful. ","Woody Woodall","If you think about the revenue growth profile Brett I would tell you probably in the 3 to 5 zone on the SunGard from the revenue growth standpoint. In terms of margin contribution, our GFS margins without them are about 22% or so, with the synergies we think the GFS margin growth of 26% plus in 2016. ","That will continue to grow with the 2017 as we get full run rate synergies out of it, but that\u2019s what we are looking at in\u201916 in terms of profitability contribution. ","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","So the 22% for the fourth quarter was GFS ex SunGard, but the 26% plus is with SunGard in the synergies. ","Woody Woodall","Let clear, GFS around 22% would be a sort of a full year GFS without SunGard. Adding SunGard and the synergies in to 2016 we think the GFS segment growth profile or EBITDA margin profile would be 26% for us. ","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","So both of those numbers are for \u201916. And then you mentioned specifically Gary and I just want to make sure I heard you right that slower growth in the Capco portion of consulting and I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s probably the low single digit that we\u2019ve been seeing the last couple of quarters. And then you said, may be double digit growth in the back half. Can you give us a sense of the drivers, first of all is that correct? ","And second of all, give us a sense of the drivers? There were some questions of whether or not there was a systemic sort of industry wide big bank slowdown and uptick of professionals\u2019 services or whether there were some specific things that were just your business. Can you give us some color on that?","Gary Norcross","Yeah, just to be real clear, you hit the nail in the head in the first half of the year, you\u2019re going to see flat growth in Capco, may be even a little declining over prior year periods. And then you will see it ramping up to Woody\u2019s point for the full year getting to up mid-single digit, and then going in to 2017, we do expect Capco to recover to more of that double digit growth rate. ","But as you know in the consulting business, that\u2019s all about building your pipeline and filling it. And that\u2019s in fulfilling it. That\u2019s one of the things that we changed significantly. What we have done in Capco historically is we\u2019ve gotten to a very large transformational engagement and we took our eye of the ball or off the base business of consulting in my opinion. And so we\u2019ve retooled the leadership there, got them refocused on executing more of the thought leadership consulting engagements.","We\u2019ve seen nice uptick of pipeline. We\u2019ve actually seen strength coming in to Q1 with deliveries. So we got to continue to that obviously and continue that growth. But it\u2019s going to be much more back to what we picked in the original Capco acquisition which is more transformational consulting, where we are doing engagements more short term in nature around thought leadership and how to transform various functions of financial institutions and then allow us to pull in more product IP instead of some of the large lower margin body shop type deployments that we\u2019ve gotten in to. ","Lance has excellent experience on that, from his prior life with his former company. He\u2019s bringing a great discipline to that process and we\u2019re seeing a lot of improvement early on under his leadership. ","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. ","David Koning - Baird Equity Research","First of all on the IFS segment, it looks like that might have accelerated to around 5% growth if we exclude the gaming business from the prior year, and the strongest growth of the year looks like. I\u2019m wondering first of all if that\u2019s right, and secondly if there were term fees in the quarter and how much those were and then finally if that higher level of growth is sustainable through 2016?","Woody Woodall","It\u2019s a good comment. I think if you normalize of it the gaming and other pieces, we got about 4.4% growth in the quarter which we did see as an acceleration. I think the level of no ease in \u201915 was high compared to \u201916. `16 should be clean and which is a very good line of sight around it. We did have about 8 million of term fees in the quarter that flowed in to the IFS Group. So and you saw the exact way around. We did see some level of acceleration and it\u2019s a relatively clean number. ","Gary Norcross","But you are thinking about it right David. I mean the team\u2019s done an excellent job of cross settling and filing in frankly as we\u2019ve described in the past from these whole set of created firm, from these clients that are leaving due to being acquired, right. So we saw a nice acceleration in growth and we\u2019re confident about where that\u2019s going to come in 2016.","David Koning - Baird Equity Research","Okay, and then just turning t GFS, you made a lot of comments around some guarding capital. But you declined about 3% normalized in Q4. Are we going to turn to growth again in Q1 and maybe if we look through the year is that low single digit growth in the first couple of quarters and mid or maybe even a little better in back half. I just want to know if it going to grow throughout the year or if Q1 is still a down quarter.","Woody Woodall","Yeah, Q1 will not be a down quarter, we will see growth. What you\u2019ve got is a compliment of SunGard continuing to grow the base product or solution set business continuing to grow with Capco having some headwinds still in the first quarter. But yes we\u2019ll see growth and anticipate growth in these quarters. ","Gary Norcross","SunGard brings an increase in our product lab or product focused IP sales in that group as well, and so those are more sticky in nature and they\u2019re also more reoccurring in nature and so we think that\u2019s going to help with the growth throughout \u201916. ","David Koning - Baird Equity Research","And finally just a real quick one on the definition; with organic growth through the year, are you going to include SunGard in the prior year quarter or are you just going to exclude SunGard from the current quarter as we look through the rest of the year?","Woody Woodall","We would include it in the prior quarters, similar to how we have done organic growth in the past. We exclude acquisitions, divestitures and FX very similar to how we did in 2014 and prior. ","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Just want to follow-up on Dave\u2019s question on GFS, its first half and second half there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces across the Capco piece. What are the other big puts and takes that we need to consider? It sounds like the Bradesco conversion is a big one, anything else?","Woody Woodall","Yeah I think the win for Bradesco was definitely a nice win for us. We\u2019ll do some services around that conversion in the first half with the actual conversion taking place mid-year on that portfolio. Excited there; we do anticipate good growth in Asia Pacific again. Clear2Pay is going to grow well and then we\u2019ve got some softness in Capco in the first half. SunGard\u2019s growing relatively ratably over the course of the year. ","Gary Norcross","Also Tien-Tsin keep in mind as we talked about in the prior March, you got Sainsbury coming on, Woody mentioned Bradesco, you\u2019ve got the Digital Bank that is being launched in both the US and also in the UK that\u2019s two separate contract but both of them will be driving revenue as well throughout the year. ","Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan","So summer is a pretty important conversion period then?","Woody Woodall","That\u2019s right, but we don\u2019t have the same curve that we had. It\u2019s much more ratable over the course of the year. ","Tien-Tsin Huang - JP Morgan","Right, because you\u2019ve got some informational work here. And then just my follow-up, just the SunGard retention, I know that had gotten better towards the better part of \u201915. Have you seen any chance, sounds like it\u2019s doing well, but how the conversation has been going around retention? What are you assuming for 2016?","Gary Norcross","We\u2019re continuing to see an improvement in retention throughout 2016. As you pointed out, they\u2019ve had a very nice slope of improving that over the last several years and we think that will continue. Frankly the conversations with the clients have been extremely positive and I\u2019ve had an opportunity to have a lot of those over the last several months. ","And what we\u2019re finding is they are very pleased that FIS was the acquiring company, they are very pleased with how our overall size of relationship has grown through the combination because we would have already a strategic relationship with those clients. So it makes us that much more scaled and so it\u2019s all positive. But we are planning for a continued improvement and retention and we think the evidence of that won\u2019t occur. ","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Just want to touch on starting off with guidance once again just as a follow-up. You came off a year where obviously there are some unforeseen things that had occurred and so I know that the intention hopefully was to come in to this year with more of a conservative guidance assumption, and so here with 3% to 4%. ","Our first quarter run rate was decent on the IFS segment and obviously like you mentioned for a lot of different reasons slower on the GFS. So when you look going forward, can you just give us some confidence if there is anything that would lead to that guidance being either below that or what are those variables and potentially is that already conservative. Is this sort of the low end of the range? Inherently what you\u2019re giving with upside to that from other variable, I guess there\u2019s some contact around the conservatism and the nature of how you really thought about guidance here this time. ","Woody Woodall","As you might imagine coming out of \u201915 and looking at the macro backdrop, we definitely took a more conservative approach particularly on the revenue growth lines, and specifically on the revenue growth lines that are more discretionary in nature. ","Across the board, we think we\u2019ve got lower sales execution risk in the various [play-ins] and then we\u2019ve got a larger component of the earnings per share that will rack on more controllable things, synergies for example, things that we can go and execute on regardless of macro backdrops. So, yes, we think we got a conservative plan here both in top line and in earnings per share growth in 2016. ","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","And then on the cross-selling side, I am curious to know, is there anything included in your outlook around SunGard and are you seeing any evidence so far of cross-selling in terms of revenue synergy opportunities, whether it\u2019s the wealth business you\u2019ve talked about in the past or its Capco or others. ","Gary Norcross","Yeah Darrin, we were very conservative when we looked at cross-selling. But we are as I\u2019ve shared in my prepared remarks; we are very excited about what we\u2019re seeing in the conversations that are occurring. There are a lot of opportunities as we are looking at the wealth, we\u2019ve taken wealth and combined with our existing wealth business and gives us a substantial scale in that space and allows us to push in to the regional community banks and seeing good progress there.","We\u2019re seeing great uptick in some of our regions around world, Europe, Asia, specifically where we are able to bring out of sales resources and SunGard sales resources augmenting with Capco and seeing some nice early engagements. ","So we do think there\u2019s going to be some upside, but to Woody\u2019s point we were conservative in our modeling of that. ","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","And just last question from me, when we looked at - when we heard your prepared remarks you did list off a number of if what sounded like pretty decent size deals. I know Bradesco is one, but also I think you\u2019re investing $100 billion in a bank for direct banking and some others. ","It seems like there was a lot that was announced and still sort of slowly but surely rolling on through this year, whether its Sainsbury, you mentioned testing or Credit Agricole or others that are still to come. Can you give us a little more color on the timing of some of the larger implementations? Sainsbury sounds like it\u2019s in testing mode now and it\u2019s going to ramp through the year I imaging. Anything else we can just sort of hold on to in terms of similar larger deals? ","Gary Norcross","I think you\u2019re right; we\u2019ve got a lot of large transactions that we signed. The sales team executed well throughout last year. Frankly to your point, it does on board over time because these are big projects and it takes time to get them onboard. ","But when you think about Sainsbury, it becomes a mid-summer deployment for what we\u2019re calling phase two of that project. The final phase will launch in early \u201917, so very good progress there. We have high confidence in that and the relationship can\u2019t be better and the teams are working very well. ","We also mentioned a UK Digital Bank that will launch in Q2 as well, and then the Digital Bank that you mentioned [credit] of 100 billion, that will drop a lot of services, but that will be onboarding throughout \u201916 and in to \u201917, so that\u2019s a little later, because we didn\u2019t sign that till Q4 and those tend to run about anywhere from 12 to 18 months of deployment time. ","The Bradesco talk about the large card portfolio that will also come on in mid-summer. ","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","And would you say those four are the top four that are sort of yet to be implemented that you have in the pipeline or now that\u2019s [reassigned]? ","Gary Norcross","Those are some of the key ones that we\u2019ve highlighted. Of course obviously in the company [outside] we\u2019ve always got a lot more large implementations going on. And so the team that was a nice job of deploying those and typically they come on without any excitement which is always the thing we\u2019re looking for. So we\u2019ve got to continue to not only execute on our delivery pipeline but also our sales pipeline, we got to keep filing those delivery buckets, and the team\u2019s done a nice job doing it. ","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","Just want to start IFS, when I look at sort of low level of term fees in 2015 and you signed several new core processing clients, shouldn\u2019t that result in a higher normalized top line growth? And when I look at the overall IFS [team mates], maybe that\u2019s the offset. But how much of an offset is that going to be? Any kind of prognosis on IFS by the various pieces? ","Woody Woodall","And when you look at it, I think Ashwin a couple of things, one, conservative about our revenue growth guidance for 2016 first of all. Secondly as we talked we do have a broad set of payment solutions business, some of them are growing faster, some of them are growing slower, which is a headwind to overall growth in to the IFS Group. ","What we did see was good growth in the banking group and good growth in the business solutions group and EMV card production. So we\u2019ve got some growth but we definitely still have some level of headwinds. Again the macro backdrop here is conservative overall guidance as well. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","Can you comment on the nature of some of those headwinds, the timing aspect of it?","Woody Woodall","Well if you think about our check business for example, check volumes continue to decline, that environment continues to be a headwind overall for us. We seek some price compression in payments group that we\u2019ve talked about before. So that\u2019s a bit of a headwind in terms of overall growth. ","Some of these wins are obviously coming on and they\u2019re implementing growth or improving growth as we forward. But you\u2019ve got a combination of headwinds and tailwinds in that business that we think is still driving that 3% to 4% range in to 2016. ","Gary Norcross","If you think about it, and we keep mentioning it on the calls, but it\u2019s been a significant growth with all these acquisitions, and so that\u2019s just a natural headwind that propels in to 2016. While the term fees are coming down and I always point to, that\u2019s a great indicator of the launch for. They are continuing, they are still not down to zero, right, so we still got to deal with acquisitions.","To Woody\u2019s point, it\u2019s a very competitive market, we continue to see the price compression as an issue, but the team continues to sell through that, where they had a great year last year in sales and I would tell you in 2016 we see no indication that\u2019s not going to continue. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","Got it. Now none of those factors sound like the check processing payment price compression I think is new there, that\u2019s good. As you look at the overall portfolio of business that you now run are there pieces either within SunGard or within FIS old curve that does not make sense that does not belong?","Gary Norcross","There\u2019s always going to be. We\u2019re always sort of going to evaluate what are the right assets for us going forward and also what meets and fits with our strategy. As you\u2019ve seen historically at FIS we\u2019ve divested up assets that don\u2019t our strategy but are very good company. So I\u2019ll point to healthcare, I\u2019ll point to the gaming business. And we\u2019ll continue to look and evaluate that. ","If we have assets that don\u2019t fit our overall strategy, but would be better served under a different ownership structure, we would certainly pursue that. ","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","Last question, investors obviously care a lot about leveraging, I am hoping you can comment cash used, might you lean a little bit more debt towards debt pay-down as oppose to buyback, any thoughts there?","Woody Woodall","We would lean very heavily to debt, [quit] repayment there. In fact we don\u2019t anticipate any share buybacks in 2016. We will close the year round at about four times leverage. We\u2019re targeting to get [bad debts] of 2.5 times by the end of 2017. But all of our excess free cash flow will generally be used towards debt pay downs Ashwin over the course of \u201916 and through \u201917 until we de-lever back to the targeted level. ","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","(inaudible) on a constant currency basis in 2016?","Woody Woodall","2015 during the third quarter which they reported was about a 5% growth rate. We only picked up the month of December which was a $300 million contribution; their full year growth rate was just under that number. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Okay, so more kind of in line than the 3 to 5 you guys were thinking about for SunGard going forward?","Woody Woodall","That\u2019s correct, probably more in the 3 to 4.5, 3 to 5 zone. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","And then just a clarification on GFS, just trying to think about the pieces on the minus 3% constant currency organic growth in the fourth quarter. Telling through is tough comps and then you mentioned also of course professional services. Any details you can give us on those numbers on how to think about the drop there of minus 3%. May be what Capco grew in the fourth quarter exactly on a constant currency basis. ","Woody Woodall","Capco on a constant currency basis was down approximately 10%. That equated to a full year growth of 5%. We were anticipating Capco having slow growth in Q1 and returning to some growth in Q2, Q3, Q4, but in mid-single digit for most of 2016. So that\u2019s how we kind of slow that piece of the business line.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Anything else to quantify inside of GFS that was negative or caused the drop of 3%?","Woody Woodall","Those were the big items, the other one, the license comp that we had in 2014 once there was about $7 million or $8 million license in 2014 that drove a difficult sales comp in to \u201915. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s really helpful. I think going forward in GFS ex SunGard is that still supposed to be in that positive 3% to 4%, and then just what drives that just in the first, second quarter in the first half, I assume its supposedly or supposed to be lower. Is there anything that helps the growth either way to come off that minus 3% ex SunGard?","Woody Woodall","I think the Latin America win definitely helps support some of that growth. Ex SunGard that would offset some of the PS business that we talked about. Clear2Pay is still growing very well for us in Europe and in Asia Pacific it\u2019s been growing pretty well. So the combination lands on we believe the three to four kind of zone without SunGard in the front half of the year as well. ","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead. ","George Mihalos - Cowen & Company","Just wanted to ask you is there cadence we should be aware of in the IFS segment as we model through 2016 or should the growth there be fairly uniform quarter-to-quarter unlike the GFS segment?","Woody Woodall","We think it\u2019d be fairly uniform. That business is highly recurring, very predictable and has performed well in our anticipation. That coupled with very little expectations around term fees, we think it\u2019s going to be a pretty ratable growth. ","Gary Norcross","I think George when you think about it, it will return to a more normalized quarter-on-quarter that we\u2019ve seen historically in that business, given its 90% reoccurring revenues. So that\u2019s what we love about that business is very predictable. ","George Mihalos - Cowen & Company","Just to follow-up on Bryan\u2019s question, it sounds like for the first quarter at least of \u201916, Capco again will be under some pressure. It sounds like may be on a constant currency basis that should be negative, and then start to turn positive in 2Q and then accelerate over the back half of the year. Is that the right way to be thinking about it?","Woody Woodall","That\u2019s a fair way to think about it. ","Gary Norcross","As we said the back half of last year we started filling the pipeline, we started getting out and selling the type of consulting we were looking for. We\u2019ve had some engagements we are starting to fill that. So all the indicators are nice progress, but this will take some time to get it back to a more normalized basis. ","George Mihalos - Cowen & Company","And just last question from me just as we think about the tax rate, the 35% for 2016. Woody how comfortable are you that that coming down in \u201917 may be they are something closer 33 or a range like that?","Woody Woodall","I feel really comfortable. If you look at what SunGard was doing, they\u2019ve repatriated most of their cash back to pay down debt. It produced a standalone rate that was pretty high about 38% standalone when you take out discrete items in their history. So we will feel very confident in our ability to drive that rate down over the course of \u201917 and forward as we implement tax planning strategy similar to what we\u2019ve done at FIS, utilizing the foreign rate differential in some of the structure that we have. ","Operator","And our last question of the day comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Company","The first one, you were asked the question on bank spending, discretionary spending related to SunGard, and it sounds like obviously with the fourth quarter you had a deal wins that went off. So just broadly the bank spending, discretionary spending environment for the core business ex SunGard both across those GFS and IFS?","Gary Norcross","What we can say is what we\u2019re seeing in our product focused sales teams, we are continuing to see good pipeline, good closure. Keep in mind, even on SunGard, most of their license fees are term based, so you have to renew them in order to continue to process. There\u2019s also a large maintenance string and processing strings associated with that. ","So you\u2019re really talking about mission critical applications. And as I said, we saw great response out of SunGard team in December. We see good pipeline in to the Q1 and good line of sight to our Q1. We are also seeing across traditional FIS business and our IP sales we\u2019ve highlighted number of key wins last year. So we think that gives us confidence going in to \u201916.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Company","So basically broadly you haven\u2019t really seen any sort fall off in activity levels, given the uncertain environment we\u2019re all seeing and volatility?","Gary Norcross","Other than our people based services business, we haven\u2019t. We\u2019ve seen some softness there, we\u2019ve highlighted that starting mid-way through last year, but really in our product led sales, we continue to see good strong momentum. ","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Company","And just to be clear, there\u2019s a lot of commentary around guidance for the segments. Just to be clear as it relates to the 3 to 4 organic growth, it sounds like you are thinking 3 to 4 for both IFS and GFS, and I think I heard the 26% margin comment for GFS including SunGard, just to be clear on the margin and growth expectations by segment. ","Woody Woodall","We typically haven\u2019t given segment guidance, but I\u2019m going to give you some color around it. We do think IFS in that 3% to 4% zone, the top one. We would anticipate IFS margin\u2019s in a 10 to 20 basis points expansion range. We would look for GFS revenue in the 3% to 4% zone as well, and that GFS margin profile to increase from 22% or so to 26% plus. ","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Company","Just one last question, very high level commentary on the GFS from a geographic perspective, sounds like Latin American is probably going to improve with the Bradesco [language] sort of a much higher broadly kind of full year basis by the year before (inaudible) geographic. ","Gary Norcross","When you look at that blend, Latin America is going to have a nice year given the wind that we had in Q4. Moving over in to Europe, we\u2019re seeing strong product led sales, especially in the UK and Germany specifically, and we think that\u2019s going to continue.","We had some good sales success last year in that region, a lot of that\u2019s going to be onboarding this year, but we also see good pipeline and good integration. Asia has been strong for us consistently, and frankly as I mentioned we now doubled the size of that sales force in Asia which is something that we needed for the increase in demand that we\u2019re seeing. And so we were in the process of broadening our sales force there anyway. ","So that\u2019s going to be a good outcome. We are bullish that that team\u2019s going to continue to execute and Asia\u2019s going to be continue to be a strong grower for us. ","Operator","And for closing remarks, we\u2019ll turn the conference back over to the CEO, Gary Norcross. Please go ahead.

And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our first speaker, Pete Gunnlaugsson. Please go ahead.","Peter Gunnlaugsson - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Ryan. Good morning, everyone and welcome to FIS's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Turning to slide 2; Gary Norcross, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer will begin today's call with company highlights for the quarter; Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer will continue with the financial results. This conference call is also being webcast with today's news release and corresponding presentation available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Moving to slide 3, today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements.

Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Pete. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to announce that FIS delivered strong results again this quarter, delivering 4% organic growth. Our sales pipeline and revenue backlog are strong and continue to grow. These are positive signals that our clients are continuing to invest for the future.","Growth in the quarter was driven by strong sales over the prior three quarters as well as exceptional operational execution. The continued expansion of existing client relationships, growth of our clients through higher volumes of transactions and accounts and new client logos builds on our positive momentum as we near the end of the year. We continue to be pleased by the accelerating market momentum globally for our mission-critical products and services.","Turning to slide 5 for key themes, in the year, we continued to make strong progress executing against our modernization and market expansion strategies, which we have shared throughout the year. Our focused investment in our enterprise DIGITAL ONE platform brings modern, best-in-class capabilities to both self-service channels such as mobile, lab and tablet to banker-assisted channels like branch systems, teller, kiosk, call center and back office.","Its new architecture and design provides a clear path to a modern banking experience for financial institutions around the world and allows us to expand our reach into new markets. DIGITAL ONE has already had early success throughout 2018 in the large regional and direct bank market in the U.S. We are excited about this solution making an even broader impact to financial institutions and credit unions for the remainder of the year and throughout 2019. Similarly, our investments into more modern payment loyalty solutions are seeing strong demand with solid end quarter results. These solutions are also opening new markets globally to FIS.","Additionally, through our modernization focus, we continue to successfully execute on our data center consolidation strategy and expect to run more than 50% of our production workloads in our private cloud by year-end. This data center strategy is not only driving higher availability for our clients, but we're also seeing the significant cost savings flow through our results, in line with our projections during our May investor update. Based on these comprehensive modernization programs along with other initiatives, we will continue to drive long-term scalability, growth and resiliency for FIS. As a result, we are confident that we will exit 2018 with a solid foundation that positions us well for success in 2019 and beyond.","Turning to our segments, Integrated Financial Solutions drove another strong quarter of organic growth and margin expansion. Exceeding our expectations, these results were underpinned by increased transaction and processing volumes and as mentioned robust year-to-date sales. Demand for our retail banking, digital, wealth and payments businesses remained strong in the quarter as our clients continued to seek more efficient and modern ways to run their operations, grow their businesses and connect with their customers across digital channels.","I'd like to share a few client highlights across our broad financial services portfolio. In a competitive core takeaway deal, a fast-growing Texas-based community bank chose FIS as its core banking platform to support its strategy to outpace its competitors, while growing and expanding into new markets. This multi-year deal also includes a full suite of ancillary solutions including debit and image processing, fraud and new digital banking and payments capabilities, providing the bank with advanced operating efficiencies and a more modern user experience for its customers.","In addition, a global energy giant is modernizing the way it engages with customers by deploying our digital payment loyalty solution. This innovative solution enables customers to redeem earned rewards at the pump and within stores using their mobile phones. With this new deployment, the growing FIS Premium Payback redemption network now supports millions of consumers across more than 24,000 U.S. fuel stations.","Finally, as an example of our success in cross-selling, the depth and breadth of our solutions portfolio, a top 20 retirement plan sponsor expanded its relationships with us by selecting an outsourced FIS wealth solution to reduce its operational cost, improve servicing. This new win enables the organization to increase operational efficiencies by replacing three existing solutions with a single hosted retirement plan administration solution for its entire defined contribution retirement business. As we look across the IFS spending environment, it remains robust with strong sales forecast for Q4. We continue to build on these positive results established over the last several quarters creating momentum into 2019.","As expected, results for our Global Financial Solutions segment rebounded in the quarter with notably strong growth for our banking and payment solutions. Also as expected, our institutional and wholesale businesses had a nice rebound over Q2. We continue to expand our leadership position in the direct bank market and have become the de facto partner of choice for institutions looking to increase deposits through direct bank offerings. For example, our enterprise DIGITAL ONE solution that I referenced earlier is powering the recently launched direct bank offering for a top 25 financial institution joining the ranks of direct banks running on FIS technology. Another top 100 bank also selected DIGITAL ONE in the quarter to power its branch transformation strategy.","Also, as you saw after a ten-year partnership, we recently announced winding down our Brazilian joint venture. The JV was an exceptional entry point to the highly attractive Latin America payments market. Moving forward, we have the intellectual property, talent and infrastructure to effectively expand our commercial relationship for Bradesco and more importantly, we are well positioned to gain new clients in the Latin America region. Based on our discussions in Brazil, we see the recent election as a positive to our continued long-term business expansion in the country. As you are aware, FIS has completed several strategic divestitures since acquiring SunGard over three years ago. The JV transaction will complete our plan to divest businesses and allow us to offer our most focused mission-critical portfolio to-date as we plan for 2019.","Looking at other international regions, we continue to gain market share and are successfully capitalizing on increasing demand for our solutions. For example, a large European payments processor became a new FIS client this quarter by entering into a multi-year debit and prepaid processing agreement. As with many of our European clients, this partnership supports the organization's strategy to more efficiently comply with the increasing demands of the European regulatory landscape.","In summary, the spend environment in our GFS segment remains strong. Our solid pipeline and sales forecast points to a strong Q4, therefore giving us confidence in our full-year results as well as creating strong momentum into 2019.","Turning to slide 6, overall, we continued to drive solid momentum and are making very good progress on executing our strategy that will drive long-term transformational results for us and our clients including focusing our investments and accelerating our initiatives to provide the most modern solution set in the industry, remaining on track with our data center consolidation and cloud strategy, and continually driving increased efficiency within our operations. This focused execution of our strategy has been a pervasive hallmark of our success.","This month, we celebrated our 50th anniversary, a very impressive milestone for the fast-moving FinTech industry. Our 52,000 employees shared in this achievement through celebrations in more than 70 of our worldwide locations. One of our core tenets is giving back and our employees participated in activities supporting the communities where we live and work. While our employees enjoy looking back at where we have come, they are even more energized on how we will continue to evolve FIS and remain on the forefront of solving for the future of our industry for the next 50 years.","Woody will now provide additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Woody?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks Gary. I'll begin with slide 8 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. In the third quarter, revenue increased 4% to $2.1 billion on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA increased 7.6% to $808 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 290 basis points to 38.7% for the quarter. Adjusted net earnings was $438 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 13.7% to $1.33 per share compared to $1.17 per share in the prior-year quarter. For the first nine months of the year, revenue increased 2.7% on an organic basis to $6.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew 4.9% to $2.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 310 basis points to 36.3%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 19.7% to $3.64 per share.","Moving to slide 9, in the third quarter, IFS revenue grew a healthy 5.6% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew 5.9% to $496 million versus $469 million in the prior-year quarter. EBITDA margins expanded 30 basis points to 45.5%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue increased 4.3% on an organic basis and adjusted EBITDA grew to $1.4 billion, a 4.8% increase compared to the prior-year period.","Turning to slide 10, banking and wealth grew 5.2% for the quarter. This strong performance was driven by growth in our community bank channels as well as continuing demand for our outsourced wealth solutions. Payments grew a robust 7%. As Gary mentioned, we are seeing interest and demand in our innovative solutions. These market-differentiating solutions were called out at our Investor Day in May and they continue to gain traction in the market.","Performance was also enhanced by increasing transaction volumes in our debit and fraud solutions. Term fees were $21 million for the quarter versus $18 million in the prior-year period. We still anticipate full year term fees to be relatively flat compared to the prior year and they make up less than 1% of total FIS annual revenue. As Gary mentioned, we're very pleased with the revenue growth year-to-date for this segment and market demand remains healthy.","Turning to slide 11, as expected, GFS returned to growth during the quarter and grew 2.5% on an organic basis. EBITDA increased 5.2% to $355 million. Margins expanded 420 basis points to 38.7%, reflecting a positive revenue mix. For the first nine months of the year, revenue increased 1.6% organically. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $973 million, a 3.5% increase compared to the prior-year period. This represents 480 basis points of margin expansion to 35.5%.","Moving to slide 12, our institutional and wholesale business rebounded from the second quarter and grew 1.1%. We continue to anticipate improved growth in the fourth quarter. Banking and payments grew 4.4%, reflecting strength in demand in North America for our digital suite of solutions as well as payments growth in Latin America.","Moving to slide 13, Corporate and Other revenue increased 1.2% on an organic basis to $79 million. As previously mentioned, we expected the top line headwind to subside in the second half of 2018. Going forward, we do not anticipate this segment to be a headwind to consolidated top line growth. The Corporate and Other segment results included $55 million of corporate expenses for the quarter compared to $75 million in the prior-year period. This reduction was partially driven by benefits from the acceleration of our data center consolidation program. Moving forward, these ongoing incremental cost savings will positively impact the margin profile of the IFS and GFS segments, and our corporate expense will revert to historical levels.","Moving to slide 14, free cash flow for the quarter was $356 million. As you'll recall last year, free cash flow was benefited by approximately $50 million related to a delay in tax payments due to Hurricane Irma. This year, there was no deferral and therefore taxes were paid in the normal course of business. We're also making some modest working capital investments to support growth initiatives and we're seeing higher sales commissions. Both of these impact near-term cash flow, but will support longer-term revenue and profit growth. Debt outstanding as of September 30 was $9 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5%. Approximately, 95% of our debt outstanding is at fixed interest rates, which provides stability in a rising interest rate environment.","During the third quarter, we returned $570 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. We paid $105 million in dividends and repurchased 4.3 million shares. Through the end of September, we have repurchased 10.5 million shares for $1.1 billion. We have $2.8 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. Our weighted average diluted share count was 331 million at the end of the quarter and our basic share count was 328 million. We continue to see strong sales results, which have contributed to an increase of $400 million to our backlog compared to the prior year.","Before I move onto guidance, I wanted to spend a few minutes discussing some recent transactions, and our expectations for foreign currency impact for the remainder of the year. First, we divested our Certegy Check Services business on August 31, which was reported in our Corporate and Other segment. This transaction reduced Q3 EPS by $0.01. And for the fourth quarter, we expected this business to contribute $0.02 of EPS and a little over $20 million of revenue. Annually, this business would have contributed approximately $80 million of revenue and $0.06 of EPS in 2018.","We also began the process to unwind our joint venture in Brazil. Currently, we anticipate the transaction to close no later than the end of the second quarter of 2019. Upon closing, this will enable us to serve our clients in Brazil on a direct basis. In addition, this positions us to more effectively compete in this very attractive market as a fully independent third-party payment processor. This transaction does not have an impact to 2018 adjusted results and will have no meaningful impact to the medium-term outlook we provided in May.","The unwinding of our joint venture, in addition to the announced divestitures, leaves us with the most focused set of assets serving the financial services industry. As Gary mentioned, we do not anticipate further divestitures. Finally, given the current expectations of foreign exchange rates, we anticipate FX to negatively impact our fourth quarter top line by approximately $45 million and EPS by about $0.01.","Moving to slide 15, this morning, we refined our full year consolidated revenue growth guidance to approximately 3%. We now also expect IFS organic revenue growth to be approximately 4% and GFS organic revenue growth to be approximately 3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin outlook remains at approximately 37% for the full year. And finally, we're tightening our full year EPS range. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be $5.20 per share to $5.24 per share, representing 22% to 23% growth.","Moving to slide 16, we will continue to leverage our market leadership to produce predictable top line growth, exceptional margin expansion, double-digit EPS growth, and strong cash flows. These strengths allow us to invest for the future growth and return value to our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks.","Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Our first question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, David.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","It looks like for 2018, your revenue growth for IFS and GFS will actually be sort of the mirror opposite of what is in your long-term guidance, which has GFS growing significantly higher than IFS. So, my question is, is this more of a 2018 phenomenon really driven by higher bank IT spending? Or do you think this is more sustainable where the higher margin IFS business can outgrow GFS in 2019 as well?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No, it's great question, David. We're coming off of three really good quarters of sales in IFS. You're seeing that flow through toward the organic growth rates. Frankly as Woody and I both talked about, Q3 exceeded our expectations. We're looking at a strong Q4. So from a sales perspective, and confident going in (19:43) 2019. So, I do think the fundamental spending environment has improved across our regional and community banks. And we're certainly seeing stronger demand for our solutions given the fact that we're focused on our modernization strategy, movement into the cloud, the new DIGITAL ONE announcement. We're actually pretty excited that IFS will continue strong growth rates into 2019.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, your long-term guide called for 75 basis points to 125 basis points of average annual EBITDA margin expansion. Do you expect to be on that trajectory in 2019?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think, David, we don't have any broad change to the mid-term guidance we outlined in May and we believe we'll absolutely be in that level of margin expansion in 2019.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","In fact, you're really seeing some great traction and pull-through with our data center consolidation. So, you're starting to see those numbers drop to the bottom-line, which is a great positive. So, we're actually very confident in our guide on continued margin expansion going forward.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Hi, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, nice re-acceleration in GFS.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. I guess, first of all, when we think of GFS, I think, you imply now about 7% or so growth in Q4 to get to that 3% for the year. But I guess I'm kind of wondering as we look into next year now because 2018 had a lot of lumpiness because of license and ASC 606, is next year going to be a smoother trajectory to kind of normal growth all through the year? I guess those couple of questions first.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think as you remember, we talked about some lumpiness because of the adoption of ASC 606 in 2018. Our expectation in 2019 is a smoother alignment. Although you may have some renewals in a particular quarter versus another, but we don't expect the level of movement that we had because of the adoption of ASC 606. As you remember, we are looking at a robust fourth quarter growth rate to get to the range we talked about. But we anticipate at least a few points out of the shoot (22:17) just from the adoption of ASC 606, and then the remainder of the organic growth to be driven through a robust pipeline and good solid license sales that we anticipate in the fourth quarter. But I think going back to your original question, we do anticipate less lumpiness in 2019 than we had this year.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. And Dave, I just want to remind you Q4 is always a big quarter for the GFS business. It's just cyclically always a quarter in which there's a lot of decisions made by the Tier 1s around the globe. And frankly, they're cleaning out their budgets for the year they're in and preparing for their implementation of their big programs starting in the next year. So even as Woody described, the smoothing out at some in next year, you'll still see Q4 as a big year next year.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then I guess, secondly on the JV change, how does that affect kind of annualized revenue and margins? And is that going to be included kind of in your margin expansion, if it doesn't have an EPS impact, but it takes revenue down, that would seemingly help your margins.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","It's a great question, Dave. I'm going to give you some color around the JV itself. We put out a press release that had roughly an annualized impact to reported revenue of about $200 million. First, while we consolidate the JV, we only own 51% of the economics, Bradesco owns the other 49%. And after we closed the transaction, we'll remove ourselves from some low margin call center operations and some low margin, almost no margin, pass-through revenues from a third-party vendor. The combination of those and removing the minority interest is why we anticipate really no impact on EPS, but it will impact reported revenue some. All those collectively will help our margin profile in 2019.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","And to build on that, Dave, I mean one of the things that's exciting about this as we've talked about in the past, it was a great partnership that allowed us to really penetrate the high growth market of Brazil. But now that the fact that we're going to be independent, we've got a great commercial arrangement going forward with Bradesco, but it really does allow us now to fill the full capabilities of FIS, not only in Brazil, but the broader Latin America market.","So, we're pretty bullish on our opportunities down there in the future given the fact that we've now unwound the JV. In the past, we had prospects that really didn't want to enter the JV because of the Bradesco ownership. So, now all that goes away as a barrier for our sales going forward. So, it's a great outcome for us.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Sounds great. Thanks guys. Nice job.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. One moment please. Okay, Mr. Huff your line is open.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Brett.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Congrats on the results. One question, Gary, you talked about the modernization progress you guys are doing, so less a numbers question. I know that you've talked about modularizing your cores, customizing sort of the front UIs, and then trying to make, sort of, I guess a \u2013 I don't know \u2013 a manufacturing or infrastructure that kind of works across all those. Can you give us a more specific update on that? Number one.","And then kind of related to that, do we have any implementations of some of those new modules? And how is the conversation going with some of those mid and larger banks in terms of are they buying into this thesis that you guys have?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. No, Brad, it's a great question. As we talked about we're very far down the path of our modernization transformation and it really spans from the technology side, so data center consolidation. As you're aware, we're wrapping up year three of a five-year journey. You're seeing great outcome from the operating savings. We'll have $100 million in run rate by the end of this year. We'll have $250 million by the end of year five, and we'll have over 50% of our production compute in the cloud by the end of this year. So, great progress and being very well received.","And that's not just cloud-based deployment that's modernizing our network, modernizing our infrastructure, using artificial intelligence, et cetera, through the whole process of delivery, so that's going very well. I highlighted a number of key wins on our more modern digital omni-channel platform that we're able to deploy globally across any and all financial institutions. I highlighted a number of DIGITAL ONE wins in the quarter.","We've had quite a bit of success with that solution throughout the year, not only with sales but also going live in production on a true \u2013 the true future of where we see both the assisted and unassisted. From a core modernization standpoint, we have had great progress on that development and a number of key wins this year in the market, and a lot of traction in the larger financial institutions. We're deploying those components under our brand Profile 8, which is the next generation of our Profile suite. But we're also now consuming those components in a number of our regional and community bank cores as well. So, all of that combined we feel really good about the retail banking side, and what we're doing.","I also highlighted a number of key wins with our modernization effort around payments. You're starting to see some traction in our payments growth. A lot of that is next generation technologies that we're starting to deploy and gain traction. I highlighted the example with the U.S. fuel stations, and that success. We're also seeing and we highlighted several wins \u2013 significant win in Europe where our PaaS product, Payment as a Service product is gaining a lot of success. We've now had three wins there.","And then on the institutional and wholesale side, doing a number of key modernization efforts around some of our SunGard assets. So, long-winded answer to we have a lot of traction across this and it really is starting to resonate with our client base.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And just the quick follow-up is on M&A, I think Woody you said, if I heard you right, it sounds like post the Check business, congrats on that sale, it seems like we've trimmed most of what we want to trim and feel pretty good about our portfolio. And if that's the case as we look forward on \u2013 now that our balance sheet is in pretty good shape, what are we thinking about from an M&A point of view maybe even as some of the valuations have come in with this market turnaround?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. With regard to the first question, I think, that's right. We're about as clean and focused as we can and we have been since I've been with the company for 10 years. Feel very good about where we're at in terms of the amount of technology and software-related mission-critical-related applications that are in the portfolio, and things that we've pruned off over the last few years.","With regard to future M&A, I think, it's the same philosophy that we've always had. We try to find things that are good strategic fits that increase our capabilities in markets that we serve or break us into new markets and they also have to make sure they make good financial sense and drive solid returns to our shareholders. I don't think that's changed very much. We continue to watch the market dynamics as everyone does. But we're always keeping an eye out for what's going on out there.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, Brett.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter and the acceleration in the organic growth, nice to see.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thanks, George.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Wanted to ask on the IFS strength, specifically, within the payments division, that obviously accelerated significantly from the first half of the year. Is that one or two deals that are kind of dropping in now, and really pushing that growth rate, or is it more broad-based? And then, related to that you talked about stronger market and also some competitive takeaways. Is there a way to kind of gauge the strength between those two or sort of break it down between those two drivers?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. I would think \u2013 I would say it's a combination of both, George. The nice thing about the IFS business is, it's got a very diversified client base. And so the acceleration in payments, you're seeing that from economic indicators, you're seeing increased volume, especially around credit, debit and our network businesses. So we saw nice volume increases across the quarter, which obviously contribute to our organic growth.","But the team has also done a very nice job over the last three quarters, selling some nice payment sales and you're seeing the team get those onboarded and starting to gain traction as well. So it's really a combination of market dynamics as well as sales dynamics, both contributing to an accelerated growth rate.","Across IFS, it was a very clean quarter. And if you look, we're encouraged about what we're seeing in that market, what we're seeing in the sales force, taking market share and the growth across it. So I think there's a lot of good indicators that make us excited for not only the rest of the year, but into 2019.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I'll follow on to that too. I mean, we had robust growth in payments. I think, it's an indicator that the investments we've been making over the past few years are actually paying dividends now. And we continue to anticipate robust growth in payments going into Q4.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great to hear. And then, not sure if I missed it, but the outsized margin expansion in GFS that you saw this quarter, what were sort of the key drivers of that?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","You got a couple of things. We continue to monitor costs, no doubt about it. We've got some absence of lower margin business from divestitures that we made in the prior year.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Right.","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","And we've seen some of the data center consolidation efforts flowing through to the margin health within that business.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Thank you, George.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry about that. I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the M&A landscape among your bank partners. Clearly, we've seen a little bit more elevated M&A in the space, maybe not to the lower end of the market. Maybe talk about what you're seeing and how you expect that is going to potentially impact your growth rate going into next year?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question, Jim. We're seeing a pretty consistent trend across M&A. Woody highlighted the term fees in Q3 pretty much in alignment. You can almost use that as a proxy for M&A activity pretty much in alignment over last year and looks like they'll be down a little bit in Q4 based on where we sit which makes us come in flat year-over-year. Yeah. There's a lot of discussion going on I would say it that way. But those discussions and frankly decisions have been fairly consistent over the years. There's some indication as we've raised the SIFI limit that we might see more activity in the larger bank space. But I'd also come back and say valuations are high in the markets.","And so the good news about FIS is we've got very strong positioning in the large bank market. And typically we're the net benefactor as our customers are buying other clients and driving scale. And then as even in the smaller bank markets as banks grow into the larger bank space, they tend to look to FIS to really drive their capabilities necessary to compete at that level. So long-winded answer to not seeing a lot of change, but it's something that we monitor very closely.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful color. Thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-up, at a macro level, you clearly highlighted that IFS is coming on a little bit above plan because of the strong sales in the IT spending backdrop. What's your client conversations look like in terms of their expectations for 2019 spending? And directionally whether that's going to be quite as strong as it was this year?","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Well, right now, all we can look to is what Q4 looks like. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, it looks like we're going to have a strong sales quarter in Q4. And I will remind everybody as we onboard these sales, you need to look that those are \u2013 that's going to drive organic growth 9 and 12 months out, all right? Because it takes time to not only sell the solution, it takes time to implement it. And I'd also highlight that our pipeline continues to be highly qualified and robust in the IFS segment, so that gives us confidence as we look into 2019.","I think a lot of our clients as interest rates continue to rise, their net interest margin continues to spread and they're more bullish on spending on some programs that they've held back. There's also a real need to modernize these platforms and FIS is certainly leading the way in that category. The benefits to cloud computing drives, the benefits to omni-channel deployment, next-generation components, payments, and institutional wholesale are really resonating across those client bases. So we feel good about 2019 as it sits today given the size of the qualified pipeline and the activities we're having in the sales channel.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey guys, good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Could you just talk about the free cash conversion? When we quantify, it provides more details on the two impacts that you called out, Woody, working capital investment and higher sales commissions. And then is there any update on free cash flow guidance for the year or beyond?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. If you look at the free cash flow again we're trying to highlight year-over-year, we had a benefit in Q3 2017 of roughly $50 million. That would get you to about flat year-to-year.","We have had some modest investment in working capital to support the growth primarily in the payments area. And we've had some higher sales commissions this year that frankly we're happy to pay.","If you look back we've been trying to increase the percentage of revenue conversion into free cash flow if you go back to 2014 that was roughly 14% conversion of free cash flow from revenue.","And we are looking to be very close to 20% this year, and we want to continue to drive growth in that revenue to free cash flow conversion at or above 20% going forward. So that's where we're at on the free cash flow comment.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Do you still expect it to be north of 100% of adjusted net income going forward?","James W. Woodall - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","I would anticipate it to be roughly 100% this year. And then would continue to think it could be 100% to 110% on a go-forward basis.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. And just my follow-up would just be on the sales commentary. Great to hear that, that's solid. I know you don't quantify the retention rate type of comment. But can you give us some comments at least qualitatively on dollar retention rates? Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.","Yeah. From a retention standpoint we continue to do very well, not only taking share with new wins. Obviously, on this call, we highlighted a lot of new wins.","But I would tell you our renewal rates continue to be in line with historicals and we're very pleased with the retention rates that the team is executing on. That's a great opportunity for us during the renewal cycle to cross-sell and up-sell our new capabilities, to really communicate our modernization story, help push people to the cloud and also gain the benefits of many of the next-generation technologies we've talked on the call.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations, Nate Rozof. Please go ahead.","Nate Rozof","Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the FIS third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The call is being webcasted. Today\u2019s news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Beginning on Slide 2, Gary Norcross, our Chairman, President and CEO will discuss our third quarter 2019 business highlights and FIS\u2019 growth strategy. Woody Woodall, our Chief Financial Officer will then review FIS\u2019 third quarter financial results, synergy performance and provide updated guidance for the fourth quarter and full year.","Turning to Slide 3, today\u2019s remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.","Please refer to the Safe Harbor language. Also throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share. These are important financial performance measures for the company, but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information, are presented in our earnings release.","With that, I will turn the call over to Gary.","Gary Norcross","Thank you, Nate. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s call. Beginning on Slide 5, I am very pleased to be able to share our outstanding third quarter performance with you. Our financial results were excellent with revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS all significantly exceeding our expectations. We also got off to a very fast start with both revenue and cost synergies especially considering we operated for only 2 months as a combined company. As a result, we are raising our fourth quarter and full year guidance for revenue, EBITDA and EPS as well as our 2020 cost synergy target.","The strength of our third quarter performance and raised outlook clearly demonstrates the power of this combination and our overall growth strategy. Including 2 months of Worldpay contribution, we generated more than $2.8 billion in revenue and approximately $1.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA. This represents 35% revenue growth on a GAAP basis over 5% organic growth and 350 basis points of margin expansion. We generated $1.43 of adjusted EPS, which was well above our expectations. In the third quarter, sales were up more than 25%, increasing our backlog 9% organically, accelerating from 7% growth last quarter. This gives us clear line of sight to continue revenue growth throughout 2020. FIS has successfully generated seven consecutive quarters of exceptionally strong sales. Merchant Solutions also saw continued strong sales momentum within our e-commerce portfolio, including 23 cross-sell wins in the quarter, accelerating from 14 wins in the second quarter. We think these cross-sell wins are another strong indicator of the success and scale that our newly combined company can deliver.","Turning to our early synergies from the Worldpay integration that clearly showed that the combination of our two companies is paying significant dividends, our combination is strategically differentiated on three main fronts. First, we have a unique strategy to accelerate organic growth by aggressively investing in innovative technologies and automating complexity. Second, we are combining the premier assets in the industry to create leading solutions focused on secular high growth markets. Third, we are bringing value to our clients with our world class scale.","We exited the quarter generating more than $30 million in annualized run rate revenue synergies with significant future opportunity. I\u2019m excited to announce that we have already signed agreements with two of our bank clients to expand our relationships in the merchant services. This includes a merchant referral agreement within $11 billion bank in the United States as well as an agreement with a large banking client in Brazil. With this agreement, we are now enabling merchant processing in Brazil at the point of sale for over 500,000 merchants. This step forward demonstrates the power of our new companies global reach as neither company would have won these transactions on their own. These early wins illustrate the power of our end-to-end value proposition and we have a solid plan in execution timeline that will drive our results to achieve our $500 million revenue synergy goal.","With regard to cost synergies, our team began executing immediately and upon close and generated well over $200 million in savings on an annualized run rate basis exiting the third quarter. Woody will go into more detail regarding cost synergies, but given the outstanding results today, and our current plans, we are very confident in delivering more than $500 million in total cost synergies. The integration of these large transformational M&A transactions continues to be a core competency, and we will utilize it as part of our strategy and further accelerate our organic growth and shareholder value.","Turning to Slide 6 to discuss our growth strategy, we continue to aggressively invest in new technologies across all three of our segments. Investing in future innovation to benefit our clients started more than three years ago. It\u2019s part of everything we do at FIS and we will continue to drive our client value proposition. These significant innovations are now coming to market and not only driving our sales results but leading to our accelerated growth. Our clients depend on us to stay ahead of the market and make investments that enable them to run their operations more efficiently, connect with our customers and grow their businesses. With the addition of Merchant Solutions, our growth rate will expand to 6% in the fourth quarter. We see numerous secular growth opportunities in all three segments and our clients and partners are excited about the potential value we bring to them by solving their current and future needs.","Turning to our segment performance, our Merchant segment continues to benefit from its exposure to secular high growth markets and ability to win market share through superior client service. For example, a leading global coffee chain selected FIS for in-store payment technology across more than 600 locations in the UK and Europe. Our global reach, innovative capabilities and differentiated approach resonated with the iconic coffee giant as it expands into new markets. In addition to this marking new client win, Merchant renewed its important strategic relationship with Kroger to continue providing our innovative suite of omni-channel payment solutions. While we typically do not highlight renewals, this is one of the largest clients of the former Worldpay business. And we were thrilled with the early commitment Kroger showed in extending our long-standing partnership. In our Banking segment, our clients are reinventing their business models to create seamless digital experiences for their customers using our advanced technologies. For example, we expanded our relationship with the Global Bank to implement a real-time payment solution for their corporate clients in 9 countries. The bank chose to partner with us due to our prudent capabilities and expertise as well as our ability to move quickly to meet Europe\u2019s regulatory requirements. In addition, a large regional bank in the U.S., decided to switch to our outsource suite of core Banking Solutions after acquiring one of our clients. The combined company now has assets approaching $50 billion, and represents a consistent theme of large financial institutions looking at FIS to solve their complex core banking business challenges. The decision was driven by our scalability and our consistent investment in new products as well as our tremendous scale in the large regional banking market.","Similarly, in our Capital Market segment, our investments to automate complex process is using advanced end-to-end technologies or resonating clients. For example, a large institutional broker signed an agreement to implement our Consolidated Audit Trail solution to effectively meet new regulatory requirements for monitoring securities trading. Regulatory compliance is critical for our capital markets clients and our ability to automate these processes is a true differentiator. This is our 12th Consolidated Audit Trail win this year and shows our ability to work at scale to simplify the complex. We also expanded our strategic relationship with a large global Financial Services Corporation. In this enhancement we are bundling several FIS cloud based solutions to help this organizations global travel services enhanced treasury controls, optimize cash visibility and reduce fraud. These impressive client wins across our segments demonstrate the strength of our business model and powerful client value proposition. I am very proud of the team sales and operational execution, especially given the backdrop of the significant integration activities occurring throughout the company. With such strong results in revenue synergies already starting to ramp, I\u2019m increasingly confident in our expectation for organic growth to approach 7% next year and to further expand to 8% to 9% in the future.","I will now turn the call to Woody to round out the financial discussion before he opens the call to questions. Woody?","Woody Woodall","Thank you, Gary. I will begin with our results on Slide 8. We had an outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 5.4% on an organic basis to $2.8 billion, with strong top line performances from all three of our segments. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.2 billion during the quarter and our margins expanded 350 basis points to 42%. We expanded margins by generating operating leverage, driving data center consolidation and achieving cost synergies. We also benefited from the inclusion of high margin merchant revenue for the last 2 months. As a result, adjusted EPS was $1.43 per share, reflecting our strong revenue and EBITDA performance.","Turning to Slide 9, we accelerated the timing of both revenue and cost synergies. In only 2 months, we have already achieved revenue synergies of more than $30 million on an annualized run rate basis primarily through the benefits from debit card routing. We expect revenue synergies to ramp up from here, giving us clear line of sight to our $150 million target by the end of 2020. This fast start gives us confidence to increase the fourth quarter revenue guidance and gives us an early lead on achieving our revenue synergy goals. In addition to the debit card routing benefits, we also expect to achieve revenue synergies through cross-selling our combined portfolio, improving authorization rates, reducing fraud and expanding our geographic presence. For example, our first joint loyalty as a currency client is on track to go live during the first half of next year. Completing the integration of this solution into the Worldpay platform will mark a significant milestone. It will streamline the on-boarding process for future clients, allowing us to significantly ramp-up sales and distribution in order to accelerate revenue synergies. At this early point in the integration, we are ahead of our planned revenue goals which puts us clearly on track to achieve our $500 million revenue synergy goal by the end of 2022.","Turning to cost synergies, we achieved more than $200 million in annualized run rate cost synergies exiting the third quarter. As a result of our rapid progress, I\u2019m very pleased to increase our 2020 cost synergy target by $50 million to more than $350 million in annual run rate savings. The team has been working hard to drive cost out of the business and started executing, day one. We drove cost synergies in the third quarter by reducing duplicative corporate costs as well as by achieving interest expense savings that we announced last quarter. Moving forward, we will achieve our cost synergy targets primarily by consolidating our merchant and issuer processing businesses as well as by streamlining operating and technology costs, while maintaining a focus on accelerating revenue growth. We feel very confident about our ability to achieve or exceed our synergy expectations and look forward to continuing to update you on our progress each quarter.","Moving to Slide 10, I would like to add some color on our segment results. Merchant Solutions grew 8% organically, including 2 months of Worldpay during the quarter. We expect Merchant Solutions to accelerate to 10% growth in the fourth quarter as we realize additional revenue synergies and we expect similar growth levels in 2020. Turning to adjusted EBITDA, the Merchant segment generated $371 million in the quarter, representing a very healthy 52% margin. Our Banking Solutions segment increased 5% organically. The strong performance was primarily driven by continued new sales over the past several quarters as Gary described earlier. As a reminder, it takes several quarters to convert new sales to revenue giving us great line of sight to our organic growth targets through 2020. Our strategy to accelerate growth by investing in technology and innovation is clearly paying off. Banking generated $641 million in adjusted EBITDA driving a 43% margin. Capital Markets also generated very strong organic growth of 5%. This top line growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in recurring revenue, while license revenue remained relatively flat. We continue to shift the revenue mix of this segment from license fees to our recurring or SaaS-based subscription revenue model. Our growing recurring revenue base is building a strong foundation for future revenue growth as well as providing more visibility into our go-forward revenue expectations. The Capital Market segment generated $280 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 46% margin.","Turning to our capital allocation strategy on Slide 11, this quarter, we saw 23% conversion of revenue into free cash flow, up from 20% last quarter. As a result, we generated $640 million in free cash flow with only two months of Worldpay, which is nearly double the amount that we achieved in the prior year period. We use the strength of our third quarter cash flow to aggressively repay debt. We have already paid down more $700 million of outstanding debt since closing even as we continue to fund integration. We also doubled our quarterly dividend payment to approximately $215 million following the increased share issuance related to the Worldpay transaction. We are committed to our investment grade credit ratings and we will quickly delever to achieve our 2.7 times leverage target by the end of 2020. Even as we de-lever the strength of our balance sheet gives us flexibility to continue to invest in innovation for the benefit of our clients as well as to execute tuck-in acquisitions to further enhance growth.","Moving to our fourth quarter and full year guidance on Slide 12, we are raising our revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance ranges for both the fourth quarter and full year. At the midpoint, we are increasing our revenue guidance by $7.5 million for the fourth quarter and by approximately $40 million for the full year. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $50 million for the full year. Finally, we are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance at the midpoint, about $0.03 for the fourth quarter and about $0.12 for the full year. The increase to our fourth quarter guidance primarily reflects current business trends and ongoing synergy achievement, while our higher full year ranges reflect both the outperformance that we generated in the third quarter as well as our increased fourth quarter expectations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the strength of our business model and the power of our growth strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. Good morning, guys and nice results. I wanted to ask a little bit about kind of the modernization of your banks. In the past, you talked about where they had to kind of go down this pathway in order to really implement a lot of the new technologies and I am just wondering what you saw now you\u2019ve got this combined entity and those kind of conversations and just where we are in that process?","Gary Norcross","Yes, I know, Dan. Thanks. It\u2019s a great question. I think we\u2019re in the early, early innings of the transformations going on. At FIS, we are in the later innings of that. Obviously we started well over three years ago modernizing all of our technology stack and pushing our compute into our own private cloud. We then also started modernizing all of our application layer and bringing on next generation digital experiences, and frankly next-generation capabilities across all of our segments, and that\u2019s resonating well with our clients. And you are seeing that in our quarterly results with seven strong quarters of revenue sales, but we think we are very early in the process. Frankly, as we have discussed on prior calls, I think the industry held on too long to legacy based technologies and really we are seeing our clients now have to make that transformation. So we are excited about the investment that we started years ago. We are excited about our timing for where the market is and really puts us in a really good spot as we look to the future.","Dan Perlin","And just as a quick follow-up, can I ask about the geographic mix that you are thinking about the demand environment and specifically, we have just heard concerns around Europe kind of intra-quarter and so anything on that would be great? Thank you.","Gary Norcross","Yes. Now, when we look across Europe and frankly the UK, what we are seeing in the UK with Brexit specifically, we have already seen that volume kind of go down the recessionary period. So anything that would show any kind of improvement would actually be a tailwind for us. I would agree, Europe has been a little slow for us across the broader banking capital markets as well, but we have had some nice wins here recently. Other areas like Brazil, we have seen some nice growth data. We continue to see Asia strong. So our geographic footprint continues to be a very good differentiator for us from a global perspective, but when we look at Europe and Woody talks about our guidance and where we\u2019re seeing coming in we\u2019re really keeping Europe and broader UK at current levels.","Dan Perlin","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good morning guys. Nice overall results here. Just one clarification on the Merchant Solutions side, can you \u2013 I realize Worldpay is only in that number for 2 months of the quarter, can you give us a sense for one what the whether or not that legacy business is still running at that sort of 10% organic growth number, it\u2019s been running at. And then also just within that, can you give a sense for how e-com and integrated are tracking. E-com in particular just I realize that\u2019s a small piece of the business but just so critical to the overall growth? Thank you.","Woody Woodall","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. We tried to highlight last quarter, we expected a little noise related to the transaction in the third quarter and we only had two months in there, that probably impacted by roughly a point negatively in the quarter. We also saw technology solutions in the old Worldpay nomenclature mid to high teens with continued momentum and expectation of that mid to high teens type level both e-com and integrated had very strong quarters as we expected. And we continue to see that through both the fourth quarter with a call out of expecting 10% growth for the Merchant Solutions group in the fourth quarter and continuing that momentum into 2020.","Gary Norcross","Yes, Lisa to build on that, we kind of highlighted in the prepared remarks on our e-commerce sales success. We saw really nice sales win and that in those sales wins accelerating from a cross-sell standpoint with 23 wins this quarter compared to last quarter. So everything I would tell you, we are seeing good strong results and actually to your point, e-commerce is very, very important to the overall growth strategy and continued leadership in that space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos","Hey, good morning guys and let me add my congrats on a strong quarter.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, George.","George Mihalos","If we can just dig in a little bit on that last question specific to the tech solutions, I think, Woody you said it was growing kind of in the mid to high teens that would seem to suggest that e-com \u2013 I would think e-com is kind of still growing in that 20%ish range. So, one, is that the right way to think about it? And then you had a lot of momentum with cross-sells and the like, just curious is servicing marketplace is a big opportunity for that e-com business or is it more kind of blocking and tackling and getting sort of a full suite for merchants that you might be servicing offline and trying to get the online business?","Woody Woodall","Yes, I will get the first question and maybe let Gary guess the second half of it. We talked about integrated or the old technology solutions growing roughly mid to high teens within if you break that down even further we would anticipate e-com in the fourth quarter and into 2020 to stay close to that 20% level and feel very good about the momentum in that business right now. Within the third quarter, specifically, it was in the mid to high-teens when you normalize some wins from last year, but very pleased with the overall growth of that business and anticipate it to continue to stay at those nearly 20% levels in the e-com.","Gary Norcross","Yes. And George to build on that, I think it\u2019s important when we talk about e-com, we are talking about really pure-play level online acquiring. So, when you think about brick-and-mortar moving to online that really falls up under our omni-channel deployments. So now our e-com business which is pure-play really is growing very, very high as Woody just said greater than 20%. I think the cross-sell wins are important indicators. Even in the first quarter we did 16 of those, second quarter came in at 14 wins and then Q3 at 23 wins. So, Mark Shane and the group are really doing a nice job continuing to grow that business.","George Mihalos","That\u2019s great. Really, really appreciate that. And just one more if I can kind of sneak in, when you look at kind of the synergies on the revenue side, is there any way to think about that opportunity in near-term kind of domestic U.S. versus international maybe where you might be seeing some more momentum?","Woody Woodall","Yes, I would anticipate we expect it to come out of the gate strong. We highlighted debit routing is some of it. I will say more of that in the U.S. right now, but I would tell you we are actually slightly ahead of plan on our revenue synergies coming out of the first couple of months and feel very good about executing that, but more of that in the run-rate right now would have been in the U.S.","Gary Norcross","Yes, I mean, I think George just building on that, if you look at our revenue stream, more than 70% of our revenue streams in the U.S. So naturally our cross-sells, naturally our revenue synergies is just going to be heavily weighted toward the U.S. But I think you\u2019re going to see our revenue synergies really pretty much in alignment with the way the revenue falls as the company. So we will see nice opportunities outside the U.S. as well. We highlight the Brazil opportunity that we just signed and there will be more that come online, but just given where the book falls in general in all of these revenues are going to be cross-sell up-sell pull through data utilization, etcetera. The revenue synergies will predominantly fall in the same manner as our current revenue.","George Mihalos","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey. Good morning guys. How are you?","Gary Norcross","Great, Jason.","Jason Kupferberg","So I just wanted to ask following up from last quarter, when I think you had indicated that the deal should be modestly accretive to adjusted EPS in 2020 and that was relative to the standalone FIS number of I believe $6.16. I just wanted to see if you wanted to put a finer point on the magnitude of accretion, we should be thinking about in 2020, especially since you have now raised the expense synergy target for next year?","Woody Woodall","Yes, I am not going to give 2020 guidance today on the call, but I would tell you that gives us incremental confidence on both remarks I made last quarter which we are approaching 7% organic revenue growth, has incremental confidence on that coming out of the gate with strong revenue synergies and then accretive to that $6.16 number you mentioned there, I have incremental confidence on that and we look at the overall increase in the cost synergies next year, but not giving a finer point on it at this point. We will give more color in February when we actually outline the 2020 guide specifically.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, fair enough. Just as a follow-up, wanted to get your latest observations in terms of some of the smaller competitors in the market that tend to be turned more to the cloud-based competitors in core banking, there was a bit of chatter on that topic 2020 last week. So I just wanted to get your perspective especially as more of the neo banks keep popping up?","Gary Norcross","Yes. I know, I think we keep highlighting throughout our calls. Obviously, we would say we are the leader in cloud-based computing today at this point in time and financial services given all of our data center consolidation and us consolidating the vast, vast majority of all of that work to the cloud today. Some of the things we are doing with technology really hasn\u2019t been seen in the industry before. When you look at our application stack of bringing online, our next generation cloud-based applications you\u2019re seeing success. And we\u2019ve announced several wins on the call, and we have several more coming on specifically core banking. So whether you\u2019re looking at our omni-channel digital experience is Digital One full cloud-based type technology you are also \u2013 we have announced several wins on our core banking next generation core banking platform and actually have one of those online as well. So we think we respect that there is always going to be competitors in the industry. But given our position, given our scale, given our historical investment and timing, we think we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of the next generation of technology in computing in the industry.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. Well, thanks for the comments and congrats on the quarter.","Woody Woodall","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning. Good to see the strong sales growth in bookings growth, Gary and Woody.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, David.","Woody Woodall","Thanks, David.","David Togut","Given the strength you have seen in bookings and this looks to be the third consecutive quarter of core FIS in the mid single-digits. Should we expect this mid single-digit growth rate in Banking Solutions to be sustainable into 2020 given the seven consecutive quarters of strong bookings you put up?","Woody Woodall","Yes, I think that\u2019s right, David. The way the business flows we anticipate sales growth driving revenue growth. So as we are seeing that sales growth for several quarters gives us good visibility and we would expect that mid single-digit growth that we highlighted last quarter in the banking segment to continue through 2020 and have a high level of confidence and visibility into that as we continue to click off months of sales.","David Togut","Understood. And then the big win you called out Gary in Brazil in Merchant, how does the pipeline look for cross-selling Merchant business in Brazil going into 2020?","Gary Norcross","I would say holistically, the pipeline for cross-sell for merchant across all of our customers looks very good, right. I mean, we were excited about the Brazil win. But when I look more holistically on a global basis in some of the things that we have going on in the sales channel with regards to Merchant, I am very excited about that overall business and our ability to cross-sell into our customer base. The response has been very strong since the closure.","David Togut","Understood. Just a quick housekeeping question, for the third quarter, what would total revenue and EBITDA have been if Worldpay were included for the full quarter?","Woody Woodall","I don\u2019t have the dollar amounts of revenue David. I would tell you that will be slightly under the 6% number as we had some of the noise from the transaction in there. We do still anticipate full year pro forma revenue as if Worldpay would have been in since January at right at 6%.","David Togut","Understood. Thank you very much.","Gary Norcross","Thank you, David.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. Maybe just touch a little more on the driver supporting the strong growth in the legacy FIS side for a minute just because I know bookings have been good, but just more particularly, what\u2019s driving that 5% on cap markets. I know that you expected to accelerate to get it was definitely a rate we haven\u2019t seen much in a while on that segment. So that\u2019s great to see. But that segment as well as even the banking side. I mean, I know you just said it would be sustainable maybe a little bit more of detail around what\u2019s driving that sustainability now? And I just want to hone in on one follow-up. Go ahead Gary.","Gary Norcross","No, go ahead Darrin, get your follow-up questions.","Darrin Peller","Yes, I mean really just trying to understand when you combine that, if that\u2019s stable. If you combine that with the traction we\u2019re seeing on the cross- sells you went through on the Merchant side, right, whether it\u2019s the cross-sells manifold pay and some of those synergies, just talk about timing on when we would expect those to come on? When do you expect the revenue from legacy cross-sells manifold pay deals you did to actually start showing up in revenue. Some of the clients you won last year. And then where are we on the rewards, NICE and the car production build out?","Gary Norcross","Okay. So look a lot in there, let\u2019s back up to the base banking business, capital markets business and acceleration capital markets specifically. We talked about last quarter that we were seeing acceleration in capital markets. One of the things that we\u2019re real pleased with is actually license being capital markets were flat. We actually saw an acceleration, we\u2019ve been telling the market for some time that we are seeing this movement from licensing on premise to deploying our technologies and our SaaS model. That\u2019s back to our investment in innovation and back to investment in technology and leveraging cloud-based computing technology, so all of that is playing huge dividends for us when you look at our scale. So we expect to see capital markets continue to accelerate in Q4 based on that investment. Banking as well, we are at an interesting inflection point in the industry. We really have a lot of legacy technologies in market, and frankly we started those investments as I said, more than three years ago where FIS started investing heavily in new innovation where we really pivoted our spend from legacy technologies to the future. You saw that impact our growth rates in the short-term, because frankly we were spending our capital dollars in areas where we didn\u2019t have product to deploy against, but now you\u2019re seeing the timing work out very well for FIS, where our customers are looking to take advantage of some of these lower their total cost of ownership, improve their overall digital experience across their end customers and that\u2019s all resonating not only in our sales pipeline, but you are seeing our closings. I mean those are very strong results on sales now for seven consecutive quarters. So whether you are looking at Merchant, where we are leading and e-commerce, high valued e-commerce, high valued technology integration, banking or capital markets that key theme plays out very well and is really playing into our accelerated growth rate significantly.","Woody Woodall","If you are looking at the specifics on timing of revenue synergies, they will ramp over the course of the year, next year. We\u2019re starting to see some of those cross-sales from the Worldpay Vantiv flow into the actual results now, and they were built into our expectations as we outlined those last quarter and we\u2019ll see the new revenue synergies sort of flowing through over the course of the year, next year.","Darrin Peller","Okay, alright. Just one last quick follow-up, I mean, the RFPs that we are hearing about on e-com sounds like they\u2019ve accelerated maybe even 2 to 3 times what they were last year for gateway consolidation. Are you seeing the same thing and it seems like there is maybe only four or five key players winning a lot of that bulk of those RFPs. What kind of win rates are you seeing, obviously the 23 you announced is a good sign of that?","Gary Norcross","Yes. Now look, I mean, we are seeing obviously increased demand for our solution set, I mean e-commerce is doing very well. We think there is really three significant players in the space today. And clearly, we are the lead global player in that mix. And you are seeing that in our cross-sell wins. And the team just doing a really nice job of selling into this key high growth secular market and you will continue to see us ramping that up and also the revenue associated with that and driving into the results as Woody talked about.","Darrin Peller","Alright. Thanks guys. Great.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thanks. Hi, Gary. Hi, Woody.","Gary Norcross","Hi Ashwin. How are you?","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Hey, good, good. Thank you. These are good results. Appreciate the raise very solid. Can I start with, I know you are not providing 2020 guidance, but investors are clearly focused on the future. So perhaps maybe I can start by asking, our led things investors should watch out for from a modeling perspective as they put down more granular numbers any quarterly trends, the cadence of synergies coming in any comp things to watch out for?","Woody Woodall","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. We continue to add color. I would tell you, first quarter comps next year have some challenge and maybe you remember this year Banking had a very strong first quarter of 2019. They had some tailwinds in it. So there is some comps in there. We anticipate revenue synergies to increment over the course of the year as they take form from achieved to realizing them in the P&L. So we\u2019ll see that. We tried to give some color around merchant being at roughly 10% going into 2020 with good line of sight. Banking to be mid single-digits and the Capital Markets group to be low single-digits with some optimism on Capital Markets as we continue to see the quality of that revenue, the recurring nature of that revenue continue to increase. But we have incrementally more confidence in a 7% or approaching 7% organic growth in 2020 and certainly have incremental more confidence on the comment regarding it being accretive to the $6.16 I mentioned last quarter. So those would be some incremental color points Ashwin as we go into 2020.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Now, thank you for that. And then I know as a company both you guys and legacy Worldpay, always been sort of focused on reinvesting. So when you talk of increased synergies, is that a gross number. Is that a a net number and the reinvestments, what are the focus areas for you now. And then sort of clarification, obviously you guys have announced new headquarters. Could you just kind of provide the capital allocation on that?","Woody Woodall","Yes, the synergy number is a number net of dis-synergies, if you will. So things that we would have to invest related to the transaction, specifically would be netted into that number. To the extent we decided to invest further in other areas we would obviously call that out in a different way, but that synergy numbers, net of dis-synergies within the overall guide for 2020. We are or just announced, we will be building a new headquarters here in Jacksonville, effectively consolidating existing \u2013 three existing spaces that we have today in Jacksonville and we\u2019ll expand and grow some incremental jobs. We continue to grow the overall company. It is in our overall guidance. It is our overall capital allocation and would not change anything that we\u2019ve outlined already.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff","Good morning, Gary, Woody and Nate.","Gary Norcross","Hey Brett.","Woody Woodall","Good morning Brett.","Brett Huff","Two questions. One to follow-up on Brazil, we are pretty excited about that opportunity given the limited US presence there. Gary, you talked about a big bank referral win which is great. Can you tell us a little bit about your strategy going forward? Are we going to lead with e-com, are you going to lead with sort of integrated arena lead are you trying to leverage the issuing relationships we have down there. Can you kind of give us a sense of that? And then number two question is, the 25% sales increase or bookings increase was that organic including Worldpay kind of just I want to make sure that I understand what that number is? Thank you.","Gary Norcross","Yes, the first, let\u2019s get the second question first. The 25% is an organic growth number, right. And we have been very consistent on the quarters that we disclosed that. Back to Brazil, obviously what we will continue to focus on, we have been driving heavily into e-commerce and we want to continue to make sure that we leverage e-commerce, where we can appropriately in Brazil, certainly a great opportunity for us on that. But with that being said, we also want to make sure that we take advantage of \u2013 we have got a really good, strong client base in Brazil and we want to make sure that we are partnering with those clients in a way and adding value to through cross-sells and up-sells as well. So it will be a combination of both. But I would tell you in general given what we are seeing in that high gross secular market, we prefer to lead with e-commerce and in any point we can on the Merchant side.","Brett Huff","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","Dave Koning","Yes. Thanks guys. Good job.","Gary Norcross","Thanks, Dave.","Woody Woodall","Thanks, Dave.","Dave Koning","Yes. And I guess just first of all on the Merchant segment, is it easiest just to think about the legacy tech solutions high teens in the legacy merchant part low single-digits and that just blends to about 10% over time. And then as part of that is merchant growing low single-digits and can that actually get better like the merchant the old legacy Merchant segment?","Woody Woodall","That\u2019s a rough way to think about Dave. I mean, there are some pieces that were moved around as you know. We certainly saw very good growth in both integrated and e-com and trying to highlight some color on that. One of the theories we had is that the traditional business we could improve and grow faster and I think we\u2019ll see that over time as it flows into the numbers. I think it\u2019s a rough way to think about it. We\u2019re trying to highlight that merchant on a go-forward basis, we anticipate Q4 to be about 10% and in 2020 to be roughly a 10% number, which aligns with that high-single low-double digit comment that we\u2019ve talked about over the past couple of quarters. I feel very good about where the business is health of the very strong growers and our ability to drive some incremental growth in some of the slower business.","Gary Norcross","Yes, I mean in general, Dave. I think the way to think about it is, obviously, we are going to focus on high-growth secular trends that are occurring across our various market segments, right. And so, naturally, we\u2019re going to be focusing heavily in merchant on technology and high valued e-commerce, because there is a very strong secular growth trends there. With that being said [indiscernible] and the team \u2013 broader team are doing an excellent job as well with the traditional merchant business. So we\u2019re not going to turn it back on these other businesses, but you will see us continue to focus on where we see high secular growth capital markets, we are seeing a lot going on in RegTech, which is why we highlighted the Consolidated Audit Trail success there. So anywhere we see these higher secular growth trends we\u2019re going to sell into and we think we\u2019ve got excellent technology to deliver against them and you\u2019ll absolutely see those just grow at a much higher growth rate.","Dave Koning","Great, thanks. And just one follow-up on Q4, it seems like the guidance implies growth to be reasonably similar to Q3 unless, I\u2019m mistaken, but I know you talked about merchant accelerating, I think capital markets accelerating. Is banking about the same? Maybe just so you can kind of take the three segments and say which ones accelerating and decelerating relative to the total company Q4 guidance?","Woody Woodall","Yes, I think you\u2019ve got merchant continue to accelerate off of Q3. We anticipate Capital Markets to continue to accelerate off of Q3, and banking closer to the Q3 number as it faces a little more difficult comps in the fourth quarter. Net-net, you\u2019re seeing the increase in the fourth quarter on the guide, basically being driven by revenue synergies. And we already had some of those that revenue and cost synergies baked into the original Q4 guidance overall, and we believe it\u2019s balanced Dave.","Dave Koning","Great. Thanks. Nice job.","Woody Woodall","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Bob Napoli","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the question.","Woody Woodall","Good morning Bob.","Bob Napoli","Just with the acquisition now of Worldpay, I was just wondering what the thoughts were on your M&A? I understand you\u2019re very tied in right now with integrating and cross-selling, but I would imagine that you\u2019re generating, so much cash flow, you are thinking about \u2013 I am sure you are thinking about an M&A strategy. I just wanted to, if there is any change or any thought and how you\u2019re thinking about M&A, in the future as you get more into the integration of the two companies?","Gary Norcross","Yes, Bob, at the highest level, there is really no change. I mean, obviously, we\u2019re very focused on integrating the Worldpay transaction. With that being said, we will do, even now we\u2019ll do small tuck-in type acquisitions to augment growth in areas that we\u2019re seeing going on in the segments. As you said, we\u2019ve got plenty of cash flow to not only pay down the debt as Woody described, but also not only to continue to maintain our dividend going forward, but also to make small tuck-in acquisitions. Once we feel like we\u2019ve got the integration of Worldpay behind us, we want to make sure that we drive accelerate growth we\u2019re looking for also drive the accelerated shareholder value. We\u2019ll then look to see if there is some broader M&A activity. But M&A is going to continue to play an important role in our strategy as we look for ways to accelerate our growth further.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. And just a follow-up on the outlook for EBITDA margins by segments. As you think about that over not only into 2020, but long term, any thoughts on how we should think about which areas we\u2019ll see the most expansion in margins?","Woody Woodall","Yes, I think you\u2019ll see expansion across all three segments particularly as corporate costs get leveraged into those segments. You\u2019ll see incremental probably in merchant and banking and some of the most of the revenue synergies are driven out of those two segments, but you will see margin expansion across all.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vasu Govil with KBW. Please go ahead.","Vasu Govil","Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a great quarter.","Gary Norcross","Thank you.","Woody Woodall","Thank you.","Vasu Govil","I guess the first question on the Worldpay and Vantis cost synergies, are you still tracking in line to deliver that $250 million number that you had called out? And then as we think about the revenue synergies, do you have any updated thoughts given that you have seen this acceleration in deal signings. So it could be tracking better than the $100 million number that you\u2019re doing out there before?","Woody Woodall","Yes, on the cost side, we are really kind of close that out last quarter at the $250 million number. So most of the tracking at this point of that is behind us and we\u2019re focused on integrating the new Worldpay with FIS. With regard to the $100 million of revenue synergies that was previously outlined, we anticipate more of that to flow into 2020. But I think that\u2019s roughly in line with the original expectations as you are seeing us call out those cross- sells, and feel very confident that that\u2019s still a good number.","Vasu Govil","Great. And just a quick follow-up on the strong new sales number, can you give us a little bit color maybe on sort of what the composition of that new sales looks like, where you were seeing more strength? And then you also noted the backlog accelerated to 9%, I think it was 7% last quarter. Does that mean we are running ahead of track for 2020 or is there a different sort of interpretation of that?","Gary Norcross","Yes. No, most of our sales success what we are seeing obviously, we highlighted a number of key wins, but you\u2019re really seeing it around our new technology, new innovation, new solutioning drive we highlighted the merger of two very large regional banks coming together to form almost $50 billion institution and they selected to come with FIS, even though the other bank that was acquiring our bank. So, and that\u2019s all just based on the innovations around core bank processing, which was a question highlighted earlier and also our omni-channel digital experience. We\u2019re also seeing it across all of our real-time faster payments type solutions. We have highlighted a lot on this call around merchant. Certainly in Capital Markets, we are seeing strong growth in regtech and some of the other areas. What I am really excited about is just how much of it is really now coming into our full blown SaaS models. Right. We\u2019ve talked a lot about this on \u2013 on this quarter, it was really nice to see Capital Markets grow with actually flat license fees and accelerated \u2013 significant acceleration on the SaaS deployment of software, and so it really gives us high confidence as we lean into \u2013 going into next year. And as Woody talked about our accelerated growth targets, so all of that makes us feel really good about what we are seeing going into 2020.","Vasu Govil","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Neill with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Neill","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of the detailed questions have been asked and answered. I was wondering though if we could bring it back to, I think it was the final slide of the merger deck or you talked about the promise of the end-to-end connectivity between issuer data and acquiring and I think the view that this could bring a durable competitive advantage to off rates and fraud rates longer term. And so I know it\u2019s only a few months in, but have the teams kind of met, has the data pool has been sort of discussed and shared or maybe you could articulate kind of how that longer term synergy process is starting to take shape?","Gary Norcross","Yes, no, I think it\u2019s a great question, Matt. Absolutely the teams have met, we have got a full plan around improving our off rates and reducing our fraud rates. The whole end-to-end we are evaluating this even closed loop makes sense. So there is a lot of opportunities here that the combined asset pool of the combined company can drive into the future. As we have talked about on prior calls, really need to look at those things starting to come online, 18 months, and after because there is work. I mean, Woody highlighted, even our loyalty as a currency where we\u2019re bringing that online in a fully integrated manner in the first half of next year. So we do have to do work as we put these together, but the quick answer is, the teams are highly engaged. Excuse me, and we\u2019ve got a lot of governance around that and we will continue to drive to that because we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity on that in the 18 months out timeframe.","Matt O\u2019Neill","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Damian Wille","Hi guys. Good morning. This is Damian on for Ramsey. I wanted to ask on the PIN debit routing you called that out as the driver of the revenue synergies this quarter. Is that opportunity largely complete now or is there more to go there and what would you view is the sort of next synergy driver that you will focus on?","Gary Norcross","No, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s complete at all. I think Woody was just trying to highlight something that drove a big piece of the early synergies win that we highlighted. There were other things that were in that number as well. But as we look for opportunities to leverage our scale whether it\u2019s in debit routing, merchant referral services, even some of the things we talked about on the last question that will continue to drive and accelerate the revenue. We really have identified six major areas that we\u2019re focused on today. The teams have rallied around those. We\u2019ve built detailed plans around that, whether it\u2019s investment in software for development purposes etc or just sales plans and sales tactics and execution, and I can tell you we are way down the path on all of those major categories. And as we come in the future quarters. We\u2019ll give you more and more highlights as we see that revenue ramp. But you know, last quarter, we increased the amount of revenue for next year from a cross-sell standpoint. Given the quick out of the huge success we\u2019ve had, we\u2019re actually very excited and feel that number is \u2013 we\u2019re certainly much more confident in that number as we go into it and then in future quarters, we\u2019ll give more and more detail for you.","Damian Wille","Yes, that\u2019s great. And then a follow-up, actually we have been talking a lot about Brazil today, maybe we could talk Brazil than a little bit more on India. I know you called that out, originally as a focus area, maybe you could give us more color on just what exists in your India business today how much of it is ATM versus core versus the card processing and then which of those businesses you expect to lever the most in the context of this Worldpay cross-sell?","Gary Norcross","Yes. Look, I mean, we have talked a lot in the past. Obviously, we have got a large ATM business in India. We have got a lot of large now in growing core banking business in India. We were very successful in leveraging a lot of the new charters that were launched in India as a mandate by the government. So we have successfully launched those. We will leverage obviously those customers to cross-sell further payment capabilities and we talked about e-commerce, which we think there is a real opportunity to leverage more e-com in India as well, but it\u2019s really going to be a combination of all of our capabilities that will continue to allow us to accelerate our India growth rates.","Damian Wille","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thanks so much. It looks like a great start to Worldpay. I heard the 9% organic growth in the backlog, Gary, how about underlying retention and pricing? Is that moving up or holding up as well in driving your acceleration comment next year?","Gary Norcross","Yes, you know what, what I would tell you Tien-tsin, we have talked about this in the plan. We are not seeing any acceleration loss rates or pricing compression has been a fact for years in our banking and capital markets business, so we \u2013 and we are not seeing really an acceleration of that as well. I mean it seems to be pretty consistent. I would tell you, I don\u2019t think its necessary slowing, but we feel great about the share we\u2019re winning and feel great about our competitive positions. But we don\u2019t see that as an accelerating headwind going into next year and it gives us that much more confidence as we look into next year.","Tien-tsin Huang","Good. It\u2019s encouraging. Just two quick clarifications. The merchant bank deals, the U.S. and the Brazil and maybe just the short-term pipeline as well. I\u2019m curious, are this mostly the Novo merchant bank deals, just curious how quickly those things can ramp and then also on capital markets can we say that you have reached an inflection there with converting from licensing to just asset deals?","Gary Norcross","Well, let\u2019s go to the first one that is both of the merchant deals were competitive takeaways. And so we\u2019re excited about that. When you look at capital markets opportunity that we\u2019ve talked about, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re at the inflection point. Q4 naturally has a heavy license component and always has been. We talked about how we have got a balance from a sales standpoint of our license grow over compared to our SaaS model. We think this quarter was just a great execution by the team, they really did just a really nice job with that management, and so it\u2019s certainly is a strong indicator, you will see reoccurring revenue in capital markets continue to accelerate. But we\u2019re still \u2013 it will still be next couple of years before we get truly license fees down in a range, what you\u2019re seeing in banking, which is a very small percentage.","Tien-tsin Huang","Understood. Thank you for the update.","Woody Woodall","Thanks Tien-tsin.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question today comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Joseph Foresi","Hi, just two quick ones to wrap up. Maybe you could give us a little bit more color of your on the ground conversation with banks, particularly in the merchant services, how that conversation is going, what pricing looks like because obviously it\u2019s been coming down over a long period of time. And then I\u2019ll ask my second one upfront as well. Just the delta on the upside on the cost synergies, when we get to the top end of the range, where do you think you might be able to extend the cost synergies and what functions would you be looking at?","Gary Norcross","I\u2019ll take the first one on the merchant conversations. I think if you look, one of the things that we were excited about when we put the combination Worldpay together was just how much they have spent on next generation technologies themselves, right. So you look at FIS, we have talked a lot about our modernization efforts, our transformation efforts. I would tell you Worldpay what they are very similar process whether it\u2019s their acquiring platform in the UK or frankly stuff, they have done with high valued integrated payments and then e-commerce, and so when we are talking to our bank referrals for merchant referral programs, they see the benefits of that investment, they see the technology and what it can drive and how it can help them differentiate and actually grow their revenue streams. From a pricing standpoint, like all the industries, it\u2019s price competitive out there. And we think our scale allows us to compete in the investments we\u2019ve made. We think it allows us to compete in that category very, very effectively. Are we seeing increases in price competition honestly I\u2019m not from my chair. But I would tell you it\u2019s always been price competitive. Alright, and I think FIS is in a real good position to compete on that.","Woody Woodall","On the cost synergy side, I think we are really pleased with where we are. At announcement day we started out with a roughly $400 million of cost synergies, we increase that to $500 million on the second quarter call. We increased that to greater than $500 million today, while we\u2019re not end of job, we continue to focus. I think the teams are very good and continue to drive costs out of the business and we\u2019ve got a long history of being able to overdrive our synergy targets.","Joseph Foresi","Thank you.","Gary Norcross","I am excited about the strength of our performance following the Worldpay acquisition and the progress we\u2019ve made in bringing our two great teams together. I would like to thank our more than 55,000 associates across the globe who are working hard everyday to deliver exceptional results for our clients and shareholders. If you have any questions, following today\u2019s call, please reach out to our Investor Relations team. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the future of FIS and I want to thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the FIS First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Peter Gunnlaugsson. Please go ahead, sir.","Pete Gunnlaugsson - SVP, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations","Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FIS' first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Turning to slide two, Gary Norcross, President and Chief Executive Officer, will begin with a summary of our financial performance followed by a market review. Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with the financial results for the quarter. Today's news release and the supplemental slide presentation are available on our website at fisglobal.com.","Please turn to slide three. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the Safe Harbor language.","Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide more meaningful comparisons between the periods presented. These non-GAAP measures are outlined on slide three as well. Reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP results are provided in the attachments to the press release and in the appendix of the supplemental slide presentation.","With that, I will turn the call over to Gary to discuss the first quarter financial highlights on slide five. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Starting on slide five, we finished the quarter with an increase in revenue of $1.6 billion, reflecting a 2% reported revenue growth while adjusted earnings per share was down 4% from the prior year quarter. Fundamentally, our Integrated Financial Solutions segment had a solid quarter while our Global Financial Solutions segment was presented with a number of challenges that will continue into Q2.","In the quarter, we were negatively impacted in our Global segment by changes in foreign exchange rates, continued slow higher margin product sales, a project delay on a previously announced large scale transformational project, and a large non-bank contract that did not meet our profitability metrics.","We also experienced the lowest level of termination fees due to bank consolidation we have seen in the last 11 quarters. While this initially creates some challenges in our IFS segment first half comparisons, overall it translates into a lower client churn and replacement cost. Adjusted for these one-time fees, reported revenue growth would have resulted in 5% top line and 7% bottom line growth in the IFS segment.","The combination of all these factors impacted our Q1 results and prompted the change in guidance for the quarter and the full year which we announced on April 9. Consistent with our growth strategy and in line with me becoming CEO, we have resegmented the company to give greater transparency around the drivers for FIS as well as highlight the potential value for expansion due to the two diverse businesses that we currently operate.","These two segments are the Integrated Financial Solutions segment, which focuses primarily on regional and community-based financial institutions in the United States, and Global Financial Solutions segment, which serves global and international financial institutions. We will continue to leverage our technology investment and scale across both market segments while we capitalize on growth opportunities created by the fundamentally different needs and buying patterns of each of these respective markets. This segmentation will also enable more accurate comparison of these segments against the unique competitors in their respective markets to drive overall long-term shareholder value.","Next, I'll define the business conditions and strategy for each segment as well as provide business insight on their performance in the quarter. Woody will provide some additional insight into the financial performance of these segments for the quarter as well as additional metrics we're now reporting.","Turning to slide 6, served by our new Integrated Financial Solutions segment, U.S.-based regional and community institutions traditionally buy end-to-end integrated and outsourced solutions. These institutions value partners that offer a total solution package and on an outsourced basis, invest in new ways that allow them to more effectively compete with the largest global money center banks. Due to continued bank consolidations, this is a slower growing but solid market segment where FIS can leverage its scale and solution integration to generate attractive margins and to drive a significant highly recurring revenue base.","The fundamentals of IFS segment are strong. They had a good first quarter when looking beyond the lower term fees that will continue into Q2 but improve in the back half of the year. As banks continue to move beyond the increased burden of regulatory environment and economic recovery, we should see continued increase in investment decisions which should also increase reported revenue growth in the back half of the year.","From a sales standpoint for IFS, we closed a number of long-term outsourcing deals including a large multi-billion dollar bank that is utilizing our core digital banking and item processing capabilities, demonstrating our continued ability to deliver a comprehensive outsourced solution.","Wealth management also continues to perform well for the company. As an example, we signed a new long-term agreement with Argent Financial. This win combines our trust platform solution with a full suite of outsourced back office services. This agreement was just one of our wealth wins this quarter and a solid proof of how last year's acquisition of Reliance Trust is creating new wealth management opportunities. These types of successes coupled with others within our Integrated Financial Solutions segment have allowed a year-over-year increase in new contract value sales for five consecutive quarters. Additionally, we just completed one of our largest client conferences, hosting record client and prospect attendants. Feedback and client engagement was extremely positive with strong opportunities being generated as a result.","Turning to the Global Financial Solutions segment, these clients have a greater demand for outcome-based intellectual property-led services and an increased willingness to outsource solutions and services to drive cost reductions and transformation. They have a strong desire to innovate, particularly in the consumer-oriented channels, and value partners that have the agility to develop and bring solutions to market at scale and across geographic boundaries. This is a higher growth market where we generate lower margins due to the high mix of professional services including consulting, IT integration and business process outsourcing.","Over the last four quarters, our higher margin product sales in our GFI market have not met our expectations. Meanwhile, our consulting business and our intellectual property-led reoccurring services continue to accelerate, causing us a mix problem with regards to revenue and profits. Based on these results and as Woody and I have discussed on prior calls, we are restructuring our two former divisions of Global Financial Institutions and International Financial Institutions.","As part of this restructuring, we also have moved all appropriate products and product sales that serve global requirements into our GFS segment. In making these adjustments we expect margin expansion to occur over time in this segment as we gain scale and continue to rationalize our operations. The restructuring of these two significant divisions will continue in Q2. These adjustments as well as a resolution to a number of the prior mentioned headwinds for this segment will accelerate our revenue and profit growth in the back half of the year.","Despite these challenges we did see a number of very nice wins in the quarter. We saw significant increases in our consulting business in Europe and North America and are in final negotiations on a number of key outsourcing transactions. Asia continues to be a strong market with rapid growth. We extended that success with the recently signed engagement with Karnataka Bank to deliver an entirely new eLobby self-service channel. In addition, we continue our success in the auto finance market, signing a significant outsourcing agreement with the financial subsidiary of a top automobile manufacturer in North America.","Turning to slide seven, I'd like to summarize the quarter before I turn it over to Woody for the financial report by saying Q1 was clearly a more challenging quarter than expected for FIS. We continued to grow revenue and return cash to shareholders, demonstrating the consistency of our business model, but we did not achieve the results we had expected. The restructuring and resegmentation of our business enables us to achieve operational efficiencies and better combat timing and revenue mix changes that occur with large complex deals such as in our GFS segment. Our new segmentation model better aligns our service and solution sets to clients bearing requirements and enables us to leverage FIS' scale to more effectively propel our clients' business forward.","We are confident that our business model, proven execution and deep client relationships will continue to enable us to drive profitable growth, maintain the strength of our balance sheet and return value to our shareholders.","Woody will now provide details around our Q1 performance. Woody?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Gary. I will begin on slide nine with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. The first quarter consolidated revenue increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis to $1.6 billion. EBITDA was $425 million, a decline of 5% from the prior year period, with EBITDA margin declining 190 basis points to 27.4% compared to 29.3% in the prior year.","Non-GAAP adjusted net earnings from continuing operations decreased to $186 million from $199 million and adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the prior-year period.","Our results for the quarter reflect the negative impacts from lower termination fees, increased investment in our European capabilities and a scope modification delay of a significant project which adversely impacted the quarter. In addition, the quarter was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.","Non-GAAP results for the quarter are adjusted to exclude $0.12 per share for acquisition-related purchase price amortization, $0.10 per share related to the global restructuring activities and $0.03 per share related to acquisition, integration and severance costs.","The global restructuring charge is a result of our resegmentation and alignment of resources in our Global Financial Solutions segment. The activities relate primarily to Europe and are a combination of optimizing onshore and offshore resources as well as the removal of overlapping management resources.","As Gary mentioned, we resegmented the business into two new reportable segments, the Integrated Financial Solutions segment and the Global Financial Solutions segment. We're also providing additional financial and operating metrics which we believe provide greater visibility and transparency into each segment and the key drivers we monitor to operate the business. This resegmentation provides flexibility and more clearly differentiates the market dynamics and gives better comparisons of our results to our competitors.","I will now continue on slide 10 for the first quarter segment results. In the first quarter, Integrated Financial Solutions revenue grew 2% on a reported basis to $969 million. Termination fees were $28 million lower compared to the prior year period. Integrated Financial Solutions EBITDA for the quarter decreased 1% to $379 million. EBITDA margin was 39.1%, down from 40.2% in the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower termination fees.","Turning to slide 11, you'll see new details on revenue contribution and growth from banking, business and payment solutions, and revenue composition for the period. We're also providing metrics regarding outsourced accounts processed and transaction volumes, both which are key metrics underlying the recurring revenue of the business.","For the first quarter, this segment had 89% recurring revenue. Banking solutions grew 12%, driven by our acquisition of Reliance Trust and cross-selling and upselling new products into our existing clients. Business solutions grew 4%, primarily driven by card production. Our payment solutions revenue was down 4%, primarily driven by a termination fee headwind from the prior year period.","Turning to slide 12, in the first quarter, Global Financial Solutions revenue increased 1% on a reported basis to $587 million. The reported results for GFS reflect a negative foreign currency translation revenue impact of $45 million for the quarter and the previously announced non-renewal of a non-bank contract. On a constant currency basis, Global revenue grew 8%.","Global Financial Solutions EBITDA decreased 14% to $90 million. EBITDA margins were 15.4% These results were adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rates, the project delay, investment in expanding capabilities in the UK, lower than expected product sales and a heavier mix of services revenue which was partially offset by cost actions and lower incentives for the quarter.","Moving to slide 13, you will see our reporting metrics for Global Financial Solutions. We are including revenue growth by region in constant currency. For the quarter, Asia Pacific had strong growth of 45% driven primarily by the India ATM and our expanding core banking presence in India. Europe grew 16%, driven primarily by Clear2Pay and Capco consulting.","In North America, product sales and information technology outsourcing was slower than anticipated and, as expected, Latin America revenue growth remained slower due to macroeconomic conditions. We are also disclosing the revenue composition for the segment, 73% of GFS revenue is recurring in nature. The bottom half of the slide provides revenue by currency and our consulting and services head count. The largest global and international banks, the target market of the GFS segment, continue to focus their spending on services and consulting. This drives strong revenue growth but creates margin headwind with the change in revenue mix.","As disclosed in the 8-K filed a few weeks ago, corporate expenses directly related to supporting the segments, such as sales, finance and human resources, are now reflected in the segment results. For the quarter, corporate expenses not attributable to directly to the segments were $44 million. Please refer appendix material in the presentation for more information on the businesses and products for both segments.","Moving to slide 14, we continue to reinvest in our business. Adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $315 million for the first quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $101 million. We delivered free cash flow of $214 million for the quarter. These results are consistent with our previous guidance of free cash flow conversion to approximate adjusted net earnings.","For the quarter, we returned $223 million to shareholders. $150 was returned to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.2 million shares in the open market at an average cost of about $68 per share. The share repurchase program drove a 2% decrease in our weighted average diluted share count to 286.8 million. We returned $73 million to shareholders through dividends.","As of March 31st, debt outstanding was $5.2 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.7 times debt-to-EBITDA. The weighted average interest rate was 3% at the end of the quarter.","Moving on to slide 15, on April 9th, we adjusted our outlook for the full year. There were a number of moving parts to that change and I want to walk you through each one. First, M&A activity creates a tailwind to reported growth of approximately 2%. This is comprised of the 3% tailwind from acquisitions, primarily Clear2Pay and Reliance Trust, and 1% headwind from divestitures, primarily the Certegy Gaming business.","Second, we announced the non-renewal of a contract which created a 1% headwind to reported growth. This contract was not with a financial institution and had minimal profitability. Third, we had a project delay in Europe and high margin global product sales are not materializing as we anticipated, creating another 1% of headwind. Since providing our initial guidance on February 5th, we have continued to see pressure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This further decline of non-dollar currencies is expected to impact our full year reported growth by 4% or an additional 2% adverse change from our February guidance. We now expect reported revenue growth of 1% to 3%.","Moving to slide 16. In an effort to help with quarterly modeling of our full-year outlook, I will add some color on the second quarter and full year. The second quarter of 2015 will continue to see headwinds and difficult comparisons. The prior-year quarter included benefits of approximately $0.09 from termination fees and a discrete tax benefit. We do not expect to see similar benefits again in the second quarter of 2015.","Foreign currency exchange rate headwinds and the project delay will also adversely impact the second quarter. Our restructuring efforts to address the shift in GFS sales mix will benefit the third and fourth quarters more heavily. Based on these factors, we are now expecting second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.73 per diluted share.","As discussed, the first half of the year is challenging. The second half of 2015 will drive more earnings per share as we anniversary difficult comparisons and see the impacts of cost actions taken. Further, we expect the project delay issue to be behind us.","For the remainder of 2015, we expect reported revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3%. We expect margin expansion to continue into 2015 and will now be about 50 basis points. We expect 2015 adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.27 to $3.37, which is a 6% to 9% increase over 2014. This will be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year based on the items described above. And we expect free cash flow to approximate adjusted net earnings.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go directly to the line of Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for all the new disclosures. That's great.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dave.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I noticed a couple of things in there. It looked like core accounts, so core banking accounts have been trending a little bit lower the last few quarters and also ITO, BPO head count has been trending down a bit. Those are new disclosures, maybe you could just talk through those?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me give you a little color on that, it's kind of two things going on. As we talked about in the Integrated Financial Solutions segment, we continue to see a lot of consolidation and acquisition in that space. As you are very aware, in the U.S., that continues to be a consistent trend. So the sales team is doing a very nice job of selling through that and maintaining kind of consistent account volumes and that is contributing to our slower growth in that segment.","You do see one big drop which is really an interesting anomaly. We had a very large bank that actually had an in-house developed system, one of the only ones I can think of that's happened like this in the last three or four years, and they actually migrated in-house on their in-house developed system. It was a simple product offering. We extended a real robust services engagement from them, so that's the anomaly you see in the drop there.","When you go on to the ITO and BPO resources, frankly that's all Brazil. As Woody mentioned, we've got some serious macroeconomic issues in Brazil. It's really growing slow and as transaction volumes come down, you'd expect your call center agents to come down as well. So that's what's going on in that grouping.","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","The other area you're seeing in the first quarter around the ITO, BPO head count would be associated with the non-renewal of the contract, too, Dave.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, good point.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Okay, that makes sense. And then historically there has been quite a bit of seasonality in the second half of the year is always better than the first. But this year, obviously, it's a lot more than usual and requires almost $1 of EPS in each of the final two quarters. Is some of that going to be a new type of phenomenon? I guess, how do you get there?","And is there anything one-off in the second half this year? I know last year there was some one-off stuff in the first half. This year, is there going to be some one-time benefits in the second half?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","I think you've got a combination of items, Dave. To your first point, you definitely see more growth in the second half of our business than we do the first half. That has been a normal growing occurrence over the past several years and you can model something around that.","The second will be really around getting out from one the difficult comparisons where we've had term fees as a giant headwind in the first half of the year. We're actually seeing a little bit of tailwind in the back half of the year in terms of term fees year-over-year. The second would be getting the benefit of the cost actions that we're taking more in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and getting the project delay behind us. So, a combination of those items, we'll see a definite swing in the back half of the year compared to the first half of the year","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just final quick one. Your share count basically the last two quarters has been pretty stable. I know you've bought back quite a bit of stock. Just wondering why we haven't really seen the share count go down much?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think you've seen a couple of things. One, you've seen us buying back shares but you've seen the growth in the stock price over the past several quarters that's taking the diluted share count up a little bit associated with it. So you've got a combination of the two of those areas as well. Stock compensation is up slightly year-over-year. So we're seeing a little bit of that. But that's the big change, Dave, more than anything else.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning, Gary and Woody.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, David.","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Gary, what gives you the conviction that the actions you've taken in the first quarter are sufficient to put FIS back on a more consistent growth track? And I'm sort of asking the question looking beyond the second half. I recognize second half you have some easier comparisons but obviously major restructuring actions. So, maybe just fleshing out your thinking and what's behind your getting back on a growth trajectory?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, David, it's a great question. One of the things we've looked at in the global market very consistently as we've gone to that and we've disclosed to the market as well is we felt that there was an opportunity to pull more higher margin product sales into that business. As you see in what we disclosed this quarter, I think it was 2% was software license. What we continue to see over the last four quarters is we continue to see some of our license engagement slide from quarter-to-quarter. We're not seeing other people win those but we're also seeing them getting converted to complex services engagements where we leverage our software.","But frankly, it goes into either our outsourcing which you're actually seeing a ramp-up in Europe around our banking utility we're building out. And so, after four quarters of this consistently, we decided to actually take our former product division, which was IFI, and we took our former services division, GFI, and are putting those together. So, we're getting a lot of opportunity of moving some resources from very expensive countries to offshore. As you know that's been a consistent strategy for us for years.","We've also gotten some synergies in management. We've also gotten some synergies in go-to-market. So, you can tell by the severance costs, granted they're skewed because some of the countries that we had the resources in, but we had a lot of synergies between those two divisions. And that's going to continue through Q2 as we build out the go-to-market. We also, as I mentioned in my script, there is a number of large outsourcing engagements we're in the final negotiation stage of as well. So that makes us feel confident that the services concept.","So if you see in what we've disclosed, you'll see our intellectual property-led services consistently growing quarter-over-quarter and you'll see our software sales is a very small amount. So these two trends over the last year has allowed us to bring these things together. So we think we've made the necessary actions. We feel confident with the pipeline and all of the services led opportunities that we have in the pipeline and we're in final negotiations on a number of them.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. And then just shifting over to the GFI business, you announced a large investment in GFI, about $30 million at the beginning of last year. It sounds like that hasn't gotten the traction that you were expecting. Where do you stand right now with the large GFI initiative and the build-out of the those sales teams?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it actually has gotten traction. It's just gotten traction in more complex services and transformation. It really can be attributed to as you are seeing that growth occur. So they continue to drag and penetrate very nicely in those global institutions with some large transformational outsourcing deals. One of the things that's also interesting is a lot of that's leading into long-term contracts. So it's not a classic services business where you're having the book and build on a very short timeframe. We're getting a lot of long term. So that actually is gaining very nice traction.","The issue for us is just the elimination of really the software license as a material component of that business. That was something that we saw transitioning after 2008 but, frankly, it just \u2013 for whatever reason, as the market continues to evolve that type of business is not coming back. And now those clients are really looking for ways that we can leverage our talent, drive their cost down, and use our intellectual property to drive a different outcome for them. So really that GFI investment has done well. We did, as I just mentioned, though, as we went through the restructuring and we put these two groups together, we were able to get some efficiencies in some of our go-to-market overlap as well. So, long-term, it's going to be a good outcome for this group.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Are you seeing the traction with the EMV card manufacturing that you expected at this point in the year?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","We actually are. If you turn to the IFS section, one of the things you're going to see is a line item that shows 4% growth, if memory serves. And that's primarily our card production EMV. We're seeing a nice ramp-up over that. We've disclosed a number of big wins. And so that volume continues to grow. While it's still small volume relative to our overall volume of cards we produce, we produced millions of EMV cards this past quarter.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","I see. Just a quick final question on FX, Woody. It looks like you had a 3 percentage point FX headwind to revenue in the first quarter. You're calling out a 4 point headwind for the year. But a number of your international currencies, particularly the pound, have strengthened significantly versus the dollar in the last month. Is that 4 point headwind just including some element of conservatism or do you really think 4 points is the right number given current spot rates?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think it's difficult with the volatility going on in the currencies that we are in right now. As you know, we updated our guidance on April the 9th, and I think you have seen some level of improvement in the currencies since April 9 even, David, to your point. But I would tell you that we think 4% is close to where we think we'll be for the full year. If the dollar weakens a little bit against these currencies, obviously it wouldn't have as big of an impact. Very difficult right now to try to figure out exactly where currencies may land.","If you look at the euro and the real, for example, I think they're down or have depreciated about 18% compared to this time last year. But you're right, if we see some improvement in currencies compared to the U.S dollar, that 4% headwind may not be as big but that's where we got it to at the time it updated and that's where we're at for the moment.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thank you very much.","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, David.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison M. Jordan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. This is Allison in for George. I have a question on the IFS segment, the 2% growth that you saw this quarter, how do you think about the longer term revenue target there and how long do you think it takes to get back there?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Allison, we're going to go into a lot of that on Monday in our investor update but clearly the biggest headwind this group has is just consolidation in the industry, right? I mean we continue to see acquisitions occur through the various different asset ranges within the space. Depending on what that continues to do, that will actually turn into a nice tailwind for IFS. But certainly we think long term, given our position, given our dominance in outsourcing in a number of the key markets, it's certainly a mid single-digit grower for us. You see the margins that we generate out of that.","Frankly, when you start really breaking out that group and comparing it to some of its competitors, you're going to see that the margin contribution given the outsourced nature of the business is going to be superior to a lot of the competitors. So, it's a very strong fundamental business and we would expect that growth over the long-term would accelerate back into the mid single-digits which is, frankly as I said, on adjusted basis if term fees didn't exist, that grow over, that's exactly where we would have been this quarter which is right about 5% and 7% on the EBITDA line.","So, we would have gotten margin expansion and good md single-digit growth. So it's really just the nature of how the acquisitions hit at any given point in time in that business. But fundamentally, it's a strong business and should continue to operate in that mid single-digit range.","Allison M. Jordan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks for that color. And then just shifting gears a little bit, on the M&A front, how are you thinking about opportunities domestically versus internationally?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think there are some opportunities. Certainly, you see the last big one we did was Clear2Pay. That's going exceptionally well for us in Europe and in other areas. We're always going to look for the right opportunity. We want to find something that gives our markets or our businesses an opportunity to accelerate growth and return value to our shareholders.","Frankly, there's still probably too much supply in some of the markets that we're operating in. So if we can find a transaction that would make sense, we would certainly evaluate it. But like always, we've got to make sure that it makes sense for our shareholders.","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I could tell you, Allison, that the international opportunities have definitely looked a little more robust right now, given the strength of the dollar, coupled with we've got a lot of offshore cash right now, so.","Allison M. Jordan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks for the color, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, Gary, Woody and Pete.","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Brett.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","On the project delay, can you give us more detail on that? And I ask that in the context of your commentary that the GFI business has more of these big complex services deals, so what comfort can we get that that delay is unique or was there something that we had to fix in our project approach or can you just give us some thoughts on that?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Brett, we're looking at right now about a 3-month total, 2.5-month 3-month total delay. Frankly, it was impacted by two things. One, it is a very large transformational project and we're bringing this financial institution out of a very old legacy environment. So they have some issues on their side as well that actually added to the delay. We also kind of had a perfect storm there. We've had a lot of success in that region with the challenger bank. So that ended up having us build out scope to build out a much larger banking utility given some of that success. So I think it's the combination of those two things.","As you know, I've been with the company 27 years. We've had project delays before. Any big company that would tell you they haven't had a project delay is not being accurate. But the reality is this one kind of caught us from those couple of angles. We definitely have made some changes in our program management function. Obviously, as we build out these capabilities in Europe, we got to make sure that we have the talent that's applied to these projects to make sure they have high success.","But am I overly concerned about the project delay? I'm not. I think the team is very focused and when I look at not only the sales success we've had to-date and we've announced some of those, but when I look at the contracts that we're actively negotiating, I feel very confident that the whole banking utility is going to be a very successful business for FIS going forward.","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Brett, if you think about sort of the financial impact in terms of what it is to the total contract. To the total contract, this delay is insignificant to a several hundred million dollar contract, but it did impact our quarter.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then my second question is, Woody, you mentioned that you think that there's 50 basis points of margin expansion this year even with some of the changes. And I know there's some of the cost overruns but I also know you're taking some costs out of the business. But as we look further out, one of the key questions that I think a lot of folks were wondering about last year, as the GFI business grows faster and it's lower margin, can we still expect a 50 basis points type expansion over the medium-term or long-term given this what looks to be a fairly permanent mix shift?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think we're going to talk more about that on Monday in terms of the details behind it, Brett. But you're exactly right. I think you've got very good margin expansion capabilities in the IFS segment and it will continue as we consolidate data centers, as we sell into leverage platforms, as we continue to drive that business as we always have. The GFS business, it does create some challenges in the short run and potentially longer-term, but we do expect margins to expand as you get more of those services growing and you get more of scale in the areas that we're serving associated with that. But it's a challenge that we're going to continue to monitor and work through.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's what we needed. Thank you.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. It looks like you've shifted over the past couple of years to a company that's now adding contracts that are three, four, even five times the size of your average contracts in the past. And I think some of this is \u2013 these transitions we're seeing or delays on a big contract may be understandable given what kind of a transition comes with these adjustments. But when we consider constant currency growth guidance, you're still starting with a year for 5% to 7%, or even if you start with the low end of that.","Is the pipeline that you guys talked about earlier have contracts that are big enough kind of like the same Sainsbury's and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricoles to enable potential acceleration in revenue growth in 2016? I mean, I know we're not guiding yet but I just wonder if the pipeline is big enough now or are the sales times on these things going to be much longer?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Darrin. It's a great question. You're exactly right. We really have in our global business seen a massive expansion in the size of our contracts. We've highlighted those on a number of our calls. And as you said, as you're dealing with the these larger and larger agreements you can run into some of these things.","Let's get to your question about pipeline, the quick answer is yes. I mean the pipeline is very supportive. We've got a number of large transformational opportunities that we're actively negotiating and so we see good line of sight that we can continue to that growth in these large transformational engagements. Capco has been just an unbelievable acquisition for us. It's been over five years but if you look at the growth in the consulting engagement and you look at how that's augmented into our IP-led services and we give that transparency, you can also see we have good pipeline supporting that. We'll see that continue.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I mean maybe we can talk about this more at the Investor Day but is there any other fundamental reason why 2016 wouldn't be able to be at or above this year's constant currency 5% to 7% kind of range?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, again, not going guide on 2016 yet after the first quarter of 2015 but we're going to give some outlook, a multi-year outlook, on Monday, Darrin, as to what drivers are in these businesses and what the growth characteristics should look like in both of these businesses.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, and then just lastly, I mean you had a couple of moving parts you mentioned around the deals and the addbacks and take-out. The term fees, just so we understand, that was what, about a 50 basis point headwind on this year's growth rate versus last year? Is that right in terms of my math?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think it was little bigger than that, it was $28 million associated.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, so okay, so absent that in terms of normalized, your growth rate would have been about \u2013 a little over that higher?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. All right. I'll leave the rest for the Investor Day. Thanks a lot, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Darrin","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jim E. Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe address the pricing environment for a moment, and give us a little bit detail around what let to the non-renewal of that client contract and whether you're seeing that for other customers in the non-financial segment or even in the international segment in the financial part?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Jim, two parts to that question. Let's get to the first one on the non-renewal. Frankly, this was an IT data center engagement and it was a very low margin contract. The client wanted to have a reduction that was even lower that would make actually the agreement non-profitable. It's just not a strategic business for us. So we just chose not to renew it. And as I said, it wasn't in the financial services industry whatsoever because we're just not going to provide service at those kind of margins for our company and our shareholders.","If you start getting into financial institutions, as I mentioned to an earlier question, we do continue to see a lot of competition or perhaps even an oversupply in what I would say the traditional U.S. business, right, what we're now calling the Integrated Financial Solutions segment. So pricing is always going to be an issue, especially when you've got what I would call a monoline player. So you've got a single product offering in the market or in that customer, some of the pricing characteristics of that can be disproportionate. You can also see opportunities where larger scale competitors of ours that will have a broader solution. As they try to move upmarket, you can also see some aggressiveness around price.","When we get over in the global marketplace, it's a little different. You're really \u2013 in those large transformational projects, there's always going to be an element of cost saves involved in those. That would be one of the reasons why a large global institution would not only outsource because on some intellectual property and the capability that we have, but they're looking for ways that through our best practices we can drive those costs now. But we don't see as much aggression from some of the other providers because it's more of a long-term project base type approach on those.","Jim E. Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, if you look ahead to the EMV liability shift in October this year and you consider your NYCE network, do you see any potential share gains or any market share shifts at all because of the Durbin compliance changes that some retailers might decide to implement?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","You know, our NYCE business continues to perform very well. I mean, we've been pleased with its performance so far. Is the team modeling a big increase for the back half of the year in that, no. I think it's been fairly consistent, but it has performed very well and they continue to grow their share.","Jim E. Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple questions on the, just first on I guess Brazil and Bradesco. I know there has been a lot of news flow there, Ita\u00fa with its network deal and MasterCard and GDP slowing some regulation changes. Any update on the Bradesco JV and its current state and any opportunity to add more partners there?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","You know we have actually added some partners over the last several years. Bradesco, as you know, just continues to be the dominant client in that JV. We've got a number of years left on that contract. I mean Bradesco is very pleased with the service we're providing. We wish the macroeconomic issues were a little more favorable in Brazil but we're still very committed to the JV and things are going well there.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, good. And then on Jim's prior question, just the non-bank outsourcing book itself, how big is that today for FIS?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It's less than 5% revenue, sort of those IT outsourcing or IT infrastructure outsourcing, is less tan 5%, Tien-Tsin, and even smaller on the EBITDA side.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect, okay. That's good. Last one from me, just I know there has been some consolidation in the baking space, surprised we haven't seen more actually but any of the announced deals have implications for FIS and should we expect more term fees just from a bit higher level standpoint? It seems like maybe that's a fair assumption to include.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know, it's interesting. For the last three years, we've actually seen a steady decline in our term fees for three consecutive years. We would actually tell you the number, the percentage of acquisitions increased to the highest we've seen last year. A lot of those acquisitions are occurring in lower asset size institutions where we don't have as much penetration. Of course, when one of our large guys is acquired, it overdrives in a dollar amount, so our term fees can be quite large.","There are a number of large combinations that have been announced. We would go back to the Umpqua Sterling, that's been a very successful situation where Sterling was on FIS, Umpqua was on a competitor. They chose to stay with FIS and we have successfully converted that client now onto all the FIS systems, so that's a very successful conversion. And there's going to be some other announcements coming where we've had a couple of combinations in a similar vein of Umpqua Sterling that FIS also was selected. So we're pleased as we get in the large bank market, given our size and scope and scale in those markets, we continue to have a lot of success growing that business.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, great, thanks for the update. See you next week.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","And we'll now go to the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, good morning, a few question. I guess the first one maybe if you could help us quantify the cost savings from the restructuring so we get a little bit more comfortable with the implied margin parameters going into the back half. I think David Koning referenced like the dollar EPS per quarter in the back half and our math was similar but wanted to get more comfortable on the margin implications?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think you've got a couple things there. One, you've got a charge associated with it of about $44 million, a good bit of that is in Europe where you've got a higher level of severance, if you will, associated with removing head count. The vast majority of that will be in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, Glenn, and we're looking at in the range of probably 70% of our savings in the third quarter and the fourth quarter this year compared to the charge. So you definitely will see benefits there. Some of those benefits will flow through and anniversary into 2016 as well but most of it is going to hit the third quarter and the fourth quarter in terms of benefit as we transition and onshore offshore some of those resources. And then obviously, the pure management overlaps will take place a little faster than that.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Could you put a dollar amount on the savings, though?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We haven't put an exact dollar amount on it but you know, I'm thinking probably $25 million third, fourth quarter combined is probably what you're looking at.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then I haven't done the math precisely but it almost implies like a 33% or so EBITDA margin exiting the year so? Maybe the sliver lining here is 1Q and 2Q don't look great but you exit the year at a really nice profitability level. Is that a good baseline to be \u2013 first of all, am I right on that math and then is that a good baseline going into fiscal 2016?","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well I think you'll see some benefits from the costs actions specifically. I think you'll see some benefits from term fees in the second half versus first half. I'm not sure that's the proper baseline because you're getting some benefit out of the term fees in the second half just like you're getting some detriment in the first half, but we do anticipate continuing to see some level of margin expansion through 2015 and then further into 2016.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then the product sales weakness, are you sort of talking about license deals or is this somewhat related to the project delay, or is this just a question of timing on this.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Glenn, it's definitely more license fee in nature. If you see, I mean we only had 2% license fees in the quarter. This business used to be a heavy license business and certainly we thought that would recover give our engagements but we continue to see our license fees slide from quarter to quarter. There's just lot of softness whereas our services stuff just consistently ramps up. So we're not sure that this market is ever going to return to really big license model again and we thought it would. I mean, it used to be a heavy license model historically but which is good for us long term, it builds our reoccurring revenue base. It allows it to be much more predictable in the long term and then, with that scale, you'll see steady margin recovery.","Glenn E. Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We will now go to Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So I guess the first question is obviously you have a presence in all various different parts of the market but clearly you've done better in the mid sized regional and larger contracts. So now with the new breakout with IFS, should we look for \u2013 when you look at the market like that and who competes in that market, should we look for more of a push towards the lower end, credit union, community banks, or is that not appropriate?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","I don't think so Ashwin, if you look at where we do very well in that market, we don't do a lot in credit unions. We do in the payment space but most of our focus in that market would be larger community banks. So I would draw in the greater than $1 billion, we might go down to greater than $500 million. But when you really get in the small end, a lot of our competitors, they have very nice share down in the smaller end of that market. And, frankly, a lot of the consolidation, at least number of units, is occurring down on that low end. So we'll talk a lot about that on Monday but basically what you're seeing is actually the mid tier is actually growing -- that greater than $1 billion \u2013 because we've got clients that are trying to get the scale to deal with the regulatory change and, frankly, the complexity of all the technology that's being rolled out and that's playing really to FIS' strength long term.","We definitely will have some lumpiness due to term fees because when have a large multi-billion dollar bank get acquired, typically the term fees can be a very large number as you see evidenced by this quarter. But when you look at that greater $1 billion space, we continue to gain share in that market. We continue to see evidence when really two large institutions combine together that they look to FIS to outsource to. And so all of that is going to be positive trends for IFS long term but you won't hear on Monday that part of our strategy is to push deeper in the lower end of the community bank market or, frankly, in the low end of the credit union market. We will certainly continue to be opportunistic there. We've got a number of customers there. We're going to serve them just as well as we serve any of them. But there's just \u2013 that's were most of the churn is occurring as we see it.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thank you for that. Moving to the GFS side, clearly more traction there but you have been talking of larger deals for a year and half, two years now at least, if not slightly longer. The question is do you have the ability to support the higher growth that's coming down the funnel both in terms of people and in terms of IP or do you need to continue making further investments whether they are organic or through M&A, if you could comment on that?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","You know, I think one of the things you're going to see with the new transparency and hopefully you guys are going to enjoy this level of detail, but you're certainly seeing as we grow these complex projects, we've got to hire people, right. So competition for talent is going to always be something that we're going to have deal with. I think we've proven that over the last two years we've really signed some very nice agreements and we've been able to deliver on those. And we've seen the revenue and profit growth associated with those services.","When you get to investments, to Woody's point, there are some good opportunities outside the U.S. for acquisition. The Clear2Pay acquisition has been a good one for us. That's a great example where they had some great IT capabilities around payment hub technology already in the money center banks but once again heavily services oriented around the deployment of that.","So we'll continue to look at those opportunities. We also are continuing to invest in intellectual property for that market. We've seen a lot of engagements with some of our largest clients where we'll come in and do a specific build leveraging some of our components but then customizing it their benefit, once again through a services engagement. But you are right, I mean, as we grow that business, the recruitment of talent is going to continue to be an important issue for us to monitor. I'll tell you, I mean, our consulting group Capco is really a desirable place if you want to be in the consulting field in financial services to join. So we're able to recruit very well in that space from a lot of the larger providers. And traditionally, as you see, we've been able to ramp up our IP-led services as well, but we're going to continue to monitor that.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, and one last question, if I may, the higher sales costs which, I guess, clearly you have to go after an opportunity when you see it, but there's also what opportunities do you go after versus you say no to. And last year you guys made a pretty big investment in going after larger relationships. Could you sort of provide an update and maybe Monday is the right place to do this as opposed to right now, but can you provide us an update with regards to when do you say yes versus when do you say no, what are the criteria that you're using?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we'll certainly go into a lot more of that detail on Monday, but it's a good question and our strategy has not changed. I mean we're materially focused on a very small number of global countries, right. We are very focused on the type of capabilities that we have existing capabilities that we can leverage, right. So we're focused heavily on the retail banking side in certain sectors and also from the consulting side on the capital market side. So where we truly aren't building out capabilities, we have capabilities that exist today that we can leverage. When you're outside of that space, we say no often, right. So, we really aren't looking at country expansion as a growth opportunity for us and we're also not looking at getting into product deployments or capabilities that don't exist within FIS. But we'll go into that detail for you on Monday to give you a better sense of that.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. See you guys next week.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","All right.","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Curious about in the GFS segment, how does the margin profile in that segment vary by geography? I guess it's kind of, I'm trying to get a better idea of how scale efficiency is operative in your business across these different geographies. Are GFSs in Europe more profitable than in Brazil versus the U.S. versus here versus there, just wondering if you can give me any color there?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","No, Ramsey, it's a good question. What I think you'll find is the margins are directly related to the type of IP engagement we have in that. So as you would expect, on the highest end would be where we truly have a product solution that's outsourced to us in our data center. That would be on the higher end of those margins and then it moves down to where we're doing just traditional back office BPO would be on the low end of that spectrum. So and then when you start getting into each country based on that dynamic, you start getting into the scale growth components of that.","Overall we do believe that the margins on this business are going be able to accelerate, especially as our services components grow because we're seeing that occur in our large scale services engagements. But it really is based on how much product is truly engaged or in the engagement.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","All right, that makes a lot of sense. Changing channels here, in the Asia Pacific segment I mean, that was pretty remarkable growth now that you break it out. Is most of that coming from India or is growth in Asia Pac pretty broad based?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","The team is doing very well. India is definitely the leader here in this growth. I mean, we highlighted the India ATM deal several years ago and you see the ramp that's provided but we can't lose sight of the job the team has done there in building out a true core franchise as well. Mahila Bank, Bandhan Bank. We talked about Karnataka on the call today. So India is by far the lead but we're seeing some nice growth in some other regions as well. Thailand is a very strong market for us and we obviously are doing well in other regions like the Philippines and Australia. But by far, India is the majority of the revenue in that sector.","James W. Woodall - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","If you look at the calls over the last several quarters, almost every call has had some mention of a win in India. And as we've talked about it, it was growing very well but not a giant needle mover. I think this kind of gives you some clarity and visibility into what growing very well really means and it's becoming a larger component of the overall GFS group.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC","All right, guys. Thanks a lot. That's very helpful.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question is from Mr. Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. We've covered a lot of ground today but I want to understand a little bit as you realigned your go-to-market strategy and realigned the segments, what specifically do you feel like has changed in terms of how you're actually going to address your customer opportunities? In other words, is it personnel, is it technology, is it other assets, what about the realignment sort of practically on a day-to-day basis do you think work better and gives you the confidence in the outlook for a better second half?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","That's a great question, Andrew. Well first, what we've done is we've now got truly two pure play companies here that exist. We've moved all of product, all of accountability, all of ownership in both unique segments. You've got the IFS segment which is really, it's just the dominant outsourcer in community banking. It's got the broadest product suite in the industry. The team is very focused whereas in the past we used to have that team being distracted to help focus on things going on in the global markets even though the revenue didn't flow there. A lot of the R&D was going on in that group just because historically that's where it was.","We've now got two groups that truly own end-to-end all their capabilities. They have the products that they need in both markets. When you get over to Global, it's just that. We've really moved now Global from a sales engine to truly an end-to-end business. So, now they've got the capability to invest in their products or de-invest in solutions that aren't working in that market. So, in the simplest form, it's just one of accountability and focus that we think are going to drive much better results.","We've been moving in this direction for a number of years. When we announced our strategy shift back in 2012, this was the direction we've been taking the company. As you would expect, these are a lot of people to reorganize and so fundamentally this was the last step in the strategy. And so we're going to get people that have lot more focus and accountability, right products. We're going to be able to make investments more effectively in those segments and then convey them to our investors on the returns we expect. So we think all of that's is going to accelerate the execution.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, would you characterize the way you've positioned or repositioned the businesses, this is kind of perhaps an acceleration of the final step in the plan that was already contemplated and already was kind of a work in progress?","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, exactly. We've been working on the resegmentation for last year as we started moving through me transitioning from Chief Operating Officer into the CEO role. And so before when I was Chief Operating Officer, we ran the business in a very different manner. But we had always had the strategy to move towards this more market focus. And if you look back on our calls, we talked a lot about our markets and the unique buying characteristics of our markets. If you look, the services fees from a professional services consulting piece is very small in IFS. You know we don't have a lot of that type of revenue driven. It's all outsourcing and highly leveraged products. So we take a product and we launch it many times. And you know our traditional competitors in that space very well.","You move over into the Global business, very different, right. Heavy head count, a lot of advanced professional services consulting with IP built into that process. So it really is gotten us to the ultimate disposition of where we were taking the company. So now you'll have the ability to really look at both of these groups against their true pure play competitors and see how they're performing against those. So we're excited about the transparency this is going to drive and the ability for these two market leaders to focus and invest and drive their businesses.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, thanks a lot, appreciate it.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now turn the call back over to Gary Norcross. Please go ahead.","Gary A. Norcross - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you for your questions today and for your interest in FIS. We continue to deliver revenue growth fueled by significant reoccurring revenue streams and strong sales results. We are confident that the resegmentation of our business will enable us to better leverage our technology, consulting and managed services portfolio to realize cost efficiencies within our own organization as well as deliver true value to our clients within the unique markets we serve. Together with over 14,000 clients across the globe, FIS and our more than 42,000 employees are empowering the financial world.","In closing, we are pleased to share more detail with you around our strategy and resegmented operating model at our upcoming Investor Conference scheduled for May 4th in New York.

Please go ahead.","Nancy Murphy","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Frank Martire, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will begin with a summary of our financial performance. Gary Norcross, President and Chief Operating Officer, will follow with the operations report, and Woody Woodall, Chief Financial Officer, will continue with the detailed financial review.","Today's news release and the supplemental slide presentation are available on our website at fisglobal.com.

Frank?","Frank R. Martire","Thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I am pleased to open the morning\u2019s call by reporting that the second quarter proved to be another strong quarter for FIS. Once again we delivered profitable organic growth, continuing our record of consistent performance in line with expectations.","We continue to execute our global growth strategy with a focus on optimizing our business and delivering strategic value to our clients. We remain confident in our 2014 outlook and focus on driving superior returns for our shareholders.","Looking at details of the quarter revenue increased by 6% in total to $1.6 billion, and year-to-date to $3.1 billion. This marks our 18th consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth. Adjusted earnings per share rose 6% to $0.75. Strong cash flow and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to return a record $463 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the first six months of the year, and finally we achieved strong sales execution in the quarter and are entering the second half of the year with a robust pipeline.","We are excited about the growth opportunities for our business as the global financial service landscape evolves. Our results reflect our unmatched combination of technology, services and consulting solutions, which drive transformational change for our clients. We continue to align our investments with market opportunities and client needs to drive profitable growth.","Our first half results and consistent performance reinforce our confidence in achieving our 2014 goals. It also highlights the strength of our operating model and continuous steady execution, which is consistent with our growth strategy to deliver value and profitable results to our clients and shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Gary for our business strategy and operating highlights. Gary?","Gary A. Norcross","Thanks, Frank, and thanks again to everyone for joining us this morning. Turning to Slide 8, as Frank discussed, the second quarter was another strong quarter for FIS. Our market focused approach and investment and innovation in service related offerings have delivered strong business results and our emphasis on overall operational efficiency continues to translate to consistent, profitable growth for FIS.","In the quarter, we reported strong sales with good deal flow and key strategic wins across all markets. We further strengthened our pipeline across all segments and the markets they serve. We continue to expand our solution footprint through investing in our platforms and targeted acquisitions. This includes our recent acquisition of Reliance Financial, which I will discuss in a few minutes, and we continue to reaffirm our investment strategy to better penetrate the global financial institution market with strong indications this focus is driving increased traction, which we expect will translate into higher revenue and profit growth for the company, but will create some near-term margin constraints.","All of this allows us to remain well positioned to capitalize on the increasing industry demand for scalable outsourced solutions and services. We identified this trend early and began positioning FIS to deliver these capabilities on a global scale. Today our unique business model encompassing financial technology, outsourced solutions and consulting services is driving transformational change for our clients. We have captured a steady stream of new wins and expanded business by meeting pressing industry needs for efficiency, growth, security and improved customer experience. This represents a re-occurring theme for today\u2019s conversation.","Turning to the markets, in North America we had a very strong sales quarter with several large strategic wins reflecting renewed market demand and continued confidence in our depth and breath of solutions, delivery excellence and transformational capabilities. First I would like to highlight a significant competitive win involving one of the industry\u2019s highly respected and innovative banking brands, a win that we believe represents one of the largest EMV contracts to date in the US. Starting in October, FIS will replace 10 million magnetic stripe cards with new Chip-and-PIN technology over a 24 month period. This relationship with a client known for its industry first underscores FIS\u2019 ability to lead the industry and bring transformational technology to the markets we serve. Our experience, best in class platform, delivery capabilities and commitment to security resulted in this win against a strong competitive landscape. We are very pleased to have been selected and are excited with our leadership role in this space.","Next I would like to highlight Bank Leumi USA, who selected FIS to deliver a unified core banking and wealth management platform to provide a universal view of its customers\u2019 portfolios. This common platform and single point of access for customer accounts provides consolidated data for tracking analytics in a simpler interface for risk monitoring and response. This sophisticated and transformational solution also supports our specific risk and regulatory requirements. The solution will be fully outsourced to FIS and will include a suite of front-end e-banking and e-payment solutions designed to simplify customer interactions across accounts and improve customer services.","Lastly, we are pleased to highlight our recent acquisition of Reliance Financial, which expands our solution capabilities in the growing wealth management market. Combining our current wealth-based solution technology with Reliance\u2019s services capabilities and seasoned leadership team creates an end-to-end outsourced solution, and it expands the strategic value and services we bring to our client base, enabling us to efficiently serve this growing market. This business serves more than 200 clients today, and is expected to double in size over the next five years. We believe this will be a powerful addition to FIS.","Switching to our international segment, we achieved 12% organic revenue growth, while continuing to drive strong demand for our solutions across all regions with a number of significant new deals closing during the quarter. Starting with Asia, this market delivered significant opportunities with organizations looking to serve the underbanked and emerging payment sectors.","For example, you will recall our success last year in launching Mahila Bank, India\u2019s first bank, aimed at the financial empowerment of the country\u2019s women. This has been followed this quarter by Shivalik, an Indian co-operative bank, who has selected FIS to deliver a completely outsourced banking solution. This trend towards banking utility models is also visible in other countries as banks are looking to FIS to help drive efficiency and best practices.","Meanwhile, our ATM outsourcing growth in India continues with new business wins with Bank of India, Karnataka Bank, [Muthoot Finance] joining a long list of major players relying on FIS to install, operate and maintain their payments infrastructure. We also continued to find success for our core banking technology with banks wishing to keep their processing in-house.","As an example, Philippine National Bank has selected to deployed FIS core banking platform after its merger with Allied Banking Corporation. This core replacement now takes us to four out of the top 10 banks running our core systems in the Philippines. I\u2019m also pleased to report that CIMB Thai has signed with FIS for credit card processing, positioning us in Thailand\u2019s growing card processing market. In addition, the Bank of Philippine Islands, BPI, has joined the growing list of financial institutions migrating onto FIS switching products and represents one of three switching deals we concluded in Asia-Pacific this quarter.","In Europe, we are continuing to make good progress on our major projects with Sainsbury Bank and ING. The Sainsbury migration took a major step forward this quarter, with the first technology deliverables that form the base for the banks infrastructure. Meanwhile at ING, the bank is continuing to make good progress on its transformation project based on FIS\u2019 core banking platform.","Moving to Latin America, our business continues to perform well and grow despite a slower macroeconomic environment. In Brazil, where we are the largest third-party card processor through our joint venture with Bradesco we saw another quarter of growth in cards and transaction volumes. We continue to believe this market provides a long growth runway driven by the secular shift from cash to card-based digital payments. In addition to these highlighted projects, we continue to generate positive momentum with existing deployments and expand business with established client relationships.","Record attendance at our annual international client conference hosted in June enhanced our robust pipeline and our full-year outlook in the international market, which remained strong and on target.","Next we continue to make good progress in our growth of the global financial institutions market and remain pleased with our early results. Our strategic investments in this market show early signs of progress. Our pipeline is growing and we are continuing to close large strategic transformational deals. As we referenced on our last earnings call, early in the second quarter, global investment banking firm Jefferies selected FIS as its long-term strategic technology partner to deliver IT transformational services worldwide.","As a single source provider, FIS brings needed expertise in change management and outsourcing, financial technology and capital market consulting capabilities, enabling Jefferies to manage cost and maximize gains for greater efficiencies. This is a value proposition that is unique in our industry and unmatched by our competitors. Additionally at the end of last year, we told you about our innovation strategy to incubate early stage exploratory consulting services focused on disruptive technologies that are changing the industry and defining new customer interaction models. We are pleased to announce that we have closed our first engagement with a very large and prominent retail bank that first experiences exploratory consulting approach through one of our innovation centers.","Using this approach, we have defined a unique solution that is centered on the modern lifestyle and combines digital technology in a physical environment. This innovative new solution will deliver an entirely new way for this bank to interact with and add value to its customers. These early results and our increasing pipeline continue to fuel our confidence for investing in this market.","Turning to Slide 9, and before I turn it over to Woody, let me take a minute to recap a few key points. We had a strong second quarter and we are proud of the results and our performance in the first half of the year. Our strong quarter reflects a combination of new wins, implementations and expanded client relationships. We remain committed to optimizing our business and delivering strategic value to our clients, which is central to our global growth strategy. We will continue to invest in the markets and solutions that are central to driving profitable growth.","Now I'll turn it over to Woody for the financial report.","","James W. Woodall","","Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 11 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter. Consolidated revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis to $1.6 billion driven by growth in all markets.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% to $466 million, while the EBITDA margin was 29.2%, a decrease of 60 basis points from the prior year quarter reflecting a change in revenue mix, including higher growth in international markets, consulting and services as well as increased investment in the global financial institutions market.","Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $217 million from $210 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 6%, to $0.75 per share, from $0.71 per share in the prior year quarter. For the first half of 2014, adjusted revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and 4% organically to $3.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4% to $914 million and the EBITDA margin was 29.2% compared to 29.4% in the prior year period.","Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 6% to $417 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.43 per share. As we discussed in prior quarters, termination fees in 2013 related to the BMO M&I merger, resulted in a revenue headwind of about 100 basis points in the second quarter 2014. This headwind was partially offset by contractual fees related to Umpqua Bank\u2019s acquisition of Sterling Bank. These fees contributed approximately 80 basis points to Q2 2014 revenue growth and are non-recurring in nature. As we discussed last quarter, this important win of the outsourced processing of the combined banks significantly increases the long-term value of this relationship. We are pleased with these results, which are consistent with our outlook for the year. ","Now I will continue on Slide 12 with a review of segment results. Financial Solutions revenue was $629 million, an increase of 6% on an organic basis, reflecting growth in consulting, professional services and digital banking. Results also include the contractual fees related to the Umpqua Sterling win I referenced. Financial Solutions EBITDA increased 8% to $249 million, while EBITDA margin expanded 20 basis points year-over-year to 39.6%.","Turning to Slide 13, Payment Solutions revenue was $624 million, about flat with the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in network solutions, bill payment services and image and output solutions offset by lower termination fees. Payment Solutions EBITDA was $253 million and the EBITDA margin was 40.6%, down from 42.2% in the second quarter of 2013, primarily reflecting lower termination fees and revenue mix. As a reminder, looking forward to the third quarter the Payment segment has difficult year-over-year comparisons due to elevated license sales and termination fees in the third quarter 2013. Also this segment has a seasonal trend of lower sequential revenue in the third quarter due to the increased volumes for processing tax payments in the second quarter.","Moving to Slide 14, International revenue was $347 million and grew 12% organically in the quarter. We continue to see organic growth across all major regions, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Asia and continuing growth in Latin America. International EBITDA increased 11% to $73 million, EBITDA margin was 21.1%, down 70 basis points primarily reflecting increased investment in the global financial institutions market.","As Gary discussed, we are pleased with our early progress in the global financial institutions market. Consistent with our plan in the first half we have invested an incremental $15 million primarily to expand our dedicated client teams and are on track with the $30 million for the full year. We expect revenue growth in this market to gain traction late in 2014 and into 2015.","Corporate expense was $109 million, unchanged from the prior year, reflecting diligent cost management. We expect corporate expenses to remain at a similar level for the remainder of the year. ","Moving on to a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP EPS on Slide 15, GAAP earnings increased to $0.62 per share. Second quarter 2014 GAAP results are adjusted to exclude $0.13 per share in acquisition-related purchase amortization.","The effective tax rate was 30% in the second quarter of 2014 and in the prior year quarter. Both periods reflect favorable resolution of certain tax matters of about $0.04 per share. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 33% to 34% for the full year 2014.","Moving onto cash flow on Slide 16, adjusted cash flow from operations totaled $245 million, up from $199 million in the second quarter 2013. Capital expenditures were $97 million consistent with our target of 5.5% to 6% of revenue through the first half of 2014. Free cash flow increased to $149 million from $115 million in the second quarter 2013. As a reminder, free cash flow conversion in the second half of the year is historically higher than the first half due to timing of payments, including taxes and incentives.","Turning to Slide 17, we returned approximately $219 million to shareholders in the second quarter, including $68 million in dividends [Indiscernible] to repurchase 2.8 million shares in the open market. Repurchase activity reduced our weighted average diluted shares to 289.2 million in the second quarter, from 294.3 million last year. At the end of the quarter, basic and diluted shares outstandings were 284.6 million and 288.4 million, respectively. Approximately 1.7 billion remains under our repurchase authorization and we expect to repurchase shares throughout the second half of 2014.","Moving on to the balance sheet, debt totaled $4.9 billion. In June we issued 1 billion in new senior notes to refinance existing debt at lower rates and to extend the duration of our capital structure. In July we completed the redemption of 500 million 7.875% notes and expect to record a third-quarter charge for costs related to the refinancing activities of approximately $0.08 per share. The refinancing results in a reduction in our weighted average interest rate to 3.2%, which was anticipated, and our leverage ratio was 2.6x, and we continue to target a ratio at or slightly below 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA.","As Gary mentioned, we are pleased to have completed the acquisition of Reliance Financial in mid-July, which provide long-term growth opportunities in the wealth management space. In 2014, we expect the acquisition to be neutral to EPS and provide a slight revenue tailwind as we build our sales pipeline.","Moving on to Slide 18, we are reaffirming our outlook for 2014, including organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%; adjusted EBITDA growth of 4.5% to 6.5%; adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.05 to $3.16 per share, reflecting growth of 8% to 12%; and free cash flow approximating adjusted net earnings. To add further color to Q3, we continue to see line of sight through accelerated revenue growth towards the higher end of our guidance range.","As we have previously described, this growth includes international consulting and services which come on at lower margins. Additionally we have difficult comparisons due to elevated termination fees and license sales noted in the third quarter last year. As a result, we expect pressure on year-over-year EBITDA margin comparisons in Q3. ","In summary, we're pleased with our first half financial performance and our outlook for the full year 2014. We remain focused on executing our growth strategy, generating strong profitability and cash flows and deploying capital in value enhancing ways.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions.","Nancy Murphy","Operator, can you open up the line for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions) The first question in queue will come from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Glenn Greene \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Yes, thank you. Good morning.","Frank R. Martire","Good morning.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer","I guess \u2013 I guess a few questions, first I guess I will just sort of start on the Woody\u2019s last comment at the end there, maybe just give us a little bit of color around the visibility towards the higher end of the organic revenue growth and sort of \u2013 frame sort of the margin pressures sort of the same dynamic that you have been talking about of \u2013 lower revenue \u2013 the revenue mix sort of causing that impact on the margins perhaps faster consulting and international growth?","James W. Woodall","Yes, as we described \u2013 as we laid out guidance for the first half of the year, we anticipated growth to grow in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. We have seen that. We saw 4% organic in Q1, 5% organic in Q2, which was a little bit of a tailwind. We were excited about that growth, but we anticipate continuing to see accelerated growth in the back half of the year. In conjunction with that growth, those will be more in the international revenue growth. It will be more in the consulting and services area.","Again those don\u2019t come on at the same margins as traditional processing revenue. If you combine that with some of the large license sales and termination fees that we noted in last year\u2019s Q3, it is going to put some pressure on EBITDA margin, but again seeing that accelerated revenue growth that we anticipated.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer","And then maybe for Gary there was a lot of commentary, a lot of deal activity, it sounded like a bunch of new wins, maybe you could just sort of frame sort of the sales environment relative to what it has been, three, six, nine months ago as to \u2013 is your commentary, does it imply that you are seeing a pickup in activity, does this give you more confidence about accelerating growth not only in the back half of \u201914, but into \u201915?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, Glenn, no, it is a great question. We are very confident, what we are seeing in the sales and excited about the results. The sales team is operating very well across North America, the international group and in the global financial group. Our pipeline continues to go up in all markets. We are seeing great deal flow, which is \u2013 which is exciting. So we are seeing stuff run through the pipeline on a faster basis and our sales success is up significantly over last year.","So we do feel confident about the back half of the year, and we do feel good about next year. To Woody\u2019s point, I\u2019m actually pleased to see the growth in the services business, in the processing business and less licensing fee and less term fee. It gives you a much more stable revenue growth curve that allows you to run the business in a much more effective way. So we\u2019re pretty bullish on where things are headed and the opportunity that exists in front of us.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer","All right, I have got some more questions, but I will jump back in the queue. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.","Good morning everybody.","Frank R. Martire","Good morning Brett.","James W. Woodall","Good morning Brett.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Few questions, first of all, just to follow up on the trends from additional deals Gary that you mentioned, can you give us a sense of sort of what you see out there? I think there are sort of two at least that I think of are two buckets, one is sort of the more traditional core deals that you all had one in a legacy way and then the new sort of IT infrastructure deals, I know that the global effort is sort of barking up both of those trees, but can you give us a sense for more specifically how those pipelines are developing, is there a region where you are feeling like there is going to be some activity soon. Can you give us a little more color on that?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes. No, I mean I think it is \u2013 it is interesting what we are seeing across all markets. Just the classic deals that we traditionally sold, where it was a product, a single product and an implementation, even a single product on an outsourcing basis. While we are continuing to see that in the international market, frankly across [EFI] and even across North America we are seeing deals that are much more transformational in nature. Not only will they have intellectual property and capital, but really a long term services component, where we are taking a huge piece of that infrastructure. I think that transformational opportunity that you are probably referencing is the Jefferies deal that we just announced. But what we are seeing is even in that market right you have got very large institutions, needing to reduce their cost in a very material way to take a whole bunch of disparate applications and pull them together and wrap best practices around it, streamline the overall operations, reduce application complexity and deliver it over a long-term value proposition so they can not only control their cost, but drive efficiencies as they grow their business.","And we are seeing these kind of engagements, where frankly it puts FIS in a very unique position. They are just not where we can really think of any competitor I think bring the capabilities around product, bring the capabilities around service and then bring the capabilities around consulting expertise to drive all that together to truly drive that long-term result. So we see it with the signing of Jefferies, we\u2019re seeing it in our pipeline execution. Frankly even backup of some of the large deals that we announced where we look at what we\u2019re doing with Sainsbury when you look at \u2013 what we are doing, things we are doing with the Umpqua, these are deals that all have, all of those components. So it's not just product lead it's a comprehensive product suite, it's wrapped around with those types of services and IT infrastructure. And when we look at our pipeline Brat, we have got more and more those types of deals coming into the queue.","Frank R. Martire","So, Brett these are now one-off opportunities when you look at Jefferies and some others, we have a very strong pipeline that supports that they will continue and thus many those that will come.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.","That\u2019s helpful and then second question on margins, I know there is in taking some of these larger deals on with more of a mixed component not just product driven that it has a little bit of a degradation impact on margins, as you guys think forward over the next year or two years on medium term, do we still feel like that we are going to grow margins by 50 basis points for give or take overtime even with that mixed shift?","James W. Woodall","Yes, I think as we talked about before. It depends on where the revenues come from. If they continue to come at a faster pace internationally and at a faster pace in these deals that have a lower overall margin profile, it will be difficult to continue to expand margins every year on that basis. However, we will also think at that same time, we would accelerate top line growth higher than that 5% of what we have seen over the last few years.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, we have been real clear about that Brett. We fundamentally will give up a little bit of margin to accelerate the top end of the growth curve and we are seeing those results. Do we think there is margin expansion in the business? Absolutely, you continue to see us hold our corporate numbers flat, you continue to see us execute very well where appropriate cost need to be taken out but obviously we are pushing the company to a higher growth curve and would expect those results.","Frank R. Martire","And to add a little more color, just to be clear, we would expect profit growth to accelerate and we would trade margin expansion to trying to accelerate that profit growth faster than we have today.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.","On a dollar basis you mean?","Frank R. Martire","On a dollar basis. That's correct.","Brett Huff \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s all I needed. Thanks guys.","Frank R. Martire","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Thanks guys. Look I just want to start off first with understanding sort of one-time items mainly around the term fees again only because just talking to margins, obviously margins, if we back out the $14 million from last year in our estimate your margin would have actually expanded about 40 basis points year-over-year during the quarter, are there any other moving parts? I think there was a benefit in the financial segment, right? That maybe would be impacting margins this quarter, just we get a sense of what was normalized growth and margin expansion after backing all the one-time non-operating items?","","James W. Woodall","Yes, we had a contractual fees related to Umpqua Sterling Banks transaction that was about an 80 basis points tailwind this quarter. So if we are looking at just to give you some color around sort of one-times or non-recurring items in the quarter. Additionally, we continue to invest in the global financial institution market this year which has an incremental $30 million headwind year-over-year. That was about $7 million or $8 million in the quarter. So that's about 40 basis points or so of headwind in the quarter. So there are some moving parts but we are just trying to give you there some color around where those parts are as we flow through the year.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","That helps, thanks. And then just I guess I was going to ask about the $30 million anyway so following up on that point, can you give us a little sense as to what the effectiveness has been, I mean again I think your goal is to really focus on a top 30 clients try to harvest more business out of them by moving some of your experts from the consulting side of the business over and back filling. How is that being going? Any traction, any new (inaudible)?","Frank R. Martire","Yes, I think Darren it's going very well. We are very pleased on it, try to provide some color in the script. When you look at the Jefferies win, it's direct result of that investment. We have announced another large win prior around unfortunately some of these global institutions don't allow you to expose their name in our earlier call. We are seeing great momentum in the pipeline to where these points we are right on track with our investment, you are exactly right. What we did was we hired really sales team if you want to think about it, client relationships teams dedicated to these top financial institutions. So they are a team and they are built around the global client partner. Their expectation, our expectation of that engagement is to drag all the things I discussed, not only in consulting and services but also product and processing and we are seeing strong results around that and seeing the strong pipeline as it grows to what these points mix is all different but the deals are long term in nature. Our pipeline actually has grown more in GFI than it has in the other markets but it's grown across all the markets which would indicate that this level investment there was some pin up demand in those markets and we are executing against it. So we feel good about the investment today.","Gary A. Norcross","And Darren, it's not just the number of wins but it\u2019s the size of the win. They are large deals for us and a lot of recurring revenue associated with it.","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays","Yes that's great. I mean chilling obviously in the financial segment of the international segment and certainly help you get to the strong guidance results high end in the guidance and trajectory next year. One last question though on the payment side, that's the one area where it didn't look as strong just based on I guess flattish growth than if you back out the term fee maybe just couple of per say growth, can you give us a little more granularity as to what the moving parts are and what's really driving sort of the upside versus the holding it back right now and if that should change and--","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, now it's a great question. If you really peel back through PSG we have some business lines that actually really did perform very well. We saw some strong growth in money movement and our network business etcetera. But your point out is exactly right, we did have the brawn of the large term fee from M&I hit back particular segment just so happens as the way they fell last year and while we grew through it on the revenue line as those term fees come on at a 100% margins roughly as well software license as then you sell through that is not going to be able to fill that profit on the same manner. Frankly when we look, payment is just an interesting situation about Q2 and Q3 of this year. We\u2019ve got some very difficult task for that particular segment, lot of license fees flowed, lot of term fees flowed through that segment last year.","And one of the things we continue to see is our software licenses just continue to stare a step down which is positive for us long term, back at Frank\u2019s point about long reoccurring revenue streams and it makes it much more predictable and makes frankly much more confident in what the future holds. But, those things do provide little lumpiness in the bottom line for us.","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays","Okay guys, thanks very much.","Frank R. Martire","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi guys, good morning. Just wanted to ask about \u2013 just on the term fees, how much were in the quarter just versus last year, just wanted to make sure the right numbers?","James W. Woodall","The term fees that really called out last year were mostly around BMO M&I, we talked about that being a $40 million number, we talked about 70% of that being in the first half of the year ratably between first quarter, second quarter and again between financial and payments about 70% again within payments versus financial. So, kind of sketch that math out that lot one, the specifics of those term fees are in the quarter last year.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And there is really none this year?","James W. Woodall","Well, not necessarily term fees, we always have some level of term fees in the year typically we churn out to call those analysts that are truly significant for you guys and we didn\u2019t have anything that was really significant in terms of term fees.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then, with some of the margin headwinds and obviously ramp up strong of the organic growth in the mix of business just trying to get a sense for EBITDA margins for the full year, does that mean and\/or can you just quantify that what that means for this year, for the EBITDA margins on a year-over-year basis?","Gary A. Norcross","As we talked and we guidance, we expected EBITDA margins to be in line with revenue growth or EBITDA growth to be in line with revenue growth. We added some color to say, if we see revenue growth towards the higher end of that range and if it comes in more of the international space and consulting and services space, you may see EBITDA margin at the lower end of that growth profile. So it will put some pressure on margins this year, how we ultimately pan out for the year will depend on where the actual revenue flows but it will put some pressure on overall margin expansion for the year.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then, just finally on the third quarter in particular, there is I think a high level license fees last year, just trying to get a sense of how big that was, how big that hurls that is to jump over?","James W. Woodall","I think we called out in a combination of the script and or the margin expansion last year, I\u2019ve to go back and double check. But, I know we saw, I think about 170 basis points of margin expansion in FSG and about a 175 of expansion in PSG, a lot of that was driven off of term fees as well as license fees last year, I think we called out the specifics around that.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Actually, I\u2019m just going to sneak in one last one. On the payment segment, I understand the comp gets tough and there is still tough in the third quarter and then does it start to expand then in the fourth quarter or is that also difficult comp for the payment segment?","Frank R. Martire","I think a lot less in terms of difficult comps for the segment, second and third quarter just had sort of heavy one times in it, we\u2019ve tried the highlight for you, but it\u2019s an easier comp in the four.","Bryan Keane \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great, congrats on the good quarter.","Frank R. Martire","Thanks Bryan.","Operator","And our next question in queue will come Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi, please go ahead.","Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Thank you, good guys.","Frank R. Martire","Good morning Ashwin.","Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citi Investment Research","My congratulations, good quarter here. My first question is, you guys have had some pretty strong signings here not just this quarter but the last many quarters, and I think it would help investors if you give us some idea of the conversion of these signings into revenues, I know these tend to be longer term, it can be often 12, 18, 24 month type conversions, but what are we looking at in terms of a potential acceleration of top line?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, Ashwin we\u2019re trying to give some color on that and more trying to continue to work and give you more insight over the cause. But, if you look, I talked about the deal flow through that pipeline not only are we building pipeline, we\u2019re seeing good churn on the pipeline meaning we\u2019re seeing decisions, obviously you don\u2019t win every decision in the market. We would tell you, if we did, but what we\u2019re seeing is, is great deal flow through the pipeline and we\u2019re continuing to see growth in the pipeline. So, not only are we seeing good deal churn we\u2019re actually replacing that pipeline and the pipeline is growing and our sale success has been growing consistently quarter-over-quarter and in Q2 it was a very big quarter.","To your point, how we\u2019re on-boarding some these larger deals, some of these deals depends on the type of engagement we have, I highlighted Sainsbury Bank major milestone this quarter getting their IT infrastructure established. We\u2019re seeing great, so that project is big and complex as it is, which I know a lot of the times these things around the industry will drag out. We hear stories about people\u2019s project getting elongated beyond the original pro forma. This one is right on schedule and so we feel very good about executing, we got other milestones in Q3 and Q4 and you will see that probably on-boarded by Q1 of next year, so feel good about that.","ING is another one, very complex, very large transpiration project worldwide once again that project continues hit every milestone, we\u2019re seeing revenue associated with both of those deals come on in the manner that we thought. The ATM deals are great examples as well, we announced a very, very large contract and it\u2019s going to ramp up to $100 million revenue, actually that ATM deployment is right on schedule and in couple other regions. In India, we\u2019re actually a little ahead of our deployment schedule and we\u2019re seeing a transaction volumes come up within pro forma. So all of these things, the deal flow is important and we\u2019re seeing in, frankly as I answered on another question, we\u2019re seeing an acceleration of deal flow. We\u2019re seeing, decisions are starting to be made on a shorter time period, some of these large complex deals still take 12 plus months to go through sales cycle because they\u2019re larger, they\u2019re more complex, but we\u2019re seeing deal flow accelerate. We\u2019re seeing pipeline accelerate and we\u2019re seeing our sales success and signings accelerate, so all of that makes us pretty confident about the second half of the year, makes us confident about 2015 and we think the strategy is working very well at this point.","Frank R. Martire","And Ashwin, where this commentary is coming, we continue to see \u2013 accelerate revenue growth towards the high end of our guidance range. So, actually we\u2019re trying to see some of that result right now.","Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citi Investment Research","And then, just to clarify that particular comment, you meant on a full year basis or second half, when you said high end?","James W. Woodall","That was specific to the third quarter color standpoint, but to give you guys we anticipate this first half to be slower, second half to be faster and we\u2019re seeing good line of side.","Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Got it. One other questions, obviously completely support the focus on operating profit as opposed to a margin number and operating profit increasing at a faster phase, now having said that when I look at some of these factors that have been pressuring margins international for example, and consulting growth, at what point, given that consulting is pretty much, I think the consulting headcount is kind of tripled in a couple of years here and international may go into country like the Philippines for example, three banks becomes four banks, five banks, your revenue gets spread over the cost. Shouldn\u2019t that ease some of the margin pressure?","James W. Woodall","Absolutely, I mean, as we normalize our mix, I think the way you\u2019re saying and as you see expansion in countries, yes, management expects, they start saying obviously some margin tailwinds around some of these businesses and frankly we\u2019re seeing some evidence of that. The consulting business you reference has continued to perform very well and obviously we want to keep that growth going and our consulting business is coming on at very traditional margins of what other large consulting groups are doing. There is a lot of opportunity around the globe to continue to sell out products, but now we absolutely believe that there is margin expansion in the business long term.","I do think you will see some lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter but we not only think we will get operating profit growth, but we do think long term will get some margin expansion and we\u2019ll continue to see that.","Ashwin Shirvaikar \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Got it, thank you guys.","Frank R. Martire","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Togut with Evercore, please go ahead.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.","Thank you, good morning everybody.","Frank R. Martire","Good morning, David.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.","Gary, on the last call you indicated that there was an opportunity to expand the India ATM contract to add a few new circles I believe, can you update us there on potential expansion opportunities?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, we\u2019re starting to actually see that but in a circle concept, it\u2019s a good question David. We haven\u2019t seen entire circles come back around, what we\u2019re starting to see in our reference some of them in the call with Muthoot Financial and Bank of India and others, we\u2019re starting to see ATM expansion right, not only in public sector banks but non-public sector banks. But, we\u2019re starting to see some of the large public sector banks that are struggling and circles come to companies like FIS and allowing us to deploy, even in circles we didn\u2019t win and we\u2019re starting to see more and more of that because they do have their numbers, they\u2019ve got to get out, they\u2019ve got to grow their business.","So, we\u2019ve seen a complete circle comeback around, no, I\u2019m not saying that it won\u2019t happen, but it still remains. They\u2019re certain circles that are struggling throughout India and we continue to take market share based on our results and the team has just done a phenomenal job in India. We got a great leadership team over there and they are really shining against the competition in deployment of these environments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Dan Perlin with RBC, please go ahead.","Daniel R. Perlin \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. So I guess kind of a longer term picture, I am just wondering and not the hamper on the margin so much but as you think about kind of your pipeline and you obviously have a very good line of site into what\u2019s going to look like and the business kind of contextually is changing quite a bit, I am just wondering when you think about the ability for the business to actually produce margin expansion, not absolute dollar growth but actual margin expansion into \u201915 and beyond just longer term, is the cost structure appropriate today or you thinking that you are just kind of get to that point via leverage because my sense of what I am hearing is that it's not going to take longer than \u201915 even if we exclude the $30 million.","James W. Woodall","Well, I think you might think about in terms of markets. If you look at our North American market which is more of our traditional business, you will continue to see margin expansion as sales in that leveraged environment come on at higher margins than the average corporate margins.","If you look at the global financial institution market, a lot of that is around consulting and services and it's a pull through of product but there are always services in that sales process, those we don't expect to come on at the same level of margin as our traditional business. And then the international group, we anticipate continuing to expand margins with those overall margins will be less than the corporate margin as they are today. They will expand and move towards that corporate margin but they will be lower than the overall margin in the short term but expanding.","So you have to kind of map out where the math is or where you anticipate the math to be in those different markets to add them together to see what the margin profile looks like over the next three to five years.","Frank R. Martire","And as we said on the GFI space specially that's an area that as we continue to see the success we are seeing and as we continue to see it accelerate the top line, don't expect, we might come back and talk about further investment in that market frankly it accelerated even further.","So we talked about that when we announced the original 30 million, this is something that we fundamentally believe there is lot of opportunity there and as the team executes but the Woody\u2019s points, even in GFI those services businesses, the margins ramp overtime because it's long term they deploy those services and as the services reach scale you are going to see even margin expansion there.","So that's goes back to the earlier question that I think Ashwin talked about which is we\u2019ll see margin expansion across the businesses but it's going to come in different ways across those markets and the type of mix we are deploying there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Tien-Tsin T. Huang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang \u2013 JP Morgan","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the EMV win, just curious to learn a little bit more about it. Is this a traditional VISA, MasterCard branded debit card win, is it just issuer deposit thing or would you also secure the branded business as well?","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, it's a great question. Right now it is VISA and MasterCard and it's really the card reissue inside of EMV, we think it's very significant. We got actually a pretty full pipeline around that side of our business and so we think it's a good opportunity and good testaments. Frankly I think it's the largest EMV deal done so far around cards but not sure that's one I said one of the largest, I mean it's definitely up there.","And when we look at our pipeline Tien, generally there is a lot of opportunity around this particular space. So we are starting to see, we have been seeing some EMV activity but it has been more partial reissues, high network, individuals, people traveling outside the states et cetera, et cetera. This is the first that at least in our environment where we have seen someone convert their entire card portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.","David J. Koning \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Hey, guys Great job.","Frank R. Martire","Hey Dave. Thanks.","Dave Koning \u2013 Baird","Yes and so I guess about the revenue acceleration now you kind of went over this little bit but I am just wondering when you said towards the high end of the range, did you mean for the full year that you think it gets higher in the range or you mean kind of through the second half and kind of existing the year it will be towards that higher end of the 4.5% to 6.5% range?","James W. Woodall","If you go back to how you laid out the guidance in the year, again we anticipated lower growth in the front half of the year, higher growth in the back half of the year. My comment was specific to Q3 where we really anticipating towards the higher end of the range for Q3 specifically. We still think that 4.5% to 6.5% is the right number for year but we do anticipate more growth in the back half of the year than we did in the front half of the year. We are sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Peter Heckmann with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.","Peter Heckmann \u2013 Avondale Partners","Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered but I did want to just see if you can give us additional, little additional detail on the Reliance acquisition in terms of how we should be building that into our model. So would that approximate about $16 million in annual revenue?","James W. Woodall","Yes, we haven\u2019t given specific dollars around it but we anticipate I mean a little bit of a tailwind in revenue in the back half of 2014, obviously we closed in mid July. We don't anticipate any EPS accretion in 2014 from the deal that EPS accretion will come in 2015, in terms of thinking about it I mean when you look at $110 million purchase price at the end of the day it's not that significant of the deal when you think about what the accretion might look like. But it will be a bit of a tailwind in the back half of 2014 and then further into 2015.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, we are excited about it though when you think about especially the community banking market, one of the things all financial institutions are clamoring for is how to drive additional fee income and how to make more money and how to penetrate further their customer race with the broader products suite.","One of the things we are seeing is we had a great product solution around wealth management but frankly a lot of the community institution just don't have the expertise to deploy full on back office trust services. Reliance Financial allows us now to take the subject matter expertise and intellectual capital and best practices around running a trust organizational, wealth management organization coupled with our product capability and the combined event is going to put us in a very good position to deploy that offer now to more than 600 sales resources around the U.S.","So we think it's a great opportunity. I even said in my notes we would be disappointed if it didn\u2019t double in size in the next five years and to Woody\u2019s point it\u2019s going to contribute accretively in 2015 and beyond with that growth.","Frank R. Martire","And it's a great opportunity cross-sale opportunity and added value for our clients.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Georgios Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Georgios Mihalos \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Great. Thanks for taking my question guys. Just wanted to dig in on the international side little bit more very strong growth there, is there a way to sort of parse out the growth that you are seeing from the consulting side, the Capco side versus say the processing side of the business?","James W. Woodall","Yes, I mean if you start thinking about in terms of regions, we saw extreme double-digit growth, high double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific. We saw very good double-digit growth in Europe and EMEA both in our traditional business as well as our Capco business. And then Latin America, we showed sort of mid single-digit growth. We anticipated seeing some headwinds in terms of overall growth because of sort of the macro economics going on in Brazil. But we are still seeing good growth there and then outside Brazil, again still seeing right at double-digit growth. So I hope that add a little color for you.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, just to be real clear, it's not all consulting growing there.","Frank R. Martire","That\u2019s right.","Gary A. Norcross","That\u2019s for sure I mean we are seeing great ramp-up in Sainsbury we are seeing great results in ING. We are seeing some other significant wins in Europe. Frank and we talked about other calls that Europe has been a headwind for us with several years because it turn slower from the macro economic issues. We are now seeing that accelerate for us with several large deals to double-digit growth as Woody just talked about.","We are seeing Brazil slow and it's been a major tailwind for us. Although we are still seeing good growth in Brazil and very bullish on our opportunities down there and then Asia-Pacific is growing very well and very, very strong in fact and all of that's is non-consulting. Now the consulting business, don't get me wrong, doing very well. So you are seeing the combination of all those things continue to push our international segment at double-digit rate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies","Hi guys. I wanted to ask about your international margins. It sounds like some growth acceleration in Asia and Europe is kind of more than offset, some macro-driven softness in Latin America. I was wondering if given the differing product and services mix in these different geographies Europe versus Asia versus Latin America, does this shift have any impact on how we should think about your international margins over the time? I guess it's another way of saying, are your margins significantly different in these different geographies?","James W. Woodall","That's a good question. I think there are some differences in the characteristics in the areas international that we have more of a consulting services, we are seeing a little bit of lower margins and the areas that you are in more leveraged environments like Brazil for example and some of the southeast Asia stuff, Australia specifically you got some higher margin area. So there is a blend across the board.","The other thing you saw in the quarter and we will see this year, this is part of our GFI investment, it\u2019s growing into the international market, so you have got that specific investment flowing into the international markets as well.","Gary A. Norcross","Yes, just to build on that Ramsey, it's a good question. Keep in mind over the last year now we talked about how we\u2019ve seen a very quick shift from product licensing to outsourcing and so what Woody\u2019s point is exactly that as our outsourcing builds in various markets, you are going to see that margin accelerate but given the infancy in some of the markets of our outsourcing, you have got to sign more customers to get that scale.","But once again, we are very pleased with that transition. It will normalize our growth streams and allow us to give us confidence in our projections in a much more effective way and also overtime, will produce much more predictable margin expansion.","Frank R. Martire","And Ramsey, it\u2019s like any place more size and scale we are able to leverage more and drive down cost.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one final question; it will come from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tim Willi - Wells Fargo","Thank you and good morning. I have a quick modeling question and then one about the business. First, on modeling did you call out what the revenue decline was around the check processing and the payments business, I know you typically give that out?","James W. Woodall","We did not, Tim I think we have talked about it in the last few quarters, we have seen that not as a headwind anymore and as it continue to be a less significant component of the business, we are trying to get away from talking about it. I would tell you to give you some color this quarter, it wasn\u2019t much of a headwind, slight headwind this quarter but not much one.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the conference back over to our presenters for any closing comments.","Frank R. Martire","Okay. Thank you for your questions, for your continue interest in FIS.
