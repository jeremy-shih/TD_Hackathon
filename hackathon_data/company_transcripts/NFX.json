Welcome to the Newfield Exploration Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference. For opening remarks and other housekeeping items, I will turn the conference over to Steve Campbell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Steve Campbell","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. A few of us are still assembled in our Halloween costumes from late last night, but we appreciate you guys dialing in for today\u2019s call. Following this morning\u2019s prepared remarks from our Chairman and CEO, Lee Boothby, we\u2019ll have members of our leadership team available to take your questions. As always please limit your time during Q&A to one question and one follow-up.","Let me again remind you today that today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available on our website, along with our earnings release, the financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations as well as @NFX. We will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so please see the reconciliation in our earnings release and in @NFX. Today\u2019s discussion will contains forward-looking estimates and assumptions that are based on our current views and reasonable expectations.","In summary, statements in yesterday\u2019s news release and @NFX and on this conference call today regarding our expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under the Federal Securities Laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in the earnings release and @NFX, our 10-K and 10-Qs, our prior outlook release and other filings with the SEC. Please refer to the risk factors in our earnings release and @NFX for additional information.","Thanks again, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman, Lee Boothby.","Lee Boothby","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I\u2019ll open today\u2019s call with our key message right upfront: Newfield delivered. Our significant a ramp in the Anadarko Basin oil production came through over the past three months. We\u2019re seeing strong results from our recent wells, with STACK outperforming our quarterly expectations by about 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We continue to execute very well as we ramped from three completion spreads to six and completed about 40 wells in the Anadarko Basin during the third quarter.","We did this with the backdrop of inexperienced crews and the hurricane that dropped 50 inches of rain on our office and made weather-related issues for our field personnel very challenging. I applaud our operations personnel for making the right things happen, doing the right things and getting it done once again. We\u2019re excited to share today\u2019s progress report with you this morning and we appreciate you dialing in. We generated some significant milestones over the past quarter. Here\u2019s a short list. We posted more than 25% increase in our oil production in the Anadarko Basin quarter-over-quarter.","To be clear, that\u2019s second quarter 2017 to third quarter 2017, not year-over-year. Our Anadarko Basin production averaged nearly 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the third quarter, a new record for Newfield, erasing several quarters of relatively flat production as we transitioned from HBP drilling to pad drilling. Well performance and execution had been equally strong and we now expect our Anadarko Basin production to average around 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, up another 10% sequentially.","This number is at the upper end of the range we provided for you back in February. Our recent oil well in STACK had a 24-hour record for production per thousand feet of lateral, coming in at 5,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the initial 24-hour period. Oil cut was 67%. This is a good follow-up to our Burgess well, and we now have two of the top five 24-hour oil well IPs in STACK. The Burgess, which was drilled earlier this year, is projecting a type curve well in excess of 3 million barrels of oil equivalent after 120 days. We\u2019re still learning with every well we drill and complete.","Our Stark and Freeman pads have shown strong early performance. These NFX-operated developments were drilled to test 10-well spacing configurations in the Meramec with all wells completed with 2,100 pounds of proppant and 2,100 gallons of water per foot. Average infill well performance from both pilots is tracking above our type curve. Production updates on BOE and oil can be found in our @NFX publication. It\u2019s early, but we remain encouraged and are confident in our resource estimates for STACK. We invested $316 million in the third quarter and we\u2019re on track to deliver this year\u2019s program for our stated $1.1 billion.","In today\u2019s @NFX, you will find a slide that shows Newfield as the best-in-class driller in every basin where we are active today. The slide shows penetration rates across the three drilling regions. Newfield is the clear leader, and we benefit from a culture of innovation, with our teams constantly challenging each other to improve. We expect to see continued efficiency gains in the Anadarko Basin as we progress our development. Our drilling results continue to get better, with recent wells averaging 700 feet a day in SCOOP and just under 1,000 feet a day in STACK.","Year 2017 is shaping up to be a very good year for Newfield as we are executing well against our beginning of year objectives. Our 2017 program was focused on STACK pilots to test various spacing assumptions and advanced completions. We recently completed and turned to sales the Freeman pilot. Results from the nine infill wells in the Meramec look consistent with our Stark pad after 60 days of production. Both pads were completed with Newfield\u2019s GEN17 completion design of 2,100 pounds of proppant foot and 2,100 gallons of liquid per foot.","Although early, cumulative average 60-day production from both pads on an oil equivalent basis outperforming the Company\u2019s 1.1 million barrel type curve. Our Stark pad, which now has 120 days of production, is estimated to generate an internal rate of return of more than 60% at a $50 flat WTI price. In addition, the remaining portion of our HBP drilling program continues to show excellent results across our acreage position. During the quarter, we provided you with an updated list of wells with cumulative production out to two years. It was an impressive list that spanned across our acreage.","In @NFX today, we provided data on another eight recent HBP wells in STACK, including the play\u2019s record-setting oil well, which commenced production with 24-hour initial production rate of 5,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, some 67% oil from a 7,140-foot lateral. In SCOOP, we commenced sales from two new developments during the quarter. The McClelland pad was our first development with eight infill wells drilled in the Woodford. Average 30-day rates for the eight infill wells were 1,966 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 36% of which was oil.","The McClelland infill wells are performing in line with our recent Tina development, where production has averaged nearly 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 41% oil over the first 120 days. The second development was the Holinsworth, which had seven infill wells in the Woodford. Initial 24-hour production per well averaged 3,193 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 33% of which is oil, 30-day production data is not yet available. Despite some significant weather issues during the quarter, our Williston Basin production averaged nearly 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","The Williston basin continues to deliver for us. With a single operated rig, we\u2019ve been able to grow our production through optimized completions and significantly more productive wells. The Williston is expected to deliver more than $100 million free cash flow for us in 2017. Our recent wells have estimated gross EURs of more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent and we raised our type curve in the Williston earlier this year. We estimate that we have about 200 operated locations that deliver strong returns in today\u2019s oil price environment.","In addition, we have hundreds of non-op locations in the Williston as well. In preparation for these quarterly updates, I typically go back and reread our prior transcripts. Last quarter, we detailed several key priorities that are present today as they were then, especially in light of the recent discussions we\u2019ve had with many of you on the road. These priorities are: First, we\u2019re focused on delivering our three-year plan which we laid out for you in February. Despite the exuberance for quickly rising oil prices earlier this year, we used $50 per barrel of WTI as our base planning assumption in 2017 as well as a flat rig count in the Anadarko Basin.","When combined, this base plan was set to deliver double-digit compound annual growth over the planned period. Since that time, we raised our 2017 production growth estimates from 3% to today\u2019s 9% to 10% growth outlook without adding increased activity levels. We\u2019re executing extremely well today and our well performance across the organization has been very strong. But growth by itself is not our goal. That\u2019s why my second point on last quarter\u2019s conference call would likely occupy the first spot today, based on recent discussions. We remain focused on improving our returns. Full stop. Our overarching goal is to transition our company to one that delivers sustainable production growth within our funds from operations.","We certainly had this ideal in our mind when we set our activity and spending levels for this year, and I am confident that Newfield will be in the short list of companies that can deliver on this objective. It will be important that investors reward companies focused on these new metrics and not revert to past behaviors which overwhelmingly favored production growth over capital discipline and improved returns. Our leadership is on board and we are pursuing creative ways to ensure the ongoing alignment with our owners, from the boardroom all the way to field operations.","Third, we are rapidly advancing our learning curve in STACK and solving for the optimal returns-focused development well spacing. This year\u2019s pilot program is providing us with data that will drive improved returns and margins through optimized operations on the road ahead. Our fourth objective relates to SCORE and understanding the vast resource that lies within our own operated HBP acreage position in the Anadarko Basin. For a $100 million investment this year, we made the assessment of other prospective horizons on our acreage of priority. By year-end, we will have up to 10 operated wells in these prospective horizons and a better understanding of their commerciality and plans for future development. We remain very encouraged with some of the early results we are seeing in SCORE.","Before opening the call up to your questions, I\u2019ll quickly cover our third quarter financials. For the third quarter, we bested Street estimates for both earnings and cash flow. Net income was $87 million or $0.44 per share. Earnings were impacted by onetime tax benefits of $17 million or $0.09 per share, driven by carryback of net operating losses and unrealized derivative loss of $34 million or $0.16. After adjusting for the effect of these items, net income would have been $104 million or $0.52 per share. Revenues for the third quarter were $439 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $173 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $262 million.","As I mentioned earlier, we are right on track with our investment plan for 2017. You can find a table in @NFX that details our quarterly investment pace, excluding capitalized interest and overhead. Our domestic production in the third quarter was 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, surpassing the upper end of our guidance range. Domestic production for the quarter was 41% oil. Including China, our total company production in the third quarter was 14.9 million barrels of oil equivalent or 162,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is approximately 12,000 barrels per day above the second quarter of 2017. Of the total, 64% was liquids and 36% was gas.","As a percentage of overall volumes, we expect that our fourth quarter mix will reflect slightly higher gas and NGL production. This is primarily due to several large development pads brought online in SCOOP, the largest is a non-op development currently producing at very high rates from the condensate window of the play. Our net share in that development is over 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It\u2019s very rich gas, but only 11% black oil. Our more normal oil gas and NGL split should prevail into 2018.","As you know, our Pearl field in China remains off-line awaiting repairs for our third party-operated storage vessel that we expect to be completed by early next year. We lifted the remaining oil in the vessel during the third quarter, resulting in 239,000 net barrels. No additional liftings are expected until next year. We continue to add to our hedge position for 2018 and 2019. We\u2019re essentially insulating a mid-50s oil price and protecting ourselves from the downside. As we move into development plays and plays like STACK, it will be increasingly more important for us to manage commodity price risk to ensure acceptable returns on our development programs. Newfield has an excellent track record in this regard, and expect our behaviors to remain consistent. Please see @NFX for the complete updates on our derivatives positions.","Before closing out our prepared remarks this morning and moving to your specific questions, let me take a few broader \u2013 make a few broader comments about our business and our near-term focus. Over the last quarter, we\u2019ve spend some time on the and met with approximately 15% of our owners. These meetings were done with our Lead Director and chair of our Audit Committee. It was a great opportunity to have a dialogue about our company, our industry and gain important insights on how our owners collectively view the future. Be assured that we hear you. Our industry is at an inflection point today where the land grab is behind us.","HBP drilling has shored up large, contiguous acreage positions in resource plays and we\u2019re now entering the harvest mode. Harvest mode should look different, and historic behaviors of aimlessly chasing production growth at the expense of returns should become a thing of the past. Newfield is in a unique position today, blessed with a quality inventory of opportunities. We expect to be in the short list of companies that will transition to delivering improved returns and cash flow growth while living within our means. Simply stated, production growth should become an output of implementing the right development strategies to maximize value creation. On the road ahead, we are focused on delivering double-digit growth while demonstrating improved efficiencies throughout our operations.","As always, thank you for your interest and investment in Newfield Exploration. And operator, we\u2019re now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Dave Kistler with Simmons, Piper Jaffray.","Dave Kistler","Kind of picking up on your comment about being a little gassier in the fourth quarter. When we look at the McClelland and Tina infills and going back to kind of the Q2 slide deck where those are generating 70% rate of returns, is it necessarily bad that mix is getting a little bit more gassy with those types of returns? And how do you think about that in your go-forward portfolio?","Lee Boothby","Dave, hello and thanks for your question. I think the short answer is we\u2019re returns-focused and you can count on team Newfield to pursue the best returns in the portfolio. They\u2019re incredibly strong returns. We\u2019re excited about the well results. And I think we should all become a bit agnostic with regard to product type when you\u2019re generating 70-plus percent rates of return. So we\u2019re very pleased with it. I think it doesn\u2019t affect the mix in the short-term, as indicated. But we\u2019re going to continue to pursue the high-return portions of our portfolio.","Dave Kistler","Okay. I appreciate that clarification. And then going back to something you were talking with respect to the weather interruptions and how you guys were to avert any issues there, can you talk a little bit about how you structurally have planned to be able to do that when other operators have been using it as an excuse relative to their performance this quarter?","Lee Boothby","I can\u2019t speak to the other operators, Dave. But I\u2019ll tell you that our team does an amazing job of planning and reacting. We weren\u2019t without stress. Obviously, in the weather-related effects and some of the backup in the system, certainly don\u2019t want to act like we didn\u2019t have stress. There was a lot of stress in our team, but they planned effectively and executed extraordinarily. And then of course, that\u2019s all Gulf Coast and related effects that spilled back towards pressure in the Mid-Continent. And on top of that, our Williston Basin folks were hit with weather. And I never heard a peep out of our team, not one complaint, not any bellyaching, nobody looking to blame any weather on delivered results. So as I said, team Newfield delivered. I\u2019m proud of them.","Operator","We have our next question from Josh Silverstein with Wolfe Research.","Lee Boothby","Good morning, Josh. Hello.","Josh Silverstein","Hey, good morning. Sorry, I was on mute. You mentioned the 40 wells in the Anadarko Basin this quarter. Just wanted to see if that was a little bit below where you guys were thinking. Maybe there were some weather issues that had some impact there. And then maybe going forward, what would be kind of the quarterly cadence? Or if you want to look at annual cadence for how many wells can be turned online with a 10-rig program.","Lee Boothby","Well, the 40 was in line with our plan expectations, so I would say that\u2019s what we built to. We loaded up in the first half of the year with respect to the multi-well pad developments. We did have a handful of HBP activity that continued through the first three quarters, but that was dominated by the multi-well pads. As far as cadence, still in the short-term, continue to be some variability as we move rigs between SCOOP and STACK to keep the overall development program on track. The ultimate cadence in 2018 forward will be dependent upon where we set our final capital budget and plan.","And we\u2019ll come out with that in early February. But I would say in general, based upon the activities that we\u2019ve seen this year and the tight capital budget, you\u2019d expect a more normalized level to be 35 to 40 wells per quarter. And we\u2019ll advise if we come out with a plan that\u2019s above or below that. But that\u2019s probably in line with what you might expect on the road ahead.","Josh Silverstein","That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful there. And then thanks on the comments on the kind of normal split of the production mix there. And I know there was no other question on it, but is the normal split around the 35% level where you were this quarter? I realize maybe fourth quarter\u2019s a little bit gassier. And I understand that there\u2019s a bit of rig mix between the two areas, but STACK is over 45%, SCOOP\u2019s around 25%. So I\u2019m just wondering if that 35% is kind of the right blend.","Lee Boothby","Yes. So it\u2019s obviously moves around depending on the pieces that you look at. I think I\u2019d start with a reminder to everybody that if you think about where we\u2019re going to be on domestic oil fourth quarter 2017 over fourth quarter 2016, we\u2019re going to be up some 25% on oil. So oil\u2019s growing. We benefited by improving NGL pricing and we\u2019re blessed with having exposure across the phase envelope and we\u2019ve been able to drill and complete wells that have really high NGL yields, so we benefited there as well. Anadarko Basin, when you isolate on oil, it\u2019s up some 30% fourth quarter of 2016 over \u2013 fourth quarter 2017 over fourth quarter 2016. Again, strong upward momentum that\u2019s going to carry into 2018.","What I would suggest to everybody, and I\u2019ve tried a couple of times during the course of last year to suggest this, is to not be so hung up on single percentage fluctuations, up or down, quarter-over-quarter, because as we move around on the phase envelope and you turn on 8, 10-well pads that have the variability we\u2019re talking about, that\u2019s going to affect the numbers a percentage point or so. Ultimately, I would expect that we\u2019ll maintain, when we say 2018 forward, you look at the total liquids percentage that we delivered in 2017, we\u2019d say we\u2019ll have a similar mix going forward. I don\u2019t see that changing materially. We may sort of slide up or bias to oil over that time period, but I\u2019d look at the mix on an annualized basis to be kind of plus or minus 1% or 2% around the numbers that we\u2019re posting for 2017.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Derrick Whitfield with Stifel.","Derrick Whitfield","Thank you and congrats on a strong quarter guys.","Lee Boothby","Thanks, Derrick.","Derrick Whitfield","Lee, at a high level, how would you think about spending and capital allocation in a $55 to $60 price environment versus the planned $50 assumption you mentioned earlier? Would you be biased to pile cash or slightly increase activity with a focus on returns?","Lee Boothby","Well, first and foremost, we\u2019re going to stay returns-focused. I think that\u2019s where our management and board are focused, that\u2019s where our operations leadership team is focused and that\u2019s driven all the way down to field level. So we\u2019re making decisions today on optimizing returns and delivering cash flow growth. I mean, that\u2019s the ultimate measure. Clearly, we said that we want to move to balance within the timeframe that we talked about back in February, in that three-year period. Beyond that, our investments will be dictated by the pricing environment, the macro and the cash available.","But we haven\u2019t changed any of our thinking, sitting here today, over what we articulated back in February. And I think the cool thing is we\u2019re ahead of schedule and I think we carry great momentum into 2018. And if we see a $55, $60 world develop, then that just gets easier. We kind of like that.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ron Mills, Johnson Rice.","Ron Mills","Good morning, Lee. A quick question. As you think about \u2013 with HBP coming \u2013 or nearing an end in the STACK and you talk about being agnostic on returns, how do you think about capital allocation between the SCOOP and STACK in terms of rig count, given the compelling returns there despite the different product mix?","Lee Boothby","Well, I think when you get to an HBP point, then when the team, and that\u2019s Gary, John and our operating teams, look to optimize on the program, they\u2019re going to focus on where they can generate the best returns within the portfolio. So in the end of the day, we\u2019ll have capital budget, we\u2019ll make the allocation, and their job\u2019s going to be to optimize the return.","So we\u2019ll go to the places that give us those outcome. I expect that we\u2019ll continue to see activity in both SCOOP and STACK that\u2019s a high return for both areas. Williston Basin, we\u2019ve been running a rig for the last couple of years. And we\u2019ve got really strong returns there. So you can continue to see activity there. But it\u2019s all focused on high returns. Let\u2019s use the phrase that\u2019s popular these days. It\u2019s a premium inventory, premium returns. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. We\u2019ll go wherever we have to go to get them.","Ron Mills","Great. And is there any marked difference between kind of your Stark and Freeman pads in terms of being over pressured and normally pressured? And how does that play into \u2013 or how do you think that plays into your oil results?","Lee Boothby","Yes. I think when you go back, and I think we\u2019ve been consistent with over the last several years, you moved from southwest to northeast kind of across our acreage position, across the broader STACK play. Go all the way out to the west, you start in the dry gas window. As you move back towards Cana Woodford an up-dip of that area, you get it kind of in the gas \u2013 kind of wet gas condensate window. And then you go through volatile oil and then into the black oil window.","Our acreage position remains 80% plus in the black oil window. We\u2019re blessed to have exposure in that wet gas condensate volatile oil window, and that\u2019s where we and industry have been focused in a $50 world because the combination of pressure and yield and product yield have generated really, really strong returns. But we still see strong returns from East to West. As long as you\u2019re in the liquids window, wells out west tend to cost a little bit more and wells to the east cost a little bit less.","So F&D and returns are something that our team looks at. And when John and Gary are executing the game plan. They\u2019re taking all of those factors into account in terms of optimizing the returns.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra","Yes, hi. Good morning, Lee. Just a question, first question on the increased density pilots. Were these all two string?","Lee Boothby","The well results that are posted?","Subash Chandra","Yes, correct. The wells in those pilots.","Lee Boothby","I believe they\u2019re stated in the fine print and I have to wear glasses these days. So when I [indiscernible]","Steve Campbell","I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re three string. As is the type curve, yes.","Lee Boothby","I\u2019m sorry? As is the type curve, Steve added.","Subash Chandra","As a three string type curve, okay. And the cost variance, 3 to 2, is it sort of $0.25 million, $0.5 million range?","Lee Boothby","Cost variance?","Subash Chandra","Yes, from two string to three string. Because I guess you\u2019re going to do two string at your acreage to the east.","Lee Boothby","No, no, no. Here, two stream versus three stream is very simply this: two stream, when we say two stream, is separator results. So we\u2019ll have natural gas and liquid volumes. Three stream\u2026","Subash Chandra","No, I\u2019m sorry, Lee. String, not stream.","Lee Boothby","I was worried that maybe you stayed up last night trick or treating or something.","Subash Chandra","Had some of that as well.","Lee Boothby","But as you move west, in the deeper sections, there is extra string of pipe. And in general, you\u2019re looking at about $750,000 adder for that string of pipe. Yes.","Subash Chandra","Okay, got it. So \u2013 but the wells that you\u2019re announcing in your pilots, those are two string.","Lee Boothby","The wells to the west, the west will be \u2013 have the extra string in it. The Freeman\u2019s would \u2013 three string. So when you move into the black oil, you can think about that as two string. So those wells generally have an advantage on cost.","Subash Chandra","Okay. Got it. Okay. And second question, I think you inferred this already, continued investment in the Williston. And what about Uinta? And how do you think about those two assets holding the line on volumes heading into 2018?","Lee Boothby","I mean, I think Williston we\u2019ve been pretty straight up about where we\u2019re at there. We\u2019re generating high returns. I love the performance of the team and you should probably plan on seeing our rig continue to execute there. Uinta, we owe you guys an update in 2018 on our progress out there. We\u2019ve had the JV that\u2019s coming to an end, I guess, in terms of the activity there. So we\u2019ll have well results that we can talk about next year. And we\u2019ll be able to talk about that in terms of where it fits in the portfolio prospectively. But I\u2019ve been pleased with the progress the team\u2019s made the last couple of years in terms of learning curve.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Singer, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you, good morning. Wanted to follow up on a couple comments you made in your opening remarks. The first was creative ways of alignment between shareholders and the board room, and there was that working the field. If you could add some more color on what some of those creative ways or creative options are. And then the second is on margin improvement. If production mix is flat, can you talk to what impact we could see on the operating cost side of the equation or whether margin expansion will be more coming from capital cost via lower F&D or lower CapEx per barrel?","Lee Boothby","So I\u2019m going to take the first one, and if I forget pieces of the second one, I might ask you to repeat. There were a lot of words there. So on the first point, when you \u2013 when we talk about alignment, it\u2019s having a plan that is certified and blessed at the board level; and goals, which we\u2019ve been very steadfast in over the last half dozen years. All of our goals that are part of the annual incentive plan for the entirety of staff, so that\u2019s management and everybody down to the field level, absolutely aligned with the return focus that we\u2019re talking about.","So everybody\u2019s playing off the same page of the playbook and executing and there\u2019s good communication. So I think that\u2019s critical. Oftentimes, if you go back historically, it\u2019s easy to talk a game, it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to play the game. And our intentions are to not just speak the words, but to deliver the results. And I think that the companies that have a track record of delivering those results year in and year out, have proven operators and have proven ability to execute, I expect that those will be the winners on the road ahead for the reason stated in the earlier commentary.","So very simply, we\u2019ve got everybody aligned. It\u2019s not a new thing at Newfield, but with emphasis, everybody\u2019s aligned on the elements that we\u2019ve laid out over the course of this 2017, and I would expect that alignment to be enhanced on the road ahead. As far as the second question, I said there was a lot in there. Can you give me the short reminder of all the things you said? And let me make sure I hit on\u2026","Brian Singer","Driver of margin improvement. Is that coming? Specially if production is flat, right? Is that an op cost point, or is that a capital cost point?","Lee Boothby","Well, I mean, we\u2019re moving on all fronts. I mean, our team\u2019s focused every day and working to improve F&D, right? There\u2019s always a lot of conversations about well cost. It\u2019s a bit of a head fake some days. There\u2019s all kinds of type curves and yields, so when you think about returns, it\u2019s an F&D game. Margin enhancement, you got to be improving returns, and you can do that by lowering cost and improving yields. So our completion folks are working hard to give us better completions that have better yield per foot of lateral.","And on the other side of the equation, we\u2019re working very, very hard to think about the best locations for product mix. As the macro shifts, where do you get the best yield of product mix that can optimize the revenue stream and generate the returns. On the LOE side, I\u2019ve been absolutely amazed at what our teams have been able to achieve over the last several years in terms of driving LOE cost down. Never bet against them, and they\u2019re going to stay focused on it. And I think that\u2019s part of the equation. And then at a leadership level, we\u2019re also focused on making sure that we\u2019ve got an accretive G&A profile that\u2019s part of that.","So when you put all of those pieces together, playing forward, we\u2019ll have an accretive profile because we\u2019re extracting the efficiencies out of the organization and we\u2019re staying focused on driving improving returns. The other item that\u2019s been helpful in areas like STACK, and we\u2019re going to continue to press this on all fronts and all operating areas, working to lower differentials. And some of our investments and infrastructure, the core contiguous positions, the operating advantages that, that affords, we\u2019ve been able to see those benefits.","And I think we\u2019ve talked about them enough that you can go back and look at the high points there in terms of what we\u2019ve delivered. You should take it as an expectation going forward by our team that we\u2019re going to continue to find those opportunities and drive them forward. And then I touched on one of the earlier questions, we\u2019ve seen an improving NGL pricing scenario develop as 2017 has played out. And that really drives some incremental cash in that area and it changes some of the positioning for those wells in the portfolio when we\u2019re talking about optimizing returns. So one of our core values is adaptability, and I think our team has demonstrated that in spades over the last few years.","And we\u2019ll continue to adapt, shift and lean in to some of those developing trends. But it\u2019s multiple fronts. It\u2019s not single item. And then ultimately, as we look forward, it would be my hope that we can all become a little bit more constructive and worry about so much on where rigs are positioned, but more on the results that are being delivered from those rigs. I think that tells you a lot about the quality of the team and the decision-making and the consistency of management.","So just call that a plea to say look out into the future and become a little more comfortable with the idea that if companies are delivering results, they\u2019re making good decisions. And we\u2019re going to deliver those results. And we\u2019ll continue to update you guys on the road ahead.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Herrlin, Societe Generale.","John Herrlin","Have you and the board had any discussion, since you\u2019re going to have more of a returns-focus on, one, dividends. And second question, do you think, given your book debt load, that you\u2019ve been penalized even though you\u2019re not going to have any real maturity issues until 2022, do you think as you get more returns-focused, that you\u2019ll look at delevering a little bit on a book basis? Or will you just let earnings carry it out.","Lee Boothby","So maybe start with the first one there, John. And this is not new dialogue for management or the board. Our view, very simply, is we\u2019ve got to execute and deliver. We had to get our acreage HBP-ed so we could move towards development. Now that we\u2019re finishing off the HBP phase, we can optimize development. As we optimize development, we\u2019re optimizing returns. And we\u2019ll keep all of those things on the table on the road ahead. I think the clearest demonstration of returns-focused that\u2019s flowing through is going to be growth in cash flow and the fact that you can do it living within your means.","So think about playing forward, 2018 forward, we\u2019re going to look at that and understand what we need to do within whatever price range that we choose to contract the plan on. And we\u2019ll communicate that actively with the board. So returns focus with the board is not new language. And ultimately, balanced at delivering \u2013 being able to deliver a balanced plan delivers growth, that demonstrate returns. Beyond that, we\u2019ll cross those other bridges when we get there.","And as far as penalized, levered and this, that, the other thing, I don\u2019t really have a strong opinion. I like where we\u2019re at. I think we\u2019ve got a good debt maturity ladder. We\u2019ve got a strong financial position. And I\u2019ll give Larry Massaro and the team a lot of credit for keeping us in the fairway there. We\u2019ll continue to make smart decisions and on the road ahead as we face those decisions then. We\u2019ll make the right decisions at that time.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Richard Tullis, Capital One Securities.","Richard Tullis","Thanks, good morning. Nice quarter, Lee.","Lee Boothby","Thanks, Richard.","Richard Tullis","Sure. Just a couple of questions. So China oil volume\u2019s obviously declining, but still viable given international oil prices. What sort of cash flow could you expect from those properties next year, say, they\u2019re back up and running in first quarter?","Lee Boothby","Well, since we\u2019re shut in at moment, we\u2019re hoping the reservoir\u2019s recharging, that would be the first thing. And I\u2019m not suffering decline right now because we\u2019ve got shut in. But it has been on decline. And my view is that it\u2019s been a strong-performing asset. We\u2019ve got two or three years of good production out in front of us when it comes back online. We\u2019ll update you on cash flow and what our expectations are when we come out with our plan in February 2018. We expect it to be back online early next year.","Richard Tullis","Okay. And then secondly, Lee, does the higher current oil price environment, hopefully sticks around, allows for some meaningful level of dollars to be allocated to, call it, exploratory efforts next year? And what sort of things could you look to do?","Lee Boothby","Well, I would tell you that we\u2019re always thinking about our exploration and new ventures team, talks about the opportunity list in terms of hopper and conveyor. The things we\u2019ve been doing are derisking, this year, the SCORE play, zones that are already on HBP acreage. That\u2019s the obvious place. We\u2019ve already made that investment. I would say that, respectively, given our rich with inventory, high-return, premium, quality inventory, that we\u2019re going to be development-focused. But we\u2019ll continue to have export their ideas from time to time, we\u2019ll work that into the program. But our program\u2019s going to be strongly development and focused when moving forward.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc.","David Deckelbaum","Thanks for taking my question, Lee. Nice job on the quarter.","Lee Boothby","Thanks, David.","David Deckelbaum","Wanted to just marry your comments around balance sheet, this sort of evolution with the industry. How do you view the state of, I guess, your total asset package right now? You\u2019ve had some successes in the Williston, and it warrants keeping a rig there for a couple of years. But I guess as we get into next year and have well reserves from the Uinta, I know you have other assets like the Arkoma, how aggressively are you going to be pursuing, I guess, pruning your total asset base to become a little bit more efficient here?","Lee Boothby","So I\u2019ll make it hopefully clear. We have a very healthy perspective on this, I would say at a management level and I would say a staff level that\u2019s been demonstrated over the last several years, and certainly this carries into boardroom as well. We call it grow, hold or divest. And every asset that sits in Newfield\u2019s portfolio is tested every day on that basis. So we\u2019re growing an asset, we have to know why we\u2019re growing the asset, that\u2019s generally the asset you\u2019ll see active investment in. If we\u2019re holding an asset, then we\u2019ve got to be able to answer the question on why we are holding that asset? To what purpose?","And if you can\u2019t meet the grow or hold test, then divest is the right answer. I think we\u2019ve sold in excess of $3 billion of assets over the last several years. We\u2019ve redeployed that into the portfolio that we have today. So reinvested North American resource plays. We\u2019ve been consistent on this front that every asset has a life cycle. So we\u2019ll continue to have active dialogue in that regard. And clearly, at the right time and place for the right reasons, we maintain the option of divesting assets to accelerate activity in our portfolio. So we\u2019ll stay focused on that. And it\u2019s going to continue to be part of our daily decision-making.","Operator","And we have time for one last question, that will come from Leo Mariani, NatAlliance Securities.","Leo Mariani","Hi, guys. Just wanted to maybe ask the oil cut question for the fourth quarter a little bit differently. I think you\u2019ve described it well, Lee, in saying that the gas cut goes up a little bit because you\u2019ve got some very prolific pads coming online on the SCOOP play that have gassier. I guess, alternatively, maybe are there fewer STACK pads coming online in the fourth quarter, which are obviously oily there? Obviously, you had a huge third quarter in terms of STACK pads turned online. Just trying to get a sense of maybe there\u2019s just less oily property also coming online as well.","Lee Boothby","So Leo, I\u2019m going to give you a gold star. That\u2019s spot on. Just in terms of the sequencing and where things fit in, we do have a decrease in completed and POP-ed wells, put on production wells, in STACK in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019ll build that cadence again as we move into 2018. So that\u2019s one of those variables that we\u2019re working to manage. I think that we have taken steps to move towards a consistent frac fleet in terms of counts.","So we\u2019re reducing volatility in frac fleet. And Gary and the team are working every day very hard to make sure that we\u2019re balancing out all of those demands. So consistent activity in the flat frac fleet 2018 forward, but no way around it. We turned on a bunch of pads which represent a bunch of drilling activity and capital investment in STACK in the third quarter, we have fewer STACK wells coming online in the fourth quarter. Spot on.","Leo Mariani","Yes, that makes sense, for sure. And I guess just in terms of a quick follow-up here. Obviously, you guys are now in full pad development mode at STACK. Do you guys see potential for continued well cost reductions? So maybe you could just give us a sense of what well costs are now and maybe you could give us some projection as to where that may go over the next six months, barring any service cost increases.","Lee Boothby","Yes. I would say that the cost that we\u2019re experiencing at present are kind of in line with what we\u2019ve talked about here over the last few months. So I don\u2019t have any new color to give you there. I think you can put that out. We\u2019re working hard on the 2018 plan, and since we haven\u2019t presented preliminaries to the board, I\u2019ll just go ahead and stay silent on that until early February \u2013 excuse me, February of 2018, when we come out with our plan.","What I will say is our team\u2019s working every day, per the earlier conversations, to drive down cost. And that\u2019s on all fronts. We have to do it. It\u2019s an imperative. I think it\u2019s something that they do exceptionally well. We demonstrated what \u2013 how that plays out on the drilling front in the @NFX publication. So we said at the beginning of our transition to North American resource focused and our shift to oil, that we ultimately needed to be a leader on the operating front in any area we chose to deploy capital.","So I think that drilling performance demonstrates that. We\u2019re attacking completions in the same way, we attack field-level operations the same way, we attack margins the same way, and our team is relentless in that regard. So you can count on them to continue to deliver. And I\u2019ll promise that I\u2019ll give you as much color as I can and that you need when we come up with our plan early in 2018. But again, we feel really good about our 2017 results and really excited about the 2018 forward game plan.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. We\u2019ll turn the conference back over to Mr. Boothby for any additional or closing remarks.","Lee Boothby","Well again, thank you all for dialing in this morning. I appreciate the questions. We\u2019re very pleased with where we sit closing out the third quarter, excited about getting into 2018 and executing that forward plan. Look forward to visiting with you on the road here in the weeks and months ahead. Thanks for your investment and your interest at Newfield, and thanks for your time today.

For opening remarks and other housekeeping items, I will turn the call over to Steve Campbell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Stephen Campbell","Good morning everyone, and thanks for dialing in today. We realize this is a very busy day for you guys with multiple calls going on at the same time. Following our prepared remarks this morning, which we promised will be brief, from our Chairman and CEO, Lee Boothby, we will have all the members of our leadership team available to take your questions, as always. [Operator Instructions]","Let me also remind you that today's call is being recorded, and will be available on our Web site along with our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables, and non-GAAP reconciliations as well as @NFX side deck. We will reference certain non-GAAP measures. So, please see those reconciliations in our earnings release and in our @NFX publication.","Our discussion today will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations. In summary, these statements and those in yesterday's news releases and @NFX and on this conference call regarding our expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal Securities Laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations, including those we've described in our earnings release and our other filings. Please refer to the legends in our earnings release and @NFX for additional information.","Thanks again for dialling, and I'll now turn it over to our Chairman, Lee Boothby.","Lee Boothby","Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone, thanks for dialing in for our midyear update call. And this remain very interesting times in our sector, and as Steve mentioned, we know everybody is -- you know, got a lot of meeting information they're trying to keep up with today, call information, so we will try to keep our call on schedule and keep our remarks brief. As always, we will welcome your specific questions at the end of the dialog this morning.","I will start off by saying most importantly we are accomplishing our key objectives for the year and executing very well across our entire portfolio of assets. In STACK, we remain in the early innings of understanding of our ultimate infill well space and completion designs. We have recent production date on our third operated infill STACK pilot to-date, and we have about 250 total operated drilling units to tackle on the road ahead. As we mentioned on many occasions, it's very important that we capture the right data early to create maximum value over time. It's a world-class asset that will only get better on the road ahead.","In SCOOP, we continue to refine our development plans. In yesterday's release you will see the results from the Tina development which is an eight-well Woodford Shale development with increased completion intensity and tighter cluster spacing over the historical activity in that area. As you can see in our @NFX publication, the results we are seeing are very encouraging in all aspects, and it bodes well for the upside in SCOOP, not just in the other horizons are being tested, but in our Woodford where we believe there is redevelopment opportunities, and I think Tina is a good proxy for what we might be able to do there.","In today's @NFX, we also remind you just how stellar our results have been in the Williston Basin over the course of the last several months. Our teams are drilling best-in-class wells in the basin; our enhanced completions are significantly improving well productivity and EURs. Our recent wells of estimated gross EURs in excess of 1 million barrels well equivalent, and we raised our tight curve in the Williston to reflect the results of the results being posted we enhanced completions.","Through the quick pay back out of these wells, we have maintained production with a single rig and added high return inventory depth to our position. And we today we estimate we have more than 200 operated locations that deliver strong returns in today's oil price environment. In addition to that we have hundreds of non-op locations as well. So, this is a quality asset, and our team is delivering top tier results.","In China, the operator of the third-party floating storage and offloading vessel notified as recently of a problem that will impact our pearl production during the second half of this year. It's a vessel that serves several fields in the area. The issue caused us to recently suspend production from the pearl field. Repairs are required on the vessel which is located about 10 miles from the field, although we were hopeful that these repairs will be completed timely. We took a cautious stance and removed all additional liftings from our forecast for the remainder of the year. This assumption reduces second half output by total of about 5,000 barrels of oil per day. I'll certainly update you once we have better visibility on the timing resuming production.","At the midpoint of the year, we still remain confident that our business plan articulated last February accounts for today's market realities and the continuing volatility we expect in the crude markets. Our plan carefully balances our need to collect infill well spacing information in STACK with investor appetite for improving margins and delivering sustainable returns with production and reserve growth. I have no doubt about it. This still remain challenging times in the E&P sector.","Consensus view from early 2017 that oil prices would strengthen significantly has waned. And companies are again looking into a future that will more likely see mid-cycle oil prices between $45 and $55 per barrel. The goal of this management team is to ensure that we remain competitively advantaged in any price environment. And that is where our collective focus lies today. So we have several key priorities. First, we're focused on delivering the three-year plan we laid out for you earlier this year. The plan used $50 WTI as our base planning assumption, and provided us with double-digit compound annual growth rates over the planned period. We have the people, assets, and capital structure to deliver this plan at current strip prices.","Second, we must have an eye on returns, and work towards transitioning our company to one that delivers sustainable production growth within our funds from operations. Our spending levels were carefully set to ensure that we maintain a strong balance sheet and manage leverage during a period of continued oil price volatility, and the results in uncertainty. Year-to-date, we have lived within our means, funding our drilling programs and maintaining our cash balance of approximately $550 million. Although our high level of completion activities in the third quarter requires a modest outspend, our cash remain a sound insurance policy against a prolonged period of lower oil prices.","Recently, we've had some very thoughtful discussions with investors around the path forward for the E&P business, and is our belief that the E&P winners of the future will exhibit more rational, mature, and disciplined behaviors that deliver both growth and returns to shareholders while minimizing periods of deficit funding and better managing leverage.","Winners will find a way to create and deliver value through cycle. And I and the management team in Newfield are confident that we have both the people and the asset portfolio to make this shortlist. Third, today's plan advances our learning curve in STACK, and we are working to determine optimal development well spacing. The information we are collecting today related to geologic targeting, infill density, and cluster spacing, completion designs, and flowback practices will help us optimize the development plan, maximize our future returns, and deliver the best long-term value proposition for our shareholders. And last night's @NFX we provided early flow data on our recent Stark pilot in STACK, which includes nine new infill wells in the Meramec shale. You will see that those wells are projecting well above our 1.1 million barrel oil equivalent type curve. These generate very strong returns at today's commodity prices.","In addition, we updated our production for the Dorothy pilot, completed earlier this year in the Meramec. On a normalized basis production from these wells are projecting above our 1.1 million barrel type cure. And we currently estimate that those wells will have EURs in excess of 1.4 million barrels. I'll say it again, it's early. We're presently on our fourth operated pilot, and we have about 250 or so operated DSUs in STACK alone to develop in the future.","In addition to the Meramec, we have other prospective horizons we're testing for future development in more mature plays like SCOOP and the Bakken we continue to find ways to improve after hundreds of wells drills to-date. So the simple takeaway for you is this, we're delivering strong returns today, and history says we will continue to find innovative ways to add more value as time progresses.","Production results from recent pilots do show interference, as expected, when compared to our initial wells drilled during the HBP phase. But the average results are tracking above our 1.1 million barrel type curve. We purposely elected to test tighter spacing knowing the importance of capturing this information early, and we will adjust our plans to yield optimal economic results on the road ahead. Our Freeman pilot which also test the 10-well configuration in the Meramec is just beginning to flowback following its recent completion. Later this year, we will complete a 12-well pilot on the Velta June. By mid-year 2018, we will have a significant sample dataset of long-dated production on six-well, eight-well, 10-well, and 12-well development spacing configuration in the Meramec horizon alone.","Ultimately, our density spacing will be fine-tuned to the prevailing macroeconomic commodity price environment. Oil prices are a key variable in setting the planned development well density and completion designs, and our development plans will be continually adjusted to maximize returns and value. We've been careful not to raise our type curves estimates in STACK until we've captured and analyzed the data so we can better understand and properly communicate these critical variables and their collective impacts.","Fourth on our list of objectives for 2017, is a better understanding of our ultimate resource potential in the Anadarko Basin. We made the assessment of other prospective horizons on our acreage a priority entering this year. In SCOOP and STACK we're advancing our SCORE program, the Sycamore, Caney, Osage, Resource Expansion. And we are collecting valuable results today. By year-end, we will have up to 10 operated wells in these respective horizons, and a better understanding of their commerciality and plans for future development. We remain very encouraged by some of the early results we are seeing in SCORE today, and look forward to sharing an update with you later this year.","As you can see from last night's release and @NFX publication, 2017 will be another good year for Newfield. We're seeing higher-than-expected domestic production year-to-date from both our new wells and our base production. For the second quarter, we bested the upper end of our production range with outperformance from all producing areas. The higher-than-expected production was attributable to the larger completions and greater well productivity being delivered throughout the company's asset portfolio. We're on track to deliver our 2017 domestic plan, and again raise the midpoint of our domestic production guidance for 2017. The third quarter is our highest level of activity for the year, and our guidance does reflect timing risk assumptions between the third and fourth quarters. Nonetheless, the year end is tiring we now expect to deliver 8% growth year-over-year compared to the 3% or so estimated in February.","Despite the backdrop of lower oil prices, we remain very encouraged with our future outlook, and growth trajectory, and will enter 2018 with very strong momentum. Newfield has several distinct advantages that we expect will allow us to continue to differentiate our story from the pack on the road ahead. The SCOOP and STACK plays are economically advantage, we have lower our cash operating costs in these plays, and they provide our highest cash operating margin. As we continue to funnel the lion's share of our capital into SCOOP and STACK, and the Anadarko Basin becomes a higher percentage of total production, we would expect that our corporate margins will continue to improve. More of our capital in 2018 will be allocated to drilling and completion activities. In 2017, approximately 25% of our capital budget was allocated to non-drilling and completion investment. This included land, leasehold renewals, and investments in water infrastructure, et cetera.","These investments will decrease as a percentage of total spending in 2018, and we estimate that approximately 90% of capital next year will be invested in the drilling and completion operations. Now that we have largely executed our large contiguously sold position, and funded value-added infrastructure, we're incredibly well-positioned to efficiently harvest our SCOOP and STACK developments going forward. We have a strong capital structure, and multiple options within our portfolio to fund and accelerate our future developments in SCOOP and STACK. Prior to the oil price slide in late-2014, time and again we've demonstrated our ability to sell non-strategic assets, and generated more than $3 billion in proceeds to improve our balance sheet and capture our key plays in the Anadarko Basin.","We know the value creation that occurs as a portfolio is optimized and funds are allocated to assets with inventory depth and higher margins. I'm confident that we will continue to refine our portfolio over time, and reinvest the proceeds in our SCOOP and STACK development. We recently sold our interest in Bohai Bay, China, which closed during second quarter. Today, our cash balance, including short-term investments is approximately $550 million. As we often say internally, assets are not our children. And they all have a lifecycle within our portfolio. You can continue to count on us to do the right things at the right time.","Before opening the call up to your questions, I'll quickly cover our second quarter financials. Our domestic production in the second quarter was 12.8 million barrels of oil equivalent, surpassing the upper end of our guidance range. Including China, our total company production in the second quarter was 13.6 million barrels of oil equivalent, or 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is approximately 500,000 barrels above the first quarter of 2017, of the total 62% was liquids and 38% was gas. For the second quarter, we had net income of $0.49 per diluted share after adjusting for the effects of unrealized derivative gains. Net income for the second quarter was $85 million or $0.43 per share in line with consensus estimates.","Our revenues were $402 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $300 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $215 million. We included a table in @NFX that outlines our investments, which totaled $296 million in the quarter, excluding capitalized interest and overhead.","Our cash operating expenses for the second quarter stated on a unit of production basis were also below our guidance ranges, you can see the continued positive improvements we've made in our cash operating expenses and this should lead to enhanced profitability in the future. You will see @NFX publication. We also added some hedges recently to minimize uncertainty in the remainder of 2017 as well as some positions in 2018. Recently locked in about $50 and an additional 8,000 barrels a day for last five months of the year and we also initiated some hedges for 2018 three way structures for 12,000 barrels a day. These hedges are comprised of $46.56 per barrel with the short put of 38. Prices fall below 38, Newfield receives market plus eight.","As promised, we kept our prepared remarks relatively short today, however there's a lot of good news within our budget. We got high quality options today and we intend to pull every knob and lever to differentiate our performance, we're fortunate to have top tier assets that can generate quality returns at today's strip oil prices. We will continue to find ways to combine growth and returns while being ever mindful of our balance sheet and capital structure. Tomorrow's Winners and EMT will combine the best people and assets to deliver returns to investors through cycle. And Newfield intends to be one of these companies, our cash on hand today is comforting safety net during a time of price uncertainty, this cash coupled with additional non-core asset sales at the appropriate time will be used to bridge us to our desired future state where we balance our investing and spending levels.","As always, thank you for your interest and investment in Newfield Exploration and thanks to every member of team Newfield for the great work they do on all of our behalf each and everyday. Now operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Josh Silverstein with Wolfe Research.","Josh Silverstein","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. A couple of questions from my end, lot of focus here on margins and the outlook, just wanted to make sure I think you are focused on the $50 per barrel case. If we are in this $45 to $50 range though it sounds as if because of the improving oil productivity that you're seeing out of STACK that you're still very comfortable with that -- those targets that you put out even [indiscernible] little bit higher than that?","Lee Boothby","Yes, we're very comfortable with our targets. I think to make it crystal clear, where we stand by or the statements made in February and we're confident that we can deliver that plan.","Josh Silverstein","Great. And then I want to focus on the margin side here, could you just focus -- can you just update us as far as the spending plans or the shift between the SCOOP and STACK rig count, obviously STACK higher margins, little bit higher oil cut there, the rig count is a little bit even this year, just how that progresses as we go into 2018?","Lee Boothby","And Josh, I think it's a good question. And I think there are a lot of pieces to this puzzle. I think I'll take you all the way back to late last year. We started articulating to everyone that we were going to have a period where we shifted from HPP mode to pad drilling. So the first thing to remember, the first half of the year we had the majority of the rigs allocated to STACK drilling these multi-well pilots that now we're starting to enjoy the data collection, the early flow back. So consequence, we had very limited completion activity in STACK in first half of this year.","So the activity in the third quarter of this year, we're going to be loading up on all the completion activities related to the drilling in the first half of the year, and that was the reference slide out spend in the third quarter, and then we go back to a more normal spend rate, but we're managing to the 1.1 billion capital program, and we'll meet that number at year end. So that's kind of the game plan.","Some of this is related to the capital reductions that took place on spend rates back in 2016. So we're starting to work out that. And I think the fact that we outperformed in the first half of the year leaves us in a really enviable position as we get this [indiscernible] of production that we're turning on now. And we're very excited about the momentum we will carry in. So, as far as shifting rigs, the way we would think about our objectives here is to eliminate for you our portfolio, our opportunity set, locations, economics, economics, economics over a reasonable range of oil prices, and ultimately continue to refine our development plans. Our operating teams, Gary and John, and the people that report to operating side of the business and they do all this great work for us each and every day, well, they're out there working within the context of our plan. And that still requires some amount of activity of moving rigs around to accommodate toolings, some limited HPP work, and we're kind of diagnostic. We're drilling high return opportunities in the portfolio. We think that the transition that we're talking about that you're going to want us focus on high return opportunities. And we'll go wherever the best returns are in the portfolio, but the rig counts will fluctuate during the year just as the completion activity fluctuates.","As we find more stability kind of on the road ahead and this volatility ultimate starts to diminish, I would expect our behavior and frankly the behavior of the other large operators to become more steady state and at that point you can probably track rig activity in completions a little more closely to ultimate business plans but we will have some movement, we gave you guys averages on the rigs for the year, we're operating within those, within those ranges and the same will be true the road ahead.","As far as STACK rigs, SCOOP rigs hopefully that answers that question both are delivering high rates of returns. And as we determine the spacing then at that point we'll be able to give you the combination of development pilots what they look like the timing and all the embedded in our plans. So you'll get the best, our best picture of the world that we can give you as we enter 2018 and tell you the updated plan results and what our game plan is in road ahead. Right now, we're focused on delivering a plan that we talked about in February and becoming the balance company that generates returns, production growth, reserve growth and delivers those returns to shareholders in road ahead sustainably.","Josh Silverstein","All right, great. That's perfect guys, if I could just sneak one more in, you talked about a bit about portfolio management at the end, it seems as if you're liking even more so the results in the Williston Basin just kind of curious, the other assets are now moving ahead of that asset as far as maybe pent up production and not that you need to do it right now given the cash in the balance sheet just any thoughts there would be helpful? Thanks.","Lee Boothby","I think the way to think about the Williston Basin is its recognition of the value creation our team is delivering and it's probably a pretty honest communication to the world that's a high value asset and we haven't changed our position on every asset has life cycle and you can count on this management team to do the right things at the right time, leave it at that. We have plenty of cash no need to sell today. But the right time when we're ready to accelerate into the great results being posted in the Anadarko Basin that will be part of our decision making.","Operator","We will go now next to David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions.","Lee Boothby","Good morning, Dave.","David Deckelbaum","Lee just following up on that last point with the Williston I guess as you look into 2018 and you talked about none of your assets necessarily being children is it more advantageous to Newfield right now that add some activity there going into next year given some of the recent events do you see that adding more value than sort of growing modestly with the one rig over there?","Lee Boothby","That's certainly part of the decision making, we could use we think the right answer at this point is to stay focused on Anadarko Basin's SCOOP and STACK and focus on advancing the development of the depth and scale and quality of those assets and their criticality in our future I think dictates that but if you're asking me to do I feel bad about investing in these areas high returns, I do not but we want to be disciplined, live within our capital plans and achieve balance and once we're balanced and growing double digits and we'll be able to add additional activity and at that point, I would say road stay focused on putting the rigs to work where we can generate the highest returns to shareholders.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate that and then one more for me just on those been removed from guidance from the second half of 2017 how frequently do you get updates on what things I knows assets and how should we think about reincorporating some of those volumes beyond 2017.","Lee Boothby","No, I think the safe point right now is the position we've taken since it's in China it's on the other side of the world much of a lot of time there. We need to let our friends there sort out. This issues and game plans so soon as we know what the game plan is will communicate that to you guys and I would expect will have better color sometime this fall. And they're going to be moving very quickly to get production reestablish because they've the interest not just of pearl but they've got several other fields to do the same so, we're confident that they're going to be putting all their resources to work to reestablish production and at the time we know what that answer is I can give you, I can give you an appropriate update on timing.","Right now we've assumed it's all out if it comes off back on before, before the end of the year. I've been that's positive and when we put out of 2018 plan and you'll have the benefit for our understanding at that point as one corporate to plan and frankly it's while it's, bothersome that you take this out of the exits it's a very minor cash for forces year so it's not really causing the stress we're able to deliver our plan and will keep you guys posted another way to look at it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee Boothby","Hi Brian.","Brian Singer","Given the importance of the ramp up of the oil production in the Anadarko Basin can you give us any update on where July our current production stands were just the key milestones to achieve third and fourth target there would help clarify the extent to it. You are on track.","Lee Boothby","I would simply tell you Brian that were on schedule one mark into the back half are on schedule when we see no reason to tell our ability to deliver that plan.","Brian Singer","Okay, great and you broke out in slide 5 you're well performance in Eastern STACK that showed well performance above. Are these the well that you would expect within that type curve would actually be performing below average given lower pressure regime in the east and if we were to look at the bottom right exhibit on slide 5 just for oil would we see a similar a different conclusion in terms of how production tracking versus like.","Lee Boothby","Yes. I'm sorry for I don't have to past year repeat because I was trying to grab the slide if you looking at.","Brian Singer","Sure, it's helpful. Yes, slide 5 to one and with the Eastern STACK wells specifically. I think conventional wisdom maybe if you correct this we would say that, they would be at lower rates relative to an average type curve you apply because the pressure regime might be a little bit, a little bit less so I guess we would do well you're showing here would we expect should the based case will that are performing that should be performed below type curve but actually performing above. And then if we were to just look at oil only as opposed to view a day with the conclusions on the Eastern STACK be any different.","Lee Boothby","Okay, so thank you for restating what I'd tell you this I think this is very, very encouraging. But in our minds internally it's not new news. I think it just continues to. put to bed an issue that costs a lot of noise two or three years ago them demonstrate the high prospectively of our entire acreage block. What you're actually seeing here learning, Gary Packard, John Jesse the teams of manager our operations learn every day and we're flying those learning. So I think it bodes extraordinarily well as we move development into the black oil phase where we've got, most of our data, most of the activity and frankly the fluid phase that we're exploiting is the most well behaved in the reservoir. And I'll probably talking to some you guys about that on the road over the months ahead so, I feel very good about it I think kudos the team and I'm to keep the pressure on John and Gary to see if they can continue to improve the next we're learning every day.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.","Richard Tullis","Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. just a couple quick questions the what's the well cost on average in the Anadarko basin now for the STACK well as using the current 2,100, 2,100 completion method notice the $8.8 million well cost for the start pilot wells just wonder with then average well cost in the second quarter for those type wells.","Lee Boothby","Sure, so the -- it is very simply we embedded $7.8 million average cost is what you're asking for. In the plan and I presume you're referencing the stated cost $8.8 million in the stock pilot that we just released so, the couple things about that pilots on the west side of our acreage so that's the deepest targets that we're drilling in that. Large contiguous footprints there in Eastern STACK. So as a result the western edge of carry slightly higher cost. Well as we just talked about over on the eastern side, there earlier question are in the shallow section. We're trying I guess Brian was asking those questions are getting good results there and those are the lower cost. But the average it'll vary across the footprint but I think that we're somewhere in the, 78, 83, for bouncing around in there as far as averages that we're demonstrating but I'll remind you we said in the last call that inflation in the first half year outstripped our forecast so, people might tell a lot of other key stories but I'm just going to tell you that inflation is real and we don't live in any different universe from everybody else, you put 10% inflation and 12% inflation which I guess has been our observation. We forecast 7.5 there is, you can do the math on that sort of good portion of this Delta is related to inflation pressures in the first half of the year.","Richard Tullis","And then we just follow up on that is those cost pressures kind of normalize and at this point it does those well cost should hold into the third quarter and it maybe the fourth quarter as well.","Lee Boothby","Yes, I think I look, I think that our friends in the service sector. I mean they're catching up in the first half is driven by demand on our side of the table but we see things kind of moderating I think that's a good sign and ultimately service cost and capital programs and everything else are going to have to all arrive at a balance somewhere over the commodity so, what is that going to be choppy but right now we're not seeing any incremental pressures.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ron Mills","Good Morning, Lee. Quick question just exclusive of the score kind of resource expansion potential can you just refresh memory about, about your current inventory in the resource potential You talked about how that compares to the, of the 10 to 12 well spacing that you're talking about on, on these upcoming Merrimac wells as I think, I think you're using up to six wells per zone for a couple zones and some trying to get a sense of the magnitude of resource extension of that without those this core program.","Lee Boothby","Yes, this really pretty simple, will update you again, the results the score well level set all the stuff early next year is kind of something the space got into, part of our regular cycle. Last update said we have around 8000 locations total that was posed just be transactional expanded to the west out there and STACK and expanded our footprint in STACK of core footprint. Part of that I think it was at 6000 assumptions between those who have been consistent we generally assumed about two horizons working across the acreage footprint and you're right the upper end of the range that was articulated was around six wells per horizon.","So the other way to think about that is it's about 12 wells per DSU and the way I think about it is we've got hundreds of DSUs to do the math on it. Let's say that the number somewhere around 800 plus the issues that are going to be delivered, if you've got 10 wells for the DSU and 800 that take 1000 that's pretty easy to see how you get there and then the resource expansion I think what where that would come in is the combination between what we learn on the pilots. And how we ultimately determine the spacing options within the prevailing macro which means within the prevailing oil price, you'll have to understand that, that number will vary depending a little bit, depending upon the final completion recipe and spacing assumptions. And we plan to give you a pretty clear view of how we think about that entering next year, benefiting with all of learning's of we have here score very simply, we add additional horizons and were not part of that resource we'll be adding additional locations.","Those additional of patients to be accounted for and we'll will communicate that end resource now yes about the resource obviously the resource total that we've published against the 8000 was around 2.4 billion barrels and that that's billion barrels net. So resource expansion success we said we were testing around a billion barrels with $100 million we're putting into score. Success there would push that well north of three this way I would think about it.","Ron Mills","Great. And then my follow-up is actually follow-up to Brian's question about, you've been increase report about your EURs, or your type curve is expected to be in average across your whole position, but in light of now the test both on the eastern and western edge, have you been positively surprised by the fact that you haven't seen necessarily as much EUR degradation particularly towards the east and that points to some point in the future like you did last year with this performance in another average type curve increase?","Lee Boothby","Well, look, you know, we're going to be shifting. We're going to be working to maximize value. I think that's our responsibility to shareholders. So by definition, we're going to have some target returns that irrespective of oil price we're trying to achieve. And we're going to make sure that this return is sustainable. So if you think about that, anything that you hear from new field on the road ahead is going to be cash in that context. And we'll do that with the objective of maintaining balance and maintaining a strong balance sheet.","That's what real companies do. And we want to attract investors into Newfield that are interested in investing in real companies that are going to be here, doing real things for their benefit. That's what our team focuses on every day. I hope that's attractive. As far as are we excited about what we're seeing, absolutely, am I surprised? Absolutely not. We generate data -- and I'm going to warn everybody here. So if you guys are listening, pay attention. We generate data in HVD mode.","In Oklahoma, we have to drill single wells, and we were fortunate to be able to drill single wells on the majority on 1,280 acre DSO. These are not large Texas ranches where you can hide in a corner and drill a bunch of wells and hide from things that we know are going to occur as you do the development. The parent-child discussion is head fake. And at the end of the day, we've been consist as a company talking about unbounded wells and warning people about bounded wells. I don't care about the parent-child, I care about maximizing value. And we've got the right team with the right focus to make sure we get best solution. That's where it's focused on. So all of what we're doing is in that context. I hope that's helpful. We can talk some more about on road, but that's how we think about things.","Operator","Our next question will come from Derek Whitfield with Stifel.","Derek Whitfield","Thank you and good morning. Lee, certainly understand your point about bounded and unbounded. But with regard to the STACK type curve, could you give us a sense as to where the gen 17 HBP results are projecting from an EUR perspective? ","And I ask that only because the outperformance is increasing over time. It is not clear how many well are in the outer part of the curve.","Lee Boothby","Well, I think I'll start with your first half of your question. We're very excited about how the gen-17 wells are performing. And I think all of the information we put out clearly documents what we're seeing. The issue for us is that majority of that information as well at this stage, majority, because it's now starting to changing with [piles] [ph] coming online, was created with unbounded wells. So, our instincts would tell us that you're probably going to see some level of interference, we're going to want some level of interference in the ultimate development.","I think if you go back to the earlier presentation, some of the IR Paxson, and maybe even the last quarter, if you look at the data we had, the early wells were projecting to give you kind of a scale something around 1.5 million. That's 3 wells type curve is set at 11. Clearly, we're leaving ourselves in headspace as we work through the rate of return, oil price, macro value equation. And ultimately, once we've settled on that, we're going to level set you plan year to plan year on how we see the macro environment and the product price immediately ahead. And we'll work to deliver the returns. It's going to be the same-store, but we're going to work to deliver the returns. And I think you're going to need to be flexible because as oil prices mounts between whatever the numbers are, 40 and 60, we attack the asset a different way when oil's 40 and we mine when oil falls 60.","The other thing to remember is we're only four wells operative, excuse me, four pilots, [indiscernible] fourth operated multiple well pilots. In the Merrimack only, in STACK out of 250+, so we're talking early innings here, but I'm really excited about the approach our team is taking. We are investing in learning, and we're being aggressive. That is going to pay dividends in making sure that we make the right development decision [indiscernible]. I don't think that's appreciated at this point, but I'm proud of the team for the position they're taking.","Derek Whitfield","And then just one follow-up, and it's follow-up to Ron's question. What are you seeing in the data that suggests 12 of density is the upper bound for the Merrimack and have you guys contemplated pilot that would test co-development of the Merrimack and Woodford?","Lee Boothby","So we felt from where industry had been mostly one well for DSU and then we started out with six well and eight wells that 12 seem like a pretty big step. My hope would be that we learn things to tell us the combination of completion optimization, well results, reservoir management where you're at the fluid window that only these things combine certainly I hope that we can prove in a white commodity price environment we can build even more and that might very well be one of the outcomes.","We believe that 12 is as far we needed to go in this first year aggression so that we can make sure that we're not well beyond where we want to be for the prevailing commodity but I'm pretty encouraged by the results and the start pad that we put out. The issue Merrimack I'm excited about the ones that's going to be coming here next. And by the end of the year early next year we should have the 12 of results combine with some production on the two 10 well pads. And then our friends in industry are doing a lot testing as well I think we're all working altogether and I think that you've got lot of really high quality companies that are attacking this problem and talented technical team. So I am confident by the end of the year all of us Newfield and our friends in the play will have a much better understanding of reservoir performance, phase behavior, spacing and we'll all do our best to give you the best view of future at that time that's kind of how we're look at it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Good morning guys, Lee especially I didn't talk to guys a little while on this - could you talk a little bit about when you start flowing these wells what's your kind of call the constrained or your chocked problem how that looks today versus what it was may be a year on that getting lot of guys obviously just seemed to investor seems just glance at IP rates and again I think for you'll it much more than that?","Lee Boothby","Well, unfortunately I'm not burdened by the absolute details I'll stay away from chocked sizes and stuff because I think I am also smart enough to know that most people just know - what 3060 forces a part of an edge I don't really understand the full dynamics so we won't go into that. But I will tell you that we had a history now several years of testing right. And I'm saying we, we'll start with new field and then I'll come back to what I think this on boarder segment, but we've tested areas that you flow aggressively early on for trying to accelerate cleanup and blah, blah, blah and we see some areas that no sensitivity. So in those areas you say turn them on bottom rip from day one because we haven't seen any degradation.","And generally in the dry gas phase when we were all doing that other than places where you had really hard over pressure and compaction related results and things of that nature. Most of the time we all concluded that you let the gas will rip and don't look back. Well this now we're into complex oil systems and I'm going to apologize I spent way too much in my career as reservoir engineer thinking about these things but I think it plays well. And particularly areas like we're attacking today and SCOOP and sac you've got the most complex fluid systems in these oily transitions from gas to wells every player that you guys were talking that are people who exploiting wetgas condensate bouts of oil reservoir engineer 101 says these are unique system and you got to understand them. And where you're at relative to couple points which are things you probably hear people talk about or do point matters where you're at you know in the reservoir, how you're completing, how you're produce, ultimately impact EURs right.","So if you do things in the front end early to maximize IP's you could be detrimentally impacting the value proposition for the owners. Newfield doesn't do that okay I think we have to be very careful about continuing this focus on you know IPs 24-hour IPs I mean how we look at them to I mean we got a pretty good idea and get strong IP that is probably good sign. But the thing that really tells to tail is how does the wells perform over time. And now that we're going in the multiwell development multiplayers' in these reservoirs with founded wells we're going be drawing the pressure down in a - very large rock volume that is not type of rock volume that all of these equations that people developed. And we were all trained on pushed it but the way you guys sometimes ask questions which must mean people on our side they were feeding it doesn't seem it to understand that.","So we want to be very careful. So what our team did in the Stark pilot that we talked about is they learned from all of the available data they had further to the west down dip any well to oil web gas comment, say window, and they developed some correlation to say it looks like if u go back and study some of the earliest wells that were high IPs that you might have done something detrimental on the reservoir. So even though we had much higher productive capacity at the Stark and what's being demonstrated, we chose to restrict the flow rates, so that we could let the pressure distribution on the reservoir collaborate overtime, and not create deleterious effects that would ultimately impact value. I think that's smart, and I could entertain them whole night, pat our team on their back every day for doing that work.","So that's what we are doing. And I appreciate the question but I hope we can talk more about rates of return and value on the road ahead, because that's what we are focused on. I think frankly that's what all of our friends are going to be focused on in the Anadarko Basin as well. That's where we are at. Hope that answers your question.","Neal Dingmann","Yes, absolutely, absolutely. And then just one last one if I could, like just looking at Slide I guess four and six and I get these shows that once I apologized that not a prop in gallons per foot of course for 2121 that you are using in the STACK and then even going and then looking at, which you are now currently using the Williston, do you think both of these now. I mean, to say we are at diminishing returns. I mean, you are pretty comfortable at both of those levels are you still you know, toying with it that maybe bumping those up or bumping those down a bit.","Lee Boothby","Look, I think in the unbounded world, we an industry approve that more profit, more fluid. When the world doesn't know that has neighbors you can deliver bigger wells. So if people are playing that game you guys just need to be smart enough to realize that's what happened. I think we long ago just to need to know we comeback and we let those wells know that they now have neighbors left in right and then there is really horizons above and below that they are not going to look like they did when they did know that they had neighbors. Right, so we are focused on the children because that's where we are going to make money for the shareholders. I love the children, I'm glad I said that. First delivers the children because that's where we make money and I think that we will have a much healthier dialogue kind of on the road ahead.","Now as far as the processing, now we've been consistently saying that look we are describe that more profit, more fluid of tighter cluster spacing, more fracture in terms of lease to better wells. That, the essence of that argument will flip to the developed plan. But the size of the energy that's being impart in each of those wells. What the optimal completion configuration is as yet not completely known in this play or frankly most other place. That's what we are chasing today. And you have to be prepared if we come and tell you that here is we prove this to ourselves, we tested diminishing returns on the various key variables. We know the commodity price environment will be able to explain to you why we are drilling the wells where we are? That's the mission that we have on the road ahead, imagine a very short flipbook to make that point. I think everybody has been much better educated than they are today. So just stay tuned we will try to communicate as effectively as we can, but we think it's all good, we are getting a lot of good day ahead and we are excited.","Operator","We will take our last question from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital.","Brad Heffern","Good morning everyone. Lee going back to Pearl early in the call you said that it's not a significant cash flow impact, would you be willing to give a ballpark of what the cash flow is at the current commodity price and additionally is there any sort of business interruption insurance or some other proceeds that you could get?","Lee Boothby","We don't really expect any claims under business interruption insurance for this particular downstream not operated et cetera. We are probably looking in the $20 million to $30 million range I would guess on cash flow impacts that's assuming we get nothing in the second half of the year.","Brad Heffern","Okay, great. And then, finally on the Anadarko world volumes quarter-over-quarter they were down a little bit, was that just timing of completions or you know, soup versus snack what was the impact their?","Lee Boothby","Yes, so because I know if you were on the call earlier. I think I had a portion of the question earlier on this but the plan form its conception was backend waited. We had very little completion activity in STACK in the first half of the years our completion activity in the first half of the year is a slowest completion activity you had in Anadarko basin in the last two years that was all by design. Now we are going into very heavily weighted completion, high intensity completion phase during the third quarter that sets us the growth.","So we are looking at you know, a road ahead go back to the numbers Anadarko basin great than 20% of all growth, if I'm remembering correctly from the plan pretty confident that's the numbers what we see. That's the kind of trajectory we will be moving into and then at that point on the road ahead it will be a question of you know, what's the right trajectory for Newfield 2018 for? But we are going to be carrying that kind of growth rate in the back half of the year, so pretty excited about that and again it's back end waited from the start, it's not related to where we've been drilling north or south super STACK and I hope I will leave this talk for you guys. I hope at the end of the day we can to the spot where we are talking about a very large high resource potential in that case we are at the drilling activity, high return play and this is going to deliver billions and billions of dollars of value to our shareholders and that's what we think about every day.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Lee Boothby","Well, thank you again everybody for tuning in. I appreciate the questions and we look forward to listening for you guys on the road in the months ahead and when they were getting back into an active season there month or so out. We look forward to updating you on continued progress. We are at year-to-date excited about the future. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] Mr. Lee Boothby, please go ahead, sir.","Lee K. Boothby","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2014 conference call. We're off to a great start in 2014. Our operating personnel helped us post another great quarter, and we are executing extremely well across our domestic focus areas. We look forward to providing you with today's update and taking your questions at the end of our brief prepared remarks.","I'm joined today by other members of our management team including our CFO, Larry Massaro; Chief Operating Officer, Gary Packer; and Steve Campbell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Let me open today with some highlights from the first quarter. On February 10, we closed the sale of our Malaysian business for approximately $900 million. This was a very tax-effective sale, and proceeds were immediately used to fund a portion of this year's capital budget and to repay all of the borrowings under our revolver. We fully restored the capacity under our $1.4 billion revolver.","Our first quarter production exceeded the mid-point of our guidance by more than 400,000 barrels equivalent. Let's talk for just a second about oil growth, not liquids, but oil growth. Our oil growth in 2014 is largely back-end-weighted. The planning of new pads in proven plays like the Williston and the ongoing development in the Anadarko and Uinta Basins. We expect that our second half 2014 oil production will be nearly 15% higher than our first half oil production. In short, we expect that our second half oil production will grow by more than 1 million barrels over the first half. Again, we are focused on oil growth, and that is driving our forecast expansion and cash flow.","The cost and expenses for the quarter were in line with guidance, and the projected improvements over 2013 and our cash operating costs are materializing. The efficiencies in our operating expenses are leading to higher margins and improved earnings.","In February, our midstream partner in the Anadarko Basin completed a significant upgrade for our SCOOP system. We are today producing more than 35,000 net barrels of oil equivalent in the SCOOP and STACK, and remain very confident in the growth trajectory outlined in our 3-year plan.","I continue to be very impressed with the results being posted in both our SCOOP and STACK plays. In our @NFX publication, we provided updates to our average performance versus the tight curves outcast 400 days. Please note that the average of the 23 wells and SCOOP wet gas and the 15 wells and SCOOP oil continue to track above the tight curve. In STACK, we now have 11 producing wells across an area in excess of 300 square miles, and the average production data show outstanding conformance to the type curve, out to 600 days.","The key in resource plays is to meet and\/or beat the statistical averages the data set grows and expense. Stay tuned for more good news as 2014 unfolds.","In the Uinta Basin, we are today drilling SXL wells in the Wasatch and Uteland Butte formations. Several of the wells are online, and we plan to share longer-term production data with you around midyear. We are encouraged by both the early production and the recent progress we are making to lower completed well cost and enhance returns. The Williston Basin and Eagle Ford teams continue to execute extremely well in these oil developments. These plays will each grow by more than 35% year-over-year. More importantly, efficiencies of full field development are translating to the bottom line as these plays are helping to drive the improvements in our overall cost structure.","Gary Packer will cover more play-related highlights with you shortly. I like where we sit today. Our leadership team clearly understands what it takes to be a premier, and the key is to creating shareholder value. The ingredients include solid execution quarter-after-quarter, deep inventory, high-quality drilling prospects, sustainable profitable growth and production and reserves, and strong capital structure. We've completed our transition to a liquids company, and we are combining strong liquids and cash flow growth with an improving outlook on cost. We are focused on delivering the targets outlined in our 3-year plan.","When executed, this plan delivers a 20% CAGR in cash flow and liquids production. We're on course to improve our debt-adjusted production growth on a per share basis, it navigates our program where our capital investments and cash flows are more in balance. We're confident that we are taking the right long-term steps to create value for our stockholders.","Before we get into our operational update,","let me quickly cover our first quarter financial and operating highlights.","Excluding the items noted in our news release, our net income from continuing operations was $60 million or $0.44 per share. Cash flow was $345 million. Both earnings and cash flow in the first quarter beat consensus estimates. First quarter production from continuing operations was 10.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, which exceeded the mid-point of our guidance by about 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Our discontinued operations provided another 1 million barrels of oil equivalent during the quarter. The China production was approximately 200,000 barrels.","We are pleased with how our cost and expenses came in for the first quarter of 2014. As you know, our 3-year plan is modeled around improvements in our cost structure, which are driven by efficiencies in our developments. With Malaysia sold and China being a very small part of this year's production, investors can now see the Newfield of the future much more clearly. We invested $397 million in our domestic business in the first quarter. $26 million went to discontinued operations. Our outlook for 2014 capital expenditures is unchanged and remains approximately $1.6 billion.","Before I turn it over to Gary, let me update you on our China sales process. We are completing our underwater inspections of a jacket and making plans to make repairs early this summer. We expect to reschedule the installation of the LF 7 topside facilities for the third quarter and to achieve first oil production in the fourth quarter of 2014. We continue to work with our bid group on the planned sale of China. We anticipate resolution later this year. We will keep you informed as more information is known. I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary D. Packer","Thanks, Lee. Let me give you a quick summary of our drilling programs, starting in the Anadarko Basin. SCOOP and STACK plays have certainly received a tremendous amount of attention in recent months. In fact, there are more than 35 industry rigs running in these plays today.","Our first quarter net production in the Anadarko Basin averaged 29,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are producing today well more than 30,000 barrels equivalent per day net. The 2014 growth forecast is on track, and we still expect to exit 2014 with nearly 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of net production.","The Anadarko Basin will receive nearly 1\/2 of our 2014 capital investment this year. SCOOP and STACK plays are allowing us to combine high rates of return, a large operated acreage position, high working interest and rapid liquids growth. We remain extremely excited about our results to date. See, the Anadarko Basin is capable of driving our corporate growth in cash flow and production well beyond our 3-year plan.","I laugh when we get the frequent question, when are you going to go faster? Keep in mind, we have moved from the 1 operated rig in 2011, when we drilled our first well in the STACK area, to 4 operated rigs in 2013. Now, we're up to 8 operated rigs today. We've doubled our investment in the Anadarko Basin over the last year. We continue to look for more ways to efficiently move dollars toward the basin.","It's easy to go fast. The challenge is doing it efficiently and honor the commitments we have made in regards to our balance sheet. So where are we today in SCOOP and STACK? I'll start with SCOOP. We continue to see strong performance from our wells. 6 of our 8 rigs are -- operated rigs are running in the Basin. In yesterday's news release, we published a summary table on our first quarter well results. Rates are consistent with our previous wells. In today's @NFX, we plotted all of our wells against our tight curves.","Based on the drilling data set, we are very confident in delivering on our 3-year plan. The SCOOP investments are generating the highest returns in our company today. Our activity to date, as well as industry activity, has been heavily focused in the SCOOP South Wet Gas play where 21 rigs are running.","In 2014, we plan to drill about 20 Newfield wells in the South Wet Gas and about 25 wells in the South Oil. We continue to see solid efficiency gains in the SCOOP drilling program.","In our first quarter, the drilling cost per lateral foot decreased 17% when compared to our average of 2013. We've modified our casing designs, increase our lateral lengths, moved to more [indiscernible] development pads, improved drilling penetration rates and reduced downtime between wells, a true team effort. A significant upgrade was recently completed on our SCOOP midstream system. We now have 200 million cubic feet a day of gas processing capacity.","As we mentioned earlier, we had about 4,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day curtailed for this first 6 weeks to the year. This expansion allowed us to return all of our curtailed wells to full production and tie in recent completions. We expect the second upgrade this September to add an additional 80 million cubic feet a day of gas processing capacity.","In the second half of 2014, we'll be drilling our first operated wells in North SCOOP. This is about 40,000 net acres that sit north of SCOOP and south of STACK.","There are 10 industry operated rigs running in this area today. We have participated in several wells to date and are very encouraged by the early returns that we are seeing. Stay tuned for more information from us later this year.","Over the next 2 years, our production from the Anadarko Basin is expected to become more oily as we shift drilling activity into our STACK play. We have more than 150,000 net acres in STACK, and our working interest average is about 60%, which is very high for Oklahoma. In addition, as the name implies, we have STACK geologic pace in the Woodford and Meramec Shales that provide up to 700 feet of hydrocarbon column to exploit.","In addition to the Woodford and the Meramec, other prospective formations exist. We plan to test them in the future.","Our 2014 STACK program has several objectives. First, we are drilling the whole acreage. We plan to drill about 20 SXL STACK wells for 2014, and for the next 2 years, our drilling program will be largely dedicated to HBP efforts. The second objective is to learn more of the optimal development well spacing. We are placing our wells on adjacent east-west section boundaries and gathering spacing data as we HBP. Each SXL well holds 2 sections. Third, we're quickly delineating, and therefore, de-risking our acreage. To date, we estimate that our drilling has de-risked about 1\/3 of the STACK acreage. Our 2014 program will test the boundaries of our acreage and we expect it will delineate and de-risk about 70% of our acreage by year end. And fourth, we plan to drill about 20 wells this year and are testing multiple objectives in the STACK. We will be coring wells in several areas, staggering adjacent Woodford and Meramec test, as well as drilling upper and lower Meramec wells on tighter spacing.","If production results on 10 STACK wells to date, then about on end, 30-, 60- and 90-day rates remain strong. Our longest-producing STACK well has now been online for about 3 years. This was a short lateral drilled in 2011 to test the exploratory concept.","Well, that has now been online for 920 days and the production is still 65% oil, and the cumulative production is 73% oil over a 3-year period.","This well gives us confidence in our tight curves and future oil growth projections. We have 2 rigs running in STACK today. We have production results on all of these wells, and we feel very strong about their performance.","Our first net -- our first quarter net production in the Uinta Basin averaged just under 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, slightly exceeding our plan. In the Uinta Basin, we are advancing 2 plays, the ongoing development of our Monument Butte waterflood and the ongoing assessment of our horizontal plays in Central Basin. We are, to date, drilling our first handful of SXL wells in the Central Basin and we are encouraged with our early results. We're drilling wells in both the Uteland Butte and the Wasatch plays with lateral lengths approaching 10,000 feet. As proven in multiple other plays, SXLs lower completed cost per foot, maximize production rates, improve EURs and rates of return. We have 2 operated rigs running in the Central Basin today and plan to drill about 15 SXL wells this year. Around midyear, we will have production history on about a half dozen or so SXL wells to update you upon. We remain confident that SXLs will be the key to unlocking the economic value of the vast resource in the Central Basin. We have the necessary permits in hand today to execute our 2014 program, and we continue to have constructive dialogue with state regulators and permanently amend field rules to roll out for SXL's development in the future.","Our investment levels and near-term growth outlook in the Uinta Basin will continue to be determined by the timing of refinery expansions, the regulatory environment and our internal pledge to allocate our capital to the projects with the best returns.","As you know, we have agreements in place with both HollyFrontier and Tesoro that add about 20,000 barrels of oil per day of new capacity in the Basin by 2016. New transportation initiatives, both rail and pipeline, provide encouragement that our future crude growth will not only have a home, but the potential to receive more favorable pricing in the market.","In addition to rail, one of our refining partners continues to advance discussions and planning for a 60,000 barrel of oil per day oil pipeline on the Uinta Basin into Salt Lake city.","The Williston Basin and Eagle Ford developments are progressing extremely well. These plays are benefiting from the synergies of full field development through SXL wells, common drilling pads, shared facilities and use of in-place infrastructure. They're delivering solid returns and providing free cash flow to fund our large-scale programs in the Anadarko and Uinta Basins.","In Williston Basin, we continue to run 4 rigs and expect to drill about 50 operated wells this year. The first quarter production averaged nearly 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is about 10% higher than our fourth quarter 2013 rig. We are on track to grow our Williston production to about 40% this year with a consistent 4-rig program.","We brought online 16 wells in the first quarter, including 12 that are Bakken wells and 4 wells in the first member of the Three Forks. As always, we show 30-, 60- and 90-day production averages and add-on effects. Our Williston Basin wells averaged initial production rates of about 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and our recent 10,000-foot SXLs were drilled and completed for an average of $8.4 million, including facilities.","Our Williston team is executing extremely well and building on the efficiency gains achieved over the last 2 years.","In the Eagle Ford, our first quarter production averaged over 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and in line with our planned expectations to grow year-over-year volumes by about 30%. We reduced this year's drilling program in the Eagle Ford to one rig, which allowed capital to flow into the Anadarko Basin, as previously mentioned. We expect that our one-rig program will hold current production levels relatively flat throughout the year. One rig will allow us to drill about 20 wells.","I'll turn it back to Lee for closing comments.","Lee K. Boothby","Thanks, Gary, and thanks to you, all, for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest in our company.","We're off to a great start in 2014. We beat first quarter production expectations, and our cost and expenses are exactly as modeled. Our operating teams are executing extremely well, and we are focused on delivering on our 3-year plan, which combines liquids growth with cash flow growth and improving margins and profitability. As we said in February, we believe the achievement of these objectives will lead to improved net adjusted production and reserve growth metrics and lower leverage ratios, and we intend to deliver. This time, we're happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amir Arif with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","The first question is just to achieve the 50,000-barrel a day exit rate that you're targeting in the Anadarko Basin, can you just summarize for us what you need on the midstream side for in terms of the STACK and the SCOOP for processing and takeaway? And then the follow-up question is the -- I believe this quarter, you did test the Lower Meramec. If you can give us any color on that well?","Gary D. Packer","As far as the takeaway for the exit of this year, we referenced in the call that we have 80 million cubic feet a day that we're going to be bringing online in -- early in the third quarter. And those are the requirements that we see to make the 50,000-barrel-a-day number. And as far as the deeper test, that well is currently drilling as we speak. And it's called the Brueggen, I believe.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So that will come out with 2Q results?","Gary D. Packer","Once we have the 30-, 60-day numbers, we'll have it out to you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you could maybe speak a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing on rates of return on your STACK wells. I know it's early, and sort of how those kind of compare with SCOOP?","Gary D. Packer","Really, nothing more to add other than what we showed in February with -- we just have the 2 initial wells and they're in line with expectations. We generated a return on the first 8 wells of about 35%. We expect that just to get better as they do on all these plays. And that's very competitive in the portfolio and in our space. They're not going to compete with SCOOP wells, which are some of the best in the industry. But we feel like both of them certainly deserve capital allocation in our program.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, as you guys progress into 2015, you talked a little about, in your prepared comments, about need to sort of HBP more STACK. Does that mean we could see more rigs kind of move to STACK next year to satisfy those requirements versus SCOOP?","Gary D. Packer","Well, the current plan contemplates that we will HBP from -- many of these leases already have built-in expansion capabilities. We are examining all opportunities to reallocate capital and move incremental rigs into the area, and I think Lee referenced that in the call. So it's not currently built into our plan. Rest assured that we're looking at every alternative, and whatever we do will be accretive to the information we've already outlined in our 3-year plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In the STACK, if I look at those 90-day rates, it ticked up a little bit from the 60-day. Is that just particular to these 2 wells or is that something you're seeing with some of the more recent wells you drilled, including the ones at the end of last year?","Lee K. Boothby","I think it's important to remember, when you look at STACK, and I think we've got a total of 11 wells in the curve that we published, obviously, the newer wells, when you look at the details, sit inside of the 90-day rate. We've seen outcomes above and below the type curve. The average sits right at or just above the type curve. So we're very, very encouraged of what we're seeing. As mentioned earlier, we continue to step out and test the limits of the play. I think that's one of the features that we're going to be working on in 2014. And I would say at this point that we've had a number of issues. Remember, it's HBP, not development. So all kinds of infrastructure related to managing developments and optimizing lift and all that stuff, that's still yet to come. I think when you look at the Mary well, which I think was a new [indiscernible] lease, that's a well that has continued to get better and better throughout its first 4 months or so of production. So you've got a lot of different things going on in terms of completion optimization, lift optimization, and we're in HBP mode, not development. That's the key to keep in mind when you think about looking at these results. I see a lot of people take head fakes on individual well data without having any understanding on what's going on out in the field. It's a path for fools. So I would say be careful, those of you that are tempted to go down that path.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then for my follow-up, let me choose. Uinta, and you guys have -- I guess, in the fourth quarter when you previously talked about it, you talked about that weighing of XL -- or SXLs being more Uteland Butte than Wasatch. Is that still the plan? And can you tell us what your well cost run out there versus what you think a target well cost may be?","Gary D. Packer","Dave, we continue to look to balance that out. I would suggest to you that in your -- you said it accurately, we had more Uteland Butte than Wasatch at the end of the quarter. We're going to -- I would suggest that we'll probably see more balance in that as the year unfolds. In regard to the well cost, if you referred to the February @NFX, we outlined Uteland Butte wells in a 10 to 12 range, and the Wasatch well in a 13 to 15 range. We like the progression that we're seeing year-to-date and in capturing the benefits of the SXL, so I think we'll be navigating to the low end of those numbers. And we're feeling more confident everyday that, that's going to be the case. But we still need to drill some more wells to prove that to ourselves.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was hoping maybe you could compare, contrast when you look at SCOOP oil and STACK oil specifically, against perhaps these other shale plays wherein they're multiphase reservoirs where the oil part, it didn't particularly work well, be it Eagle Ford or Utica. And then my follow-up would be, if that Cana oil was in your original -- or your prior view of what the de-risk acreage is in Cana, which I think was around 25,000 acres.","Lee K. Boothby","I will jump in the first one while it's fresh in my mind. If I miss a part of it, take me back there. I would say that the well that Gary referenced, I think, in the STACK play that has nearly 3 years of production history at this point, or certainly chasing down 3 years. It was drilled early, drilled early in the oil window, drilled well at depth, and it was drilled there on purpose so that we could gather this information and continue to calibrate performance. I would tell you that we've been very, very pleased with the performance that we've seen, both in SCOOP and STACK up up in the oil base. I think that was probably the biggest risk in the play going in. And certainly, we in the industry, we're not in the position to know one play versus another, how that's going to work. The STACK play is all in the oil [indiscernible]. If you think about the well results, now we're seeing consistency and sustained performance over multiple wells across a large area of 300-plus square miles. And everyday that goes by, we get more and more confidence in that regard. And with the planned program, ourselves and the industry, now that the industry has moved into the play, there'll be 40 to 50 wells probably by year end that we'll be able to look at specifically there for comparisons. So I think that the data set is going to be growing at a pretty good clip, and we continue to see consistency there. I think we, you and everybody watching the plays will get very, very comfortable.","And if you move to SCOOP, I would tell you that things have been very exciting down the SCOOP and SCOOP oil as we moved into the oil window, as we've seen much more gas energy than we certainly forecast going into the play. And obviously, having that gas energy for lift and sustained well performance has, net-net, been a positive. And I'd say that, that's a big part of the performance trend that you see now that we're documenting 10,000-foot laterals out past 400 days. So I'd say both of those plays, when you look at them relative to the suite of other plays and other basins and compare the numbers, I think you'll come away feeling very, very favorable.","I suspect, and we're not in the Utica or some of the other plays you referenced, so obviously, we didn't keep up the data but I'd leave our friends in the industry to talk to you about their plays in those areas. But when you cut across multiple plays and cut across [indiscernible], you've got different geology, different phase composition, different pressure regimes. You've got a whole host of things going on, and I don't think it's any one of those factors that you can probably hang your hat on. I think in a number of instances, at least the best I can tell from reading data and seeing presentations from our technical folks, it looks like people have been burned by some bad phase behavior. I would say we've seen none of that to date and in our plays, and that's part of the reason why we're very, very encouraged.","But going back to 2012, before we drilled the first well, we were concerned that was a risk. And I think the production data -- the neat thing about what we're doing is we're not up drilling for a geologic control at this point. We're drilling for production control. So the delineation's actually production delineation, not geologic delineation of these plays. And that's a pretty nice place to be. Clearly, we hope to see continuation of the good results in the northern portion of our SCOOP acreage, but again, our friends in the industry drilled a number of wells there, a lot of rig activity up in that area. We like the results and we expect to see success there. But that's an area we haven't drilled any material number of wells at this point with Newfield's tether on it. As far as the Cana question, I'll put that over to Gary.","Gary D. Packer","Well, I guess, I'd just follow up. We talked in the -- we previously referenced to 150,000 acres in the STACK. And when we've been on the road with many folks, we've referred to some maps and we've talked about how about 1\/3 of that acreage position with the 8 wells that we've had to date, I would call production delineated. And we have very consistent results across that, in both the Meramec and the Woodford. The exciting thing about this year, our HBP strategy is going to allow us to reach out to the North and the East across the STACK. And by the end of the year, we ought to be in a position where we're sitting here and talking about 3\/4 of our acreage position having a horizontal well in it. A lot of our activity this year is going to be up there in the Meramec, which is, I think, going to give everybody more confidence. And I'd point out that the biggest step out that we've had to date, the Yost [ph] well in the Northwest, is one of our best wells drilled to date. So it's nothing that we fear whatsoever, and it's all within the acreage that we've targeted when we put our lease -- our accumulation together, and we have an abundance of vertical well control across all the positions that says that there's really no difference across the position in which we're drilling. So I'm not concerned about drilling up against edges, and we haven't found an edge in any of the wells that we've drilled thus far. The area to keep a close eye on this year as we continue to expand in the STACK would also -- the other area would be the Northern SCOOP. And we talked about that, 40,000 net acres. Industry has done a heck of a nice job in improving the return prospectivity for that area and it's quite competitive. And you'll see us this year, I think we've got 4 or 5 wells on the board. We'll drill some wells, both in the wet gas, which will be immediately adjacent to those that others have drilled successfully and generating compelling returns. And you'll also see us, just like we have in STACK, about half of those wells will be out more in the oil space. And so stay tuned for that.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, I'm sorry, Gary, do you have a number for de-risked SCOOP and how the Cana oil phase factors into that number?","Gary D. Packer","I don't have a number off the top of my head. I mean, we've got between, well, I would guess, 75,000 acres in the SCOOP overall. The vast majority of that has a well in it, with the exception of the 40,000 acres in the SCOOP that I've referenced. So I don't have it broken out.","Lee K. Boothby","If you go back and look at the release, we had acreage split out by wet gas, condensate, window and oil window, you'll be able to put the pieces of that together and just recognize the northern portion that, we believe, industry has de-risked a good portion of that acreage. But we haven't drilled our wells there, and that's the 40,000 acres that Gary references. But majority of our SCOOP and STACK acreage is, in fact, in the oil window.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, looking at the production guidance, with a production beat above the high end in Q1, you mentioned that production going forward's going to be impacted by timing of completions, various areas in terms of where they're completing, whether it be Williston, Eagle Ford or parts of the Cana. Can you talk a little bit about is that why you're not bringing full year production up with the kind of beat that you delivered or are you being just conservative in nature?","Lee K. Boothby","It's our conservative nature, of course, Dave. I mean, I think that you've been around us, we're certainly conservative. An answer to your question, specifically, we're sitting here at the end of the first quarter, we carried good momentum out of '13, that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. We're very pleased with the results, but we're 1\/3 of the way through the year. The timing issues that you're talking about, pad drilling, we've talked a lot about that over the years. Clearly, I'd love to be able to turn those pads on earlier in time, but when you're drilling multi-well pads, you got to drill, case, complete and there's some volatility in terms of timing related to that, and that's certainly incorporated into our planning, and then the infrastructure issues that Gary have all talked about. So what I would tell you is let us see how the year unfolds. We're very, very encouraged with where we're at. I think we've got good momentum, and we'll get to the mid-point of the year and we'll give you an update. Hopefully, at that point, we'll have enough visibility that we can show you some positive upside.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then maybe just diving in the Uinta for a second and your comment about it being currently free cash flow positive. Will that remain the case as you progress on a 2-word [ph] program of SXL development? Or could that go back to a source of capital as opposed to a cash-generative engine?","Gary D. Packer","Dave, as far as the free cash flow, that was in reference to the Eagle Ford and Williston Basin. And those are free cash flow positive. Certainly, as you suggest, the Uinta Basin is going to be a consumer of capital, as we seek to accelerate the resource that we have there. But that certainly will not be the case in the Uinta overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell [ph].","Unknown Analyst","My first question was regarding the Gregory pad. It looked like it had some pretty favorable-looking declines [ph]. And I was wondering, is this a geological effect or does it reference some reservoir pressure control regime?","Gary D. Packer","It's -- the only significance I would caution -- or call out on the Gregory pad is that you're right, they are performing quite well. The 2 important things about that are: One, it's a 5-well spacing. And based on those early production results, we certainly feel good about that. The other thing is they're only XL wells. These are just 5,000-foot wells. And the only reason we would have drilled those as XLs is because we had an offset spacing unit with another operator or we would have drilled this longer. I think what you're on to here, Jeffrey [ph], is just the normal variability in results that you see across any one of these resource plays, and nothing more than that. And then certainly, we're pleased with them, but I wouldn't say it's any one more thing than the other. As you know, in the SCOOP area, as you move east to west, there's variability that exists in oil and gas yields, and you're seeing some of that in there as well. But it's just normal variability in a resource play.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And my other question was it appears that you're currently targeting the Three Forks 1 [ph] in your Williston Basin. I was wondering if you're going to do any exploration in any of the lower zones in the Three Forks over time or have you already arrived at the view that the Three Forks 1 [ph] is it?","Gary D. Packer","No, we've actually drilled a second bench of the Three Forks well last year and it was a good well for us. Just with the capital that we've allocated to the programs today, we're more heavily weighted to the Bakken and the Upper Three Forks. And we're going to allow our industry partners to kind of show us the way as far as some of the deeper benches. We are constructive on the second bench for sure up on the west anticline, where we drilled and others have drilled, and we like what's been seen there. But as far as beyond that, we're going to allow others to take a lead in that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I just had a quick question on the 4 SCOOP wet gas XL wells that you're showing here. I think these were 4,800-foot laterals, which should be lower kind of than the published type curve that you all have for the region. So I was just wondering sort of how are these -- how the performance of these wells comparing relative to your expectations? And what may the capital costs be on these, just given their short lateral length?","Lee K. Boothby","As far as the -- I'll talk, but Gary has [indiscernible] to say here. But as far as the performance, clearly, the place to look is yield per lateral foot. And I would say we've seen good conformance statistically in terms of yield per lateral foot or yield per thousand lateral feet. We believe the optimal wells where we can drill them are the 10,000-foot SXL wells. But as Gary indicated, there are a number of circumstances where geology or offset ownership and things of that nature stand in the way of 1,280-acre spacing units. In those occasions, then we'll look to drill 5,000-ish foot laterals. And so anything that's sub-5,000-foot lateral means that they've been drilled on a 640-acre spacing unit. And you're going to see the same where there'll be some areas that produce higher-than-the-average yield per thousand feet, and some will produce lower, but we've seen good conformance, relative to the yield per thousand lateral feet across the play today. Good enough for you?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, I think -- I'm not concerned about anything that's represented in there. We're going to confine the bulk of our activity to the SXLs in the wet gas window to a degree that we can. We have -- we don't have the 30- and 60-day numbers published for the first quarter, but they appear to us to be in line, and there is some graphics in our @NFX publication that actually does show our type curve relative to actual performance in the wet gas, and that -- the slide that you actually looked at in there includes both XLs and SXLs. So I'm -- we're not seeing any meaningful variability in any of those results. Just normal variability, like I referenced earlier, geologically.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And then, just quickly on the STACK play. With regards to the Mary well, it looked like there was a pretty high oil cut on that. Is there something specific that's driving this or do you think that's just an anomaly and related to the general variability you're seeing across the wells you're drilling in the play?","Lee K. Boothby","The STACK play, as I said earlier, the entirety of that acreage block that we put forward is in the oil window, which means that we're actually drilling forward, from east-west, north-south, black oil. We published, if you go back and look at the data that rolled out over the course of 2013, there's some places where we put out well data in terms of 2-phase production, and you'll see a consistently high oil yield across that data set. So obviously, the Mary is not a surprise in that regard. I think that the exciting part of the Mary is that we've had good, solid, sustained and actually improving performance over the course of the first 4 months of production. So that's the part I'm excited about with regard to the Mary well, and I think we're able to continue to generate those kinds of results, as Gary indicated earlier, as we move through the HBP phase into development, then the results, returns will just improve over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sticking with STACK. Can you just talk in broadly about how many different horizons you've now tested at STACK, the differences, if any, in performance? And then you may not be planning this because you're in HBP phase, but when you would test multiple horizons on the same section?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, our priority is going to be HBP mode. I think Gary said that earlier. Next 2 or 3 years, we've got a lot of work to do there. We will vary, as he indicated, the offset distances between laterals and where those laterals sit across lease lines from the section, just to start gathering some of the spacing-type performance information that we'll need in the play. But we don't intend to drill any development pilots or tie up rig time working on development pilots. We think we have plenty of time to work that into the program as things kind of evolve, if you will, in that regard. And I think they're going to be kind of measured as we work through the program. So first order of business is focus on HBP. We'll get the data we need to kind of verify our assumptions and spacing data to the extent we can during the HBP mode, then as we move towards development, then we'll get more into the spacing test and pilot. As far as the horizons, I wouldn't get too carried away with the horizons at this point in time. We put out last year that we had tested the upper Meramec and multiple wells in the Woodford and multiple wells at the 700-foot interval. So the way to think about that is the lowermost interval. The Woodford has been tested successfully and the uppermost interval of the upper Meramec has been tested successfully. It's about 700 feet of section. If you split it up into geological horizons, you could think about 4 or 5 different potential increments in there. But I think it's way too early to get caught up in that level of granularity. We just haven't had the time and the well count at this point to capture enough data to give you any more color than that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then shifting to the Uinta Basin, you mentioned add-on effects, the thing you mentioned on the call, the pipeline and then a refinery expansion. Can you just talk about a little bit more detail about what you think the timing is there? And is this something that is going to be where Newfield is going to be a unique supplier? What type of market share do you think you can get?","Gary D. Packer","As far as the circumstances of the pipeline expansions, we have -- Tesoro has a turnaround in first quarter of 2015. And then they're essentially be at full capacity there in the first half of the year in the -- we'll start ramping up HollyFrontier's expansion in the back half of '15, and we'll hit our full stride there in early 2016. That's going to allow us to be at about 38,000 barrels a day of committed capacity from those 2 refiners. And 2016, we believe we'll have capacity to be producing well in excess of that. We do have relationships and we'll have deals in hand with some other refiners. That'll put us somewhere around 45,000 barrels a day or so. I hope that they'll put us in a position, our teams, that we can be well north of that. And that's really what it's going to take for us to either get some other refining projects in hand or more aggressively pursue rail. And we'll probably, at that point, get into the plays that we can talk about for longer terms agreements with some of the rail providers. I don't have the numbers off the top of my head regarding the market share. I do know that each of those refiners are, in fact, refining some of our -- the other basin crude. But I can't tell you the percentage. We are far and away the largest producer, and control most of that market share.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Hubert [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Jimmy Hubert [ph] from Iberia [ph] Capital. In the STACK play, I had a question. If you have 20 STACK wells planned for 2014, how many of those are Meramec and how many would be Woodford?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, it's like 2\/3 of the wells are Meramec wells and the balance being Woodford.","Unknown Analyst","All right. And are there different lateral lengths for the 2 zones? Or do they -- do you drill both at the same lateral length?","Lee K. Boothby","Our plan is to maximize lateral lengths. We'll drill 1,280-acre spacing units every opportunity we get. So you'll see delivered lateral lengths around 10,000 feet or just over.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then just one more question. The wells into the 2 different zones, the Meramec and the Woodford, what are the costs per well for each different zone there?","Lee K. Boothby","There's not a material difference between drilling the Woodford and the Meramec. There's only 700 feet of vertical section from the base of the Woodford to the top of the Meramec. So you can think about those wells in terms of to date, performance and cost, they're very, very similar.","Unknown Analyst","And what are the cost per well, you think?","Gary D. Packer","Those wells range from $9 million to $12 million in the STACK, both in the Woodford and in the Meramec, Meramec, as we referenced. The biggest variability there has been our completion cost. We continue to be able to find ways to improve our stimulation, which oftentimes has a higher cost, but greater EURs as a result of that. But we would be navigating to the low end of that once we get a few more wells under our belt.","Lee K. Boothby","You can go back to last year, we talked a lot about the distance between cluster-per-cluster spacing and we talked about reduced per cluster spacing. We cut the per cluster spacing roughly in half during the course of 2013. So fracture and testing [ph] along the lateral for the same delivered cost today is about 2x what it was entering 2013. Those were all good things.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Just turning to the Williston Basin, would you estimate to be the inventory of drillable locations remaining, both Middle Bakken and Three Forks? And when do you see production actually peaking from your Williston Basin operations?","Gary D. Packer","Well, obviously, Dan, it's all about how many wells -- how many rigs we allocate to the play. Right now, we're sitting here talking about 4 rigs for the foreseeable future. We do grow outside of our 3-year plan, our production volumes. And we've been talking now about anywhere between 300, 350 wells for quite awhile. And what we've found is, is that as far as our inventory, and what we found is, is that as we've been able to drive our cost down, we've been able to unlock plays that were previously uneconomic, but now, certainly, compete within our portfolio. So I think that's -- that number has a bit of a moving target to it, but that's generally speaking where we're at.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Got it. Helpful. And then just turning to the balance sheet quickly here, can you sketch for us how leverage is expected to trend over 2014 and periods beyond? Certainly, we can see it going lower. I just want to get a better understanding of that trend and how capital is invested in the operations.","Lawrence S. Massaro","Yes, sure. I'll take that. This is Larry. As you've seen, we've been debt suspending across our planned period. Our goal is to get to 2016 and look to try and get to free cash flow neutral then. That's what we kind of put out earlier this year in our February release. As far as this year is going, we're right on track. We're probably a little bit better than we thought at the beginning of the year, where we're still generating a deficit, and we look to cure that through the assets that we've already talked about. So we'll fund the deficit through the sale of our international, and get to 2016 and be cash flow neutral.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Looking at the Eagle Ford, I know we haven't spent that much time on it, it's not really a big part of your current activity, but you did see a real nice increase in initial rates, I guess, 30%, 40% there. Was that mainly a function of changing completion method or maybe more focus on the 2 areas, West Asherton and Fashing?","Gary D. Packer","I mean, as far as overall, you have some certainly leasing timing issues regarding the pads that we were bringing in. We've also been playing around with spacing between wells. And the wells that you are seeing that maybe showing up in the public arena are seeing a slightly higher IP and a little better decline profile. And it's just a result of us continuing to identify what the right spacing is.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, what's driving the increase in the LOE cost guidance? I guess, it's up about 5%. What are the main drivers there?","Lee K. Boothby","On a unit of production basis, it's down quarter-over-quarter and through the year. But the main driver in absolute dollars is just, frankly, higher production.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, you haven't raised the full year guidance though, right?","Lee K. Boothby","No, we took it up just a little bit. I think you'll see another $7 million or $8 million [indiscernible]","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Philip Cannel.","Philip Cannel","Could you break out further, the mix in terms of liquids in both the Williston, the 12,900 per day, and the EFS at 11,000? What's oil, what's NGL?","Gary D. Packer","If you look at our February guidance, we break out average liquids per play. But our Eagle Ford play is north of 85% black oil, and the Williston Basin is around 70% black oil.","Philip Cannel","Okay. And in terms of the SCOOP, if you look at the decline curves from the wet gas to the oil, why do you think that we're trending toward the decline curve on the wet gas, but yet, the oil curve, if anything, is even moving farther away from the decline curve? [indiscernible] in both the 2 wells at this point to kind of make a decision or should [indiscernible] the curve?","Lee K. Boothby","The thing to remember about those curves, those are average curves for the wells that have been drilled, completed and brought online in that timeframe. So when you get to the endpoint, you've got one well. So whatever the oldest well in that data set sitting out there, so you see that well. So as you move back through the curve towards zero, you get the highest number of wells in the average. And frankly, that data is better data than looking out there on the tip. So it's there as a mechanical calculation, but the reason it looks like it's down is just simply you're looking at data from the oldest well. And at the front end of that curve, you've got 23 wells, and at the very end, you've got 1. The same as across both of those curves. In the case of the wet gas, the curve, the oldest well, is slightly below the trend line. And in the case of the oil that you're looking at, the oldest well is slightly above the trend line. Just a statistical aberration.","Philip Cannel","And do you think that we expect these to change significantly with the increased number of wells that are going to be drilled this year? I mean, is there any way to know?","Lee K. Boothby","I would take you back to our tight curve. That's how we build all our models. That's what we're looking at. We're continuing to step out and evaluate and optimize. We're encouraged that these are running above the type curve. It will be a happy day if that turns out to be the ultimate field level average, but we give you both so that you've got a reference point. Again, I think the key point is we're off to a good -- great start in 2014. We're excited about the results being posted in these key plays. We've got exciting results yet to come out later this year. Stay tuned. We're going to give you the data timely. We're going to give it to you in a form that you can understand, and frankly, we look forward to having these conversations.","So with that, I'd just like to tell everybody thank you very much for tuning in today, and we look forward to talking to you again in July, and we'll have some more good news to talk about. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"15617":["Newfield Exploration Co. (NYSE:NFX) Q1 2016 Earnings Call May  4, 2016 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Stephen C. Campbell - Vice President-Investor Relations","Lee K.

For opening remarks and other housekeeping items, I will turn the call over to Steve Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Stephen C. Campbell - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. Along with our earnings release last night, we also provided a very detailed @NFX presentation. And as usual, the slides in that presentation will be helpful to you today, as we reference those during our call.","Following prepared remarks from our Chairman, Lee Boothby, we'll have members of our leadership team available to take your questions. As always, please limit your time during Q&A to one question and one follow-up. That simply allows us to get to more of your questions this morning. Let me remind you again that today's call is being recorded, and it will be available on our website along with our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables, and non-GAAP reconciliations. We will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so please see the reconciliation in our earnings release today.","Today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions, based on our current views and our most reasonable expectations. In summary, statements in yesterday's news release, and @NFX, and on this conference call, regarding our expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking in nature and intend to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those that we've described in our press release and the @NFX presentation, our 10-K, our 10-Q, and other filings with the SEC.","Thanks again, everyone, for dialing in and I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman, Lee Boothby.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. 2016 is well underway and it's hard to believe that we're already through the first quarter. Although, oil prices have strengthened since we last gathered in this call in February, these still remain challenging times.","Our near-term business plan was designed to meet both today's challenges and tomorrow's opportunities and the key objectives that we laid out in our last call still hold. The plan was designed to preserve the health of the company and ensure that we are positioned to not only weather 2016 but to emerge with improved margins and a readiness to compete and win when commodity prices ultimately strengthen.","Our 2016 business plan has four key objectives, and I'll provide a brief progress report in each before covering our financials and operating result. Our first priority is to preserve liquidity. We've taken several decisive steps to ensure our balance sheet remains strong. We issued equity in February to ensure that we had the capital to navigate today's challenges and to bridge to 2018 when we expect to be in full field development in STACK. We greatly reduced our 2016 activity levels and closely aligned capital investments with cash flow expectations.","We high-graded our investments and the Anadarko Basin is receiving the majority of our capital today. And we hedged aggressively in late 2014 and recently modified those positions to capture financial gains and to take advantage of recent strength in oil prices.","Our second priority is the HBP STACK. It's imperative that we hold our STACK acreage by production and continue to drive down costs as we push rapidly toward full field development. We're making great strides and progress today as we HBP the north and northeast portions of our STACK acreage and we remain highly encouraged with the consistency of our well results. By year-end, we expect to be about 65% held by production.","Our third priority, reduce operating expenses and preserve margins. We have taken significant steps over the last year to improve our cost structure. Our first quarter domestic lease operating expense was down nearly 40% year-over-year on a per BOE basis and we expect to reduce our full-year 2016 G&A by nearly $50 million when compared to last year, excluding one-time cost. We're focused on margin improvement today across the company.","And fourth, we've launched a formal process to sell additional non-strategic assets. We've engaged several parties on our behalf and expect to have additional information to share with you later this year. With the continued success we're having in the Anadarko Basin, we still believe that the additional asset sales are in the best interest of our shareholder, despite the recent move in oil prices and the strength of our balance sheet.","Proceeds from the additional sales will refine our portfolio, improve our financial flexibility, manage short-term borrowings, allow for the capture of opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and\/or accelerate our Anadarko Basin program. We're executing well and delivering on our business plan throughout the organization today.","In yesterday's release, you will see we beat the midpoint of our guidance by about 500,000 barrels equivalent, and we raised our production estimate for the year by about 1 million barrels. It's important to note that gas production in our guidance is unchanged and the increase was related to liquids production.","Our production beat in the quarter was attributed to outperformance in both the Anadarko Basin and in the Williston Basin. Although we talk most frequently about SCOOP and STACK, our single rig program in the Williston Basin continues to deliver some very impressive results along the Nesson Anticline. In fact, production in the Williston hit an all-time high for us in the quarter and there's a slide in @NFX, if you would likely find some of this of interest.","Let's briefly cover our first quarter results. Our domestic production in the first quarter was above the midpoint of guidance by about 500,000 barrels at 13.5 million barrels oil equivalent. Total company production was 15.2 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which 46% was oil and nearly two-thirds liquids.","Excluding several items listed in our release, our net loss for the quarter would have been $16 million or $0.09 per share on revenues of $284 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $170 million. We recently permatized the remainder of our hedges that were not previously permatized. These actions essentially locked in a gain of about $14 per barrel.","We entered into the new swap positions in the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017 on a like volume of oil. These swaps were done in the low to mid-$40s per barrel. And considering the $14 per barrel gain on the permatized volumes and the new swaps, we will essentially receive revenues during these periods based on the WTI price of about $55 per barrel. There's an illustration in @NFX that helps explain these recent derivative transactions.","Let's spend the remainder of our call today on the operating plans for the remainder of the year and the significant progress we are making to drill and complete more efficient wells. As previously mentioned, our first quarter 2016 volumes were stronger than expected, led by the Williston and Anadarko Basins. As a result, we today raised our full year expectations by about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent.","Our new guidance for 2016 domestic production is 50 million to 52 million barrels of oil equivalent. In China, our Pearl field continues to produce near peak rates and the expected natural decline has been slower to materialize than expected. We also increased our expectations for China production by about 200,000 barrels for the year, due to this continued outperformance of the Pearl field. China liftings are expected to total 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent and no significant new investments are planned.","Our capital budget for the year remains $625 million to $675 million. As we said at the beginning of the year, our investments are heavily weighted to the first half of the year. We entered 2016 with nine frac spreads running in the Anadarko Basin. This flurry of activity has tapered and we are running less than half the spreads today, and are on schedule with our drilling and completion program for 2016.","Included in our capital plans for this year are two new infill spacing pilots in STACK. Due to the efficiency gains we are delivering in Anadarko Basin, we were able to slot this into our current budget outlook of $625 million to $675 million. We are planning to drill infill wells from two separate pads to test greater well densities. In addition, we are participating in at least one outside operated spacing pilot in STACK. Gathering early infill spacing pilot data is key to planning the optimal full field development. We expect that these pilots will commence production late this year and add nearly 1 million barrels of oil equivalent of incremental volumes in 2017.","Our SCOOP program is in development and continues to deliver very strong results, running two rigs in active development. Year-to-date, we have commenced production from a new SCOOP oil pad and the five wells achieved average rates of nearly 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day each, of which 80% was liquids. In the Springer play, we turned a new well to sales of approximately 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 81% was oil, 90% was liquid.","In STACK, we're running three rigs today and have drilled more than 100 wells to date or about a quarter of the industry's 400 wells. Our net daily production from the Anadarko Basin is near 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently. We remain very encouraged after more than four years of high activity in the Anadarko Basin and are seeing very consistent performance from our wells. Of the 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 35% is black oil. This is what we modeled years ago and it is still holding true.","With high levels of activity today in the Anadarko Basin, we have significant outside interest in wells drilled by our peers. Some of these wells have large IPs with large natural gas cuts. This outside interest will cause our overall commodity mix to change a percent or two from quarter-to-quarter. But understand that our operating results in the basin are in line with our previous forecast and have been very consistent.","I'll also add that across our 315,000 acre position \u2013 from that idea that I talked about five years ago and the work from the team \u2013 our all-in cost cumulatively is less than $2,000 per acre. Exciting asset and core foundational asset that'll serve Newfield and our shareholders well for many years to come.","As we drill to hold our acreage by production across this 3,000 plus square mile area, we will continue to see well results at or above our type curve in all portions of the field. Our HBP machine in STACK has been focused primarily in the northern portion of our acreage over the last six months. There are a couple of very important slides in @NFX today. The first is the slide number seven, which shows the 24 wells that we've drilled to the north and northeast, 12 of which are new wells, and we've provided 30 day, 60 day, 90 day average production rates for all of these wells and plotted of the 24 north wells against our type curve on slide nine.","We're highly encouraged that these wells are performing above our 950 Mboe type curve, with production out through 120 days. Let's talk a little history here before moving on. The concept for STACK and our early leasing program was conceived more than five years ago. Since that time, we've assembled in excess of 225,000 net acres in the STACK play. The quality technical work that was done to get us started has morphed into one the most active plays in North America and we have peer companies, well respected peer companies, active across the area as well.","I'd like to recognize our talented technical team for outlining what they believed at the time to be a commercially viable oil window in STACK. The fact that we're drilling wells on the northern edge of this defined boundary, are seeing those wells perform above our average type curve is fantastic news and that's a product of outstanding technical work.","Although history tells us, there will be variability in individual well results over a vast area where all hydrocarbon phases are present, we are seeing type curve or better results in all areas today. We're early in optimizing our completion practices and tailoring our completion cocktails to best match the reservoir and phase changes across the acreage. But you will notice better 60 and 90-day average rates for the newer batch of wells. We're encouraged with our results and we are making great strides to drive down well costs and improve the outlook for future rates of return.","Let's talk about our gains in drilling efficiencies and how we continue to lead the industry. On slide eight, we show the progression of our days-to-depth for our 10,000 foot super extended laterals. Here are some fun facts. The Helen, our most recent best-in-class SXL well in STACK was drilled in eight days and is among the best SXL wells drilled in our portfolio and likely in the industry. We look forward to sharing completed well cost and production data from Helen once we have it. Year-to-date, our SXL wells in STACK are being drilled at an average time of 17 days. Our peers and outside operated wells where we have a direct working interest, are averaging about 30 days for a comparable well. That's about twice our average days-to-depth in 2016.","We get lots of questions on 5,000 foot laterals versus 10,000 foot laterals and which one is better. Actually, we enjoy the question and can easily answer it with a single word \u2013 scoreboard. When our team can drill an SXL well in half the time of our peers and hold two sections in HBP mode, the answer is pretty obvious to us. Our cost for completed foot is about $690 compared to the best short laterals we can find at about $750 per foot.","We have seen the economic benefits of SXL wells in the Eagle Ford, the Williston Basin, the Granite Wash, the Arkoma and in SCOOP. These same benefits are carrying through in STACK, when we compare wells drilled and completed similarly. That said, we've drilled a handful of short laterals today on single section leases and we have about 20 planned for the year. We'll have a more detailed update later this year regarding XL performance.","Our wells in STACK today are for more efficient and our economics continue to improve. Our efficiency gains are coming through a combination of reduced drilling days, more efficient completion practices, optimized profit loads and reduced service costs. Importantly, we estimate that more than half our cost reductions will be sustainable when oil prices strengthen and service costs ultimately increase.","There are several factors that combine to drill an SXL well in 8 to 10 days; in short we're effectively managing subsurface hazards and rapidly solving problems when they do arise. Common challenges in STACK include lost circulation, hole stability and the need for an additional casing string on portions of our acreage to the north and west. We have made significant improvements in our mud systems and wellbore hydraulics and we are getting our wells down faster and more cost effectively. Each well we drill is treated as a specific project and it receives its own specific design. This attention to every detail has led to our superior results.","Our best-in-class SXL well, the Vickie, has recently been drilled and completed for about $690 per gross completed interval, or, the completed well cost with facilities included of about $6.9 million. The Vickie well is called out on slide six and compares very favorably to the $7.3 million well budgeted for 2016.","Our team has been applying much of the cost savings from drilling back into completions as we continue to seek the most optimal design for future development. It is important to understand that we are not simply trying to maximize an IP rate from the first well in the section. We're testing various proppant loads and sand sizes along with fluid types and volumes to arrive at the best design for our long-term development plan.","Additionally, we continue to drill our HBP wells along lease line boundaries as opposed to targeting the initial well on localized DSU sweet spots for maximum IP and headline results. We're in this for the long term and want to ensure that we preserve the most efficient full field development for the future.","With the recent modifications, we are today pumping about 60% more proppant for $300,000 less in total cost. In addition, to simply having lower sand and pressure pumping cost we have effectively employed zipper fracs, toe sleeves, dissolvable plugs, diverters, tighter stage spacing and perforations, higher proppant concentrations and use both cross-link and hybrid fracture stimulations. That's a mouthful. In short, we're optimizing every conceivable variable to arrive at the best answer to create the most long-term value for our shareholders, as we develop this premier asset.","One thing, however, is becoming obvious from our completion trials to date: higher profit loads are making a positive impact on our production rates and EURs. Two years ago, we were pumping less than 1,000 pounds per foot. Last year's design was about 1,500 pounds per foot on average, and included the recent JR Barton completion on slide six.","Our most recent designs include up to 2,400 pounds per foot, and are just cleaning up now following recent fracture stimulation. We're optimizing early flow to protect the reservoir and maximize liquids recovery. We will have to more to share with you on these developments later this year.","We're very encouraged by the strong performance and the consistency we are seeing in our wells after more than four years of intense drilling activity. We have drilled far more wells in this play than any other operator; we have the experience, the learning curve and the team in place to continue leading this exciting development. We know that there are significant efficiencies still to be captured and are highly confident in our ability to deliver future SXL development wells for less than $6 million including facilities.","That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and your investment in Newfield Exploration. I'm confident that our near-term business plan is sound, and that we are executing well along a path that will make us a better, more efficient and profitable company in the future.","Operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Will Derrick with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Nice result.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Will.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Lee, I guess first question, with these northern STACK results, and you talked about the need for additional casing in certain areas. Could you talk more about that and just what your thoughts are on well costs in that area?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well. I think that the well costs for the area are all part of our program that we laid out for 2016. So, we've already made those forecasts; we're not making any changes there. Talked about the well that we just drilled and completed inside of $7 million, including facilities. The extra string of pipe has to do with higher pressures and depth as you move west. It also has to do with \u2013 I think I referenced lost circulation as being one of the issues in the call. So, there are areas that require additional casing string. Up in that area, there's a target formation called the Morris Sand (20:34) that sometimes is problematic. And, it's a handful of wells; it's not every well. But there are areas of the field that will certainly require an extra string of casing.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe for you or Gary. Talking about \u2013 you all gave a lot of details on the completions, everything you've been testing. Could you give some more color on what you're seeing, I guess to date, and where you've seen the best results?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Gary give you some color there.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The best results we're seeing \u2013 everything that we're seeing is pretty much across the board. As we've increased our profit loading from that 1,000 up to 2,400, that seems to certainly be a key. We've seen some of the other operators \u2013 and Lee alluded to it in the call \u2013 have gone to higher fluid concentrations. We're just reluctant to do that; we are attempting it on a few wells. But generally speaking, we're taking a much more broader look into development. We prefer to stick in that 1,000 gallons per foot range.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. Nice quarter.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move next to Vedran Vuk from Wunderlich. Your line is open.","Vedran Vuk - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. So, well costs have come down so much that, I was just wondering, how much more is left in this cost to come down before you get to development mode? And has your target for development mode gone lower than $6 million or so per well?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that a year or so ago, we laid out on one of these calls the scenario where I think well costs at the time were north of $8 million, and I think we said that $7.5 million, we had line of sight. Like I went on to say, I think we'll tackle $6.5 million after that, and we talked about $5.5 million type wells in development. So, today, you've seen $6.9 million, and you make the point that we're not in development. We've said that we expect in development mode, there's probably another $1 million or so, that just through combined efficiencies of the development operation that could come out of the well. So, that would put you at $6 million or just inside of $6 million, which would say that we're on schedule to deliver the types of well cost that we first articulated a year or two ago.","The team's done an excellent job. I think \u2013 compliments to Gary, John, George and the extended team, and the drilling completion folks. I think that they're just doing a fantastic job, but we're on schedule, and exciting future ahead.","Vedran Vuk - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","And do you think we could see another $100,000 or $200,000 drop in the near-term?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, I think that's achievable. I like the simple math. $7.5 million, $6.5 million, $5.5 million, and then we'll chase something below that, but you've just seen $6.9 million; we're in the first quarter. We've got momentum, but I expect you'll see some additional costs come out as the year unfolds.","Vedran Vuk - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Great job guys, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll move now to Kyle Rhodes with RBC. Your line is open.","Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Kyle.","Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Any more color you can provide on the downspacing pilots later this year, just maybe in terms of location and density of those tests? And then also, do you view these pilots as an opportunity to prove what you can do in development mode, just maybe in terms of getting below that $6 million target you've spoken to in the past?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would expect that \u2013 I'll take the last part first \u2013 I would expect that the potential would be in pad drilling that we'll see some visibility of what we might be able to do, as we move towards development. So, that's a yes. I would say the pilots that we have planned are going to look a lot like the pilots that some of our friends in the industry are undertaking. In general, we'll probably test five six wells per flow interval. Remember, these are the early pilots, so there'll be a process \u2013 we'll use the scientific method again. We'll test some things, learn from others where we can, and we'll continue to move forward. We'll test both \u2013 these first two pilots \u2013 we'll test lateral spacing, how many wells per mile, if you will. And we'll also have one of the two that'll have a vertical component to it. So, you'll see more of that activity by ourselves and the industry going forward. I think the important point is, we're pulling two pilots into 2016, and that was not part of our original plan. So, it tells you we're accelerating the pilots, so we can accelerate development.","Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. That makes sense. And then my follow-up, the asset sale market appears to have thawed a little bit, and you obviously have some candidates to add to that mix. If those monetizations were to take place sooner rather than later, how would you think about redeploying those potential proceeds given today's environment? Does this further consolidation at Anadarko makes the most sense or maybe accelerating your HBP program, just curious how you guys think about that? Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think I'll give you some color and then I'll ask Larry maybe to give you some color, if I miss anything. I think first off, we've been pretty open both on acquisitions in the basin at value propositions that we can make sense of, we're interested in certainly. I've referenced earlier that we've accumulated 315,000 plus acres at less than $2,000 an acre all-in cost; pretty proud of that. People tend to think about plays on a cost-forward basis a lot of times. We think about it full cycle and that's one of the things that gives us full cycle economic advantage. As far as the asset market, we've got some divestitures teed up \u2013 our non-strategic assets \u2013 that activity's in progress and, Larry, any color you want to add?","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. As we indicated in the call earlier this year, we're using asset sales to fund any deficits or bolt-ons and so, that will be the next step once we get those done. We're currently in the process of putting together the data rooms; those'll open up here in the next few weeks and we should have \u2013 our kind of first bids on our first asset sales in hand mid-year and so look \u2013 kind of look toward the next call to give an update on that.","Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, and congratulations on the results. Comparing slides six and seven, new northern STACK SXLs are performing considerably better than the overall northern 24 well average on slide seven. You mentioned higher sand-loadings is important. Are there any other noteworthy differences between the older and the newer wells that account for the variance in production?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I would say, that's probably the \u2013 that's the primary factor. So, we'll have to watch the continued performance to see if it's sustained. Remember, when we talk about long term and getting the development right, we're trying to create complex fracture networks near wellbore. One of the secret ingredients is keeping those fracture networks propped open. So, I think that's the logic behind more proppant is good to the extent that you can get it placed. We're very encouraged by those early results and we hope to build out the data set. I think I've said in the earlier call that most of the wells that we've done the highest concentrations at this point are in early stages of flow back, so more to come.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Well, and sort of saying on the theme of these latest wells, the production obviously look pretty attractive. Assuming that this is a pretty consistent result, how might the returns of these wells compare with the rest of the Newfield portfolio?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, obviously it's an improvement over the historical wells. So, I referenced in the call that the returns are getting better. I think the team's earning those wins on the field \u2013 kind of on the field and in the game \u2013 got to like that. It's positive. I think the key in wanting to get more data and more time is to see if the flatter decline evidence that you see early in the life of the wells sustains itself. If that happens, then there'll be a positive EUR impact and that will obviously translate to much higher returns. All good.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I agree. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","We appreciate all the color on the STACK. There's three things I wanted to hit on real quick here. One, just wanted to get your thoughts on a potential performance uplift with \u2013 on a lateral foot basis at least \u2013 with these single mile laterals. I know there's been a lot of debate there. Two, I wanted to get your thoughts \u2013 Kevin laid out last night five potential Meramec zones. Wondered what you're seeing there?","And then, lastly just the potential of the Osage \u2013 some encouraging results as of late \u2013 seeing what you guys are potentially planning on that front. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the performance uplift \u2013 again, I was careful in the call and I think we said it in two or three different ways \u2013 is that we're not out chasing splashy IPs and single-well press releases. That's not our game. We're about optimizing the development and maximizing net present value. So, everything we do is set in that context.","We would expect that \u2013 first priority \u2013 get the acreage HBP. We've been clear,. We've got a drilling advantage. We protect two sections with every well. Long laterals have been the answer in every one of these major plays that we've been in, if you're about intermediate and long-term value. If you're playing the game to capture ground and flip it, then you tell different stories. And I think some of you guys have been confused by people that are nothing but interlopers. I'll be glad when the interlopers are gone, and we're left with solid companies that are playing for the long-term.","We're almost there. It's a different game; this is a big-boy game. And the time for those guys is fast getting into the rear view mirror. So, as far as performance uplift, 5 to 10 ,we're going to drill the 20 wells; we'll do our workmanlike manner in terms of the technical analysis. We'll show you the results. All the work that we've done to date shows about a 1.8 to 2 factor when you think about the 5,000 foot versus the 10,000 foot. I would put that as too close to call and then in our math, the cost advantage and the time advantage translates to return advantage. So, thanks for giving me a moment to spout a bit of a diatribe, but we feel pretty strongly we're doing the right thing.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I appreciate that. Yeah, I was going to...","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As far as the number of zones, we've said consistently since \u2013 since the beginning of the play \u2013 that we thought there were probably three to five horizons of interest. I think we still believe that today. Devon, I didn't get a chance to see their information. You said they're talking about five in the Meramec, and you're asking, can I see that there could be five in the Meramec? The answer is, yes. The Osage, we know is oil-saturated from the cores that we cot early in \u2013 early in the exploitation \u2013 exploration phase, assessment phase, if you will, of the play. It's oil-saturated.","We haven't drilled any wells there, but clearly it's a target horizon that you would expect to be producible, and I expect we and the industry will find some time to test that, and of course, the Woodford's already been proven. So, there's a lot of work yet to be done to actually refine the vertical dimension of how tightly you can stack the individual layers, but I expect that we'll gather a lot of data within the industry over the next couple of years and give you that \u2013 that answer.","I know the early pilots are generally in 150 to 175 foot range, if I'm recollecting correctly, in terms of offset vertical dimension that the companies are testing, and I think our early test will be in line with that testing assumption as well. So I think that's \u2013 hopefully that covers all three of your questions.","Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Kim Pacanovsky with Imperial Capital. Your line is open.","Kim Marie Pacanovsky - Imperial Capital LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone. I'm wondering, looking at your HBP goals, is there any difference between what's required in the northern part of your acreage versus the southern part to meet your HBP goals this year? Will you be drilling more in the northern?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Kim, I think the \u2013 if you were to go back and just kind of look at our progress along the \u2013 historically in terms of where we started drilling with the initial test well. Rock Island, we drilled around that well, then we moved west, northwest gradually and north and east here most recently. So, that really is \u2013 it gives you kind of a footprint of how the acreage position was built.","So, when we're HBPing, we're taking into account the remaining term on leases and generally, each of the areas that we've moved into were picked up sequentially after those early test results. So, we're driven mostly by the remaining term on the leases at this stage. As the HBP percentage climbs and we transition to development, then we'll be making those decisions on where the highest returns and the best development areas are, and put those at the front of the line.","Kim Marie Pacanovsky - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Great. And then, your drilling days of 17 average versus your peers of 30, that's a pretty phenomenal difference, I would say. And you pointed to several factors that account for that difference. Would you point to anything being like the first or second main factor in that? I mean, you mentioned your problem solving abilities and your mud motors, et cetera, but is there one single thing that's responsible for, or mostly responsible for the difference?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, there is. It's team Newfield, that's the first one. The second one is team Newfield's process.","Kim Marie Pacanovsky - Imperial Capital LLC","Is the 30-day average incorporating some of the privates that are in the play or is it really just your major peers?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. It incorporates everybody that's (35:39)","Kim Marie Pacanovsky - Imperial Capital LLC","Everybody, okay.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Kim Marie Pacanovsky - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Great. All right. And then one last question, and not to beat a dead horse, but there have been a couple of questions on the variation of results through the acreage. And you've pointed to it being almost exclusively the amount of proppant, the higher proppant loading resulting in the better wells. But is there any way that you can do any kind of an apples-to-apples comparison to kind of dissect the geology? And when you are in a full develop \u2013 well, you are in development mode, but when you are not really piloting anymore and tweaking things, when you are in a full development mode, where would you expect to see the better wells on your acreage?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there's a lot in there Kim. I'll try to go back and repeat some of the things I said. So the first thing is, what we've said is that we've had amazing consistency across the acreage. That's the first thing, and that's true. So we don't see a huge variability. In fact, I think we've said for the last two or three years, that in terms of \u2013 when you look at P10 \/ P90 ratios as a description of the distribution, this play from right out of the chute \u2013 the first 10 wells to date \u2013 is one of the tightest P10 \/ P90 ratios of anything that we've participated in or evaluated. That's the first thing.","There is a difference by vintage on the wells. Again, we've been very methodical about how we've approached things. The first suite of wells in the assessment phase, drilled across the acreage, we completed identically. So you can go back in the record, two or three years ago, and you can see that we talked about that on a number of the calls. We did that for the very reason that you asked \u2013 did we see any material geologic variability as we moved across the acreage? And the conclusion was no, and now we've moved into optimizing completions. So, completions \u2013 the first phase are the easy wins, if you will. We're taking the perf clusters from 125 feet down to 50 feet to 75 feet, and I think we've tested as low as 35 feet, I believe, if my memory serves me right. That's all been done over the last two, two and a half years. And the fact that we pushed from 125 feet to 75 feet to 50 feet tells you that we were seeing positive economic uplift, and we've now incorporated that into the design.","And then, Gary, John, George and our drilling completion teams, today are working on proppant load, and that's kind of been the focus. And again, we took measurable, methodical steps across large batches of wells. Now, it's hard for you to diagnose this externally, and no, we're not going to give the roadmap out to everybody out there, but we know which wells we've done what on. And we can see that we've got a group of 1,000 pound per foot wells, and we've got 1,500 pound per foot wells; and we've got 2,400 pound per foot wells, and that's all about establishing what the optimal completion recipe is going to be and optimizing on the economics.","And I think the sincerest expression of all of those results is the question we continue to get asked from a lot of you guys. We've held with the 950 Mboe type curve, but over the last \u2013 course of the last year, year and a half, all the wells have continued to track and plot above the type curve, and that's after more than 100 wells have been drilled and completed. And that is just nothing short of phenomenal. So, for those that want to understand the play and see it as it is, it's not too hard. For those that want to tell other stories, they're running out of bullets. Their guns are almost empty.","Kim Marie Pacanovsky - Imperial Capital LLC","Thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. No problem.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move now to Ipsit Mohanty from GMP Securities. Your line is open.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, Lee and team.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Just going to slide six again, and looking at probably your delineation program going forward, you alluded to going north and east. Can't help but see that the eastern side \u2013 and I'm talking about east of Vickie \u2013 lacks well control. How do you feel about going forward with that delineation and what gives you confidence that probably wells are going to come out close to the type-curve?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, you're looking at the polygon. So, I'll make it easy for you. The total acreage in that far eastern edge is single digit percentages, and we're talking about the untested portion of our acreage being only two to three miles in extent. So, from \u2013 for translating that, it is not material. There are wells planned to be drilled this year by ourselves and industry that'll test that. I think that you can probably see the logic of waiting to test that later in the program as we get our drilling efficiencies down, because the way you make that area work are by having the most efficient lowest cost wells.","So, we'll test it; industry will test it. We've got good wells right up to that area, but it is a \u2013 less than 5% of the total acreage block is represented in that eastern area on a net basis. So, that's the most important factor. We're not worried about it. I don't think you should worry too much about it. We'll test it and we'll give you the results when we get there.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Thank you. Thanks for that. And then, this is a broader question and again, I apologize, I'm taking you a little further ahead. But you hinted that right now in the phase that you are in, you're going to come back during development \u2013 right now you're in delineation \u2013 you're going to come back in development, and so you're not probably doing some of those practices that others are. So I'm just curious, like let's say, we flash forward and you're done with \u2013 you get \u2013 you're done with HBP. You come back into development mode. Are there practices that you're seeing outside that you'd like to replicate?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll give you examples from inside the portfolio. Certainly, we're \u2013 imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. So, if somebody is doing something novel and unique and creative that improves the returns, we'll adopt it tomorrow. Okay, that's first thing. So, I think the easiest way for you to see what we see in terms of looking into the future and dreaming a little bit is the Williston Basin's a great example. Our team is regularly drilling and completing and equipping wells in the Williston Basin at similar depths, 10,000 foot laterals, today for less than $5 million. So, if you want an example of what the team does, team Newfield and team Newfield's processes, there you go. And we're going to translate those over to the STACK play as we move into development, and we frankly believe we'll be transitioning into development in 2017, so that road ahead is not as far into the future as it was when we started.","And then I touched on the call about not going out and specifically targeting zones that we believe might have the highest productivity or the splashiest well result. We're actually continuing to stay very disciplined in drilling our wells just inside lease lines, and that's part of our HBP mode. It leaves all of the ground; I meant to make this point in Kim's earlier question. When we get this thing HBP'd, we're going to have data across the entire footprint, and we'll have a couple of miles between these wells that has been untouched. So, when we decide what the optimal development plan is going forward, we've got virgin ground. And a lot of times in these resource plays, when you don't have large, contiguous positions like we have here and able to control large patches of ground, that you're not able to efficiently develop in that regard.","So, I think this play has the potential of being the best and most efficient development that industry has delivered yet. And Newfield's going to be right up at the front of that line where we should be.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Okay, great color. And if I could just slip one in, which is, how do you think about going in testing out new zones. For example, the Osage, in an environment where your prime motivation is HBP, so just trying to understand.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's not a priority today, and I'm all for whoever wants to test it first, go in there. We know it's there. We don't need to get all the answers ourselves. We can learn from the efforts of others and if we happen to be the first one to drill it, we'll tell you about it, but it's not in our plan. We're going to stay focused on HBP and getting to development.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Thank you, Lee. Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's our stuff.","Operator","And as a reminder...","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jason Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jason S. Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jason.","Jason S. Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Lee, just to \u2013 to follow-up on a comment you just made. So, a pretty big increase sequentially in the Bakken with only one rig, can you just give some color around what drove that? Was it timing of completions? Was it something you changed on the completion recipe? And does that success that you're having there potentially change your views around slowing activity in that region?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so I'd say in the Williston Basin, I'll go back to what I said earlier. It starts with the team and second step's the process. Part of the learning is more stages and more prop \u2013 more proppant \u2013 and I think we did both there. So, we increased the stage \u2013 number of stages in the completion \u2013 and we increased the proppant sizes. And what was cool about that, if you look closely at it, those are 5,000 foot wells, for those that are in love with 5,000 foot wells; I kind of love those 5,000 foot wells. They were drilled and completed for less than $4 million, including facilities.","So again, those that love 5,00 foot wells it tells us that our team can go over and do that in STACK just as easily. So, what you can count on with Newfield is we're going to drill the most economic well and we're going to maximize value. That's what we do every day. We don't play this game for the short-term. It's an intermediate and long-term game and we make decisions accordingly. So, if you think about it that way when you're looking at our data, our information, you'll be in sync with us. If you're asking questions from the guys that play the short-term game, we're probably just not going to have much interest in playing that game. Go ask them what they're doing. Okay?","Jason S. Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And so \u2013 on top of that \u2013 last quarter, I guess you talked about your two JVs. I just wanted to follow-up on the Arkoma and just, I mean, I think you mentioned last quarter, superior early results, and if you can update there as well in terms of where things stand, what you've accomplished and how you see that kind of fitting into your portfolio in the longer term?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that \u2013 what was cool about that is, I think we built five \u2013 we completed five wells. I think we have a 10-well program. I think the other five wells notionally will be drilled probably next year, I'm guessing. Those first five wells were drilled and completed over a four or five month period. Four of the five are in the top short list, all time wells drilled in the Arkoma \u2013 I mean in the top 10 \u2013 so that tells you something. The other one's just outside of the top 20. I think the composite production from those five wells spread out over that four or five month timeframe was in excess of 60 million cubic feet a day. So to give you a feel for that, I think we drilled out there historically 300 plus wells. I think we had 150 million gross production back at the beginning of 2015. We drilled five wells and added over 50 million cubic feet a day.","And the best part of it is, those wells were drilled and completed in less than half the time of the best well that was drilled five years previously. So, pretty exciting and again, it demonstrates a learning organization and that team and process matter. And so, we proved the concept. We know that there is a lot of value in the Arkoma. We love having a 170,000 acre HBP asset there. And in the right place and time when it makes sense, then we've got a gas option; we'll exercise it.","Jason S. Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the answers. Appreciate it.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call back to our presenters for any closing remarks today.","Lee K.

For opening remarks and other housekeeping items, I will turn the call over to Steve Campbell, Head of Investor Relations.","Stephen C. Campbell - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. We are off to a fantastic start in 2015, and we have a lot of information to share with you today. Our speakers on today's call include our Chairman, Lee Boothby and our CFO, Larry Massaro. Our COO, Gary Packer, and the remainder of our executive team will also be available to answer your detailed questions at the end of today's prepared remarks.","I remind you again, please limit your time today to one question and one follow-up. This certainly allows us to get to more of your questions today. Before handing the call over to Lee, let me make a couple of comments. We issued a detailed @NFX publication last night along with our earnings release, and we will reference some of these slides this morning.","As you know, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website along with the earnings release, the financial tables and our non-GAAP reconciliations. As always, today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions and these are based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed today. A full disclaimer for you is located in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-K.","I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman, Lee Boothby.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. Good to get you involved in the call. Good morning, everyone. Let's get started. We're off to a very good start in 2015 and we are on course to deliver on our business plan. The priorities in this plan are very clear. First, our plan aligns our investment levels with our expected cash flows today and ensures we maintain financial strength and liquidity. We right-sized our investment levels and shifted the lion's share of our capital to the Anadarko Basin where we are seeing very strong and improving rates of return.","We executed three very important financial transactions during the quarter that put us in a very strong position today. We issued equity and paid off our credit facility. We issued new 10-year senior notes in an attractive 5 3\/8% [5.375%]. And in April 2015, we retired a commensurate amount of debt due in 2020, and we upsized our credit facility by $400 million to $1.8 billion and extended its term by two years to 2020.These transactions were carefully considered and we see them as the right steps in today's outlook for lower oil prices.","Second, we are focused on drilling in STACK to hold our large acreage position by production. Our confidence in the scale and economic success of STACK continues to grow with each well. You'll hear more on today's call to support our encouragement around the Anadarko Basin and its potential to drive our corporate growth well into the future.","And lastly, we're now positioned to ramp up activities in SCOOP and STACK at the right time. We recently announced the combination of our Rockies and Onshore Gulf Coast business units into one operating region, allowing us to expedite the shift of both human and capital resources into the Anadarko Basin as well as reduce future G&A cost and realize greater efficiencies.","Be assured as we continue to see, improving margins, we will again focus on even stronger levels of liquids production and cash flow growth. We have the people in place today to execute our future plans. Before I provide an overview of the progress we are making in the Anadarko Basin, I'll turn the call over to Larry Massaro to provide a quick summary of our first quarter operating and financial results.","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone. As we close out the first quarter, we're executing extremely well. Our 2015 operating plan is intact, and we are on course to deliver our key objectives, which combine growth with an improving cost structure.","We entered this year quickly flowing what was a $1.7 billion investment rate with rigs operating across four basins. We quickly reduced our budget to $1.2 billion and aligned it with expected cash flows. This reallocation reduced activity in South Texas and the Rockies while shifting capital to our highest return plays in the Anadarko Basin.","On that cash flow statement, it appeared that we invested about $500 million in the quarter about 20% of this was simply cash payments from 2014 capital investments. We actually invested about $400 million in the first quarter as we wound down drilling programs and completed an inventory of wells that carried across year-end. We expect that our fourth quarter 2015 investment level will slow to about $250 million.","For the remainder of the year, we expect to run one rig in the Williston Basin and 10 rigs in the Anadarko Basin. Our production in the first quarter topped the midpoint of our guidance by 300,000 barrels totaling 12.6 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our domestic production was 11.7 million barrels of oil equivalent. Adjusted for asset sales, this represents year-over-year growth of 21%. More importantly, our domestic liquids production was up 26% year-over-year. In our guidance, note that our second quarter domestic production is expected to grow 5% over the quarter.","Discretionary cash flow from operations was $255 million or about $1.76 per share, topping consensus estimates. Net income for the quarter excluding several one-time items detailed in our earnings release was $0.02 per share. The most significant item was a non-cash ceiling test write-down related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full cost company, this charge was certainly expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-K.","This is a non-cash charge. It has no impact on our credit facility or our debt covenants. We expect another ceiling test write-down in the second quarter as $90 oil prices in 2014 are replaced with significantly lower 2015 prices in the 12-month trailing average.","Our plan for 2015 projects improving cash operating costs throughout the year. We are taking the right steps today to lower our cost structure and improve margins across the company. Our first quarter domestic lease operating expense per barrel equivalent dropped more than 15% over the prior year. Our G&A expense will benefit from our recent reorganization and head count reductions. Excluding the one-time costs associated with these actions, we estimate that our G&A expense will fall by about 15% or more than $40 million in 2016 and beyond. Our interest expense will also benefit by $10 million per year due to lower rates on our recently issued senior notes. These are significant positive changes to our cost structure in future periods.","As Lee mentioned in his opening remarks, the capital market transactions we executed in the first quarter were well-timed, allowing us to navigate uncertain market conditions. At the end of the first quarter, we had nothing drawn on our revolver. With about $2 billion of liquidity, our capital structure is the best it has been in more than a decade.","The focus this year will remain profitable growth, continued cost structure improvement, getting the STACK HBPed and ready to deliver strong future growth as we prepare for full field development and maintaining balance sheet integrity.","I'll turn the call over to Lee for an update on our Anadarko Basin.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Larry. I'd like to spend the remainder of today's call on the Anadarko Basin, more specifically share some additional information with you on why we are gaining more confidence in this play's ability to deliver corporate growth for years to come.","We're on track to deliver 45% production growth from the Anadarko Basin in 2015 and we expect that our first quarter average net rate, 53,000 barrels oil equivalent per day, will grow to an average of 57,000 net barrels oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, and we expect to exit the year with more than 68,000 BOE per day.","The slight drop in our first quarter daily average is simply related to the timing of pad completions and planned shut-ins for offsetting completions. Be assured, we're on track to deliver our growth projections in 2015.","While excited about this growth, we're even more excited about our increasing rates of return, the improving productivity of our wells and the data we were obtaining from a large number of STACK wells that have now been online for two years or more.","Let me provide a few distinct examples to help you better understand our excitement and growing confidence levels in the value of STACK. Our well results continue to get better. On slide seven, in the @NFX publication, we included six STACK wells that on average have higher 30 day, 60 day and 90 day production rates than our 2014 wells, at more than 800 barrels oil equivalent per day for both the 30 day and 60 day average rates, and 765 barrels oil equivalent per day for our average 90-day rate. The oil percentage on a wellhead basis was about 80% over the first 30 days and averaged 74% oil over the first 90 days. The wells validate our type curve increase at year-end 2014.","These wells were drilled across three separate townships, and we continue to see very consistent and repeatable results as we work to HBP our acreage. When you average the 30 STACK wells we have released over the last two years, the 30-day average oil percentage is greater than 80%. Again, this is an oil play, and our acreage was purposely assembled in the updip portion of the play in what we call the oil window. This is the area that we targeted, and we're really proud to own it today. As we move south and west towards the traditional Cana play, one would expect the gas cuts to become materially higher.","We have about 100 wells planned for the Anadarko Basin in 2015, and we're gathering data very quickly. There are an additional 15 operated wells in the basin that have recently commenced production or are in various stages of completion. We look forward to sharing more long-term production history with you around mid-year.","Let me comment on an issue that has come up in a few of our investor meetings and discussions, gas oil ratio or GOR. We are seeing very high oil production in the early life of our wells. This production is holding up extremely well in our longest dated wells. Our oldest well was drilled four years to test the STACK concept. After four years, that well is still producing 62% black oil. In addition to the first STACK test, we also had the benefit of more than 2,000 vertical wells drilled and completed over the last half century. These wells had commingled production from a multitude of shallower horizons all sourced by the Woodford formation, one of the nation's most prolific source rocks.","Form this large data set of legacy vertical producers, we took a representative sample across our acreage position and examined the GOR over time. Although the oil volumes from these vertical wells weren't impressive by today's standards, what was impressive was the consistency of the GOR over the life of the wells.","On slide eight, in @NFX, we shared our original six-well sample with you. We used this information to create our type curve assumptions. To date, our four oldest wells, which now have at least two years of production history, have performed in line with our forecast GOR.","The GOR is remarkably consistent with our sample of legacy vertical wells and with our early type curve assumptions in STACK. Our model GOR assumptions appear to be very sound. Recall that our economic assumptions for the STACK play assume an average oil yield of about 40% over the life of the well. That's a three stream production representing 40% oil, 30% NGLs. That'd be 70% total liquids over the life of the well, the balance being 30% natural gas.","We know that the GOR will increase over time and we feel that our forecasts are in line with our expectations and performance observed to date. We believe that Newfield controls the best acreage in the play. And as you move west, again, we expect the play to ultimately transition to dry gas. Our original lease capture was focused on the oil window.","So make no mistake. The plays on our STACK acreage are oil plays. Slide nine shows that the initial oil cumes in STACK are very high. Over the first five years, we estimate we will produce about 60% of the total recoverable oil and nearly 80% in the first 10 years. Our high initial oil rates in the early life of these wells materially enhance our returns, even at the budgeted $60 three-year average oil outlook.","Slide 10 shows the first year economics of the STACK well computed on a three-stream basis. Our production as reported as wellhead production or two-stream oil and natural gas but it's important that you understand the economic uplift created by three-stream processing.","Our operating teams in the Anadarko Basin are doing a fantastic job today and we are leading the industry. The initial learnings from our SCOOP development have been rapidly applied to STACK. Our most recent wells have been drilled and completed for about $8.5 million gross, already in line with our full-year average forecast.","Our well costs are down nearly 50% on a cost per lateral foot basis over the last three years, and we're excited about where we may be by year-end 2015.","The real prize lies in development mode, while we are certain that significant savings can be realized. There's no better comparison in the Williston which is now in full development. Our 10,000-foot lateral wells in the Williston are today being drilled in just 15 days from common pad locations, for an industry-leading low cost of less than $6 million, including facility cost.","My final point today relates to the significant resource potential in stacking development wells in multiple horizons across our acreage. The STACK play has more than 700 feet of oil saturated column in the Woodford and Meramec shales. Our competence in well performance was demonstrated at year-end when we increased our STACK type curve by 20% to our current estimate of 950,000 barrels. To date, we've completed four spacing tests in STACK, all with very encouraging early results.","As illustrated on slide 11 in @NFX, we now have tests in the Woodford-Woodford, Meramec-Meramec, and Woodford-Meramec as tight as 880 feet apart horizontally and 175 feet apart vertically. Although it's way too early for definitive conclusions, the average for these eight wells has performed in line with our 950,000 BOE type curve. And three additional operated spacing tests are planned for later this year.","We kept our remarks brief this morning to leave ample time for your questions. I will close simply by saying Newfield has high quality options in SCOOP and STACK today, and we are taking the right steps to ensure we position the company to compete and win in today's environment and accelerate development in the future. To date, we have delivered outstanding operating results, and we intend to deliver on our full-year objectives.","Thanks for your investment in our company. We look forward to taking your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, Lee. One question, one follow-up. First question is the $8.5 million well cost is impressive and how do you see that working down over the next couple of years with pad efficiencies? Then, of course, we're all asking the same question of operators, how much of that is service deflation versus operator efficiency?","And my follow-up is the target zone in either the Meramec or the Woodford, how thick is the zone you're trying to stay in? Are you measuring that in tens of feet or is that less than 10 feet?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, well, Subash, good to talk to you this morning. I think you've got three or four questions in two, so I'll compliment you on that as well. I'll try to cover them all.","So, the first one on $8.5 million, we're super pleased to be at the $8.5 million line at the end of the first quarter. When you think about the forecast that we put forth at the beginning of the year, we were thinking $8.5 million would be a good average outcome for the year. So, I would tell you that we're ahead of schedule. Of the savings that have been realized to date to get to that $8.5 million, it's split about half service costs and half efficiency gains. So, the part that we really like is the efficiency gains side of the equation because that's the piece that we get to hold on to when market conditions turn and commodity prices rise again.","So, ahead of expectations year-to-date. I indicated we think that we'll have additional gains as the year unfolds. We'll also have the benefit of \u2013 we had a lot of carryover activity into the quarter that would be included in those costs, and we hope to see a better run rate as we approach midyear. So, look forward to us giving you an update midyear, and we'll give you some clarity on what we think the balance of the year is going to be.","As far as the STACK play, the Meramec sections, depending on where you're at, let's say it's 300 feet to 500-feet thick. Generally, the Woodford sections 150 feet, 250 feet thick. We talk about it as being a 700-foot thick oil saturated section. When we acquired the acreage position, we set out to buy it; we didn't buy edges. So as you move away from our acreage position, north, south and east, you do approach edges, but we don't have material edges, if you will, from a conventional standpoint within our acreage footprint, so that's a positive. I think it's one of the contributors to the consistent results that we're seeing across the acreage block.","And I would bet at the end of the day that we'll develop horizons that will be somewhere between 100 to 200-foot thick target intervals. And with regard to targeting within this section, we've not worked out all of the details yet in terms of specific windows. But clearly, the team's got the ability to land in 10 foot, 20 foot horizons and stay there over the course of the 10,000-foot lateral.","But generally, we want to think about it as how many layers can we develop in this 700-foot section. We've got to drill additional spacing tests and get more definitive data there to give you an answer on that.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey guys. Lee, in your prepared comments, you basically mentioned that at some point there could be a right time to ramp up in SCOOP and STACK. Can you provide a little bit more color around the thought process there on when you would ramp?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that we indicated when we came out with the $1.2 billion budget that we were going to be \u2013 remain focused on financial strength. I think we've done some things to further bolster that during the course of the first quarter.","Ultimately, as you know, Leo, we've been navigating towards balance. So I think that some upside in terms of the commodity, some improvements in margins, generation of incremental cash flow, I think that's what we'd like to see. Those types of conditions translating to having more resources available to deploy, we'll probably more likely not translate into accelerated activity. We think accelerated activity is the right first priority for the company coming out of this. We want to get the acreage HBPed and we want to get to development as quickly as we can.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. And I guess just looking at the Meramec, I'm trying to get a sense of what your longest-producing wells are in that zone. I think you guys originally targeted more the Woodford, I think you said your oldest Woodford well was roughly four years, just trying to get a sense of your longest producing Meramec well. And if you'd also just comment on how long your recent downspacing pad is at Meramec? (21:08).","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Gary give you some color on that one.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, the history on the Meramec is it's about four years as far as the longest history we have. As far as the additional downspacing, we've got three well pairs planned for this year at 880 feet and we're going to be in one non-operated spacing unit, that I think will be conceivably a little tighter than that.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Heikkinen \u2013 I'm sorry. Our next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dave.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","So, real quickly, looking at the production guidance and obviously a big Q1 beat, if I take the midpoint of the 2Q production guidance, you already at the low end or completed half of your production for the full year. Can you walk through a little bit on maybe why the conservatism in forward guidance, or what might have prevented you from accelerating that at this point? And if I missed that earlier in the call, I apologize.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, not at all, Dave. Thanks for your question. I think that the \u2013 we're certainly in a good position. I think the 2015 plan is shaping up well at this stage and we like where we sit. There's a great deal of activity in SCOOP today down in the south. It's both operated and non-operated. What you can't see and maybe don't fully appreciate all the logistical challenges when everybody's getting in, starting to develop out there and drilling spacing units. So, there are periods that you have to plan for shut-ins and other activities along with the normal sequencing with regard to pad drilling.","So, we've got two other variables there that in a perfect world, you wouldn't have to deal with. So, we're shutting our wells in when offset operators are completing theirs. They're shutting theirs in when we're completing ours. And that's part of everybody that's playing down there's production forecast at this point. So, I'll tell you that's something we do take into account. I think the second quarter does give you some indications. We see a nice uptick in production, and certainly, you've got a commitment, I think we stated it in the call, if not, I'll make it clear here. We'll certainly revisit our forecast for the year around midyear.","David William Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. I appreciate that. And then in the past, you've been pretty active with bolt-on acreage transactions, and you've been vocal that that's certainly something that you'd look at going forward. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that today? Has the environment changed? Is it a tighter supply-demand environment with respect to accumulating acreage? Any kind of color there?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, thanks for that question. I think it does give us (24:03). At first, I'll start out with saying, we've got many opportunities today. So, we're long on options and long opportunities. We've talked about the most important priority.","First of those is HBPing our acreage. I think we're well on our way. We've got a good schedule. We think things could develop where we can actually accelerate the HBP, which would allow us to accelerate development. And certainly the payoff for our investors is getting to the development stage in the play. So, that's number one on our list.","Clearly, coring up our lease positions, I mean, throughout our history, we've tried to do that and I think it makes sense. It's something that we want to do. We think we've identified the core of the play. We know where we want to be in that regard and we're going to continue to stay focused on that.","As for deals, we continue to look. But I'd tell you, given the slight rise in commodity prices, I think that in today's world, many of the sellers have what we believe are very unrealistic expectations. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that maybe even sky-high expectations. So, in that regard, we'll stay in the game but Newfield's not going to make an investment that doesn't make sense.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks, guys. As I think about your STACK results, and I think you were just hitting on that kind of mowin' the lawn as you move into development mode and you are factoring in that offset downtime. Is it development mode this year? Is it development mode next year? Just trying to think of when things transition from HBP to true development and how that STACK oil wells waiting on completion with kind of inventory builds and then contracts as you think through the remaining 12 months?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll let Gary fill in the blanks for anything I leave out . I like the mowing the lawn analogy. I typically call it Sherman's March to the Sea. I think that's really the place that we want to get to. I mean getting into development mode when you've got thousands of locations and the best team in the business strong, completing wells for you, we want to get there as quick as we can.","I think we've been consistent over the course of the last year to talk notionally at sort of the planned activity levels that we think will be a couple years before we're really into development mode. So, I'd say it's more of a 2017 event than a 2015, 2016 event to the extent that business conditions develop to allow us to accelerate we certainly could pull that back this direction. But I suspect that I'd stay focused on 2017 as being the year that we shift into development mode. Gary, you got anything you want to add?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, in 2016 we ought to have about three-quarters of our acreage HBPed. And as we alluded to, acceleration of activity will lead to acceleration of learnings which then allow us to capture more of the cost savings earlier than being in full development. But as Lee suggested, 2017's the year in which we step into multi-well pads.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Gary just said something to trigger another thought. When you think about the costs that are being delivered and the returns that are being delivered today, these are first wells in a drilling spacing unit. It's just amazing what we're able to deliver in this play today. So we're super excited, and I can't wait to get into development mode.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Sean Sneeden with Oppenheimer.","Sean Sneeden - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Sean.","Sean Sneeden - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Maybe, Lee or Larry, a follow-up from the M&A question. if you guys think about and recognizing kind of where we are with the strip, but if you think about just the general concept of M&A, is the preference for you guys to stay within the current footprint or would you guys look to expand into other areas? What kind of would drive one or the other?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Larry take the lead on that.","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, the way we look at that is we've got such a great operating capability. We're always going to lean toward the operating footprint we have. We have a lot to do in the Anadarko Basin to secure the value. So, I don't see us kind of going outside the current operating footprint. It would have to be a pretty amazing deal for us.","Sean Sneeden - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Then just maybe one housekeeping question. On G&A in the quarter, it looked a little bit above guidance. Was that mainly due to the closing of the office? And if so, what do you think kind of run rate G&A at this point?","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, we had some extra costs associated with one-time charges. In January, we had a reduction in force. It costs us about $10 million. And recently, which will hit us in the second quarter, we've got some reorganization costs which are going to end up \u2013 again, being additional throughout the year that total at $35 million. That's inclusive of our lease in Denver. And in terms of the actual G&A, there's also some costs associated with the rise in the share price attributable to our cash-doubled shares and the way we look at our share plans that are noncash aspect. So, you're seeing a slight rise in that just because of the winds at our backs on our stock price.","In terms of the savings you're going to see from the actions we've taken, I mentioned in the call script, we're going to see about $40 million of saving start to roll in in 2016 and beyond. And we're just getting our arms around that now, we're pretty excited about the impact of that as well as the impact on the interest expense segment you saw.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Du Boff with Oppenheimer and Co.","Robert E. Du Boff - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to move real quick to the Uinta Basin. I'm just curious how oil differentials and service costs are trending in that basin, and what conditions you need to maybe pick up activity there going forward?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll start off with the service cost reductions, and I'll flip it to Larry on the differentials. As far as service cost, by this point, we've dropped all our rigs, so it's difficult to actually measure them, but we can certainly impute them from some of the other areas. So, we have an active program being undertaken right now to project some of the new completion efficiencies that we're seeing elsewhere. And looking at what that impact would be in our central basin horizontal program.","But we think it would be significant. I would expect that we would see above average, i.e., beyond 20%, 30% savings, if we were going to get out there and re-drill a well today. Again, the team's working on that, and we look forward to an opportunity to put a rig back in there and test some of these things out.","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And on differentials, what you've seen is with the oil price fall, the way our contracts are structured, many of them have historically guided toward a variable percentage in the oil price. Actually, at this low point in the price cycle, you start having more impact from the part of our contracts that are fixed expense and so when we look at that, differentials have actually kind of gone to $14, which is a much higher percentage differential. And so, we see that as certainly punitive on the quarter, but with the rise in share price you'll start to see that come back \u2013 the rise in oil price you'll see that come back in line with kind of more historical percentages.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The only thing I'd add to some of the comments here is the focus we've had on operating expense reduction, and that applies to the Uinta where they've really been leading the charge as far as driving down their cost structure, but everybody across the board. I think in the quarter, we showed 15%, 16% reduction. I think we're just getting started there. I think there's some other opportunities, and I would hope we'd be in an 18% to 20% by year-end on our overall operating expense. So, a lot of great work going in there to becoming more efficient and preserve our margins.","Robert E. Du Boff - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Great. Thanks very much, guys. Congratulations again on a good quarter.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one last question from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Lee, just get back to Anadarko Basin. It looked like there was a little bit of a downtick in average initial rate per lateral foot if you adjust for the lateral in the SCOOP. What was primarily driving that? Was it just drilled in a different area versus like 14 well?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll let Gary Packer give you some color on that because he's certainly intimate with the details there.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","So, as you noticed, we had a good step up in average rates, 30 day, 60 day, 90 day in STACK. To really understand what's going on in SCOOP, the summary of it is it's just a function that we have more oil and less gas, and therefore on a BOE basis, it's translating to what appears to be a lower number. If you wanted a little bit more granularity in that, when you actually look at the oil phase that we're pursuing out there, we really only drilled one well there, and that particular well, it was a slightly longer well but it was the \u2013 one of the furthest east wells we've drilled. And as we move east in the play, we pick up a higher oil percentage. In this case, we actually had a 61% oil cut versus the prior year at about 50% or so.","When you move into the wet gas, last year, we had a considerable number of wells that we were drilled. And those wells produced at about 26% oil cut. This year, the wells that we've drilled, the five that we reported were at 30% oil cut. And that's really a function of choke management.","What the teams have developed and we've been talking about this for quite a while, reducing our drawdowns and holding these wells back a little bit earlier on, and we're finding some of the additional benefits not only in increasing our EUR is the fact we're actually getting a higher liquids cut in the separator as a result of that. So, really compliment them for continuing to look at their operating practices, and it's really going to get translated to the bottom line.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Gary. And just real quick, could you provide an update on activity in China and what sort of pricing you're realizing in the second quarter, oil pricing?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","As far as the activity, we are now concluding our drilling operations. Things were done very well. I think production's gross basis is somewhere around 24,000 barrels a day, and we still have another well that we're going to be bringing on production. So, that's going real well.","Larry, as far as pricing in the (35:12)?","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. On the prices, so what we saw in the first quarter if you relate it to WTI, we saw about $2 premium on our sales in the Pearl River which is the bulk of the revenue. I think you'll see that improve slightly this year; it'll get a little better. So, pretty much in line with what we thought.","Operator","And we have time for one last question from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning. Lee, I think it was a couple of quarters ago, you talked about in the lower section of the Meramec and looks like that's been one of your better wells. And I was just wondering if you have any other tests in that lower section among the wells that you haven't identified as upper or lower and if you have a view today of whether you have two potential horizons in the Meramec?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'll start by saying, when we got into the play and we first started talking about it, if you go back a couple of years ago now, we started talking publicly. We said that ultimately we thought there would be three to five horizons to be developed across the acreage. I think that we've got a good line of sight that that's still a reasonable range of estimates.","We're going to need to drill additional multi wells facing pilots to kind of refine that estimate. As far as individual tests, our team is testing upper, lower, middle, upper middle, lower middle, upper Woodford, lower Woodford. And one of these days, we'll get around to testing the Osage which sits between the two. It's oil saturated as well.","So we're going to continue to test multiple intervals within the 700-foot section, and we'll just keep you posted as it goes. But I'll tell you that top, middle, bottom, it's all working, and it's only going to get better from here.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Lee Boothby for any additional or closing remarks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, operator. I'd just like to thank everybody again for your interest and your investment in Newfield. We're excited about where we're at today. I hope you can take that away from the call. We've got a great team, and they're delivering great results, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as the year continues to unfold. Have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation."],"15433":["Newfield Exploration Co.

[Operator Instructions]","Mr. Lee Boothby, please go ahead, sir.","Lee K. Boothby","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our midyear investor call. We appreciate you dialing in a little earlier than usual this morning as we realize there are a number of peer company calls today. We'll keep our remarks brief today and save time for questions at the end.","I'm joined by several members of the management team, including Gary Packer, our Chief Operating Officer; Terry Rathert, our Chief Financial Officer; Clay Gaspar, Vice President of Mid-Continent; and of course, Steve Campbell, Vice President of Investor Relations.","We have a lot of good news to share with you today, and 2013 is shaping up to be an excellent year for Newfield. We're well on our way to delivering on our 3-year growth outlook that we outlined to you earlier this year.","There are 3 key takeaways from today's call. First, the process of selling our international businesses is underway and progressing very well. Goldman Sachs is managing the process, and we've seen strong interest in the assets. Sales of our international businesses will be a transformational step to becoming a North American-focused resource company. Although our international businesses are quality assets managed by exceptional people, their sale will allow us to accelerate growth in our domestic onshore areas. This is absolutely the right long-term step for Newfield, and we're confident that our plan will create value for our shareholders.","Second, our domestic assets are performing extremely well, and we're on track to deliver on our 3-year production forecast. As you could see in our release last night, our second quarter production was ahead of our guidance by about 500,000 barrels. And all of our average -- overage was from our domestic focus areas. Year-to-date, we produced over 23 million barrels, and the expected growth from our 4 key plays is largely back-end weighted in 2013. As a result, we now expect that our production will be at the upper end of our original 2013 forecast or 46 million to 47 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our 2013 domestic liquids production is expected to increase 40% over last year, adjusted for asset sales. The strength of our production in the back half of 2013 bodes well for our 2014 growth projections as well.","Third, we're seeing very positive efficiency gains in our development drilling campaigns this year. We've said time and again that one of our core competencies at Newfield is our ability to cost effectively execute drilling programs. The progress that our operating teams have made over the last 12 months to lower our completed well cost, enhance EURs and improve returns in our key development plays is nothing short of remarkable. As we demonstrate repeatable and lower well cost from our key drilling programs, keep in mind that these gains will have a very positive impact on our future development costs and the reserve report, thereby increasing PV-10. I commend our teams for getting it done, and their efforts are adding value to the bottom line.","We continue to reap the benefits of efficiency gains in the Eagle Ford, the Williston Basin, the Cana Woodford and in Monument Butte. We're drilling our wells faster and reducing the number of days from rig release to first sales to maximize our annual production impact. These improvements are coming through our well designs, tailored bid applications, identification of preferred drilling zones, completion optimization work and the multitude of benefits associated with pad development drilling. As a result, we expect that our planned rig programs in 2013 will yield more wells in each of our key plays and provide additional momentum into 2014.","In addition to drilling our wells faster, we also recently moved to 7 operated rigs in the Cana Woodford and now expect to maintain this activity level into next year. These steps add a little capital to our 2013 program, and we expect that our capital investment this year will total approximately $1.9 billion or the upper end of our original $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion guidance range. Gary Packer will update you on our drilling programs during our operations update.","First, let's cover our financial results for the quarter. For the second quarter, we earned $0.37 per diluted share, excluding the impact of special items detailed in our release. Note that we are now classifying our international businesses as discontinued operations. Earnings in the quarter were impacted by a $5 million charge to G&A, associated with a voluntary severance program we initiated earlier this year, to lower our cash operating cost and better align our organization with our vision of the future, becoming a North American-focused resource company.","Revenues in the quarter were $623 million including $188 million from discontinued ops. Cash flow from operations before working capital changes was $310 million. Our cash cost are moving in the right direction, and our teams are doing a great job to improve our margins. Therefore, in today's @NFX, we adjusted our production and cost expense ranges for the second half of the year. Note that our cost and expenses are shown separately on a unit and production basis for domestic and international. International results, reported as discontinued operations, will roll up under one line on the income statement.","Second quarter sales were 11.8 million BOE, which included 1.8 million BOE from international, and domestic oil and liquids production was up 17% over the first quarter of 2013 and ahead of our guidance. Our growth in liquids reflects the strength of our U.S. drilling campaigns and provides encouragement on the Newfield of the future.","For the third quarter, we expect our domestic liquids production will be about 5 million barrels of oil equivalent. The increase is largely related to 16 new completions in the Eagle Ford, continued growth in the Cana and higher sales in Uinta Basin. International liftings in the third quarter should approximate 1.4 million barrels, and we still expect to produce at least 7.2 million barrels in international for the full year, excluding the timing of the potential sale.","I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Gary Packer, for the operations update.","Gary D. Packer","Thanks, Lee, and good morning. We have some solid operational updates for you today. I'll hit the highlights and ensure we have time at the end to take your individual questions.","So let's start with the Anadarko Basin. The Anadarko Basin in Cana Woodford play has become one of industry's most active areas. As natural gas prices retreated, Newfield and industry were seeking new liquids-rich plays to boost our margins. We certainly found a great one in the Cana Woodford. In less than 2 years, we have moved from concept through stealth leasing efforts and into field development. At the end of this year, we expect that our Cana Woodford production will exceed 27,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's 1,000 barrels a day higher than the estimate we provided last quarter. Later this year, the Cana Woodford will become Newfield's largest-producing asset.","Our second quarter production in the Anadarko Basin was strong, averaging 16,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, exceeding our second quarter guidance of 15,000 barrels a day net. That's up more than 60% for our fourth quarter 2012. The rate of returns on these wells exceeds 50% today and among the highest in our company. In the second quarter, we moved to 7 operated rigs, above our beginning-of-year guidance of 4 to 6 rigs. Our Mid-Continent team has continued to improve the plays with drilling and completion innovations. The returns today warrant our increased investments.","Our 2013 wells in the South West Gas play produced an average of 15,000 -- 1,500 barrels a day in gross initial production, and our 60- and 90-day averages are the same at more than 1,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Again, controlled flowback is making a difference in our well performance. About 21% of our production is oil over the first 90 days.","In our South Oil play, recent wells have averaged gross initial production of about 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day and averaged about 1,200 barrels a day over their first 60 days. More than 50% of this production is oil.","So why have Cana returns been improving? Well, here are a few reasons. First, we're drilling longer lateral development wells, far longer than the competition and longer than our 2012 average. Our lateral lengths year-to-date in South Cana have averaged more than 7,000 feet. We have proven in multiple plays, the Eagle Ford, the Arkoma and the Bakken, that longer laterals improve returns. When comparing our year-to-date results to our 2012 average, we have reduced our per-lateral-foot drill and case costs in the South Cana about 20%. Longer laterals will dominate our development plan in the future.","Second, we've made some significant changes to our well design. Most recently, we have successfully eliminated the intermediate casing in some regions of the play and we've improved our days versus depth throughout. The elimination of the casing string has reduced gross well cost by up to $750,000, specifically in the north.","Third, we've been working to optimize our completions. This work includes our fracture stimulation, fluids, proppants, our volume of water usage in each stage and the distance between our far clusters -- frac clusters in each frac stage. Our learnings in each of these categories is helping to maximize EURs and improve returns.","Lastly, we're capturing data early in this development to better understand proper well spacing for our ultimate field development. We operate a pilot, drilled on a 5-well per-section spacing, and have participated in one additional outside spacing pilot testing tighter spacing. Although we don't have the definite answers yet, we're capturing this critical data early enough to ensure that the proper spacing will be used over majority of the play.","As I mentioned, our most recent wells are noted in today's @NFX. But I wanted to highlight 2 wells in particular. The first is the Brueggen Well. This is a recent well drilled on our North Oil development area. This well had an initial IP of about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross, and its production has performed extremely well over its first 90 days, averaging about 650 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The production is 90% oil and helps extend the commerciality window of our North Oil play.","The second notable well is the Campbell, located in our South Oil play. The well IP did about 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, averaged about 1,100 barrels a day over its first 30 days and the 60- to 90-day averages were identical at 1,200 barrels equivalent per day gross.","As we've said, before, flashy IP rates are not the most important factor. And the benefits of using controlled flowback techniques are evident throughout our well performance. Higher liquid yields are being realized and higher EURs. Keep in mind, our 3-year plan was built using only a subset of the total acreage.","Recent well results validate the quality of our North and South development areas, and we have a large acreage position in the Central area that could provide some significant inventory expansion. In the Central region, there are several outside-operated rigs running. We own interest in many of these wells being drilled and are encouraged by the early results we are seeing. Our Mid-Continent team has done a great job for us, and they are working other high-potential concepts in the region.","Let's move over to the Williston Basin. In short, our production is well ahead of schedule, and both our completed well cost and our field-level lease operating expenses are trending lower. I'll talk about each separately.","The current lease operating expenses in our core development areas in the Williston have decreased about 30% year-over-year to a current run rate of under $5 a barrel of oil equivalent. We have seen a steady reduction in LOE over the last 12 months. This reduction has come through a combination of factors, including reduced service costs, less than 2% production downtime from our wells year-to-date, effective choke management and continued innovations in our artificial lift programs. These positive changes are improving our cash margins.","For the second quarter, our net production in the Williston averaged 11,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day or about 1,300 barrels a day above guidance. Recall that earlier this year, we increased our outlook for 2013 Williston volumes. It's good to be ahead early this year, and we expect our Williston production will maintain its current rate throughout the remainder of the year and grow about 28% over 2012.","In addition, we continue to lower our completed well cost in the Williston. Year-to-date, we are averaging $9.1 million for a 10,000-foot SXL well. Note that this cost includes $900,000 in artificial lifting facilities. This is nearly $2 million less than our 2012 average. During the second quarter, we drilled a best-in-class well, the Johnsrud 2-H. This was a 10,000-foot SXL, drilled to TD in just 18 days for $4.3 million. We've made some significant enhancements to the well designs, including smaller-sized surface casing, modified PVC bits for faster penetration and changes to the bottom hole assembly to reduce runs by 7 to 9 days. Completed well cost was just under $8 million, including facilities and artificial lift. The well is online today and cleaning up after a recent fracture stimulation.","We've talked before about Newfield's core competencies as an organization, and the ability to execute large developments is high on that list. We have proven that we can effectively move plays from initial concept on through field development rapidly. We work to capture our lessons learned and quickly transfer them to the other areas in the company. Our teams throughout the organization are continuing to set the bar higher and higher. Last night's @NFX, we provided details on our most recent wells.","In summary, we have completed 5 new wells in the Bakken during the second quarter. These wells had average initial gross production rates of about 2,200 barrel of oil equivalent per day and about 570 barrel equivalent per day over the first 90 days.","We continue to study the test and test the Three Forks, including its lower benches. During the second quarter, we drilled an additional Three Forks well which had average gross initial production of 1,240 barrels a day and averaged 350 barrels a day over 90 days. In the second quarter, we cored a well all the way through the lowest members of the Three Forks. This provided critical information to help us solve the geologic questions around prospectivity of the lower benches and potential communications with the Middle Bakken. Our geoscientists are studying this data now, and we have recently drilled a well into the second bench of the Three Forks and will complete it early next month.","We are operating a 4-rig program in the Williston today, dominated by multi-well pads and SXL wells. With improving days versus depth, we now expect to drill an additional 5 wells this year in the Williston Basin. For the year, we expect to drill about 40 wells in Middle Bakken and 9 wells in the Three Forks. This increased well count will be additive to our Williston Basin production in 2014.","In the Eagle Ford, we recently completed 6 wells in our West Asherton field with lateral length of about 7,500 feet. The wells are now flowing back. Our net production in the second quarter was ahead of our guidance, coming in at 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day or about 40% over our first quarter average production. In the third quarter, we will be completing 16 Eagle Ford wells and expect to exit the year at more than 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We expect that our Eagle Ford production will grow more than 75% year-over-year in 2013 and more than 50% year-over-year in 2014.","Our drill and completion costs in Eagle Ford are down 18% year-to-date compared to our 2012 average. Our well costs are more than $1.5 million lower than our 2012 average. In the second quarter, our average well cost was $7.5 million. About $500,000 of this decrease is related to drilling and about $1 million is related to optimized completions. We have been experimenting with various proppant sizes, volumes and are making some value-added investments. With the efficiency gains in our drilling program, less days to total depth, we now expect to drill 2 additional wells this year. We expect to drill 36 operated wells in the Eagle Ford this year overall.","Lastly, we continue to advance the volume at Uinta Basin as we pursue high potential, large-scale plays north of Monument Butte in our Central Basin region. In the Central Basin, we recently completed 2 stacked laterals in the Wasatch play. This allowed us to test drainage and constructive interference in 2 wellbores positioned about 350 feet apart vertically. Keep in mind, the Wasatch is an oil-saturated formation that spans about 1,200 feet. We are working to solve a 3-dimensional drainage challenge with the potential to place development wells at various depths throughout the Wasatch.","In addition to the 2 stacked wells, we also drilled a monitoring well and placed surface array nearby to monitor the effectiveness of the fracture simulation realtime. The 2 wells have been online now for about 25 days flowing up CAGR [ph].","We are really managing and controlling the flowback aggressively to maintain pressure gauge data. Over the last 12 -- several days, the wells have reached their highest rates to date at 750 barrels equivalent per day and 920 barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively, and continue to improve. We are really encouraged by what the results that we've seen thus far, and these wells will be half [ph] tubing run and move to artificial lift soon. We are encouraged by this early data. Keep in mind that these are short laterals, only about 3,800 feet. We will spud our first SXL well in the Wasatch later this year.","In Uteland Butte, we are, today, completing our first SXL well, 9,900-foot lateral. Simultaneously, we are drilling our second SXL well. We are looking forward to seeing the production routes -- results from these SXL wells and are planning to drill 4 to 5 Uteland Butte SXL wells in the second half of 2013.","As we have mentioned, under current regulatory rules, our laterals are confined to about 3,800 feet. The economics of the short lateral programs simply are insufficient to compete for capital in the long term. In the second quarter, we completed 4 additional Uteland Butte horizontals, averaging about 3,800 feet in lateral length. We continue to experiment with completion techniques in the play, and we have about 30 days of gross production on these 3 wells and they've averaged about 650 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our average net production in Uinta Basin in the second quarter was 22,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day or about 500 barrels a day above our guidance.","During the quarter, we were able to continue railing oil to the East Coast. We railed more than 250,000 barrels in the quarter, which allowed us to effectively manage the refinery turnarounds in the Salt Lake City market. These turnarounds are associated with the expansion of refining capacity for our future volumes. We remain confident that our net sales will increase to more than 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third and fourth quarters as new refining capacity becomes available.","Our Uinta Basin production is expected to grow about 10% in 2013, and we have the refining capacity in hand today to execute our 3-year plan, but we continue to explore other options to move crude out of the basin. Finding new markets could provide competition for our crude and better price differentials and support our future growth plan.","That's a detailed summary of the results year-to-date. We are executing very well, making our numbers and driving both growth and improved returns throughout our portfolio.","I'll turn the call back to Lee for closing comments.","Lee K. Boothby","Thanks, Gary, and thanks to all of you for your investment in Newfield. As Gary said, we are executing very well in 2013 and are on our way to fulfilling our vision to be recognized as a premier independent E&P company. We know what is required to achieve this vision, and we are committed to delivering on our targets. We're building momentum today throughout the core focus areas, and the growth in our domestic liquids plays will quickly offset the planned sale of our international businesses. I'm excited about where we sit today and look forward to our very bright future.","Operator, I'll turn it over to you and assemble questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll first hear from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A quick question here. Just any update on the expected timing on the international asset sale?","Lee K. Boothby","So we're on schedule. We've said consistently we expect that the bid process will play out over the course of the summer and maybe go into early fall. And we hope to have the transactions completed before year end.","Rudolf A. Hokanson - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. You say completed, I guess, meaning proceeds in hand or just deals that you've announced at that time?","Lee K. Boothby","We hope to have paperwork in hand before year end.","Rudolf A. Hokanson - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. I guess on the Uinta, obviously, you talked about railing some barrels this quarter. Just trying to get a sense, just kind of how that worked out for you guys. Were you guys able to realize any pricing benefit during the second quarter, and do you have plans to continue that program later this year?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. We had not anticipated to see any of our pricing benefit early on. This early phase of our program was really meant to explore how it was going to go logistically and how the refiner was going to be able to run the crew. That's gone very well. The logistics have worked out quite well. It's going to be on an interim basis through the back half of the year. As I mentioned, the sort of [ph] turnaround required us to move the barrels that we did in the first half of the year. I suspect we'll be significantly down in the second half of the year as the additional capacity of the refiners comes on.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, looking at the CapEx increase or, I guess, relative increase to the high end of your previous guidance, looks like a decent portion of that's allocated to international. Is that something that you expect to be recaptured as part of the sales process, or is it de facto recaptured as sort of a cost-plus issue?","Gary D. Packer","I think there is certainly part of it is international, and we would expect those to be captured back. But I would say that quite a bit of the increase that we're talking about, on a relative basis to the high end of guidance, really comes from the pace in which we're drilling the wells domestically. I think I mentioned, in several of the areas, we're actually drilling -- I think a net number somewhere between 5 to 7 net incremental wells that we had not anticipated drilling early in the year, and this is just keeping these rigs lines open. As I also mentioned, we've added rig count relative to our expectations in the Cana. The results we've seen year-to-date are certainly compelling, and we wanted to make sure we had operational momentum as we're heading into 2014. So we elected to add a couple of rigs there. Because of them being a fourth quarter add, you're not seeing the production volumes in 2013. Those will be moved into 2014, where you would expect to see an increase.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great, appreciate that clarification. And then one just on the Brueggen and Campbell wells. With their stronger 60- and 90-day rates that you guys highlighted versus the 30-day rate, can you talk a little bit more about what's driving that, where they may be put on pump? Or you mentioned that it was how you're flowing them back, but any kind of additional color there would be helpful.","Lee K. Boothby","Well, Dave, I'll go ahead and jump in there, and if anybody's got anything to add, they can. I think that -- remember, we're early in the play, relatively. We're evaluating options in the oil window. Certainly, we've done a number of things in terms of pollution [ph] optimization. They seem to be bearing fruit. I think the most notable was a reduction in cluster spacing down to around 75 feet. I think we're very, very encouraged by the results. As Gary has mentioned in the call, we've got some more work to do in the back half of the year, but I would say the early returns and early tale of the tape look very, very positive. But with respect to any of the areas, any of our key areas where we see higher second month and third month production, remember, we're using controlled flowback, managing drawdowns at the reservoir phase. We believe that leads to improved overall performance, higher returns and higher EUR. So our operating teams in each of our key areas are utilizing those techniques today, and we seem to be getting repeatable results across the portfolio.","Gary D. Packer","Dave, I'd look at the @NFX. There's a graphic in there that represents some of those in performance relative to our type curve. It's pretty compelling.","Operator","And we'll move on to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the Williston, you made reference in the @NFX to testing the lower benches. Can you talk about how active you're planning to be there across your Williston acreage? And any initial color from your core analysis?","Gary D. Packer","Well, the future activity is going to be pending the results of the well that we'll be completing shortly. So it's a bit premature, and we'll act accordingly. I suspect, based on the core that we've seen, we have seen saturations in some of the lower benches. Specifically, the second bench looked pretty interesting, hence, the targeting of it in this well. We expect that to be pretty consistent across the Nesson and that portion of our acreage position. We'd be a little bit more careful with that as you start moving off the Nesson in some of the more flanked positions. But it's still early, and we'll have to do some more work to verify that.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then as my follow-up, as you move towards becoming a U.S.-only company, can you talk about the capital spend that we should expect relative to what I think is a $1.5 billion budget this year in the U.S. and how you think about balancing CapEx and cash flow once you have a stronger balance sheet and in the context of the strong well results you've seen in your key plays?","Lee K. Boothby","Brian, I'll take the lead off, and then Gary can add some operating color to the back end. I think that if you go to the 3-year plan and look at the domestic only, our CapEx range in the plan was $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion over that 3-year period. So as you know, average is around $1.5 billion a year. A lot of these improvements and growth that you see in the '14 and '15 are payoffs from forecast learning curve benefits that we're seeing the early returns of today. So it gives you very -- it gives us very high confidence relative to what we're seeing and how that translates to '14 and '15. On a go-forward basis, I would say the only guidance we have out is that $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion range. I think that's a good place to anchor yourselves. When we talked about the 3-year plan, we noted that our objectives is, as quickly as possible, to get back to a point where our cash flow from operations and CapEx come back into balance. Notionally, we start seeing that visibility in the 2015 timeframe on the earlier forecast on the plan. So we'll continue to monitor that. And obviously, as we move through the balance of this year and reset and restack our plan for capital allocations between the high-return areas in the portfolio, we'll update you later this year going into next year.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Amir Arif with Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Quick question on the '14 production guidance. The -- you didn't change the guidance even though you're adding some additional rigs and CapEx in the Cana. Can you just give us some color on that? Is it just conservatism at this point?","Gary D. Packer","Well, I know that it's conservatism. I've -- it's certainly possible that the impact's not fully baked into that. What we're also dealing with, and always, in each of these plays, is the timing of these pads. As we have pads enter the year, that certainly could cause a ripple effect through 2014. It would be our expectation that volumes would be up. Now there's another thing to keep an eye on there, and that is the actual well mix. We are always reallocating our capital, whether it be to the South or the North Oil play. So we could be moving, and I believe this is part of the case of what you're seeing there is activity moving to the North Oil. We could have a higher representation of oil. So in a barrel-of-oil-equivalent basis, you could see the volumes moderate, the cash flows would be up.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just a follow-up on the domestic gas production outlook for next year. The lack of declines, is that simply the solution gas from all your core plays?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, we've gotten to the point -- we talked for the most of the last couple of years, as we worked through the transition, that we were going to accept decline in our dry gas assets and growth in the oil assets would ultimately offset the decline. So we're at a point now where you're starting to see that playing out in the second half of 2013, and our 3-year plan predicted that. And I think you'll see the continued trend line '14, '15, where we will have offset that decline on the based -- base gas assets.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And that's from byproduct gas?","Lee K. Boothby","Yes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll hear from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","With respect to the Bakken, you're forecasting relatively flat volumes. Is this the case of the RORs aren't as appealing as the Eagle Ford, the Cana or the Uintas, or is it a case of basin evacuation in terms of getting them -- the oil out?","Gary D. Packer","No, it has nothing to do with that. It's just purely the timing of the completions that we have in the back half of the year, John. We can -- we get all the crude out that we need to. And as far as returns go, it competes very favorably to the rest that we have in the program. And the fact of the matter is we're maintaining our rig count at 4 rigs. And until we materially change that, it's going to be difficult to grow the volumes more than that.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Next one for me is on the Cana cost reductions. You said you dropped completed well costs by about 20%. How much was the drop of the intermediate casing in terms of the total cost, or could you be more specific on what the cost reductions were on a percentage basis?","Gary D. Packer","First of all, on the -- certainly, the $750,000 that I reflected on was just in the North area. So that's very isolated. I would say that the bulk of the cost reductions are just improved learning curves throughout all aspects of the program. The actual completion costs themselves could actually be up as we look to bring down 75 -- down to 75-foot clusters. That certainly is going to be an incremental CapEx on the completion side, somewhere between $0.5 million and $1 million on that aspect of it. So we probably have a lot of moving parts there. I'd have to get Steve to -- I can give him the relative breakouts for you on a percentage basis, but I think it's just the learning curve overall.","Lee K. Boothby","There's an interesting graph in @NFX that documents the gains on the drilling efficiency side as we've extended lateral lines and then captured some of those lines [ph]. I think it'll cover most of that. And then obviously, the adder is the completion cost. But I think it'll give you the pathway that we're on.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you speak to the inventory count of drillable locations at North and South Cana and maybe the weighting of oil versus NGLs versus natural gas and the production mix between the 2 areas? And then the second part to that question, that subject, how does the inventory count change with tighter spacing should it prove successful?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, on the location count, Dan, obviously, pretty detailed information that we put out earlier this year when we announced the 3-year plan, I would say that, in general, obviously, the results we're seeing are net-net positive on expansion of the acreage areas. We're seeing good drilling results, both for the operated programs, as well as some of the outside-operated programs. So I think success there, ultimately, will expand the visibility. Obviously, your question about decreased spacing, the short answer there, that's going to increase location count. So we'll continue to work the spacing angle in our various areas. You can expect an update later this year terms of the portfolio and progress and how all that plays out going into next year. But I'd say, all signs are pretty positive right now.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And as a second question here, sticking with the Cana Woodford. The Central region, when will we know more about the resource potential and maybe have a glimpse at field-level returns? And can you handicap the success rate today?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, we've talked a fair amount over the course of this year that as far as the Central portion of our acreage in Cana, we're not operating a lot of -- we're not operating Newfield rigs there at present because we're focused on the northern and southern portions of our acreage. But we are participating in multiple wells operated by others. Last count, I think there were 5 wells going that we have working interest in, in the Central area. We're very encouraged with what we're seeing. Our peers, competitors, I guess, if you will, and partners in the play are posting in terms of results. And net-net, that's positive. That acreage was part of the 77,500 or so acres that we put in that portfolio allocation earlier this year as yet to be determined, i.e., they needed additional drilling before we were willing to consider them development-type activity, but very encouraged by the early results in that Central area.","Gary D. Packer","I -- the only thing I'd add to that, Dan, is that I would expect 2014, we would start to see more Newfield activity there. We're going to have to say grace over some -- the land there. And based on the returns that we're seeing right now being more favorable, it would be certainly something that would compete better.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Lee Boothby for any additional or closing remarks.","Lee K. Boothby","Well, again, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us early this morning. We appreciate your investment in Newfield and look forward to updating you on our continued progress as the year plays out. Thank you.","Operator","And that will conclude today's call.

And before we get started, one housekeeping matter.","Our discussion with you today will contain forward-looking statements such as strategic initiatives and plans, estimated production and timing, drilling and development plans, expected cost reductions and planned capital expenditures. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, they are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks.

[Operator Instructions] Mr. Lee Boothby, please go ahead, sir.","Lee K. Boothby","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Newfield's Midyear Conference Call. I'm looking forward to providing you with today's update.","Our transformation period is clearly behind us, and there are great things happening throughout our company today. We're seeing tangible benefits from our efforts over the last several years to focus our company on domestic U.S. operations, high-grade our asset base and strengthen our balance sheet.","We announced yesterday we entered into a contract to sell our Granite Wash assets for $588 million. We expect the deal to close in the third quarter, and we intend to use the proceeds of the sale for reduction of long-term debt.","Execution over the last 2 years has been very strong. We're meeting or beating our estimates and delivering strategic objectives outlined in our 3-year plan. We're confident that this plan will continue to create value for our stockholders.","We're delivering growth across our refined portfolio today, and we're delivering results. Our second quarter oil production averaged 50,000 barrels of oil per day and has increased 32% year-over-year. Each of our 4 focus areas is exceeding our beginning-of-year expectations.","Two weeks ago, we raised our 2014 guidance and raised the midpoint of our oil forecast above the upper end of our original guidance for the year. Our oil production is now expected to grow 30%, up from 24% in our original plan. This momentum is expected to carry forward to 2015 and 2016, and our production and cash flow forecasts are biased higher.","Consistent with our normal process, we will conduct our annual strategic planning in the fall and communicate our 2015\/2016 outlook by early 2015. Changes we expect to make will be accretive to our current outlook, more balanced oil growth, cash flow growth and our desire to continue strengthening our balance sheet over our 3-year outlook.","We've also added significant inventory to our portfolio by capturing liquids-rich resource plays of scale. The Anadarko Basin, the SCOOP and STACK plays provide more than a decade of running room, and today's update in the Uinta Basin demonstrates the economic potential for another large-scale oil play for future development within Newfield's portfolio.","Our 3-year plan places us on the right course and strategically combines liquids growth -- or cash flow growth and yields-improving margins. We're on a path towards balancing our annual investments with cash flow. We continue our track record of strong, double-digit liquids growth rates.","Our focus today remains on the execution of our 3-year plan. We're not just managing our business for a good quarter or a single year. We're managing Newfield to be a healthier and sustainable enterprise for the long term.","Our vision remains clear: to be the premier E&P company consistently delivering top-tier results. Achieving this status isn't easy, and it doesn't happen overnight. We feel obligated to do more than simply find and produce oil and gas for a profit. Consistent with this belief, we published our first corporate responsibility report last week detailing our safety culture, our environmental stewardship and the hard work that our people do every day to improve life in and around the areas where we live and work. I would encourage you to go online and give it a read.","I'm joined in today's call by our CFO, Larry Massaro and our Chief Operating Officer, Gary Packer. Our remarks today will be largely focused on the significant progress we had made in the Uinta Basin. We posted some slides on our @NFX publication, and we will reference a couple of these later in the call.","Our agenda today consists of the following: first, our CFO, Larry Massaro, will provide a brief summary of our second quarter financial and operating results; and second, Gary Packer will cover our operating areas, beginning with an overview of our Anadarko Basin and Williston Basin drilling programs and spending the remainder of our time on the Uinta Basin and the results of our recent SXL campaign.","Before I turn the call over to Larry, let me mention why I see today's Uinta Basin update as very significant for our investors. Over the last several years, we've been tackling multiple challenges in the Uinta. These have ranged from a lack of refining capacity, market disruptions, HBP acreage efforts and the inability to drill longer lateral wells due to the pre-existing regulations. Today, you will hear about the significant progress we have made to improve our returns and propel our Uinta Basin assets to compete at the front end of Newfield's portfolio.","For the first time, we now have a sample of long lateral wells, or SXLs, approximately 10,000 feet, to improve the significant productivity of the resource and give visibility to the true economic potential in the Uinta. Seeing 2,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day IP rates and 100,000 barrels of production over the first 100 days is exciting, and these results will compete with any oil resource play today.","Second, we're applying our lessons learned around our company to lower well cost. Drilling and optimizing completions are core competencies at Newfield. We've demonstrated time and again that we can lower well costs and improve returns at our field-level operating teams. Newfield's focused portfolio is more alike than different today. Our Central Basin wells look similar to our wells in the Anadarko Basin or the Williston or the Eagle Ford for exploiting stacked pays through SXL wells in areas that offer multiple horizons for development. We are confident in our ability to lower cost, improve returns and deliver another high-return oil play with a deep inventory of development locations. I'll leave some stuff that for Gary to cover later, and I'll now turn the call over to Larry for our financial update.","Lawrence S. Massaro","Thanks, Lee. And good morning, everyone. Along with our guidance raise 2 weeks ago, we also increased our capital investment outlook for 2014 by $100 million to $1.7 billion. This increase reflects the increased pace of our drilling in several areas and the addition of new acreage in SCOOP and STACK.","In the second quarter, we invested $473 million in our domestic businesses. The second quarter production was 12.1 million barrels, surpassing the midpoint of guidance by 1.1 million barrels.","Our domestic liquids production was up 13% over the prior quarter and 40% over the comparable quarter in 2013. Our oil growth is driven's by the Anadarko Basin, the Uinta Basin and the Williston Basin.","Our strong production growth led to a cash flow beat during the quarter, and our cash flow per share exceeded First Call consensus and came in at $2.43 per share. Our earnings during the quarter, excluding the items listed in our release related to derivates in future periods, were $59 million, or $0.43 per share.","As we noted 2 weeks ago, our G&A expense was about $15 million higher than guidance due to stock-based compensation, which was driven by the increase in our share price during the quarter. Other than G&A, our cash costs on a unit-of-production basis were in line or better than our quarterly guidance estimates.","China, our discontinued operation, provided about 40,000 barrels during the quarter. You may notice that our full year expectation for LOE is up. This is related to higher transportation expense and reflects our new processing agreements and our growing wet gas volumes.","On a unit-of-production basis, we will be virtually unchanged throughout the year. The slight increase in the second half LOE should be offset by higher realized prices for our sales volumes.","As Lee mentioned, we signed an agreement Monday to sell our Granite Wash assets. The effective date of this transaction will be July 1, 2014. Current production from these assets is approximately 65 million cubic feet per day equivalent, of which about 60% is natural gas. Year-end 2013 net reserves were approximately 38 million barrels of oil equivalent. The transaction is expected to close in September, and we intend to use the proceeds to call and retire our $600 million of senior subordinated notes due in 2018. This will reduce our long-term debt to under $2.6 billion and lowers our debt-to-EBITDA by approximately $2 billion to $1.5 billion. As I articulated before, we believe that managing growth and balance sheet strength need to go hand-in-hand.","We will adjust our full year production estimates for the sale of our Granite Wash assets at closing, which is expected toward the end of the third quarter.","Let me quickly update you on the sales process for our China business. We've completed our underwater repairs to the jacket and are finalizing above-water repairs today. We recently loaded our topside facilities on the installation barge, and our plan is to find a suitable weather window to install the topside over the next month. This will keep us on schedule for first oil production in the fourth quarter and 40,000 barrels a day of gross well from Pearl in late 2014 or early 2015.","We continue to work with our bid group on the planned sale of our China business and anticipate a resolution later this year. We will keep you informed as more information is known.","I'll turn it over to Gary now for operations update. Gary?","Gary D. Packer","Thanks, Larry. I'll start today in the Anadarko Basin. SCOOP and STACK are very active today with over 40 rigs running. The wells continued to perform extremely well. We are seeing improvements in drilling costs. We are now in full development in SCOOP South at optimal well spacing. We now have about 85,000 net acres in SCOOP following the recent acreage additions.","Our production in the Anadarko Basin is more than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up more than 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over our first year average. With strong performance and execution, we were able to make up our first quarter volume shortfall that resulted from infrastructure constraints, and our 2014 growth forecasts are also increased.","SCOOP South, our wells continued to perform above play average type curves. In @NFX, we updated the SCOOP Wet Gas results to reflect a new 5-well Yandell development plan. These were XL wells with impressive production performance. These wells had 30-day average production of nearly 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 730 barrels of oil equivalent per day after 90 days, and these wells had an average oil cut of 41% over their first 90 days. In addition, we updated 30-, 60- and 90-day production averages for our SCOOP Wet Gas SXLs. These wells are still averaging 1,550 barrels of oil equivalent per day after 90 days.","Activity levels are increasing in North SCOOP, which constitutes nearly half of our total SCOOP acreage. We are drilling our first operated wells in north SCOOP today and own interest in about a dozen other outside-operated wells recently drilled in the area. There are now 10 rigs running in north SCOOP, of which 2 are Newfield operated. We are encouraged with the results seen to date and look forward to sharing our operated results with you later this year. We are on track to exceed our original production expectations for the year and are working closely with our midstream service provider to ensure the timely completion of planned gas compression updates throughout the balance of this year.","Let's move on to STACK, where our efforts are focused on a few key objectives. First, drilling wells to hold acreage by production. We're planning to drill about 200 SXL wells over the next several years to hold our position. Second, we are testing multiple geologic objectives, including Upper and Lower Meramec and the Woodford. These assessment efforts were balanced with our need to control acreage. Third, we are gathering valuable information on well spacing that will help us design the most efficient and profitable future development plan for this area. We updated our well performance against the type curves for STACK in today's @NFX.","Longer term well performance on 7 wells in the 200 to 300-day time period, you can see an uplift in projected performance and actual performance. We have several new wells that are completing or recently completed, and moving toward 30 days of production and expect to have an update for you later this fall. We remain very encouraged with our oil production rates and how our gas-oil ratio is holding up over an extended period of time. This studies a subset of more than 3,000 wells drilled in the area, and our estimates for commodity split in our EURs appear to be very sound.","We are also seeing efficiency gains in drilling and completions. We now project that we will drill 6 additional STACK wells in 2014, continuing to de-risk our play. Increased well count is due to the efficiency improvements and refinement of our drilling programs. As I previously mentioned, we expect to have about half a dozen new STACK wells with 60- and 90-day rates in the third quarter, and look forward to updating you then.","On to the Williston Basin, and let me make a couple of quick remarks before jumping into the Uinta. The Williston team has done a fantastic job continuing to lower well cost and executing in this high-return development play. Year-to-date, our 10,000-foot SXLs were drilled and completed for an average of $7.9 million, including facilities. This is down another $600,000 from our update in the first quarter. Due to the drilling efficiencies and reduced time from rig release to first sales, we expect to add another 8 wells into this year's capital program. The second quarter production averaged more than 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are on track to grow our Williston production about 40% this year.","I will focus the remainder of today's call on the Uinta Basin. Year-to-date, our production in the Uinta Basin is running ahead of forecast, primarily due to the improved production profile from our SXL wells in the Central Basin. Our second quarter net Uinta production averaged 26,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Let me provide a summary of key points today to help you understand why we are encouraged, and how we intend to advance our learning curve to make these plays large-scale economic developments. First, the Uinta Basin offers us significant resource and a deep inventory of oil projects. Furthermore, we control it with high working interest and great access to service providers.","You hear us frequently refer to the Uinta Basin as a foundational asset. The backbone of this asset is the giant Monument Butte waterflood, but today's excitement is centered on the Central Basin and the recent results in our Uteland Butte and Wasatch horizontal plays.","Second, we are very encouraged by the recent production performance from our SXLs in the Central Basin. In today's @NFX, you will find a summary of these results plotted against our type curves. We are seeing strong early results over the 30-, 60- and 90-day periods.","The third point is well documented through our actions. We are committed to allocating our capital to the highest returns in our portfolio. Our results today in the Uinta Basin demonstrate that these new plays will compete for future capital. Our current SXLs are delivering returns of about 30% today. We are actively advancing our learning curves to further improve profitability as we transition these plays to development.","Fourth, we feel as a proven operator in the Uinta Basin -- we've been in the basin since 2004, and over the last decade have established a great track record in operating safely, creating drilling and operational efficiencies and being a partner of choice with land owners and federal agencies and the Ute Tribe.","And lastly, Uinta crude is a valuable feedstock with refining markets expanding in the Salt Lake City area as well as other new markets. In addition, recent new entrants are helping expedite rail transport, and we believe that increasing competition for this oil will help improve our future realized prices.","A cross-section of the Uinta Basin can be found on Slide 7 in @NFX. This places our Green River formation in context with our deeper horizontal plays in the North and the Central Basin. We are today targeting the geopressured section in the Uteland Butte and the Wasatch. This constitutes more than 1,400 feet of hydrocarbon column. Yesterday, we released results from our new SXL wells and plotted them against our previously published type curves.","On Slide 9, we detail our SXL program in the Central Basin. Our recent 5 SXL wells had an average gross IP rate of about 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day and support our previously generated type-curve estimates. We have plotted our recent wells against the type curves on pages 10 and 11. Our well performance has been strong, as seen on the 30-, 60- and 90-day rates.","There's always a lot of interest in type curve performance, so let me address this now. In both the Uteland butte and the Wasatch, we generated these projections over a year ago based on our early short XL well results. In both cases, we used a 2x scaling factor on those range of outcomes to project impact to the longer SXL wells. It appears that this has been sound, and we are very encouraged with the early results, which generated 30% returns at early assessment well costs and are on a path for meaningful improvement.","Recall that these geopressured reservoirs -- that these are geopressured reservoirs and, therefore, do not require gas lift for well over 120 days. Also, remember we practice controlled flowback more consistently today than when the early SXLs that we used to develop our projections were produced.","On Page 13, we detail how our recent SXL wells in the Central Basin stack up against other high-potential developments in Newfield's portfolio. As you can see, on a 90-day cumulative production basis or on a revenue basis, our SXL wells in the Uinta Basin compare very favorably to SCOOP, our highest return play, and surpass other well-known plays like the Williston Basin. We are making critical advancements in 2 areas: increasing the productive capacity of our wells through longer laterals and improved completion and, therefore, lowering finding and development costs to improve returns.","Today, we have seen improvement in our Uteland Butte play. As you can see on Page 12, the time from spud to rig release has consistently decreased from 45 days to our recent best-in-class well of 31 days. Costs on these recent wells are projected to be about $11.2 million, and this is in line with our previous development range of $10.12 million for development in Uteland Butte. From a return perspective, we estimate that an 800,000-barrel Uteland Butte well, drilled for less than $11 million will generate a rate of return of more than 45%. As Lee said, this play can and will compete in our portfolio.","In the Wasatch, we have a more limited data set today to discuss with you but equally as exciting. We plan to drill some additional wells through the balance of this year, and we will use this information to determine our best path forward. Production results from the Wasatch have equally been very strong. However, our well costs still remain at the high end of our $13 million to $15 million development forecast. The resource provides ample encouragement to advance this program, and we intend to apply the Uteland Butte learnings to the Wasatch and we'll keep you updated on our progress.","I'll turn this back to Lee for his closing comments.","Lee K. Boothby","Thanks, Gary. Thanks to all of you for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest in our company. You can tell from today's update that we are highly encouraged with our progress year-to-date. As I said in my earlier remarks, I'm extremely encouraged with our progress in the Central Basin and its position within our portfolio. The results of our SXL wells are very strong and demonstrate the economic potential of the Uinta Basin. Our Central Basin plays will add another large-scale oil play with decades of drilling inventory.","We're confident in our operating teams, and we'll look to them to advance learnings curves to lower fining and development costs and improve our profitability and returns. And we'll continue to share our progress as -- with you as we go.","In closing, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our 3-year plan. This plan combines liquids growth, cash flow growth and improving margins and profitability. Our transaction today to sell the Granite Wash goes a long way to improving the balance sheet and demonstrates our dedication to constantly high-grading our asset portfolio.","At this time, we're happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Joe Allman with JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just on the super extended laterals. The Wasatch, it appears to be performing on its -- it's just a few data points. They're not necessarily a good statistical sampling, but the Wasatch is underperforming the Uteland Butte. Any geological reasons why that -- why you might predict that to hold true going forward?","Lee K. Boothby","I would actually say, Joe, that I don't see it as underperforming. I think the reference that you're making is when you look at Slide 10 that Gary talked about, the Uteland Butte, the 2 wells are shown quite above the top end of the range that we published back in December, in terms of talking about our expectations from the play as we moved into drilling SXLs. Including outperforming the type curves. When you look closely at the Wasatch data, you'll find out that the well on the bottom down there is tracking the 800,000 BOE curve. That's the low end of the range for the Wasatch. And the green well is tracking along the upper end of the range. So when you put it all together, the SXL wells in this data set are delivering an outcome in excess of 800,000 BOE per well, and they've got incredibly strong early production, which drives returns. So I think that watching the type curves and looking at them, well, you made a good point. Early on, with a few data points, you're going to see some noise. But trust me, we're very, very encouraged with what we see here, and there's a lot of data behind this. And it reminds me a lot of the early discussions on STACK when we had to lay down on the type curve there. Now we haven't laid down on our type curve that we've forecast. That tells us that our technical teams are getting it right. So we're excited.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I mean, clearly -- you have clearly great wells. And so do you expect any differences between the 2? Or at this point now you, geologically, you expect them to perform about the same?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I mean, they're a little bit different geologically. I mean, we'd probably give you some color later this year or early next year when we update the portfolio. But as far as production performance, they're both in the same geopressured window, and we've seen incredibly high productivity rates out of the wells. So we'll probably see some well-to-well variability as we continue to drill across the acreage. But if you look at the map in the handout, I think the area that Gary and the teams have tested are probably some 14, 15 miles east-west and 5, 6 miles north-south. So we've got a pretty big area that we've got this data set developing in now, and it's a 1,400-foot section. So Gary's comment on the Wasatch, we've got more to do there because there's 1,200 feet of Wasatch section. We have more data in the Uteland Butte as we drilled most of the early wells there to drive the learning curve. So we're just farther along in the Uteland Butte, but I expect both of them to be competitive.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Singer at Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","How should we think about the Central Basin's success in the context of capital spending and production growth from the Uinta? In other words, should we expect that you will spend less money than you planned and still meet your guidance? Spend the same amount of money and produce at higher levels? Spend more money and spend -- and produce at much higher levels? Or just you've got a greater inventory where you can maintain a rate of growth for a longer period of time?","Lee K. Boothby","I think, Brian, the way I would look at it in the short term, I think we've ended it. Over the course of the last couple of years, clearly the productivity that we're seeing out of these wells allows us to drive better production with lower capital input. So that's the capital efficiency that Gary talked about. So in the short term, that's a great option inside of the portfolio. When you look at the broader context of what's going on in the Uinta Basin and the positives in terms of 20 -- positives in terms of the entrants into the basin and driving volumes out of the basin on rail, you're seeing some competitive movement there that we think is going to translate to improved margins. So that will help with the returns. At that point, as we go through the planning process later this year or early next year, we're going to give a hard look to what's the optimal capital allocation into the Uinta Basin, how we're competing, where are we on the learning curves. I think, as Gary told you, the first half dozen wells generating 30-plus percent rates of return sounds a lot like the STACK story that we told a year ago. So we're very excited. I think this is a material, positive improvement and it's going to provide other options. As competition for the crude grows inside and outside the basin and people become cognizant of the magnitude of this resource -- which, in Newfield's 230,000-acre footprint, we've got over 1 billion barrels net to Newfield recoverable resource, exciting stuff. So when you start thinking about that translating, I think out beyond the 2015\/2016 time frame, we're probably look to drive incremental growth out of the Uinta.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And it sounds like, based on your comments on the refinery expansion, say, on the rail, that you've got confidence that, that's coming. Is there a specific time where it all kind of -- where you reach critical mass from a takeaway perspective? Or is it just incremental per year?","Lee K. Boothby","I'll let Larry and Gary give you some color because they're both involved.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, as far as -- I mean, we'll see a significant ramp-up in the HollyFrontier refining capacity starting in late 2015, and that will continue through 2016. We've layered in a third contract in there, and that's bringing our volumes up to 41,000 and -- I think a little over 41,000 barrels a day or so. But I'm excited about, and I think Lee alluded to it earlier, with the increased use of rail coming out of the basin I think that's really a game changer for us. And as we see these results and returns continually to improve, I think there's going to be opportunities for us to reach beyond that and access some of that rail market and really drive some incremental volumes.","Operator","We'll go next to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to get a little bit more color in terms of the Uinta. You talked about how you guys were targeting the geopressured zones in the Uteland Butte as well as the Wasatch. I'm just curious, is this formation -- are these 2 formations pretty much geopressured across the whole Central Basin? And how do you guys think about prospectivity for these formations? You talked about an area that was, I guess, roughly 15 by 6 miles or whatever. But do you think potentially this extends kind of well beyond that? Maybe talk to how you get to that 1 billion BOE of kind of recoverables.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, really, it was reference to the Uinta Basin, and that will be more fairly -- fully updated later in the year. How you should think about the geopressured section is we have about 70,000 acres in that area that's defined in the @NFX, and that entire area is geopressured. Others have pursued the Uteland Butte elsewhere, but that was in the normally pressured section quite a ways to the west. So you ought to think about that entire section as being defined as that geopressured window, which runs about 0.75 psi per foot. And that really explains some of that early strong productivity you see in the type curves.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. And I guess just jumping over to some of the asset sales. Obviously, you guys have sold the Granite Wash. You're working on China. And now that with Granite Wash, how should we think about use of proceeds for a China sale here? It certainly seems as though you guys have a lot of capital coming in the door here in the next year.","Lawrence S. Massaro","Yes, so China has been earmarked to cover the deficit that we have going into next year. And so once we get China resolved, you'll see us pay down the debts that they were now building. And so that was always the plan for it, and we'll be consistent with that.","Operator","We'll go next to Gil Yang with DISCERN.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Great results in the Uinta. I guess the increase in the HollyFrontier refining capacity sort of explains the pickup in the volumes you anticipate in 2016. But given the results of improved market leave recently with the recent well results and that, that transportation was sort of -- agreement was sort of set up a couple of years ago, if I recall, you must be pretty aggressively looking for the ability to expand. So how do you sort of see your eagerness to expand that capacity? As well as, how do you expect capital spending to ramp up in that region to meet that increased commitment?","Gary D. Packer","Well, clearly, the capacity is going to be out there for us. At the end of the day, it all comes down to the capital allocation. That's really going to be part of our -- the planning process that we previously mentioned in 2015 and 2016, although we've already confirmed through our own behaviors last year in moving to 300 barrels out and what we believe is a substantial volume leaving the basin today via rail that the market exists. So that's not something we need to explore. And we think it ought to ultimately, over the long term, capture a higher commodity pricing. So while we're quite interested in that, again it comes back to a capital allocation decision. And we're going to just invest in those returns that are the highest within the portfolio.","Lee K. Boothby","And Gil, I'll pick up on your reference to a couple of years ago. You're correct, those refining agreements were virtually signed late '11, early '12, and it was 20,000 barrels a day of incremental capacity in Salt Lake City. And what we said at that time we signed those agreements, they allow us to underpin our forward planning, to prove the resource, drive down the learning curve and get this resource recognized to where it could compete against other crudes. So I think we're well along that path. I think the fact that we signed all of that capacity up. Part 2 of that was other industry players, as they start talking about growth, needed to pursue other alternatives. And we're very careful to say that we had all we needed at least through 2015 and 2016, and they've come in, the other entrants, and they're driving the market and driving the rail. So I think you're seeing all the pieces come together now. We're really happy to have the new entrants. I think they're adding to the vitality in the basin. And these well results, this is a 3-year odyssey getting to this point. So we're very, very excited. And I can assure you, to Gary's point, these projects competing at the front end of the line, they're going to draw capital.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Rowe with TPH.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, just on -- sort of shifting gears to Anadarko Basin here. As you get more production history for the STACK on the 11 operated wells you've got, do you feel like it's outperforming your initial expectations in terms of oil cuts? I think you touched earlier about the GOR staying relatively flat kind of over time. So can you just kind of help us think about how GOR will change throughout the life of the well based on what you know today and how that kind of fits into your 40% oil cut that you have for the life of the well in your type curve?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, Michael. I mean, the wells are performing as we originally had predicted. And as far as the GOR, I mean, I think one of the keys to how the wells are continuing to hang in there is, in fact, that we've seen good stability in the GORs over time. As I alluded in my prepared comments, the wells that we've -- we have identified all the wells that have produced from that Meramac STACK section, across that entire area. And when you actually look at the GOR performance on those wells, they come out -- and even as far as 10 and 15 years out in the future, they're still producing at 6,000 and 8,000 GOR. So this is -- while many have had concerns that a lot of these oil reservoirs will come out and produce -- kind of blow down and produce basically dead oil, that's not what the data has kind of supported. And this is over -- the data we have actually looks out as far as 10 and 15 years. And I think that some of the key to the strong production we're seeing and how -- the flattening of the curve that you see out there.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes, and I would say, just to add into the other part -- I think Part 2 of your question, which I was buried up in the early part of the question, performance. The STACK play has been in line with our expectations, in line with the published type curves. So we're very excited about what we're seeing, and the fact that we're now looking at data that's 2-plus years long on horizontal wells to go with the 15-plus years that Gary was talking about in the vertical wells, it looks like everything is holding together very, very well.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. I appreciate the color on that. And then just one last question would be, can you talk about the uplift that you're seeing from a reduced cluster spacing and any upsized profit? And kind of what you're -- what any plans you have on that front are going forward to kind of tweak the design on the completion?","Gary D. Packer","Specifically, you're talking about STACK, I take it, Michael?","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That's correct.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, it's something that we're always continuing to tweak. I think we upsized our completions there. There's been a lot of discussion we've seen in the basin from comments from some of the other operators that we've seen out there that have suggested that the upside completions are appropriate. And those other operators are basically stimulating their plants with completion practices very similar to what we've adopted. We got down as tight as some of the more recent wells, so a 50-foot cluster spacing, and we've seen good response from that. I don't know where it will ultimately shake out. At this early stage we'll continue to watch that. But one of the things that I think is important, just to see that we're getting this right, is when you see those -- as we add in those 60- and 90-day numbers out in the future, you're seeing the actuals actually slide up high relative to the type curve and get continually flatter. And I think that's an important mark, the tighter spacing. And I think where you -- we have anywhere between 32 and 35 stages is feeling about right.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly in the Central Basin, you guys talk about having 1,200 feet of prospective play in that geopressured area. And I guess with, more specifically, the Uteland Butte having 100 to 200. How do you think about landing laterals and the process of figuring out how to optimize performance of the wells that you land those laterals?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, it's a good question, Dave. And a lot of that has already started even though we don't have a lot of SXL data. Recall that we do have XL data out there that we've utilized. At a high level, the Uteland Butte's a carbonate. It's a dolomite. And we've already changed our landing zone, and we've seen the reason for some of the more recent overperformance or strong performance in the Uteland Butte. We attribute it to that changing your landing zones within that rather narrow section. Now as we think about the Wasatch and the fact that it's 1,200 foot, we have already -- and if you'll refer to the slide that in the @NFX, there's a series of red stars. And what those illustrate for you is, is that we've actually tested 3 different sections within the Wasatch, which is actually a sand, and all 3 of those are -- have been very productive. So while we have a lot more work to do as far as producing and drilling across the acreage, we have in the very early days tested across that entire 1,200 foot successfully.","Lee K. Boothby","And Dave, remember we had 50 vertical wells that we drilled out here that had on average 6 completions through the Wasatch interval. So we've got copious amounts of data across the acreage footprint that -- we've got Mobil Oil, good strong vertical inflow. So it's not a mystery in terms of thinking about how much oil is there, and I think we just need to knock down some additional tests and -- in the layers as we work through the section and continue to broaden the footprint on the SXLs in the Wasatch, just a thicker interval. But everything is positive at this point.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Sure -- no, I appreciate that. I guess where I was going with it is kind of what the possibility is on a longer term basis for stacked laterals in the play.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, clearly, that's what it's going to be all about. We've actually already done some of that already. We've done some early pilots that are kind of in the weeds as far as what we're talking about today. But we've already done some stacked pilots in the section between a couple of the horizons, and it really got some great learnings from that , that we'll be able to share more fully when we get on the road to see it.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. Appreciate that. A follow-up would be just when you think about what you're doing in the Central Basin, how are you utilizing restricted chokes at this point? Are you or are you not? Obviously, you've had success doing that in the STACK and the SCOOP. Just thinking about how that rolls over.","Gary D. Packer","Rigorously using the controlled flowback techniques. It's most notably seen, and I've referred to that previously in the call in the Wasatch production -- I mean, early days, we're using XL wells before we were really utilizing controlled flow, and that's what these early type curves were generated from. In the advent of using those, you can see that we're producing a flatter, more extended early data. Specifically in the Wasatch, but we're doing the same thing in the Uteland Butte. And when you actually look at the cumulative production over time versus that type curve, we're right on or ahead of where we wanted to be. And we think that's a real key, probably even more importantly, Dave, in the geopressured reservoirs to try to maintain and track that reservoir energy that we have in the rock versus producing it more aggressively early days.","Lee K. Boothby","So Dave, to give you a feel, early days in these wells when they're flowing back, the teams were seeing flowing pressures in excess of 3,000 psi. So if you wanted a flashy 24 hour IP rate, we can give it to you. North of 3,000 psi wouldn't be a problem at all. We've really bought in the controlled flowback, managing the drawdown early days in the completion phase is an optimization issue, and we're doing it across the portfolio. We're continuing to do it. But very, very strong wells.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Braziller with Jefferie.","Daniel Braziller - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Some concerns I've heard regarding the STACK, specifically that it might be more of a conventional play than a shale play. I'm just wondering how you guys respond to that. And if you can quantify shale composition in STACK versus SCOOP? And then along with that, what do you need to see in the STACK before you're comfortable accelerating development here? Possibly from the asset sale proceeds rather than using those to improve the balance sheet?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I'll take the first one and then I'll let Gary talk about -- Gary and Larry talk about what they're thinking in terms of optimization in allocation. The easiest piece of data I can give you to let you know that whoever you're talking to about the Meramec doesn't know anything about the Meramec is that we had to go to the state of Oklahoma and provide a core sample to get it classified as a shale. The state of Oklahoma, which dictates these things, has classified it as a shale. We've provided core data indicative of that. And therefore, the conversation about conventional and not shale, I mean, depends on where you go in the play. But the area we're developing, it's a shale. We wouldn't be able to drill the 1,280-acre spacing units in Oklahoma if it weren't shale. Okay? So I'll let part 2 to go to Gary and Larry. Larry?","Lawrence S. Massaro","Yes, I would say that if your question was would we accelerate any of these resource plays like the STACK with additional asset sales, you saw that we sold the Granite Wash, and that's creating lots of financial flexibility for the company. With China on the horizon, that's additional flexibility depending on the proceeds we'll get. And so I see that the -- as the play gets de-risked, we will evaluate every option to accelerate. And I think the moves we've made has prepared our company for the balance sheet to pursue any of those things.","Operator","We'll go next to Rehan Rashid with FBR Capital Markets.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just maybe going back to Uinta. Any kind of color around what's the oil in place for the Wasatch in the Uteland Butte?","Lee K. Boothby","We're not ready to release that. Are you talking about on a per-section basis?","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes. Yes, indeed. Indeed.","Lee K. Boothby","Let us pull all the rest of the technical data we gather between now and the end of the year, and we'll find the right place and time to put more of that information out. But it's very large.","Rehan Rashid - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, good. And looking at the type curve, I'm just trying to figure out how to compare. So in the type curve, did you say earlier that managed flow was not going to be reflected in that? And then also, in the type curve, again to make the actuals kind of be more comparable, how was artificial lift kind of brought in? Is that at the beginning? Or kind of same place where you have it today?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. Well, first of all, and I think Lee alluded to this earlier, we had about a dozen or so Uteland Butte normally -- or a dozen or so Uteland Butte XL wells. And in a later time there, we had been practicing controlled flowback, and those are reflected in the type curves that were generated and so forth. In the Uteland, when I look at the Wasatch, we only had a handful of wells that were drilled there. And that use of controlled flowback at the time those XL wells were drilled and, therefore, when the type curves were generated, didn't fully incorporate that. So that's really the difference there. Now as far as the timing of our artificial lift, as you might have imagined, Rehan, the early XL wells had gas lift installed typically at about 2 months, which is very long and extended versus many of these resource plays that require it very early on. Because we're drilling the longer laterals, we anticipated that it would take a little longer for it to require artificial lift. So this is all pretty much reflected in these numbers. Whether it was 90 or 120 days in the original plan, I don't know, but I suspect we're going to -- as we continue to refine our targeting, we'll probably see the time that these things require to go on artificial lift be extended.","Lee K. Boothby","And also, Rehan, Gary made a point earlier, just to reiterate. The Central Basin acreage, Uteland Butte\/Wasatch is pretty hard pressure. You're talking 0.75, 0.8 psi per foot. So it's anomalous relative to most of the plays you're talking about. We want to be very, very careful on this overpressured environment that we manage the wells the right way. So we'll learn more. As we get some more wells on line, we'll continue to optimize. But I -- if you look at the 30-, 60-, 90-day rates, that's a pretty strong indication. We've given all the data in there. The consistency between the wells, 5 wells averaging north of 2,000 BOE per day, 24 hour IP, strong performance out past the 90 days, flowing on their own. Those are all good ingredients, and we like the play for those reasons.","Operator","We'll go next to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","As I think about the Granite Wash sale, and it was a core asset several years ago. And now looking at the evolution of the company with the Uinta large resource and a lot of interval stack in the same situation, how do you first think about the Williston and your Maverick or Eagle Ford assets as core areas beyond the original 3-year plan?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I think firstly, you're right on all counts. I mean, Granite Wash assets are a hugely important, positive asset for the company. I mean, it was part of our early efforts into the unconventional space. It's a great asset. We haven't drilled any wells there in 3 years. So it's been on decline. We've been fighting that decline to overcome the decline. When we look at our portfolio, the opportunities are evolving. The depth and the quality are such that as much as I love that asset -- and I was there and helped build it, right? Not being able to see in a time frame that makes any sense to any of us the ability to go back there and think about drilling wells, it just makes sense to monetize it at attractive price, put it in the hands of somebody that might have a different view or a different need, take the proceeds and apply them constructively to the balance sheet and just continue to strengthen the company. I mean, this is not a 2014 event. This has been a 3- or 4-year effort to get to this point. We like where we're at, and I think every step that we're taking makes us a little stronger and puts us in a better position to have multiple options to optimize. So I think on that front, I'll miss the Granite Wash, I really will, but I think we got a really, really attractive price. As far as the Williston and the Eagle Ford, most of our portfolio is dominated by oil. They're generating attractive returns. They're in full development mode. They play an important role and a constructive role in the 3-year planning horizon. Williston Basin, as a team, continues to drive costs down, the inventory expands. We like that. And our team has done some good work along the Gulf coast in terms of expanding some of our inventory under the old Fashing fields. So we've got not just the Eagle Ford now and the Maverick, we've got some Gulf Coast Eagle Ford that's getting mixed in there as well. So I think all of that fits well with what we're doing, and we're actually using the learnings in development mode to apply to the earlier assessment plays like STACK in the Central Basin. We're taking the learnings out of those plays and applying them. So I think they all fit together. And most importantly, Eagle Ford and Williston Basin are free cash flow-positive in terms of where they're at in the cycle. So they just -- they fit with what we're doing, and they're core and central to our liquids strategy and fit well in the 3-year plan.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Just to sure, the Gulf Coast Eagle Ford, that's the first time I've heard that phrase. Is that the equivalent of the Upper Eagle Ford or Lower Austin Chalk Eagle Ford combo? It's just a new name for the same thing?","Lee K. Boothby","It's a small acreage footprint that we have in our old Fashing field. You may recall we sold the shallow rights there some years ago. We retained the Eagle Ford. I'm just letting you know that it's part of the overall mix there. It's not a large footprint. It's something constructive that the team has done to add value.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. And then in the STACK, how many zones do you expect to be developing as you head forward and test?","Lee K. Boothby","I'd love to give you the absolute final answer, but we're -- as Gary indicated earlier in the call, we're too early to know the answer. I know that we've tested successfully 3 different horizons in the 700-foot intervals, but I'm guessing that it'll be 3 to 5. It depends on how close you can get in vertical dimension. And we haven't done anything there to really work on the 3-dimensional spacing problem. But I think we've got it in spades in terms of an issue that we need to work in the Uinta Basin. We're working it in STACK. And it's just something that we'll keep you guys appraised of as we look forward over the next 2 or 3 years. Our priority in STACK is HBP. Those 200 wells that Gary was talking about protect 400 sections. So when you think about the acreage footprint, it's a big deal, average working interest north of 60%. We want to take care of that acreage. It's our first priority. So that's our focus.","Operator","We have time for 2 more questions. We'll go next to Phillip Pennell with Mariner Investment Group.","Phillip Pennell","Yes, Lee, on the point that you just mentioned in terms of HBP. From a cost standpoint, how much additional benefit do you get from SXL as opposed to shorter laterals? Just in terms of derisking held-by-production in that play.","Lee K. Boothby","I'll give you my answer and then I'll let Gary give you some additional color since he's obviously on the ground. I mean, I think that we've proved to ourselves the most sufficient well to drill is the SXL well. We've proved it in each one of the plays the we're operating in. When you look at the drill times in a lateral protecting 2 sections with 1 well as opposed to drilling 2 wells, we'll take the longer lateral everywhere that we can drill it. Now is there an economic outcome with drilling short laterals? Absolutely. As we move down the well curve, there'll probably be some areas that we and others will drill at 5,000 feet. But our preference is to drill 10,000-foot laterals everywhere that we can.","Gary D. Packer","I have nothing to add, Lee. I think that's the plan. It makes sense to us to hold the acreage as quickly as we can.","Phillip Pennell","Okay. So everything, in terms of what you're trying to accomplish, that make sense. In terms of the Granite Wash, what was the -- of the 40% liquids cut, what was the mix of NGL in that?","Lee K. Boothby","I think, if I'm remembering, the condensate volumes on a daily basis were just inside of 1,500 barrels and the balance is in NGLs.","Operator","And we'll go take our last question today from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Returning quickly to the issue of lateral length, I mean, I'm just curious if you could add a little bit of color as to why the Yandell development was done on an XL instead of an SXL. And what's kind of the go-forward plan on SCOOP and STACK with regards to trying to increase the percentage of laterals drilled in the SXL rather than the XL?","Lee K. Boothby","I'll let Gary take that one.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, it's 2 different things, Jeffrey. One, as you move to the west in certain areas, we get deeper, and that's going to limit the lateral length that we can drill, just operationally. So you ought to be thinking about wells, on a combined basis, are going to be between 21,000 and maybe 22,000 feet overall. So as I get -- drill deeper, the laterals get shorter. We would drill 10,000-foot laterals at every opportunity. But in some cases, we also won't own the offset sections to complete the DSU. I think our Gregory pad that we drilled last year was also an example of where we have extraordinary production from an XL well that's benefited from all these learnings that we've had. So we're not going to blink and deviate from the SXL plan, and the only places that we'll drill are in those cases that I just defined.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. So just to quickly paraphase what you said, if we see an XL where -- it's either as a result of a geology or blocking up the acreage. But otherwise, it's going to be SXLs?","Gary D. Packer","Well said.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And I guess my other question was with regard to capital allocation. You highlighted in the press release that the Anadarko Basin is currently getting about 45% of CapEx. And I was just wondering, going forward, is this going to level off as some of the other plays, like the Uinta, ramp-up? Or can it still hold as a percentage or maybe even gain in percentage as the STACK drilling begins to increase?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I've listened to Gary answer the variations to this question for most of the last couple of years. And he points out that we've been drilling in the Anadarko Basin SCOOP and STACK plays now for about 3 years, and we've been accelerating since the day we started. So first year was $300 million spend, and then $500 million and then $700 million. So we have been accelerating. I would expect that the returns continue to be competitive, that we'll continue to push capital in that direction. Our focus, again to the 3-year plan, is getting back to where our cash flow from operations and CapEx are in balance. Beyond that, it's an optimization game. And I think that having multiple options in the portfolio, you have SCOOP, STACK and the Uinta Basin to drill high-return. Oil wells is a high-class problem. And I think that we're pretty doggone excited about that. When you think about the Uinta and the focus today in the call, it's a bit like the movie Field of Dreams. If you build it, they will come. And that's what we've done. So there's a bright, bright future ahead, and these assets are going to be core and central to Newfield for a long, long time.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I'd just like to thank everybody for dialing in today. I hope you can tell that we're both excited and confident. I want to compliment our think teams on extraordinarily top-flight work that they've been doing to deliver results across the portfolio. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress the rest of the year, and more goods news to come. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

For opening remarks and other housekeeping items, I will turn the call over to Mr. Steve Campbell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Stephen C. Campbell - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning, everyone and thanks for dialing in today. Following this morning's prepared remarks from our Chairman and CEO, Lee Boothby; we will have members of our leadership team available to take your questions. As always, please limit your time during Q&A to just one question and one follow-up.","Let me remind you again today that today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website, along with our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations and @NFX. We will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so please see the reconciliation in our earnings release and @NFX.","Today's discussion contains forward-looking estimates and assumptions, based on our current views and reasonable expectations.

Please refer to the legends in our earnings release and @NFX for additional information.","Thanks again for dialing in and I will now turn it over to Lee Boothby.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter conference call and operational update. We appreciate your interest and investments in our company. It's easy to get distracted during the lengthy presidential election contest where we anxiously tune in each day to hear about the latest scandal, email investigation, forgotten soundbites or the poll numbers in a presidential election that are simply too close to call and we are still six days out from the election.","But know one thing, we at Newfield are coming to work each day to find and develop precious oil and gas commodities that America needs a lot more of for its bright economic future, regardless of who gets elected. We are not distracted and we are focused on our job of adding value for our shareholders. Just a friendly reminder, if you haven't voted yet, make sure you go and exercise your right.","So it is November and it's hard to believe that 2016 is nearly behind us. By all accounts, Newfield has enjoyed a very strong year of performance and we have successfully repositioned the company to compete and win both today and on the road ahead.","Our teams have delivered on our strategic objectives in 2016, including today we raised production guidance each quarter throughout the year. Excluding acquisitions, we expect to beat our original 2016 business plan by about 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. That's 7% over our beginning of the year forecast.","Furthermore, had we retained the Eagle Ford and South Texas assets, we would have bested guidance by nearly 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our beat can be attributed to operational excellence across the enterprise. We've worked hard to reduce costs and improve our margins.","Our domestic LOE per unit of production is down -- is expected to be down more than 20% year-over-year and our average domestic oil differential has improved more than 20% over the last year. Since 2014, we've taken dramatic actions to reduce our G&A expense. We've reduced our workforce by more than 30% as we consolidated our offices from Tulsa, Denver and Houston into the Woodlands, enabling us to leverage our workforce for the future.","When you compare our early G&A estimates for 2017 to 2014, we will have reduced annual net domestic G&A expense by more than $50 million per year. We high-graded our portfolio during the year by selling non-strategic assets in Texas and acquiring more core acreage in STACK. In total, we have now divested more than $3 billion in assets since 2011 and used the proceeds to improve our balance sheet and capture premier industry-leading return plays in the Anadarko Basin.","Today, we are fortunate to have options, options that clearly differentiate Newfield from other investment choices in the E&P space. We have a strong balance sheet with a net debt over adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2 times and about $480 million of cash on hand.","Our $1.8 billion credit facility remains undrawn. We have attractive interest rates and laddered debt maturities with nothing due until 2022. And most importantly, our SCOOP and STACK assets are ready today for acceleration and are not dependent on higher oil prices to make them competitive investments in our landscape.","These are exciting times for E&P companies that have captured large positions in onshore resource plays and are now entering the harvest mode. In development, results become more consistent, efficiencies are exploited en masse and value creation is evident. There is a revolution underway today in completion designs and there are significant differences in Gen 1, Gen 2 and today's new completions where both liquids volumes and sand concentrations are moving higher.","Newfield is no different. We are now moving to our third-generation completions and our transition out of HBP into full field development should continue to show strong improvements.","Before we move to our usual discussion of quarterly financial results and operational updates, let me provide a high level framework on how we are approaching our business plan for 2017.","This is the season for our strategic discussions with our management team and ultimately our Board of Directors. The various scenarios we are running today will culminate into our official guidance that is customarily disclosed in February along with our year-end earnings.","Although this work is underway, we certainly have some preliminary thoughts today that you may find helpful. First, we expect that oil prices will remain volatile. Although we have been encouraged by recent OPEC discussions of production freezes, oil prices today continue to hover in the mid-$40s not to dissimilar from where we were a year ago.","Newfield is fortunate to have options today. Even at today's prices, we are seeing excellent returns in SCOOP and STACK and any uplift in oil prices from here simply brightens our view. We are fortunate to control a significant position in one of the best resource plays in all of industry and we control the pace of development.","Second, we are working multiple scenarios today, scenarios that encompass lower-for-longer oil prices as well as more bullish cases that move oil prices to $50 per barrel and higher. Our preference is obviously the latter. With prices strengthening from here we would expect to add significant drilling activity in the Anadarko Basin.","Despite large reductions in our workforce over the last two years, we have preserved the organizational capacity to more than double our operated rig count. However, should oil prices remain weak, we have the option to invest at similar levels to 2016 and accomplish our key near-term objectives, holding acreage by production, kicking off infill development drilling and continuing to optimize both our well densities and completion designs.","Again, these options are a competitive advantage for us and we must be prepared to play both offense or defense as appropriate for the business environment. Third, we have the financial capacity to comfortably execute either strategy. We can fund an acceleration using cash on hand. The recent sale of our Eagle Ford and South Texas assets provides the near-term fuel to accelerate development of the SCOOP and STACK assets.","We plan to use a portion of our cash balance to add rigs in the Anadarko Basin. We've recently contracted to pick up additional rigs and will phase them into operation between now and early January. As a result, we have today inched up our planned 2016 investments to about $750 million or the high end of our $700 million to $750 million guidance range for 2016.","Our cash on the balance sheet from recent asset sales can be used to effectively bridge any near-term variance between our cash flow and capital investments while allowing us to keep strong coverage ratios on our debt.","Newfield truly is in an advantaged position today. We see 2017 as a momentous year that fully transitions our Anadarko Basin operations into full field development. Since 2012, we have done yeomen's work to transform Newfield into a company rich in asset quality, scale and financial strength. Since we are just a week away from an important presidential election, I will quote the great Ronald Reagan that famously talked about his dream for a shining city upon the hill.","Newfield's shining city is for a company that combines strong production with profitability all while living within cash flow and maintaining financial strength. For us, that shining city that we've all been working toward is just around the corner.","So know that between now and February, we will create an optimized plan for 2017 that delivers long-term value for our stockholders and we look forward to sharing more specifics with you early next year. For now, let's move on to a brief discussion of our third-quarter financial and operating results.","Our domestic production in the third quarter was 14.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, nearly 4.5% higher than the prior quarter. Today, total company production was 15.2 million barrels, or about 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent, above the midpoint of our guidance. Of the total, 61% was liquids and 39% was gas.","Our beat in the quarter was primarily driven by higher production from the SCOOP and STACK assets, which more than offset the 93,000 barrel impact associated with the sale of our South Texas assets during the third quarter.","For the third quarter, we had net income of $0.24 per diluted share. In our news release, we detail certain items that negatively impacted earnings by a combined $0.21 per share. Excluding these items, net income for the third quarter was $89 million, or $0.45 per share, on revenues of $392 million.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $209 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $183 million. Our cash operating expenses adjusted for one-time charges for the third quarter stated on a unit of production basis were below our guidance ranges for the quarter. You can see the positive impact we have made on our cash operating expenses and this will lead to improved profitability in the future.","We are seeing a continued improvement on our price realizations driven largely by our new pipeline transportation agreements that move STACK barrels to Cushing. Demand is strong for these high-quality barrels and recent batch sales have sold for NYMEX WTI plus $0.60 to $0.80 per barrel. After transportation expense, we had most recently been netting NYMEX less $1.70 per barrel. This is improving our average differential across the company.","Our recent Eagle Ford and South Texas asset sales restored the balance sheet and provided cash on hand of about $480 million. This allows us maximum flexibility to play offense or defense as the situation dictates. We've included a table in @NFX today that provides a detailed look at our production volumes. From this table, you can see our outperformance in 2016 from legacy Newfield assets as well as the impact of our recent South Texas asset sales. Consistent with our usual practice, we will provide official guidance on 2017 capital investments and production expectations in February of next year.","Let's talk now in more detail about the Anadarko Basin. In today's @NFX publication, we provided updates on our recent drilling campaign. Today's results include an update on SXL and XL wells or long and short laterals.","The good news is that our results continue to be very consistent. As we work through our HBP drilling requirements this year, we've drilled more than 20 XL wells, the 5,000 foot laterals. These short lateral wells had very strong performance, as you can see on page 7 in the @NFX publication.","However, we've proven time and again that SXL wells are still the preferred path to optimize capital efficiency and maximize net present value. On page 6, we provided an update on a few recent SXL wells along with the Raptor-X infill pilot.","This pilot includes four producing wells that were drilled to test six wells per layer spacing. This would have resulted in a 12-well spacing configuration for two layers of Meramec. With wells drilled at approximately 880 feet apart, the Raptor is continuing to show strong results after 120 days, averaging about 1,050 barrels of oil equivalent per day over that period.","Important to know is the difference in completion design on the Raptor, which we inherited in our Chesapeake asset acquisition earlier this year, and our current design that we are implementing today on our Chlouber and Dorothy pilots.","The Raptor was completed with a lesser design of 1,700 pounds of sand per foot and 800 gallons of liquids per foot. Although we are encouraged by what we see at the Raptor-X today in terms of production and the costs are significantly less on these smaller jobs, we are looking forward to the latest completion designs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand per foot with 2,100 gallons of liquid per foot on the completion.","Industry is extremely active today with development pilots in STACK. In fact, today, there are about 25 pilots currently underway and\/or planned by seven different operators. Newfield has or will have an interest in nearly half of these infill pilots. This is great news for us as we can learn and use real-time information to tweak and adapt our spacing and completion designs on the road ahead.","There is a tremendous amount of information being gathered today that will benefit our development operations in the months and years ahead. Spacing configurations today vary greatly with everything imaginable being tested. The good news is to date we have not seen any data that suggests any of the wells are being too tightly drilled. It is early and we will need to capture 12 to 24 months of production data from these various pilots to make a more definitive final conclusion on optimized spacing.","We will find the right configuration that yields the best value proposition for our shareholders. But let there be no doubt about it, we are seeing the same things in SCOOP and STACK as evident in other active basins. Bigger volumes and more proppant seems to be better when it comes to completions. As I said earlier, our upcoming operated pilots will have larger completions and we expect to see continued improving results.","We are now completing our Chlouber pilot and the Dorothy pilot has just concluded drilling. Meaningful production results on both will be available early next year. Both the Chlouber and the Dorothy completions will have stimulation jobs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand and 2,100 gallons of fluid per foot.","Our original well at Dorothy was drilled back in 2015. This well was completed with 1,650 pounds of sand per foot and 1,000 gallons of liquid per foot. Our production from this well was choked back in its early days due to gas takeaway constraints at that time. This well originally produced upcasing with 4,000 psi flowing tubing pressure. However, now that we have 250 days of production, accums from this well are very impressive and we think one of the best in the industry.","The well has averaged about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over those first 250 days of production and that production is nearly 70% black oil. Today's new completion designs should demonstrate our wells are just as prolific as many of the recent data points in the Blaine and Kingfisher County line area.","We estimate these wells will cost up to $2 million more than the older well designs. However, the EUR and production uplift are expected to drive material value creation. Our goal today is pretty simple, figure out the best path forward for decades of development activity that we have in front of us.","We're looking forward to entering development mode in 2017. We know from our experience in other resource plays that as we transition into pad development drilling, our production will be a little lumpier early on than in quarters past when drilling in HBP mode where you had single wells on individual drilling spacing units.","You're starting to see that today as we've had our STACK rigs tied up on the Chlouber and Dorothy multi-well pilots over the last several weeks. This will likely smooth out in the second half of 2017 as more pads commence production and we build a stable wedge of base production around them. We'll have more to share with you in February when we talk with you about more definitive plans for 2017.","So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Before I open it up to take your questions, let me summarize the key takeaways we hope you heard in today's call. First, Newfield is in an advantaged position today. We're executing extremely well and we have options that differentiate our story from the pack.","Second, STACK is a great asset, the kind of asset that can drive our production growth and profitability well into the future. Today, we can see the end of the HBP phase and are preparing to kick off an exciting development campaign. Although there is still commodity price uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to deliver great returns in STACK and are planning to add activity as we enter 2017. As I said earlier, we can pull back the reins if oil prices deteriorate from here.","Lastly, we're gathering critical data in STACK that will lead us to the optimal well spacing and completion designs. With our operator drilling and active programs from our peers, we will have the answers to these important questions soon and will be applying them to our development plans as we progress.","Thanks again for your time today. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Brian Singer [Goldman Sachs] Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to follow-up on some of the well results that you highlighted, specifically a couple of wells in Eastern Blaine County. You talked a bit about the Dorothy and then also noted the Castonguay well and \u2013 if I'm pronouncing it right, and one of the things just noting from the presentation here is the 90%, 89% liquids cut. You might have mentioned 70% oil for the Dorothy well, if I heard you right, but can you just talk about the oil versus NGLs cut in these wells versus some of the wells to the East and whether there's any change in some of the expectations that may be out there of how oily wells in Eastern Blaine County are versus say Kingfisher County?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","I will just say, in general, Brian, I think you are well aware of this, that as you move East, you move more strongly into the black oil window and I think we've got well-documented that we've seen consistent results in more than 100 wells that we've released across there. So no change in that regard.","As you move West, you move into the volatile oil region and quickly thereafter into what we call the wet gas condensate region. I know everybody's got a lot of different ways that they talk about that.","The yield in terms of NGLs generally is 100 barrels per million or greater, somewhere in that zip code. So when you go through the math, black oil liquid barrels at the surface, that's what I was referencing in terms of the well performance on that well. I think after 250 plus days I think it is that total average cut there was 70%.","If you go back to the original footprint there on the East that we did much of the drilling in the first two, three years in the play in those 100 plus wells, I think historically you've seen that those wells have performed in that 75%, 80% oil cut range as well.","So that's how I would frame it. If you want any more details on that, I would just ask you to follow up with Steve and Danny and they can walk you through it after the call.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. And then thinking about the 2017 program, you talked about the flexibility there. What do you see as the constraint for how aggressively or not you would allocate to spend capital? Is it liquidity? Is it operational efficiency? Is it leverage? Is it outstanding cash flow or something else? As we look to model Newfield into next year, what should we assume is the key constraint or targets?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I think in the short term, our key constraint is that we will be meeting with our Board of Directors next week to talk about all the options. And clearly, I think we've said it in this call \u2013 I know we've said it in the past that one of the lessons learned here at Newfield that we remind ourselves every day that you've got to have great quality assets. We have that.","You've got to have a strong balance sheet. We've got that. Both of those have been earned wins by the team and our investors over the last several years. We know we can go faster. We've talked about having the ability to accelerate activity, but the truth is you need to go faster at the right time.","So when we think about the volatility in the space since the slide started back around September of 2014. I actually think I quipped in New York back in early September that when everybody started talking about production growth, production growth, production growth, it sounded a lot like discussions in 2014 previously. And we just don't believe that production growth at any cost makes sense.","So we want to stay financially strong. We want to make smart decisions on our assets. We want to maximize value for the shareholders and we are going to take an all-of-the-above approach to those considerations, but the volatility in the space is real and it's something that we are going to stay closely attuned to.","And frankly I think that should oil prices hang in this ZIP code or deteriorate from here, you are going to hear a storyline there that's going to sound a lot like what we've talked about previously where we are going to go ahead and do the things that we need to do and we will wait for a better day to go faster.","Having said all of that, we are optimistically adding rigs to accelerate our knowledge capture in terms of the pilot projects so that we can expedite getting to the most efficient development. So we are going to have additional momentum going into 2017. But we'll wait until we've had discussions with our board next week. And we final our plan at the February Board meeting before we talk any more specifically about that.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jason Smith [Bank of America]. Please go ahead.","Jason Smith - Bank of America","Hey good morning, everyone. Lee, I appreciate all the color around 2017. As you look to ramp the rig count and move towards development mode, can you just remind us, does that first incremental $1 today go towards the STACK or go towards the SCOOP?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. The incremental dollars today will go into development wells in the Anadarko Basin, SCOOP and STACK.","Jason Smith - Bank of America","And I guess what's the split today of the rig count between the two, please?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Today, we've got ...","Unknown Speaker","You have three running in STACK and two running in SCOOP.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Three by two today, three in STACK, two in SCOOP.","Jason Smith - Bank of America","Got it, okay. And I guess you guys have talked in the past I believe of $6 million or so on well costs in the STACK as you move towards development mode. With the shift towards upsized completions can you just give an update as to if there's been any impact to that target?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I mean the target will be impacted by wherever you land finally on completions. So when we talk about these upsized completions, proppant is not free. So you've probably got a lot more proppant volume. Pressure pumping is not free either. So as you raise the volume of fluid and the volume of sand being pumped, you are adding costs in the completions. So what you would say is that maybe the completions are $1 million to as much as $2 million higher than what we would have talked about a year ago. The uplift in EUR should translate to a lower F&D and an improved rate of return picture on an individual well basis.","So, today, just thinking through those costs, if we were talking about wells with a $6 million on them, we would be talking about wells that are probably in the $7 million to $9 million for a 10,000 foot lateral and I think that's an important point. There are a lot of numbers floating around out in industry and you guys should always make sure you talk to people about exactly what well they are talking about.","A lot of the wells that you hear about in the play that have $6 million in front of them today are 5,000 foot laterals and that other 5,000 feet, both on drilling and completions, is not free. So you need to make sure that you keep up with the mix that individual companies have in terms of 5,000 and 10,000 foot laterals and we'll do our best to keep you straight on what our plan is and how to keep up with the numbers.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Smith [Raymond James]. Please go ahead.","Kevin C. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin C. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","You've seen some other competitors I guess talk about, in the industry, talk about multiple intervals in the Upper Meramec. Do you have any plans to test it and just kind of what's your thoughts on it?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, if you go back through the last four or five years and I'll just politely remind everybody that our team discovered STACK, that we drilled the early wells. That we listened to people outside wonder what crazy things we were doing for a couple of years and then we announced the play couple of years later. We've been pretty diligent about our approach of data collection, completion designs. Been kind of methodical, but it's good. It allows us to talk about consistency in the play and prove it.","We are now stepping up activity in terms of fluid volumes and proppant and doing that in concert with industry and the truth is the downturn on the commodity has provided a great time for all of us and our peer companies in the plays to experiment. So we're experimenting on an accelerated basis. Way back when, in those early days we started talking about the play in 2013, I remember saying more than once that we thought there were probably three to five levels, layers if you will, that could ultimately be exploited across that acreage footprint where those 100-plus wells have been delivered successfully. We certainly still believe that today. So if you wanted to think about the Meramec section, I would say it's three or more depending upon how tight the vertical spacing can be as we work through that part of the equation.","You've got the Woodford, which is a horizon that exists across all of that footprint. So certainly, I think it will be exploited. And you've got the Osage where you've got people talking today about tests East and North and on the periphery of the acreage footprint and frankly that oil-saturated interval cuts across the entirety of our position out there.","So I still think that there will be three to five layers ultimately exploited, but a lot of data yet to be acquired to nail that down. And frankly, the optimist in the crowd could say that you can put a 5 plus on the back end because if we're able to prove that you can stack the wells in closer vertically then there will be more layers, greater than 5 exploited ultimately. So that's how I would explain it.","Kevin C. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So let me make certain I understood your \u2013 caught you correctly. You're saying possibly three intervals. Is that an upper and lower combined, or three intervals just in the Upper Meramec?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I'm just telling you that it's a thick enough area where we've drilled Upper, we've drilled Lower, we've drilled Middle. You could see three or more layers just in the Meramec ultimately and I'm just telling you that anybody that's going to tell you that they know the answer to that today, they've either got a secret black box that we know nothing about or a time machine where they're transporting back from a future state when the answer was clear to all.","You just think about the factors you've got to deal with. You've got oil price; that's going to be a big deal. Okay? So that will dictate how close you drill wells. Number of layers. Well, that will be a technical cost piece as well, but the technical data will tell us when you are too close or too far and we will move to optimize that, but certainly that's going to be a variable. There are actually geologic layers. We talk about Meramec, Osage, Woodford. There are three geologic layers, but the Meramec is thick enough that you could see that ultimately split into multiple levels.","And there are frankly portions of the Woodford where you could see that happen as well and we will all have to drill wells in the Osage to figure out what the answer is there because that's an area where we know it's oil-saturated and it's got all the right attributes. But we haven't drilled any horizontal wells there yet. We plan to do that in the first half of 2017. That will be part of our program.","So, hopefully, that helps. But stay tuned. I think patience is going to be a virtue for investors so that you can actually act on meaningful information and not rumor.","Operator","And we're going to take our next question from Josh Silverstein [Deutsche Bank]. Please go ahead.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a quick follow-up on that. As you guys look to go into pad development, how are you thinking about combining the Meramec and the Woodford? Do you see both formations as being part of a pad development or do you do one then come back for the other? Just any thought about that?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Our team is working through various options right now, as I'm sure lots of other teams and our peer companies are as well. I think what you just described are two endpoints. Do you come out and drill up a DSU, do you decide you know the answer on how many layers there are and you drill all the wells right upfront or do you go through and attack a layer \u2013 for instance, attack the Meramec section, fully develop that and then come back later for Osage, Woodford, et al?","We're just going to have to work through what the optimal scenario there is. And I'll give you some reasons to think about that. If you drill out a full DSU top to bottom on all of these layers, we could have capital burn for the better part of a year. And we'd be telling you that if we followed that approach fully and completely that production occurs sometime the year following.","So it's probably going to be a trade-off and probably going to be some efforts there that you'll need to consider when you think about modeling companies and that's why we referenced lumpy. I don't know if that's the best word, but we'll just call lumpy the right thing.","When you go from single wells, drilled, complete, produce in a timeframe that has shrunk down to where you could do that inside of 30 to 45 days to multi-well pads, you're now talking about months between spudding of the first well and completing the last well before you can actually stimulate production.","So you guys are seeing that. Just be aware that it's going to be part of the equation over the next couple of years, as we and industry transition into full field development.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then you mentioned before portfolio modernization. The Williston has been potentially brought up as maybe being another asset that could be divested next. Just thinking about the cash coming in, how quickly could you redeploy that to make up for the lost cash flow and obviously, there's no real balance sheet constraints right now to retire debt at this point? So just thinking about the use of cash from something like them.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I think that we start to just go ahead and take them off the radar screen as being an issue of near-term priority. We start with nearly $500 million on the balance sheet right now, so we've got plenty of firepower to accelerate activity into this environment that we are going to work through here over the next couple of years. We've been honest and consistent that every asset has a lifecycle and we've been diligently selling assets over time, including the transactions in Texas that we've completed in the third quarter. So we will continue to monitor that situation.","The Williston Basin, frankly, the team has been kicking ass and taking names in terms of the well results that they have been posting. It's a wonderful asset and we are continuing to maintain an attractive inventory in terms of well count out there and I think that place and time counts. If it becomes the right next asset at the right time in the market, then we will do something at that point in time and the logical use of proceeds would be for acceleration of development in the Anadarko Basin.","But having said that, in the interim, I'm really proud of what the team is doing. It's an important part of the equation for us and I think that we've got a talented team there, and the most talented workforce, that's the most precious commodity we have. So as we work through assets, we will redeploy people onto other assets, and higher value opportunities, and we will continue on the path ahead. It's just one of the decisions we will make at the right time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Subash Chandra [Guggenheim]. Please go ahead.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, Lee. Good morning. A question on the fluid intensity. When you think about the relative impact of proppant intensity and fluid intensity, do you expect that they will be largely equal? And as you close the gap that it could be as meaningful as the proppant intensities you've seen?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, when you look at support data and we've got the advantage of having core data and you get to where you have an understanding of the fracture network that's being reactivated, I would say both are critically important. I think that's been demonstrated at this point in time.","The things we don't fully know and understand and appreciate at this point are going to be the \u2013 it's not just the lateral loss, that dimension. I think we've got enough tests going on in industry right now that you will be able to cover the landscape between four and probably eight wells per horizon, or let's call it per layer. But what is the interrelationship going to be as you start adding additional layers and how close can you put those layers to each other? That's the variable that we think about that is going to be pretty important.","And frankly, as I said earlier in answer to one of the other questions, there could be trade-offs. It could be that you back off on fluid volumes and proppant in development mode because you understand what those interrelationships are. You deliver a cheaper, more efficient well and you fully exploit the resource for maximum value. I could imagine that being a scenario.","If you look in isolation with the data that we in the industry have accumulated here in the play, generally there is a positive correlation between increased fluid volumes. So that probably means that the fluid side of this thing is creating more fractures and more fracture complexity. You put more prop away in that same regard, then it's probably transported farther from the well and you get better propped fractures and then as our guys, John Jasek likes to remind me, it's about stimulated rock volume. So that would be the drainage volume of an individual well.","You can kind of understand those trade-offs. Not too hard to get your mind around it. But, right now, when we look at the endpoints that we have in the data set, we had situations where proppant was pumped at 2 to 1 relative to fluid. We are closer to 1 to 1 today and I think that's probably true for a lot of industry as well and that probably says that both are important and right now, it seems like having those in similar amounts is \u2013 a ratio of 1 to 1 \u2013 is probably a better answer than the proppant-loaded scenarios that we saw earlier in the development of the play.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. My follow-up is some marketers have just been talking about residue gas takeaway capacity in the eastern part of STACK and it's something I hadn't really thought about. What's your thought there? Are there limitations and if so, how they can they be addressed and if not, then I guess it wouldn't matter?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, when you said eastern part of STACK. You are talking about East of our acreage or?","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","The way it was described to me was that the Westside of STACK in the over-pressured area had better proximity to some trunk lines and it's the eastern part, not specific to residue gas, but the numbers just weren't really that concrete, so I wanted to get your perspective there.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","I think in a general statement I would say that we have our needs covered over the course of the next two or three years in any scenario that we see in terms of volumes. So take that off the table in that time period.","There are a couple of projects that we are aware of that are in the works for as forward development requirements for the broader field and, last time I heard, I think those projects are 2019 forward type timeframe.","So obviously you bring in additional infrastructure as the volumes grow out of the play, but I think there's plenty of lead time for folks to get those in place and plenty of time for each individual company to participate and get some access to that. So I wouldn't be too concerned about that.","And then, furthermore, as you move West to support your other argument, you see more and more gas production. It's more gassy, so, of course, folks will say that the trunk lines are out there and you don't have to worry about me, but the big gas volumes are actually coming from the western port of the play and it will be the more gassy companies that drive that part of the infrastructure. We're an oil company.","Operator","We have time to take two more questions. We can take our next question from Kashy Harrison [Piper Jaffray]. Please go ahead.","Kashy Harrison - Piper Jaffray","Good morning, and thank you for taking my question.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Sure.","Kashy Harrison - Piper Jaffray","So understanding that you all just raised type curves last quarter, I was just curious about how many wells do you think and how much data do you think you'll need next year from the new 2,100, 2,100 completion design before you feel comfortable making adjustments to your type curves?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Look, I would say that we talk about Gen 1, Gen 2, Gen 3 and we're in Gen 3 on completion design. We've got plenty of production data to understand the general production characteristics in the play. And you can go back to the early wells and kind of reengineer what they would have looked like had they been using current completion techniques.","So that's something that certainly our team takes into account. I think the other thing I'll remind you of that complexity issues and the pilot projects, vertical and horizontal dimensions that we've got to optimize on, that will have some impacts as well.","When we put out the updated type curve, we had 100-plus wells in that full data set and we were very careful to point out that those wells are all unbounded, which means they were single wells for the most part on individual DSUs. We know as we move into development that we and the peers will all be chasing what I call constructive interference, i.e. that you're going to get to a point where you actually see interference between wells so that you know that you're effectively depleting the resource. And that will be a different well in all likelihood than the types of wells that are populating the data set today.","So just going to have to stay tuned and kind of listen to the data points and we'll land on the right solution. But clearly, the wells that we drill today with more fluid, more proppant, tighter spacing between perf clusters will be bigger wells in their own right than the wells that were drilled two or three years ago in the play, no doubt about that.","Kashy Harrison - Piper Jaffray","All right. Thanks for that.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Sure.","Kashy Harrison - Piper Jaffray","And just given that you and your peers in the area intend to add rigs next year, I was just wondering how you all are thinking about service cost inflation if the forward strip for next year comes to fruition.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah, I don't know which forward strip you want to anchor on, the one when everybody was feeling euphoric, the tempered one everybody was feeling euphoric about two weeks ago, or the one that's on the screen today in front of me. I mean, we've seen a pretty good swing there and that's what we talk about in terms of volatility.","Now, in general, if you're in a rising commodity, we would expect that the prices likewise will come up. And I think we've said historically that if you go back and anchor around some endpoints and let's say when we were drilling $8.5 million wells a few years ago and we got that to where we could see that $6.5 million might be a cost for that same well if we were drilling that same well today. If you went back to the price environment you had when you were drilling $8.5 million wells, that well probably cost us $7.5 million today because you give half of that gain back to the service industry with the new commodity environment. I'm sure every company has got their own view of that, but we build those types of forecasts into all of our projections because they are real. As far as -- are we feeling any significant inflation pressure right at the moment? I would say nothing really significant. Gary?","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes, I think where we sit right now, 0% to 5% seems to be pretty reasonable. Unless we get a squeeze on proppant, we would have to see not only that squeeze, but a pretty good increase in commodity price before we would forecast any meaningful change in our well costs.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","So a falling commodity would put the other pressure on and static commodity, you could probably expect more of the same. That's kind of how we think about it. Any other questions?","Operator","Yes, we have time for one last question from Don Cress (46:51). Please go ahead, sir.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. Lee, how many of your rigs in the percentage terms are on development drilling right now versus single pads and how do you see that transitioning into 2017 and any cost synergies once you move to development mode from single pads, if you will?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","That's good; I think you got three questions in one. So let me see if I can touch the pieces","Unknown Speaker","I've been practicing.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","No, that's good. So the first part of that in terms of the current split, I would say that we are probably 50-50 right now. Generally, about a half of the current activity that we talked about and other half is still HBP. We've said previously that, and remember that we haven't finaled the 2017 plan at this point. We will be talking to the board about that here next week and we will also be following up with a final recommendation in February at the board meeting. We said that we would expect around two-thirds of our total activity 2017 to be development related. So that's part of that shift towards the development mode.","Ultimately, we could see percentages a little higher or a little lower than that depending upon the capital spend and pace is how I would think about that. As far as the, I think I've talked long enough, I've almost forgotten part of your question, but I think the other question was a cost question on synergies. I think we've been pretty consistent when you go from HBP mode, which is single wells on DSU to development mode. There's probably somewhere in the $0.750 million to maybe $1 million of total cost synergies that you are able to capture in development mode. I think those numbers would probably still be pretty good estimates today.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you so much.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Sure, no problem. Well, I guess that probably concludes the call. Again, thanks for joining us and signing in. Stay tuned. We look forward to updating you on the full year progress early next year and we will see some of you guys on the road here in the weeks ahead. Have a great day.","Operator","And this concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"15435":["Newfield Exploration (NYSE:NFX) Q4 2013 Earnings Call February 26, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Lee K.

Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And before we get started, one housekeeping matter. Our discussion with you today will contain forward-looking statements, such as strategic initiatives and plans, estimated production and timing, drilling and development plans, expected cost reductions and planned capital expenditures.","Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, they are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors and risks, some of which may be unknown. Please see Newfield's 2012 and 2013 annual reports on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause actual results to vary. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of today's date and unless legally required, Newfield undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with Newfield's earnings and release of any other applicable disclosures, are available on the Investor Relations page of Newfield's website at www.newfield.com.","Before turning the call over to the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lee Boothby, [Operator Instructions] Mr. Lee Boothby, please go ahead, sir.","Lee K. Boothby","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We appreciate your interest in Newfield Exploration. We've provided a thorough update of our 2013 results in yesterday's @NFX publication and in our earnings release. We plan to keep today's year-end wrap-up relatively short, leave ample time for your questions at the end of the call.","So our results in 2013 were strong. Our team has executed extremely well during the course of the year, and we entered 2014 with confidence in our people, our assets and our ability to execute and deliver relative to our 3-year plan.","So here's a brief outline of today's call. First, I want to reiterate our strategic focus and illuminate our path to value creation for our shareholders. We believe we're on a path to improving stockholder returns. All Newfield employees are shareholders, and I can assure you that our interests are aligned with yours. Second, our CFO, Larry Massaro, will cover fourth quarter and year-end financial results. Our plan provides both production and cash flow growth and focuses on the development of the liquids-rich assets we have in our domestic U.S. resource plays.","As you know, we recently closed on the sale of our Malaysian business, and Larry will update you on the use of proceeds and our ongoing sale of our China business, along with our financial objectives in the near term. And third, our Chief Operating Officer, Gary Packer, will provide operational highlights from each of our domestic focus areas and a summary of our 2014 plans.","So let's get started. Today our business strategy is clear, and we intend to deliver on the objectives outlined in our refreshed 2014 to 2016 plan. We've completed our transition to a liquids company, and our near-term capital investments will remain focused on liquids-rich plays. Our $1.6 billion budget this year is allocated entirely to creating value through the liquids growth, with the SCOOP and STACK plays comprising nearly 1\/2 of the total. Although we have a strong inventory of national gas assets and the front end of the natural gas curve has improved of late, our investment strategy remains unchanged. Our returns from our oil and gas liquids plays remains superior.","Second, Newfield is now better focused on what we call our plays of the future. Over the last 4 years, we've sold more than $3 billion in nonstrategic assets and reinforced our vision to be a top-tier domestic-focused resource company. Our investments in the 3-year plan are expected to deliver more than 20% CAGR in cash flow and liquids production growth.","Furthermore, you'll see that our lease operating expenses are moving in the right direction, proof that the efficiencies in our domestic business are positively impacting the bottom line. By 2016, we expect that our annual investments will more closely align with our cash flow from operations. We are on course to improve our debt-adjusted production and reserve growth on a per share basis.","And third, we continue to add both depth and quality to our portfolio of opportunities, which is the key to our future success.","The recent addition of our SCOOP and STACK plays have significantly expanded our inventory and will provide decades of growing. We have a significant resource base in the Uinta Basin, where exciting work is now yielding improved results as we open up another large-scale resource play for us to attack. We had some stellar results in 2013 and delivered the year 1 objectives of our 3-year plan.","I'll provide a quick summary of these highlights for you now, leading off with proved reserves. Evidence of our value creation can be seen in our year-end 2013 proved reserve disclosure, which we issued yesterday. Our domestic proved reserves were up 8% to 576 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our domestic liquids reserves increased 26% during the year, and our domestic proved reserves are now 52% liquids. Our pretax SEC PV10 value for the domestic reserve reflects the pronounced shift towards liquids and was up 44% to $6.6 billion.","At year-end 2013, 94% of our proved reserves were located onshore in the U.S. and 56 were -- 56% were proved developed.","We moved a step closer to achieving our vision through the sale of our Malaysian business earlier this month. We closed the sale on February 10, and used the $898 million in proceeds to eliminate short-term borrowings and get a jump-start on our 2014 drilling campaigns.","In 2013 we twice raised production guidance and once again, exceeded our guidance ranges in the fourth quarter, both domestically and internationally. The 2013 production from continuing operations was 40.1 million barrels of oil equivalent, exceeding our beginning-of-year estimates. The outperformance was primarily related to the Williston and Anadarko basins.","We delivered on 2013's expectations for cost and expenses, and the efficiencies in our development programs are translating to the bottom line. In our cost and expense guidance for 2014, you can see that our full year expectations show an improvement in every category.","Earlier in my remarks, I mentioned SCOOP and STACK's impact on expanding our drilling inventory, but it's also worth noting we have quickly reallocated capital among our business units to facilitate faster development in the Anadarko Basin. We remain firm in our belief that having a few quality areas in which to invest helps provide flexibility to shift people and capital to the best opportunities. And today that is certainly the Anadarko Basin.","We continue to advance our understanding of the vast resource in our Central Basin area in Utah. Our most recent horizontal wells in the Central Basin are highly encouraging. Although it's early days, we're seeing strong flow rates from our most recent SXL wells, these are the 10,000-foot laterals in the Central Basin, and consistent with our practice, we will wait until we have at least 30 days of production to update you, but expect that from us soon. With the improved production rates, these recent wells are expected to deliver returns that will compete within our portfolio. Production information that we are collecting today in the Central Basin is helpful in our understanding of this vast resource.","In the Bakken and Eagle Ford, we are now in full field development. Through pad drilling and optimized well designs, we are seeing solid returns. These plays are providing strong oil growth and helping to accelerate our SCOOP and STACK developments.","2013 was indeed a great year for Newfield, and I'm excited about 2014. I'll let Gary Packer provide additional color on our operations in a few minutes, following our CFO, Larry Massaro's overview of the financial results. Larry?","Lawrence S. Massaro","Thanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone. By now, I hope you had a chance to review our financial statements for the fourth quarter. Excluding the items noted in our news release, our net income was $66 million, or $0.48 a share. Cash flow was $398 million. Both earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter beat consensus estimates.","Fourth quarter production was 12.8 million barrels, of which 2.2 million barrels came from disc ops. We continued to see strong growth in our domestic liquids production, up 11% quarter-on-quarter.","For 2013, we posted GAAP net income of $147 million, or $0.94 per share. Excluding the items noted in our news release, our net income from continuing ops was $213 million, or $1.56 per share. For 2013, our cash flow from continuing operations was about $1.1 billion.","From a financial perspective, there are 3 key things that are important. First, our 3-year plan is all about driving cash flow growth. As we've mapped out the next 3 years, we have a 20% compound annual growth rate and cash flow. Our production base has shifted to liquids and our domestic areas are growing rapidly. At $90-oil and $4-gas, we estimate our strong growth in liquids over the next 3 years will allow us to generate cash flow from operations of about $1.6 billion in year 3.","Second, we are capturing efficiencies in our operations. From the cost and expense guidance in our release yesterday, you can see positive trajectories in our annual projections for cash costs and expenses. We are laser-focused as an organization on improving our returns and driving growth through our domestic developments.","Third, we financed our transition to liquids while living within our balance sheet. On the -- over the last several years, we sold approximately $3 billion of nonstrategic assets, and we have used our $1.1 billion of credit facility to bridge short-term funding deficits. We recently restored the full capacity of our facility with proceeds from our Malaysia sale. Newfield has a long history of managing the balance sheet and maintaining strong liquidity. I assure you that we do not plan to deviate from this track record, and we plan to use proceeds for planned asset sales in our projection of rising earnings and cash flow to reduce our current leverage. In short, our plan is designed to improve debt-to-EBITDA ratio.","Let me quickly give you an update on China sales process. As you know, the process was delayed last year due to a mechanical issue during installation of our topside. We completed substantially all of the underwater surveys and are now working with our partner on the best path toward first production in 2014. We continue to anticipate a sale in 2014, and we'll keep you informed as more information is known.","I'll turn the call over to Gary.","Gary D. Packer","Thank you, Larry. Let me give you a quick rundown on our key drilling programs as we enter 2014.","I'll start my remarks today in the Anadarko Basin, followed by the Uinta. The Anadarko and Uinta basins are both large-scale liquids plays that combined are accounting for about 70% of our planned investments in 2014. In yesterday's @NFX, we provided a first look at our resource potential in SCOOP and STACK plays. Combined, these plays have added about 1 billion barrels of un-risked [ph] resource to the Newfield portfolio. Our estimates are based on spacing assumptions of 1,320 feet and 660 feet between wells, respectively. Keep in mind, all of our planned wells are SXLs.","We continue to see very strong results from our SCOOP and STACK plays. Early wins can be noted in a couple of distinct categories. First, our well performance has been exceptional. In yesterday's news release, we published a summary table of our 2013 well results. You will note that our SCOOP 90-day production rates are higher than our 60-day rates. From the well performance we have experienced to date, we raised the midpoint of our expected EURs associated with SCOOP. We have reduced perforation clusters in our stimulations and have seen increased well performance. We continue to optimize our completions today.","In STACK, our 30-, 60- and 90-day rates are very healthy, and we are early in advancing the learning curves in this play. We have 8 wells under our belt at year end, and we are early in optimizing the best completion practices. We are encouraged by early well results, with wells exceeding our original-type curves. In addition, we are capturing mid-30% returns today and it's very early. We know that our returns will improve with time, and we continue to drive efficiencies in our programs. To date, we have been able to invest our savings through drilling efficiencies into more aggressive completion designs, resulting in better overall well economics. We have successfully tested 65-foot clusters in the SCOOP area and are now evaluating 50- and 75-foot cluster spacings in STACK.","Second, a significant upgrade to our midstream gas gathering was just completed in SCOOP. Our growth has been rapid due to the faster drilling times and improved well performance. These are good problems to have, but we filled the system capacity before expansion of new infrastructure was complete. Obviously the cold weather also impacted ongoing construction projects as well. The good news is that the upgrade is complete, and it has allowed us to bring on an additional 4,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the last few days. We will soon be moving 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net. We do not see this first quarter interruption impacting our full year estimates for the company.","Our 2014 program has several key objectives. First, we will be drilling the holed acreage while expanding the aerial boundaries of our STACK play. Fortunately, we were able to combine higher returns on our HBP needs. In 2014 we will gather some significant new data in STACK. Our test to date had been in the Upper Meramec and Woodford. We have plans to test the lower Meramec in the second quarter, as well as other perspective geologic horizons on this acreage. In over the next 2 or 3 years, we will have a much better determination of ultimate well spacing. In @NFX, we provided a graphic that will help you visualize the ultimate potential in this play as we do. Our upside is significant, and our well control today is helping determination -- our determination of our best path forward.","And finally, we are ensuring that we have the necessary infrastructure to keep pace with our growth. We have a new system up and running today in the SCOOP area, and later this year we will sign an agreement for new infrastructure in our STACK area.","In the Uinta basin, we are allocating our 2014 capital investment between 2 areas: the continued development of the GMBU waterflood and the ongoing assessment of our horizontal plays in Central Basin. There's some exciting tests underway today that will help you and us better understand our resource, as well as where overall returns stack up in our portfolio of investment choices. The Central Basin program is where I would like to focus my update today.","Over the last several years, we've been able to -- we've been working down 2 large plays, the Uteland Butte and the Wasatch. As we have worked with state regulators to modify the spacing requirements, our drilling has now evolved to SXL wells, consistent with best practices in other resource plays, and we like the results to date. We know these wells are the optimal wells for the future. We have the drilling permit in hand now for our planned SXL wells in 2014 and continue to work with Utah regulators to permanently amend the field rules to allow these longer wells, which will offer a more effective drainage of the resource.","Our recent SXL wells have provided some very encouraging early production data. As Lee mentioned, we don't plan to report the results until we have at least 30 days of production on several wells and a better understanding of what the new information means to the ultimate resource in the basin and our path forward for development.","Our investment levels and near-term growth outlook in the Uinta Basin will continue to be determined by the timing of refinery expansions, the regulatory environment and our internal pledge to allocate our capital to the projects with the best returns.","We have signed agreements with both HollyFrontier and Tesoro that add about 20,000 barrels of oil per day of new capacity in the basin by 2016. Both expansions are well underway, and our first tranche will be available mid-2015, and the full 20,000 barrels a day will be available late 2016.","In the Williston Basin, we are well underway with full field development. Our teams have successfully made this transition, and we have lowered our well cost to about $8.4 million, including $800,000 in facilities. For 2013 our volumes exceeded our forecast by 700,000 barrels, and we've seen excellent well performance from our base production. Our 4-rig program will continue in 2014, and we expect 35% to 40% year-over-year production growth.","We drilled 8 wells in the Three Forks in 2013, 7 testing the first bench and 1 testing the second. We remain encouraged and along with the industry, we will continue to test these prospective horizons beneath the Middle Bakken.","In the Eagle Ford, the rapid development of our West Asherton area led to a 60% production growth in 2013. We drilled about 30 wells, primarily SXLs, from common pad locations. For the year, our average gross completed-well cost for a 7,500-foot SXL was $7.3 million. Our activity in 2014 will be split between West Asherton and our Fashing field. We are looking for year-over-year growth in 2014 of about 30%, and we expect to drill about 20 wells, including 7 wells in the Fashing field.","I'll turn it back to Lee for closing comments.","Lee K. Boothby","Thanks, Gary, and thanks to all of you for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest in our company. We enter 2014 with lots of enthusiasm, and today's call was a great summary of our accomplishments in 2013. Our results have been solid, and our teams are executing a 3-year plan that is focused on the right performance metrics. Those metrics are liquids growth, cash flow growth, improved profitability and inventory expansion. The achievement of these objectives will lead to improved debt-adjusted production and reserve growth metrics and lower leverage ratios, and we intend to deliver.","This time, we'll be happy to take your questions. I'll turn it back to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You've provided rates on SCOOP and STACK wells through 90 days now. Is the range of results tight for the 90-day rates? That is, do you observe outlying results beginning to appear either below or above? And if you could just talk to the kind of the flatness of the production profile across those 90 days for both the SCOOP and the STACK wells.","Gary D. Packer","Dan, I guess -- I think you have a couple of things going on here. First, we've talked about how we like to do the managed flowbacks, and that's primarily an issue and a benefit down in our SCOOP area, where we just managed to choke a little bit more effectively, and we can manage that better. As we move into the oil, both in the STACK and the Eastern SCOOP, typically these wells go on gas lift relatively early, and your -- we're less effective in being able to manage that flowback. Now that said, recent activity in well results have strengthened where we're seeing these wells flow longer than what we historically have. So I think as we accumulate more information over time, you're going to see the back half of that come up. The other thing I would suggest to you is as we get -- as we've managed the cluster spacing and improved upon that, you will see generally improving data further out in the 60- to 90-day period as a result of these wells cumulating that kind of production time. So it's both managing the data as well as improved practices being translated into -- through the 90-day period.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Got it, great. And as a follow-up, can you sketch for us the midstream requirements in the SCOOP and the STACK plays over the next, say, 12 to 18 months? You touched on it in your prepared remarks. I ask in light of the delay encountered with the gathering system and what that could mean for potential bottlenecks here going forward, just in an effort to assess the risk, that's all.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, I understand, Dan. In the South area, it was purely a matter of the fact that our growth even surprised us in the success of some of the wells that we had down there. What we did is -- we refer to it as gathering, but it was actually some plant capacity issues and our ability to get the gas to those areas and get it processed. We saw more capacity available to the North in the STACK area and it's interconnected. We've been waiting on actually loose [ph] gas from SCOOP up in the area of STACK. Now we have -- in our contract with DCP, we provide for additional expansion as we have success and we'll continue to stay on top of that. But we believe that this line that was recently added should remove any additional bottlenecks. Now as we move up to STACK, the biggest thing we got going there is the fact that it's primarily oil. So the gas requirements are less, and it's also in the vicinity of where most of the available production plant capacity is. So I think we're set well. We're going to actually take these to paper and contracts with some proposals that we're evaluating right now. So before too long, you ought to look for us to give you some more clarity on that actual contract.","Operator","And we'll go next to Amir Arif with Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of quick questions on the STACK. What's the longest production history you have on your older wells out there? And how many wells are in the 90-day number?","Lee K. Boothby","Longest -- I'll take that, and Gary will give you some color on the number of wells, but the longest producing well is the well that we drilled in the fourth quarter of 2011. May or may not have heard us talk about it over the course of last year, but the first well was not released publicly. That was some of the earliest drilling that we did in the Anadarko Basin, and that was related to our desire to build the acreage position that we now call STACK. I think the total in the well count at 90 days is about 7. 7 wells in the carry-through to the 90-day rate, all of which would be 10,000-foot laterals. That first well was a 5,000-foot lateral, and we used it to calibrate against expectations for the play.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and the spacing on the Upper Meramec, have you tested 6 60 yet? Or is that something that you'll be doing in '14?","Lee K. Boothby","No, we haven't tested spacing yet. Our focus, as Gary indicated in his remarks, is going to be on getting the HBP process rolling in terms of protecting that acreage, so we've got a pretty solid plan there. We do have some plan spacing pilots down on the loyal window of our SCOOP acreage, so we'll be drilling some of those pilots this year. We'll look to extrapolate that. But the highest priority for our rigs in the north is getting the acreage HBP. We'll keep you up-to-date as things develop there.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then final question. So the lower Meramec test that you mentioned you'll be doing in 2Q, I take it that'll be an acreage where you haven't drilled the upper Meramec initially just to hold the acreage?","Lee K. Boothby","That would be correct.","Operator","We'll go next to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen","Really just thinking about your SCOOP and STACK performance and really trying to get into some of the granularity of how much capacity you have in the North area, in the South area with DCP. And just thinking about the -- those wells, they're delivering, frankly, just much, much better results, and so I can see a path where you're going to hit surface constraints as you ramp up. And so can you walk us through how that happens through this year and next year? Because that's clearly driving the majority of your growth.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, Dave, I mean, I'll just refer back to the answer to the prior question. I think we've -- we think we've resolved it down in SCOOP. We'll -- we have planned compression additions I know that we're going to be adding over time, so I think we're going to be good there. And again, in the STACK area, it's less gas than in the South, and it's an area where there's plenty of capacity. So we're anticipating about a lot of our growth, and we'll be trying to make sure that we de-bottleneck anything that could come at us.","David Heikkinen","Maybe how much were you constrained in the first quarter?","Gary D. Packer","A few hundred thousand barrels, I think, would be the [indiscernible]. 4,500 barrels a day or so, which we now have back online.","David Heikkinen","Cool, that's helpful. And then kind of looking at your other regions, and then strategically how they fit in the company with basically flattening of production and more limited inventory. Do you start thinking about divesting the Williston or divesting the Eagle Ford? How does that incorporate?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, Dave, I'll go back to the comments, and I think you've followed us close enough and we've been pretty open about our sales process and in terms of assets and how we've utilized that to make the transition transformation to a resource-play focus. Total is about $3 billion. We've still got China on the table. That's our priority for 2014. We've shown a desire over the -- and executed against that desire of our 2 nonstrategic assets exiting the portfolio, but we have no plans to sell any of our other domestic asset portfolios. We think that they play an important role in the 3-year plan. Our focus is on China, and we'll keep you posted should anything change as the year unfolds.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on kind of your Anadarko Basin acreage. I guess you guys have got about 225,000 acres. Just trying to get a sense of how much of that do you think has been sort of de-risked by the drill bit, and then kind of any color that you would have in terms of, I guess, call it, exploration versus sort of production drilling in 2014 there.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes. So, I guess on the first point, 225,000 net acres, that's about a 100,000-acre increase year-over-year. A big chunk of that was the deal we announced in August that led to our announcement of the STACK play up in the North. I would tell you that we're trucking along in SCOOP with regard to our drilling plans, and I think that we're well on our way in terms of having that acreage protected and taken care of. I don't have the exact count, but I would guess you're probably approaching 50% of the way home there. And we don't have any issues with regard to timing that are causing any issues of concern there. I will say that in the North, when we made the acquisition back in August, we looked at the lease expirations associated with some of that acreage that we've been chasing for a couple of years, and we went ahead and put the capital into extending those leases. So with regard to the STACK play, we've got plenty of time to just take care of that acreage and not feeling any stress in that regard today. Go back to some of the investor publications that we put out here over the last couple of months, on one of those were STACK. You see a parallelogram that's about 150 square miles that have been de-risked. And I think we've said in an earlier call that we thought we were somewhere around 40-ish percent on the acreage as being de-risked. Obviously we're a fraction of that in terms of HBP potential. But remember, each 10,000-foot lateral protects 2 sections. So I think those are the pieces that you need to be aware of, and we'll keep you posted as the year unfolds.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And I guess just with respect to your production guidance, looking at first quarter of 2014, just seeing that you guys are kind of guiding down a little bit sequentially, particularly on the oil. Is that just a function of the midstream issues that you've had in the Anadarko Basin? Is there anything else of sort of going on with kind of well timing in 2014 here?","Lee K. Boothby","No. That's exactly it. And again, we're guiding to the midpoint that we originally put out last year. And it would be important to note that because of that, a lot of that interruption was in the SCOOP area. It was affecting gas, therefore, it's mostly the impact of the NGLs in gas and not oil.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Brasler [ph] with Jefferies.","Unknown Analyst","I was wondering what you're expecting for Pearl proceeds? I know recently there have been a couple of transactions in Bohai Bay that imply maybe about a $200 million value to Newfield, so just trying to get a -- your guys' view on the value for all of China, specifically Pearl.","Lawrence S. Massaro","Yes, Dan. We're not giving guidance out right now on value expectations. You'll see we'll release next -- later this week in our 10-K, you'll see a $900 million PV10 number for China, that's after tax. We did see the Bohai Bay transaction, that's an asset transaction. What we're contemplating is a full exit. It's a corporate transaction. It's our sub, and so the 2 things, while related, are actually quite different. And we're hoping to get that done this year, and we'll update you when we have better clarity both on installation and the process.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. What is current production at Bohai Bay?","Lee K. Boothby","Our first quarter production in Bohai will total about 150,000 barrels.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, looking at the composition in the SCOOP and STACK, and kind of the conformity across the play, can you talk a little bit about the wells you've drilled to date, kind of the depth and the thickness of the areas that are targeted? And how that compares going forward? I'm guessing early on, you're targeting the thickest areas, but would love to get a sense of whether you've tested some of the center areas and is it showing the same sort of production responses?","Lee K. Boothby","Yes. I'll take that at a high level, and if Gary's got anything to add, Dave, after my comments I'll let him jump in. So certainly, the -- we've put plenty of geology out in terms of the Anadarko, Woodford East flank. I think it's well-documented, there's good well control. Generally the Woodford is thinner in the North and also shallower depths than we have down in the southern portion of our SCOOP acreage. So you do see a change running from north to south in terms of the depth of the target. The far southern portion of the SCOOP acreage is the thickest observation with regard to the Woodford. Up in the north, you've got thicknesses that might approximate about 1\/2 of that thickness that we see down in the South. I would tell you that be careful with each individual horizon. We go to STACK, we're talking about a 700-foot thick oil-saturated window. We've got Upper Meramec, Lower Meramec, Osage, Woodford. The important thing there is we've successfully tested and documented economic results in the upper horizon, that would be the Upper Meramec; and the lower horizon, which would be the Woodford, and we've just got some tests to drill in between. But we know there's oil, we've got good core data and put the whole story together there. So you'll see some variations of that. But I think that across the acreage footprints that we have, the thicknesses and the resource potential is well-understood, well-documented and good well control. I think those are the keys in terms of taking away. It's not a lot of uncertainty from a geological standpoint in that regard.","Gary D. Packer","The only thing I'd add to that, Lee, is, as you said, we've documented the overall thickness of the STACK to the North and the thickness of the Woodford to the south. The area that has historically been talked about being a little thinner was North SCOOP, so to speak. And I think industry data there recently has supported some pretty darn good well results. So we're now starting to see some of the thinner section still deliver competitive returns, and that's good to see.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. That's helpful and encouraging. And then maybe switching over to the Central Basin Uinta area. In the past, you did a little rail when you got bottlenecked and built up storage levels with respect to being able to process through refiners. As you look forward, do you think about, with success on the SXLs in those areas, maybe accelerating rail? Or do you look at that more in terms of beyond 2016 and providing additional legs of growth at that juncture?","Lee K. Boothby","Yes. As we sit here right now, the availability of rail is -- certainly still exists. But we have the gas -- we have the oil contracts already in place that commit us to the levels through the end of 2016, and we need to make sure that we honor those contracts. Anything beyond 2016 is certainly an opportunity, but as we know, those -- the rail contracts and those other refiners would require more material volume commitments, and we would need to see the Central Basin well results, more clarity on how those will produce over time before we could enter into those type of agreements.","Operator","It appears that there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Boothby, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Lee K. Boothby","Well, again, I'd like to thank everybody for dialing in for today's call. Thank you for your questions. As you can tell, we're excited and enthusiastic about the road ahead. Our teams worked hard to put us in this position, and I want to say thank you to everybody that's part of team Newfield in that regard.

Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for your interest in Newfield Exploration. I appreciate you dialing in for our midyear update today. I'll make some brief remarks this morning to supplement the detailed information we provided yesterday in our release @NFX and 10-Q.","Newfield posted a solid second quarter. Our domestic production in the quarter came in about 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 6% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our year-over-year growth in domestic production was up more than 30%. It was driven by the Anadarko Basin, where total volumes were 7% above the midpoint of guidance or 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Our second quarter production in SCOOP and STACK averaged 131,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to expectations of 123,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net liquids during the quarter averaged over 80,000 barrels per day and oil averaged more than half or about 42,000 barrels per day in-line with guidance.","Oil as a percentage of our overall production at Anadarko Basin was about 32% or slightly lower than the 34% implied with our guidance. Combined with our stronger-than-expected NGL production, liquids accounted for 61% of production stream in-line with guidance. We drilled some very productive, operated gassy wells in early 2018 in Western STACK. We've also participated in some gassier, non-operated developments at both SCOOP and STACK year-to-date. This led to the higher gas and NGL rates near-term.","Our year-over-year growth in Anadarko Basin was exceptional. The group barrels of oil equivalent by 45%, liquids by more than 50% and black oil by more than 40%. These are very strong growth numbers. In @NFX, please find an updated range for our estimated production volumes in the back half of this year. We are, today, significantly increasing our barrels of oil equivalent guidance for the year and reiterating our oil estimates.","In the Anadarko Basin, we expect that our net oil production will average 42,000 barrels of oil per day to 44,000 barrels of oil per day in the second half of the year. The range encompasses the inherent drilling completion and production timing uncertainties that exist with our large, multi-well development pads.","Our realized oil prices during the quarter were solid, driven by strong demand for the STACK barrels. We received a realized oil price in STACK of about $67 per barrel or 100% of NYMEX WTI. Refinery bids for our oil strengthened in June and our margins are clearly advantaged when compared against higher differentials in other basins today.","In China, we lifted 782,000 net barrels of oil in the quarter, slightly above our prior expectations of 750,000 barrels. We expect one to two liftings in each of the third and fourth quarters. The volume variance is simply due to the timing of our liftings, not dramatic changes in net oil production.","Capital investments across the company in the second quarter totaled $365 million, which was in-line with our guidance. Although total investments were largely in-line, CapEx in the Anadarko Basin year-to-date is around about $50 million to $60 million above our initial operating plan. This overage is primarily related to higher activity levels from outside operators, modest inflation and increased working interest in our HBP drilling programs.","As a result, we are today increasing our full-year capital investments by approximately $50 million to $1.35 billion. Importantly, we generated a cash surplus of $11 million in the second quarter, benefiting from higher-oil prices and stronger-than-anticipated production volumes. Although we don't want to opt out of high-return opportunities, we will continue to be disciplined and scrutinize all investments closely to live within our budget and transition the company to sustainable cash generation on the road ahead.","Our second quarter earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates. Adjusting for the items noted in our news release yesterday, our net income for the quarter would have been $189 million or $0.94 per share. Please see the Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of our second quarter release.","Second quarter revenues were $679 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $488 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $376 million. With investments and cash flow better aligned today, we managed to maintain cash on hand and ended the quarter with $293 million in cash. Consistent positive operating results combined with the expansion and extension of our credit facility in the first quarter of 2018, put our liquidity at the end of the quarter at over $2.4 billion.","From an operating perspective, we are performing well year-to-date. Here are some brief highlights from each of our active areas. We are continuing to see consistent, solid well results in STACK, where our activity is substantially focused on development. The information we are gathering from our infill pads today is very important. We have a very extensive database of infill wells in STACK, including the wells we have operated, participated in or traded for. We now have information on about 235 infill wells.","Here are a few of our recent lessons learned and the examples of how we are applying them to create value. Industry, as a whole, in every play where active development is under way is working to better understand parent-child well relationships and optimal well spacing and completion techniques. As we advance key resources into full field development, we are all seeking new and innovative ways to optimize infill well performance and our development project composite rates of return.","Although we don't have all of the definitive answers yet, we are seeing some encouraging early results in some of our recent infill pads as we seek to protect parent wells and minimize negative depletion effects across the DSU.","On some of our recent pads, we have been implementing refracs and pressuring up the parent before commencing the completion of the infill wells. We have also upsized completion job size on the number two well or the well closest to the parent and seeing improved results. Controlled flowback is also making a very positive impact on our long-term oil production rates and forecast rates of return.","Recent infills like the Stark and Margie developments are prime examples, where we have maintained higher reservoir energy during early flowback periods to maximize oil recovery, and ultimately, net present value. We plan to continue this practice going forward.","In addition, we've seen some recent successes in our SCORE program occurring in the Northwest STACK resource expansion area. We have been running a one-rig program to HBP approximately 24,000 net acres located in northeast Dewey County, where we have a high operating working interest. You can find more information on these recent wells in our @NFX publication.","Our wells in the Williston Basin continue to perform extremely well, with production up about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day year-over-year as we continue to run a single rig. At today's strip oil prices, we expect the Williston Basin will generate a cash surplus in excess of $130 million in 2018.","Our most recent Middle Bakken development was drilled west of the Nesson Anticline, and we are very encouraged with its strong production results. But more importantly, its success enhances the return profile of our remaining inventory in the basin.","We haven't said much about the Uinta Basin since our broader update earlier this year, but we continue to see very encouraging results. We're about halfway through our HBP program for the year with 10 wells turning to sales year-to-date. We are drilling and completing wells for less than $7 million and seeing 30-day gross production rates of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our net production in the Uinta is approximately 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up nearly 30% year-over-year.","That concludes our prepared update this morning. Know that we are focused on establishing Newfield as a company that can deliver strong net adjusted growth metrics and sustainable free cash flow. The second quarter of 2018 was a great stride in that direction.","Before we close, I'd like to thank the men and women of team Newfield. They do amazing work every day and make the difficult look easy and we appreciate their efforts, and without their efforts, we wouldn't post the strong second quarter that we have.","Thanks for your time this morning and your continued investments in our company. Operator, we are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our first question from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Lee, you guys called out the $11 million in free cash flow number for this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you would expect that to trend going forward and then any leading-edge thoughts on what you intend to do with that cash flow as the number becomes bigger?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","I would say that, Brad, we came into this year with quite a bit of uncertainly in terms of the oil price band. I think we talked about planning premise well below what we realized year-to-date. We've had the outstanding production performance. We've had price as a tailwind, with respect to the first half of this year, but we also had a strong hedge book to protect the downside. So, I think when you look at the combined effects of that, $11 million to the positive in the second quarter with the $67 million hedge book adjustment against that gives you some idea of the profitability of the asset portfolio today. And as we go through 2018 second half, we've got a pretty strong hedge book through the balance of the year. As we roll into 2019, we dropped substantially on hedge position to around 30% or so and we're unhedged in 2020. So, a lot of what happens on the road to the future depends obviously on the price path, but we're very pleased with what we've seen in the first half of the year and certainly ahead of schedule relative to the plan.","As far as what we will do on the road ahead with regards to the free cash flow, obviously we'll continue to look at the needs of the company and make smart decisions in terms of where we invest but we're going to consider all the options as cash builds in the balance sheet, distribution, buybacks as well as adding drilling activity in high-return areas as we want to.","Now, the goal is to get to free cash and we'll make the right decision as we see this sustainability in that area.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks for that. And then I was wondering if you could walk through the guidance for the rest of the year as it relates to oil. So, you guys obviously had a nice beatversus the guidance in the second quarter, but the third quarter point estimate is moving down to a range with the old point estimate at the top, so anything that's driving that? Is it just timing and some of the volumes are being pushed to the fourth quarter? Any thoughts around that?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I think that there are a lot of factors that impact it. I think we reiterated, first \u2013 I want to make it clear, we reiterated oil volumes for the year, so we're confident we're going to deliver the volumes that we told you we delivered at the beginning of the year. The reality of the large multi-well DSUs, timing and timing uncertainties I referenced in the earlier remarks are real.","We've got to manage not just what we do but we've got to manage in context with what our neighbors do to the left and the right of us as we work through the developments. So there will be, from time-to-time, some impacts mostly on timing. So there's timing uncertainty, but we're confident when we look at the mix of timing and outcome that we can deliver the volumes and we're going to stay focused on delivering the 2018 volume. So, the message there is, we're on track, no change in productivity assumptions for the wells, just trying to allow for the realities of uncertainty in today's market.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate it.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","No problem.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Sameer Panjawani from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please...","Sameer Panjawani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning, Sameer.","Sameer Panjawani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","In the Northwest STACK, you guys provided a good amount of color on that this quarter. I want to make sure, is that acreage that you're disclosing there incremental to your overall STACK position or is that just a subset of what you've already disclosed?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah, it's a subset of what we've already disclosed.","Sameer Panjawani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then how do you think about the variability in the oil cost in that relatively small footprint?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I think what it tells you as you drill, just like you've seen across SCOOP and STACK in general, as you drill up and down dip, you're going to be drilling different portions of the phase envelope, so a portion of it is just where you're located. We're also drilling at different intervals within the section, and I think it's been well documented that you can see slight variations across the areas as SCOOP and STACK had unfolded over the last several years.","So, we look at it as largely in-line. I think that the nice part about that acreage is that you've got a strong liquids yield, particularly black oil. That's what we bought it for. So, it's kind of an extension of the STACK trend up to the Northwest. Good piece of geological work and good piece of drilling and completion work on the part of our team to make that acreage go.","Sameer Panjawani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then on slide 6, you do a good job of breaking out the impact of the higher working interest and the higher non-op activity in the Anadarko Basin, but can you quantify the production impacts from both of these buckets in the first half of 2018, particularly I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how much oil was actually added for that incremental $60 million that you're spending to get a better apples-to-apples comparison relative to your original guidance?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","I don't have a split out rattling around my head. I think that the point of the slide is that the non-op production that we've had is, by definition, since it's West and down dip of our acreage is gassier in nature. That's what you're seeing in today's guidance. Non-op was probably, if I had to guess, you can follow up with Steve and Danny, but probably around 25% oil as compared to the numbers that we post.","So, the point of that slide there, when you look at the three-phase, which we present all our numbers with three-phase you can see that our oil yields are substantially higher than the acreage to the west of us, and NGL yields, as a consequence, has a very rich gas phase that goes with the black oil, is likewise very high. So, we've got on our operating production, 70% liquids mix, 34% gas versus 69% gas and 31% total liquids on OBO.","And these are strong economics. So, we're going to make economic decisions. It's what we do. I just counsel everybody that when you make those strong decisions on economics and you've got this mix, it's going to affect numbers slightly, fractional percentages from period-to-period and I think we've been consistent on pointing that out.","So, that's what you're seeing. Good investments. Good investments of OBO and non-op. I've told folks since the first half of this year, it's never a bad thing when people want to drill wells on acreage that you own. So, we're pretty pleased with the OBO results and we've got a great set of partners out there. So, high-quality teams, high-quality results.","Sameer Panjawani - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, all, and congrats on a strong quarter.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thanks, Derrick.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Lee, there's been a lot of discussion around disagreements between local officials in Kingfisher and state regulators over who has the right to regulate the flow of produced water. Can you take a minute to frame that concern and then discuss the impact it has had or may have on your operations?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Sure. I'll tell you what, I'll start and give you my perspective at a high level and then I'm going to turn it over to Gary Packer because he and his team are managing that issue.","I'll start with the first part of your question. Kingfisher County commissioners do not have the legal authority to regulate produced water. Oklahoma law is pretty clear that county commissioners have overstepped their jurisdiction. Regulatory oversight, those activities in Oklahoma rests with the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. So, as a result, we're optimistic the Oklahoma courts will strike down the ban that you're referencing.","We believe the produced water recycling that we've invested in, the infrastructure to move water around makes a lot of sense for industry, for our company, for the state and local citizens. So, I think we're in a good strong position there.","I'm going to let Gary give you some idea of the extent of that infrastructure, kind of the potential impacts which we see as minimal given the nature of our existing water infrastructure. Gary?","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Lee. As you can see in the slide deck that we put in there, we've made a considerable investment, about $80 million in the infrastructure out there and we see this as a big issue for the local community and it's less of a big issue for Newfield because of the investments we've made. We've laid the hard pipe up to very close to these wells and the lead to that just bridges that last portion in order to get this recycled water and produced water back to these fracs.","We think it's more of an issue of the need to continue to promote recycling, minimizing truck traffic. We think it's the right thing for the community, the right thing for the environment and it's really going to have very little impact, if any at all, on our drilling programs.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Derrick, I'll just add that to summarize my earlier comments, we in Newfield, our advantaged with our water infrastructure. Plain and simple, we invested in it, temporary lines are proven, keeps truck traffic down in the area, reduce road use, air emissions, you can win on all fronts.","2019 program that we've got planned as we roll out of 2018 is centered around the permanent pipe installation. So, I think the map that Steve and his team included at @NFX gives you some idea to the extent of that acreage. So, that's all true and we're also confident that the Oklahoma Corporation Commission will get to the right decision.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very good answers, Steve or Lee. And then just in terms of my follow-on, regarding your comments on positive infill development, could you quantitatively or qualitatively speak to the results you've seen from refrac in the parent well for both the parent and the child, and if that approach is something that you plan to replicate in your operations?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I'll tell you that it's still early. So, we're sharing kind of results that we've seen, so we don't have enough long-term performance at this point to give you a lot of color, but the early returns are positive. So, we've been able to pressure up and\/or refrac parent wells, and bring those wells back on line successfully.","We've also been able, with the upsizing our reference in the number 2 well create a pressure barrier that tends to protect the well further as you actually move through the DSU. You may recall when we went out in HBP acreage our team was pretty diligent in locating the parent wells along lease lines and leaving large swaths of acreage largely untouched. I think that's a positive as well.","And the other thing I'll reference, if you go back to the early days, in let's say, the first two-and-a-half to three years in STACK, we held our completions constant with the recipe because we wanted to see if there was any variability in terms of the reservoir as we moved across the acreage footprint. Those completion intensities would be considered pretty low in today's standards. So, the average back then was around 950 pounds of proppant per foot or 950 gallons.","So, when you think about what our team has been doing, I've said it many, many times, we've been planning for development since we made the discovery. And I think that's a big part of the difference. But ultimately, the results that get posted is a result of a lot of good work by the folks I referenced earlier, the men and women that are managing the asset for us in making these decisions. Not an accident.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for the additional detail and taking my questions.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We will not take our next question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Securities - Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, guys, Lee and Gary. Thanks for taking my questions. Gary, you and I have gone backwards and forwards over the years talking about type curves, development type curves, parent-child interference, all that good stuff. And it looks again that you're trending, at least in the Northwest, as part of your program above the type curve again.","And, I guess, my question is, the backwards and the forwards, there seems to be a debate over what does the inventory look like beyond the three-year development plan? And it looks to me that the risks on this curve are skewing a little higher again. Can you just characterize for us what you're doing differently, whether I'm reading this correctly and how you see the prognosis going forward?","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I think you're reading it correctly into the Northwest area. We are producing well above the type curve that we've historically generated. As you referenced, our prior interactions, Doug, we're going to play this out just like we've played it before.","We're drilling right now unbounded HBP wells. That program will be completed in the first half of 2019 and then we'll make some decisions about how we progress in the infill development. I suspect we'll see that in 2019. And at that time, we will see some adjustments in that type curve as they will come down as we have seen in several of the other plays.","I think we're going to play it right down the middle of the fairway. I would hope to see a very similar type curve in the Northwest area of North STACK to what we've seen. And at the end of the day, I mean our goal is to create the best returns in the overall bounded cube development. This isn't a STACK issue. This is something that we see now playing out in all resource plays out there today.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Securities - Merrill Lynch","Okay. So basically, the 1.3 million of barrels of oil equivalent, it looks conservative on the parent wells, but you're still comfortable lots of good development type curve?","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Absolutely, for now. Again, we have not \u2013 nobody has drilled any infill program out there, and I'm confident we can preserve that in development.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Securities - Merrill Lynch","Very clear. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Hi, Doug. This is Lee. Just one other thing to add there is our plan referenced the 1.1 million of barrels of oil equivalent to 1.7 million of barrels of oil equivalent range for wells drilled, and that's within the planning assumptions, which included price and well accounts that are well documented at this point. So I think, ultimately, if you go back historically the type curve was then around 1.1 million of barrels of oil equivalent. Of course, that's a mix of all kinds of different completions.","But I think that, ultimately, remember that we and others that are applying this development stage and resource plays are going to have to, real-time, make adjustments to our development in response to the macro commodity price environment we exist in. So, that's part of the equation as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Securities - Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the full answer, guys. My follow-up, if I may, is \u2013 and subsequently a follow-up to the earlier question on water handling. It's just really trying to put some parameters about it because obviously there's been a lot of noise around this. But when would you expect some kind of resolution from the state and, if I may, in the worst case scenario where there had to be, let's say, a temporary truck option, I know it's unlikely, but let's just take that as a scenario, what would it do to your costs capital and OpEx? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I'll jump in and give you some high level, and then Gary can pick up whatever I happen to miss.","So, first of all, because we have the water infrastructure, the lengths that we would be talking about or the distances we'd be talking about are very short. So, they're just short temporary jumpers that are put in place for a period of just a few months.","Ultimately, as you think about the permanent installation, if went that route, you're probably looking at something that would take a few thousand dollars, maybe $10,000 to $30,000 per well and the variable there is going to be just the distance involved to get completely around this issue.","But we say, again, I think that corporation commissions go through and the state will work the issues, and I think this will get resolved in the industry's favor but we're not concerned about it having a material impact on our operations.","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. This is not a big issue for us, Doug. This is more of a big issue for the community. At the end of the day, we can lay hard pipe in there if we need to; those options exist. As Lee alluded to, the fact that we have such a concentrated acreage position, this is really where it's going to shine in development where all this infrastructure we've invested in, we can really uptake advantage of that efficiency. So, this is not going to interfere with our programs.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Securities - Merrill Lynch","So, to be clear, pretty inconsequential, is that a fair way of characterizing it?","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Inconsequential for Newfield, a bigger issue for industry and a real big issue for the local community.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America-Securities - Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thanks very much, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Leo Mariani from NatAlliance Securities. Please...","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. Obviously, I guess at this point in the year, you folks have increased production guidance here twice in 2018. I know there's a little bit more CapEx associated with it, but I just want to get a sense of whether or not the well performance in 2018 may be tracking a little bit better than expected and is that one of the key drivers here behind the raises?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I would say that there are a number of factors. Obviously, if we weren't delivering results \u2013 strong results consistent with the plan, then we wouldn't have posted the strong first half. So, I think the first thing is that all of the assumptions our team built in are intact with regard to performance through the first half of the year.","Clearly, we've talked about the gas and NGL component. I think that it's important for people to realize that part of the increase in NGLs is that it's economically advantageous to process, and that's something that fits in a realm of us talking about making economic decisions. So, that decision in and of itself drives some of those volumes but it's also a good outcome in terms of when you think about the economics and cash flow kind of across the portfolio.","I've got no reason at this point to articulate any adjustments to the work product that has been generated that went into the plan. I think, most important, we referenced in the call is we've got five or six multi-well DSUs that are inset into the central portion of our footprint distributed along strike. That really \u2013 the results of those multi-well DSUs will underpin our three-year plan. So, that second half of the year watching those results roll off is going to be a pretty critical factor. But net-net, I'm very, very pleased with what our team is delivering for first half of the year in all fronts.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just a question here on hedging. Obviously, guys, very well hedged in 2018 and prices have done very well on the oil side. And just trying to get a sense of how you guys think about approaching hedging as you work your way into 2019?","I mean at this point, you kind of hit a free cash flow positive. Do you tell yourself that maybe we don't need to be as hedged, particularly in light of the fact that the curve is still pretty backwardated? Just trying to get a sense that there might be any subtle shifts in hedging philosophy as you work your way into next year?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","So, I'll take the first part of that then I'll flip it to Larry since we're both an active participant in terms of our hedge committee. I think that when you turn backwards, if you go back to 2017, remember how that played out. The average oil price was $51. We and others in the industry were striving to get the free cash flow generation. We saw buoyancy in the price, but it wasn't obvious that things were going to play out the way that they have. So, we hedged strongly to protect our \u2013 against the downside, but mostly to ensure our ability to execute and get to free cash flow positive conditions in 2018. So, that's how you think about the hedge book that we've got, that we're living with in 2018.","In general, we've held back for several months and haven't added to the 2019 position and we're wide open in 2020. And I think those are important points because it tells you we're fully exposed to the market in 2020, and two-thirds exposed to the market right now for 2019. So, that's just kind of how to think about it in the big picture, and I'll let Larry give you the color on the other points that you were asking about.","Lawrence S. Massaro - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Lee. Coming out of the price collapse and coming out of it with cash on our balance sheet kind of leads us to not having to hedge quite as much and certainly kind of mimic the forward curve as you see that backwardation, as Lee points out.","We've been taking advantage of going relatively short on our hedges; that's proved to be the right move for us and we'll probably see that going forward as long as the curve stays backwardated and affords us the opportunity to wait and capture maybe another $5 or $6 a barrel.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Thanks, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Biju Perincheril from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. Good morning. Lee, going back to the \u2013 sort of the new techniques for completing wells and to address the parent-child, can you talk about if there is any impact to well costs? Is that already included in your three-year average of I think, $7.6 million to $8.7 million completed well cost?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. I think the way to think about it is there's obviously incremental costs. Anytime we're experimenting, it's incremental cost. The costs are relatively modest when you think about spreading them across the DSU, where you've got six, eight, 10, 12 wells that you're talking about drilling.","The extra costs when you see it are probably going to be mostly in the area of some incremental water handling and LOE-type expenses. Obviously, there's cost for getting the equipment doing the work, but it's relatively minor when you look at it across DSU.","I would say that probably you're talking about something that's, on a gross basis, $1 million, $1.5 million, somewhere in that zip code is the kind of costs that are pretty modest. And if you're able to mitigate depletion effects relative to the parent, it's well offset with the production performance of DSU. That's the way we think about it.","And in terms of what we're trying to do, Gary, do you have any other color you want to offer on that?","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. At the end of the day, since we're oftentimes working in one of the original wells, it's going to materialize as a major expense and it's not going to show up as CapEx.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. And when I think about sort of the impact to that number 2 well, I would think it also depend on the completion design of the parent well; not just the fluid loading or proppant loading, but also the variables that control the frac length and can you talk about the evolution of the completion design on the parent wells? When did that change?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. So I referenced \u2013 I don't know if you were on the call earlier, but I referenced that in an earlier question. I think what's important to note if you were knowing everything that you and we in the industry know today, if you had a development and you could fast-forward six, seven years into the future on some new development with all the learnings that you've got, you would go back to time zero, and say, what I really want when I go through an HBP, the acreage are low-intensity completions, because I don't want to create problems for myself in development.","Well, what you have today is we stayed for three years with low-intensity completions to learn about the reservoir targets that we were setting up to develop. If you go back in that time period, the first three years or so in the play when we were talking about it, we held completion constant and we referenced 950 gallons by 950 pounds. So, 950 gallons, 950 pounds proppant per foot. That's half the intensity of the completions that we pumped on average in 2017 as an example.","So, our team already took the step on the front-end of planning for development with very low-intensity parents. There was a period and there has been, in every one of these plays because some of you listening on the call out there love big wells. I call it the nuclear arms race. My well is bigger than yours. And we've certainly drilled some big wells as well just to prove that, yes, our acreage is capable of showing those big wells.","The truth is we kept that to a minimum, and we kept it to a minimum for a reason because we knew we were going to have to come back and develop. The bigger the parent well, the more intensive the completion, the larger the stimulated rock volume, the larger the depletion effects that you have to deal with when you come back in development. So, just think through that as you think about the next iteration and the next play.","But as far as where we sit, I liked how our team attacked the development. It's been very logical. It's been methodical. It's been well thought out. And, today, we're mitigating those effects and having success, but I think it's all tied together with six or seven years of planning to get to this stage. I hope that's clear but that's the best answer I can give you. I'm glad that I....","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. No, that's helpful. Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. No problem.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Subash Chandra from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Lee, question on SCOOP, sort of look at the trajectory there. It looks like, you've got some activity level this year and next year, then peaking. Is that \u2013 do you consider that base production or is there a plan maybe, at a future date, to come back to the SCOOP?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I mean, there's upside in SCOOP and some of the other horizons that we've referenced; the Sycamore, the Caney intervals would be two that I would reference. There's also exposure down there \u2013 a portion of the acreage in the Springer, some of which is being actively drilled by industry today.","Ultimately, we also have the possibility of going back at the right place and time to infill the original development which we looked at in the Woodford that we look at today as having been underdeveloped, but a big production base. So, here's an example of the things people will deal with. You've got a big production base. It's cash flow. You're not going to go back and put that at risk, so...","And in fact by drilling through these acreage positions and developing them, you put some of the stages of development spread out over time. So there's lots of things that we can go back to there. Ultimately, we'll make the decision on investing there in the basis of how it competes within the portfolio. It's all HBP. It's about \u2013 multiple layers.","We're actively finishing up the HBP of North SCOOP as we speak as most of the production I referenced is now in what we called the South SCOOP. It's good there to hold, so we've secured the option for the future. And, presently, on all sides, there's tons of private activity. So, just sitting back and watching, we're building a database of how those things are going to perform.","So, right now, we're focused on pushing the development STACK, and we're still drilling wells down at SCOOP, but it will have another phase \u2013 probably sometime actively towards the back end of the plan or after the three-year plan would be my guess.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And any update in that McLean County area, EOG-type area?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. Well, I have to say what I've said before, it's nice having EOG as a partner. I'm glad that they have so many premium wells abutting our locations. I'm glad we got there several years before they've done it all. So, that's probably all I can say. We've got good well results there. It's part of our development inventory and Gary and the team will further that in over time.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Ron Mills from Johnson Rice. Please...","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning. A quick question. The 2018 production profile and the multi-pad completions has been well talked about, but when we look at 2019 and where the rates are going to be located on the multi-pad completions, can you give us some color as to where that activity is located within your phase windows? Is it more in the black oil window and when does that concept of row drilling really start to get completed?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","First of all, 2019 forward plans for STACK is going to be largely row drilling or you can call it bounded cube drilling, but there's lots of different phrases people are using it for but \u2013 using these days but it's all the same concept.","In general, we'll attack that moving from West to East. I referenced the five multi-well DSUs that we've drilled up on the leading edge of our development footprint in the three-year plan. We'll have that production information starting to come back to us in the back half of this year. All of that will be incorporated to further refine our forecast 2019 forward.","The fourth quarter is probably when you'll really see \u2013 if you look closely at the CapEx in the fourth quarter, part of the reason it's down is that we're shifting into drilling, the first-row drilling. So those completions actually hit early in 2019. We also, because you're going across the acreage in an orderly fashion, we're going to drill through areas that have different working interest. So, it just so happens where we're starting the working interest on average is down some 20 points over what we've done year-to-date, but it's the right thing to do. It's the right way to think about development and we're going to transition there starting late this year.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then on the Northwest STACK, it seems at least from the diagram in your presentation that the area where the Meramec becomes present again in Dewey County is relatively small. Do you feel like you've locked up a lot of the acreage around where that Meramec reappears?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. We didn't buy the acreage by accident. I think our geological team did some good work there identifying that geologic horizon that's existing in that place. That's why we capture the acreage. You're right. It's, in general, a smaller overall area extent and we like the acreage we own.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Okay.","Operator","We now have time for one more question. Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Please go...","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Lee, I know you have the three-year plan outlook for oil growth. I think it's 17% to 21% CAGR. Given current view on the second half of this year, what do you expect 2019 domestic oil production growth range could look like, say, if CapEx was similar next year?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah, I think I'll just reference the three-year plan. We've put a lot of work into it. We told everybody at the beginning of this year that it was planned. We can execute against. I think we're halfway through the first year of that, and I think the team is executing very strongly.","You have to concede that there have been a lot of changes in terms of \u2013 we talk about politics and markets and tariffs, and all kinds of things that you've got to incorporate into your decision-making. I think we'll stay on the schedule that we've developed over the last several years that will give you our best look at 2019 forward if there are any adjustments early in 2019, let's call it February of 2019. That's our plan.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","That's fair enough. And just lastly, Lee, when you look at Oklahoma increase in production taxes last year and then the issue that came up in Kingfisher County on the water transportation handling, how do you view the landscape there now regulatory tax-wise?","And then does it cause you to perhaps look to expand activity outside this stage or even perhaps look at entering a new area?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I would say that you can look at the results we're posting that despite all of what we call headwinds, we're still generating strong returns, strong growth, good strong cash flow from our assets, so I'd be remiss not to point that out. But clearly, the GPT is the most significant headwind that we've been handed.","The truth of the matter is there have been a couple of tax iterations in Oklahoma over the last couple of years, and the most recent adjustment, which was this year, is substantial. And I think that the focus from our standpoint as a team, management team and board, is we're going to work every day to call back what that GPT increase takes away and we'll keep all options on the table in terms of attacking that issue.","Ultimately, I'm confident, we're confident that Oklahoma officials understand the importance of our industry in the state and our company's investment in that state. So, we're counting on the leadership there to get things right and maintain Oklahoma's position as a competitive place to do business.","So, at this stage, we're monitoring the situation. We're on the frontlines. We're going to work hard to make up for the negative effects of the tax changes on the road ahead.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Thank you, Lee. Appreciate it.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. No problem.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","I want to thank everybody for dialing in this morning.

Please go ahead.","Steve Campbell","Good morning, and thanks for dialing in today. Following today's prepared remarks by our Chairman, Lee Boothby, we will have members of our leadership team available as always to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Let me also remind you again that today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website, along with last night's earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations as well as a very detailed @NFX publication.","We will reference certain non-GAAP measures today, so please see the reconciliations in our release and in @NFX.

Please refer to the risk factors as well in our earnings release and in @NFX.","Thank you again for dialing in today and your interest in our company. I'll turn it over to Lee Boothby.","Lee Boothby","Good morning, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter and year-end 2017 conference call. 2018 is now well underway, and we're excited to share our forward outlook with you this morning.","By now I hope you have taken time to flip through our @NFX publication. We provided a very detailed outlook for you, and we will reference many of these materials on this morning's call.","Before jumping into 2018 and our 3-year outlook, let me cover a few significant highlights from 2017. 2017 was another solid performance year for our company. In STACK, we executed an aggressive infill drilling program last year and rapidly advanced our understanding of how to best space and complete our pad developments to optimize returns.","With SVP [ph] requirements largely behind us, we're in a position to be able to maximize value creation, and our plan today is returns-focused. You will see in today's @NFX that we estimate our average STACK well in the 3-year plan will generate about 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent and have an average well cost of around $7.9 million.","This is a function of our planned construct. Well costs will vary from $7.5 million to $9 million depending on where the wells are located across our acreage, EUR flexes with well costs as well. We provide estimated EUR ranges of 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent for these wells. When factoring in the differences in well costs and oil cuts across our geographic mix, our rate of return estimates are high and average greater than 50% in the 3-year plan.","We've learned a great deal about well spacing and optimizing completions. On Page 14 in @NFX, we provide a long-dated well performance from our nearly 80 infill wells drilled to date. Note that this comparison includes all wells in which we own an interest, not selected disclosure of our operated wells where we control the spacing and completion designs.","We have proven relatively consistent well performance against the 1.3 million-barrel oil equivalent type curve and operated pads like Stark, Freeman, Dorothy, Jackson and non-operated pads like Keith and Ludwig have provided valuable insights, and as a result, we have confidence in high-return developments across the entirety of our acreage.","We moved early and aggressively to test various spacing configurations to ensure we have the proper science to build long-term value for our owners and development. Our infill tests to date range from 3 wells in a single layer of the Meramec to 12 wells in the full Meramec DSU development.","We have drilled spacing tests from west to east. This takes you from the deeper, more pressured gassy regions all the way through the phase envelope and into the far Eastern outer core, the black oil.","We're applying lots of historical lessons from our original development plans in SCOOP. Early on, in SCOOP, we spaced wells at only 5 to 6 wells per section. Today, we are actively developing SCOOP with 8 to 10 wells per DSU. We are matching the proper science and data with the specific attributes of the rock and tailoring our development plans to maximize well performance, returns and value creation.","We issued some exciting new results in our SCORE program today as well. Recall that last year, we embarked on resource expansion program to unlock additional producing horizons on our existing acreage in the Anadarko Basin. I'll talk more about SCORE in a moment.","In the Williston, we continue to drill the best oil wells in the business with larger completions and tighter spacing. We have achieved strong economics both on and off Anticline and are now testing 8 to 9 wells per DSU in our recent developments. 2017, we raised our type curve to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent to reflect recent well performance.","As a result of improved well performance in all areas, management of our base production and careful attention to costs, we delivered 10% year-over-year production growth in 2017. More importantly, we maintained a sizable cash balance throughout the year. This cash on hand will be used to balance the near-term differences between our cash flow from operations and our capital investments.","Proved reserves increased 33% year-over-year, and we replaced 390% of our production with new additions. At year-end 2017, SCOOP and STACK accounted for about 70% of our total proved reserves.","We continue down our path of gaining efficiencies, lowering F&D costs and improving our operating margins. Since 2014, we've improved our cost structure, largely to the growing scale of our Anadarko Basin operations and an intense focus on cost control to expand our margins. These seemingly ordinary steps our team takes each day to do things faster, smarter and safer are now translating to the bottom line.","Our 3-year outlook is well documented in @NFX, so let me provide some additional commentary around the highlights.","Our 2018 capital budget is approximately $1.3 billion, with 80% of our drilling completed investments allocated to our growth engines in the Anadarko Basin. At $55 per barrel of oil and $2.85 for MMbtu of gas, we expect that our investment levels and CapEx will align in the second half of this year.","Looking into 2019 and 2020 at the same price assumptions, we expect to generate more than $300 million of free cash flow, and at $60 per barrel of oil, the free cash flow estimate climbs to $1 billion. We have worked hard to transition our company to be able to deliver double-digit growth within cash flow and improve our debt-adjusted metrics.","Our 3-year plan projects annualized domestic production growth of 14% to 18%, domestic crude oil growth of 17% to 21%, and on a debt-adjusted basis, production is expected to grow 15% to 20%, and cash flows expected to grow 20% to 30%.","Our plan is returns focused. Yesterday, we received a number of questions around our oil growth trajectory in late 2018. Although the year-over-year growth is up, an impressive 20% at the midpoint, our commodity mix changes slightly in the fourth quarter. If we're going to manage our business for returns on the road ahead, we must also learn to be more commodity agnostic. We have some high-rate pads that are scheduled to pop in the second half of 2018, largely due to drilling schedules from HBP requirements. Because of their geographic location in Western STACK and SCOOP wet gas, natural gas content on these pads will be higher, but please note that the rates of returns are outstanding.","In today's @NFX, we provided an unprecedented level of transparency in how our 3-year plan was constructed. We've clearly articulated our deliverables, and on the road ahead, we hope this conversation with analysts will shift from simply growth to a more stringent focus on returns. We heard this mandate from our investors, and we aligned our plan and our compensation to incentivize these specific behaviors.","In addition, our 3-year plan was also designed to deliver steady-to-improving leverage metrics. We expect to maintain approximately $2 billion of annual liquidity throughout the plan period with no additional borrowings. As I mentioned, we work with our Compensation Committee to amend our annual incentive pay metrics for 2018 to include debt-adjusted production growth and cash flow per share metrics, a cash-on-cash return metric and a heightened focus on corporate responsibility. There's a slide in @NFX that provides you with details.","I'll turn it over to Larry now to cover the fourth quarter financial results.","Lawrence Massaro","Thanks, Lee. Today, we entered 2018 financially strong and are excited about our forward outlook. Due to fortunate timing on previous asset sales, lucrative hedging positions and quick adjustment we made to our investment levels, we were able to weather a very tough period in our business and emerge stronger. The foundation we have created has allowed us to develop the 3-year plan you see today. Let me quickly cover the 2017 financial highlights.","For the fourth quarter, both our earnings and cash flows again came in above Street estimates, and our production was right down the fairway for our most recent guidance. After adjusting for the items mentioned in our news release around refundable tax credits and unrealized derivative losses, our net income for the quarter was $143 million or $0.71 per share. For the full year, after adjusting for those items, net income was $432 million, or $2.15 per share, on revenues of $1.8 billion. Consolidated net production was 57.3 million BOE, up 10% year-over-year when adjusted for asset sales.","Recall in early 2017, we used what appeared to be, at that time, a conservative oil price of $50 WTI. It turned out the $50 was the right number. As we improved our cost structure and achieved better well performance throughout 2017, we were able to close out the year with a deficit of about $200 million funded by cash on the balance sheet. This excludes acquisitions and divestitures during the year, which largely offset one another.","Over the last several years, we have maintained a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x in the face of a very challenging oil price environment. Now that the cash flow from the assets has increased, we expect that our profitable growth with allow us to further delever. This could trigger credit rating upgrade in the period as we grow into potential higher credit rating, which should allow us access to a capital at premier rates due to the inevitable cycle in our business.","We are approaching 2018 with a very similar strategic mindset. Our budget is based on $55 WTI, and we have run plan sensitivities below above and below that assumption. With the significant portion of our 2018 production hedged in the mid-50s, we have insulated ourselves fairly well against downside risk. Likewise, if prices remain above $60, I doubt you will see us significantly change our operating plans. Our 3-year plan is a careful balance of capital discipline, debt-adjusted growth in production and cash flow and improving leverage metrics in an environment that we consider to be mid-cycle oil pricing.","As you can see in @NFX, we are forecasting significant free cash flow in the 3-year plan at a budget price of $55 oil and quite a bit more at $60 oil. The use of any free cash flow will all depend on the needs of the organization at the time. Like most companies, we will prioritize between reinvestment and acceleration of activity versus a return of cash to investor via debt repayment, share buybacks and dividends. The latter, of course, can be catalyzed with the sale of any significant noncore assets.","We will consider all options. As I told Lee, let's get -- let's just get to free cash flow first, then let\u2019s assess the road ahead and consider the financial needs of the company. Rest assured, you can count on us to make the right decisions for the owners.","With that, I'll hand the mic back to Lee.","Lee Boothby","Thanks, Larry. From an operational standpoint, we finished 2017 strong and are set up well for 2018. In the Anadarko Basin, we expect to drill nearly 550 wells through the course of our 3-year plan. Our program will be predominantly pad focused, and operational efficiencies will allow for more wells placed on production per rig.","2018, about 2\/3 of Anadarko Basin wells will be in STACK. Anadarko Basin net production is expected to grow from our 2017 average of just under 100,000 BOE per day to an average of approximately 185,000 BOE per day in 2020.","Late 2017, we began producing from the Velta June, the most technically advanced Meramec development to date. The Velta June was a collaborative effort by Newfield and our partners to test 12 well spacing in the Meramec formation alone. We drilled 4 3-well pads and focused on targeting, stage and cluster spacing optimization, various proppant loadings, proprietary techniques to optimize the volume of rock stimulating. Although early, flowback is encouraging and in line with expectations. This is a project that we will model and learn from for months to come.","Let me get off script for a moment and address the reaction on our stock price last year after a competitor in the basin referenced its far Eastern STACK results. As the Founder of STACK, we understand the play and have more data than anyone today, especially in the black oil window. We can identify the specific geological features that can lead to inconsistent or poor well performance as well as superior performance. Our Eastern acreage or the outer core of our position constitutes about 10% to 15% of our total STACK acreage position, and our leases were acquired 5 to 7 years ago at well under $1,000 an acre. There are reasons we have elected the past on previous acquisitions from private operators that may have had different objectives altogether when the drilled wells and identified sweet spots, pumped large completions and touted IP results. We have had a very careful and methodical approach to our HBP drilling. Recall that from the beginning, we referenced the importance of how wells against the section boundaries to preserve the best development options for the future. Behaviors are different when you want to own and develop an asset over a decade or more.","Others may have challenged economics going forward, but we are confident there is a lot of oil out there to develop at very strong returns. With the depth and quality of our inventory and so much time ahead of us to develop our Eastern acreage, it may be several years before we attack this area in STACK. We're running a marathon, not a sprint. And we have the time and the team to get it right. Now back to my script.","In @NFX today, we specifically called out the recent Jackson\/Florene infill and the Eastern black oil window, which tested 4 wells of a single Meramec layer. Take a look at the drawing. The original parent wells were in the Woodford, and we recently came back to test the lower Meramec. We estimate that the Meramec infills had an IRR of approximately 90%.","In 2018, we will follow up on our Jackson black oil development in the eastern STACK with several new pilots to test up to 6 to 8 total wells with results expected before year-end.","Our Stark development located in the (inaudible) oil window tested 10 wells in the Meramec and is one of the best return projects to date. After 9 months online, we're estimating 100% IRR.","As we said before, it's very early. To date, we have 8 operated DSUs where we have drilled infill wells. That's 8 out of about 300 total STACK DSUs we intend to develop over time. We are learning with each new pad and rapidly applying those learnings to deliver stronger returns.","Let me stay in the Anadarko Basin but switch gears and talk a little bit about SCORE, where we invested in resource expansion program to test the Sycamore, Caney and Osage formations. In addition, we tested an exciting Northwest expansion of our STACK program in the Meramec and continue to extend our SCOOP oil play to the north and east.","On Page 17 in today's @NFX, we have detailed map and highlights recent score activity by Newfield and industry. Within our 3-year outlook, we plan to invest about $350 million to drill around 80 wells in these play types. In the North SCOOP, an area where we and industry have recently been more active, results in the oil window have been highly encouraging and set us up for additional development opportunities in 2018 and beyond. Our recent Larry well was very strong with an IP30 of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Yesterday, we also released results from our Northwest STACK extension highlighting an area where the Meramec shale extends. Results are consistent and mimic what we have seen in the heart of STACK. We have an active HBP program planned for this area in 2018.","With a single rig program, we expect another year of growth in the Williston Basin where our teams are delivering best-in-class well performance in both cost and productivity. Williston is expected to deliver $90 million to $100 million of free cash flow for us in 2018. Last year, we raised our type curve in the Williston, and today's wells of estimated gross EUR of about 1 million barrels.","Lastly, the Uinta, an area that we have not mentioned in a few years, saw the return of some very prolific oil wells in the Central Basin. The team has done a great job of radically changing operations to cut well costs and improve well productivity and returns. This warrants $130 million that we are allocating in 2018 to HBP this valuable asset for optionality in the future. Over the last 2 years, we quietly executed a JV program that allowed us to test additional horizons, new drilling concepts and proved targeting and tailored completion designs. The results can be found in @NFX. We're extremely encouraged by the reduction in well costs and enhanced productivity from our wells.","So why is this significant? We have more than 225,000 net acres in that Uinta with nearly half located in the Central Basin region where industry has been posting some very strong results. The oil content in these wells is 80% to 90%. The basin is thick and overpressured with more than 4,000 feet of STACK hydrocarbon qual [ph]. The same line [indiscernible] that has worked so well for us in the Anadarko Basin also exists in the Uinta.","Before closing out to take your specific questions, let me summarize why we think this plan is a great value proposition for our stockholders. Our 3-year outlook is a strategic recipe to get the most out of our asset base today with targeting investments and high-return drilling programs to rapidly grow our cash flow. This plan moves us to a company that can sustainably grow double-digit within cash flow from operations. We have high confidence in our ability to deliver this plan. Over the last several years, we have significantly derisked our asset base and improved well productivity across the company, all the while strengthening our balance sheet. We have firm footing from which to execute on the road ahead.","I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year progresses. And as always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Dave Kistler from Simmons Piper Jaffray.","Dave Kistler","Morning, guys.","Lee Boothby","Hi, David.","Dave Kistler","Real quickly, I appreciate your comments about focus on returns versus mix. And clearly, obviously, the plan you outlined with improvement cash flow highlights that returns are improving as well along the way. But obviously, that volatility in what's happening with the oil mix as you're moving to pad drilling appears to be creating some angst for the market.","Is there a point in time where as you're going through the development process, that mix levels out? Or should we be looking out it and saying, \"Gosh, that wouldn't matter. It's about the returns at the end of the day.\"? And just would love more color on that, if possible.","Lee Boothby","Thanks, Dave. I think I'm going to start with the end of the question. I said in the opening comment, I think, 2 or 3 other times during the script, we're focused on returns. And we've got a high-return portfolio that's got depth and quality. Our teams are delivering top-tier results on every front that we choose to deploy them. And our view is that if we're generating higher returns, everything else takes care of itself. If you look closely at the plan over the 3-year period, you actually see the oil percentage does tick up over the course of the 3-year period. And my view remains, I think I've said this from earlier calls, that there's way too much focus on small percentage changes quarter-to-quarter. We don't control that. What we control is investing in high-return projects, and that's where our team has been tasked with.","Dave Kistler","Appreciate that clarification and definitely agree with your thought process there. Switching over to Uinta for a bit. Obviously, well results have improved on the margin likely better than that. Can you talk a little bit about what the well cost reduction has been and whether this truly competes for capital as a standalone asset right now or the decision to HBP stuff is just creating, call it, go-forward optionality between holding it or divesting it depending on how the return profile changes?","Lee Boothby","I'll start with the back end of that. Any asset under our charge, it's our responsibility, management and staff, to work everyday and maximize value of that asset. So we invest from time to time in assets to make sure that we're staying current, and we've got the best visibility in terms of the value of that asset within our portfolio. I think I've told you in years past, we've got an embedded grow, hold, divest mentality that lives inside our organization. It's alive and well. We invested in a JV program there over the previous 2 years. The team took learnings that we have from other areas of activity in Anadarko Basin and Williston Basin notably. Went to the drawing board with a blank sheet of paper and the challenge to drive costs down to get the project where it could be competitive within our portfolio. To give you a feel for how far they've driven costs down, we suffered through a couple of years, 2, 3 years early on in the play, when a lot of folks were still trying to tell whether it's a vertical play. We suffered through the early learnings on driving this play to its ultimate places of horizontal resource play. The suffering was that the well cost back in that time period was substantially above $10 million a piece. I would say, mid to -- mid-teens would be a more normal occurrence back then. Over the course of the last few years, our team's quickly driven the costs down below $10 million. And we presently sit in around where we drill and complete the wells that you see on that sheet of paper for around $7 million or less. So pretty dramatic improvement. It does move the play where it's generating competitive returns, but we'll have more to say about the Uinta on the road ahead. But very significant progress that's been made, large resource, and we're going to continue to work to drive value out of that basin.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Along the lines of the returns of the commodity, can you talk to how you see the STACK 3-year assumptions shifting in which it looks like the overall EUR seems to be rising but the oil component on an absolute percentage basis seems to be falling lateral length that's too? I know there's a lot of moving pieces in there, but can you just add a little bit more color on the next 3 years versus kind of what you were seeing 6 months ago?","Lee Boothby","Well, I think that what you're going to see that's different on the road ahead is the team's transitioning to development. We actually joked as we got ready for the board meeting that John Jasek has got its hands on the lawnmower, and he's going to be moving the lawn. And that's a nice way to say that we're going to go row-by-row and match through the acreage. So you'll see pad drilling, focus on returns, and we're going to take the wells as they come. Part of the mix in there is going to be that there'll be places where we drill 10,000-foot laterals, 5,000-foot laterals, there'll be a mix through there. I think the clarity that Steve and his team have given in terms of the release just allows you to see what the averages look like over that plan period. But we're marching forward with development. And we're taking it as it comes, and that's the plan that you see over the next 3 years.","Brian Singer","And then in your press release, you talked about some of the learnings and the information that you've gotten from the Velta June development, particularly on intra-well communication, flowback practices, completion, cluster efficiencies. Can you talk more about what the learnings are there?","Lee Boothby","I don't think we're ready to get into a lot of additional comments at this stage. I think we're working with our partners. It's still relatively early, I believe, that we're all very pleased with what we've seen. There are some proprietary aspects that was being learned, and I think that's information that's owned by our partners. So we'll work with our partners over time to -- at the right time to share that information. Until then, I'll just say that we're making real time adjustments on the basis of what we've seen, and we'll continue to learn and apply those learnings, and you'll see that in the results.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Derek with Stifel Financial.","Unidentified Analyst ","Lee, with regard to your 3-year outlook, what price conditions, both positive and negative, would force you to revisit that outlook?","Lee Boothby","Well, I think, the way -- as Larry described earlier, we kind of think about this as mid-cycle pricing. So it reflects kind of above and below our target range. Last year, we used 50. We did the same thing. 50 was a pretty good call. We're basing this at 55. I think the way I would think about it is you can see what the plan throws off when it gets 60 and above, throwing off a lot of cash. We're well hedged in the short term, so it comes down to how does the commodity move 2018, '19 and '20. So we're well protected to the downside in '18, which means that if prices were to fall lower, we don't have to adjust our plan materially in 2018. We'll keep our eyes open for signals from the market on what the right pace of activity is as the '19 and '20 pricing develops a little bit of clarity. I think you well know that the curves are backward dated today, and we're going to be judicious in terms of how we think about building our hedge book over time. But I think we're in good shape, and $5 move in oil prices, 2018 to the upsides, another $80 million to $100 million cash flows is a way to think about it. And again, we are insulated to the downside.","Unidentified Analyst ","Great. And for my follow-up, regarding the SCORE initiative. How would you characterize the results you've attained to date? I mean, they're better than we were modeling and projecting, but do they change your development for you guys over the next 3 years?","Lee Boothby","Well, I think what they do is we knew that we had oil saturated rock that we had high expectations that we and industry could drill horizontal wells in that would be ultimately competitive in the portfolio. I think we and the industry, there's a lot of other wells on that sheet that are drilled by other companies. I think it proved back and spaced, so I think all of the 3 intervals that we eliminated, the Sycamore, Caney and the Osage, that drilling activity, that resource has been substantively derisked like how the wells are dispersed around our acreage footprint, that gives you as an investor confidence in that resource. The challenge then becomes the learnings as we go through these multiwell DSU developments with a focus on returns and the challenges for John Jasek and the teams on the operating front are going to be how to fetter in additional work there and continue to work to progress those horizons so that we get the right projects at the front of the line. That's where we're going to be focused. And if it turned out that the right project on the front of the line as a Sycamore well, you'll hear us talking about Sycamore. We also mentioned the extensional work that was done, which I think is substantial North SCOOP, an area where EOG is coming and drilled some wells as well. It's another new entrant. And we where we announced the 2,000-barrel a day, 30-day rate on the Larry well, I think its evidence of that. I think our teams have been patient. But we are focused on working really, really hard. Let's call it sense of surge urgency to do the right things right and give the answers early because it's important to get it early so that you get it right early. And that's one of the big challenges for the team. So we'll continue to juggle those investments. We're investing in some 80 wells and those horizons that were derisked with the 2017 program in the 3-year plan. And it will be my expectation that you'll see a shift over time to various parts of that portfolio depending upon returns, commodity mix, macro, all the things that we use to judge where we want to be drilling. But we're very pleased with what we've seen from the SCORE program. And I think it gives us a good visibility on the integrity of the section that we need to be planning to develop, and we clearly achieved the objective expanding the resource. I think we got 3 billion barrels plus now in the Anadarko Basin alone.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ron Mills","Lee, just a little bit of a follow-up on that. When you think about potential for \"cube development\" and folding in the Osage, Caney, Sycamore, given how present they are across your STACK and SCOOP positions from a longer-term development standpoint, how do you fetter those in to the development of a DSU in a timing standpoint?","Lee Boothby","Yes. So I think, first let me take you back, and I mentioned this in the comments, prepared comments earlier, but take you back to what our team did to the fullest extent possible where we're in HBP mode. Generally, we drilled 10,000-foot laterals everywhere we could. We drilled those laterals on opposite sides of the lease line to keep those wells close. That was coming in the early stages of kind of getting some indications what interference might look like overtime. The other thing it did for us is it locked virtually $2 million -- not $2 million -- excuse me, 2 miles of undisturbed ground between that well and the next well that we drilled to HBP, the offsetting some extra. And we marched through the acreage in that way because we knew that we didn't know the answer. We knew we had the acreage in the HBP, we didn't know the answer to what the absolute final development spacing might be. We talked a lot about the last couple of years about the macro, prevailing commodity prices being part of the equation. We've talked about this being a 3-dimensional geometry problem that the team is working on. There's probably got a lot more to mentioned that when you think about completion mix and intensity and all the other things we're testing as well. But clearly, I think, we'll have the bias for developing to the fullest extent we can the economically viable section of rock that we see in particular DSU. And that's going to vary from location to location. We've got some ideas and, we've actually had some tests that we'll probably talk about during the course of this year that John and our team call interface tests. That's where we're drilling interface between Osage and Woodford. And we've had some interesting and encouraging results there. But that's all the setup. That development is being part of the ultimate development cube. So I think there's a lot going on there, and we have some test planned in '18 that'll help us advance that ball in 2018.","Ron Mills","Great. And then on Slide 14, we showed the 78 infill wells and the performance versus the new -- or the 1.3 million curve versus your 1.1. A little bit more color behind that in the sense of, is there a little bit less parent-child relationship than you may have expected? Or is it a combination of maybe that was all of the well design, completion design lateral target enhancements that have driven that a little bit higher?","Lee Boothby","Yes. So I think what you got there, very simple terms, is showing kind of the schedule for all the 78 wells, which were infill wells, which are drilled completed and initiated production in 2017. The blue line on the curve tells you the kind of the total well count. And then as you move across, tells you that we started with about 20 wells at the front end of the year, which were kind of carryover wells from the preceding program. And you can see how that ended in. Now the brown line is very simply the (inaudible) plot against that well set. And the 1.3 million barrels is shown for reference because that's the average of our plan generates over the next 3 years. So what I would tell you is it should give you some level of comfort that the types of wells that we're going to be drilling on the road ahead are going to look a lot like types of wells that went into the 2017 brown curve. That's what I would take away.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kelly with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst ","I got a couple here. So as the play leader, you guys have continually shown that you can deliver top-tier wells, particularly in the black oil window. I was wondering if you could talk about that Steven well in Eastern Canadian County, which is part of your score appraisal. The result looked better than peers in the same kind of step-out area. Wondering if you can talk about the completion design, particularly the lateral length, and whether the Osage\/Woodford is the optimal target for that area.","Lee Boothby","I'll tell you what, I will leave some of the details of what you asked about the discussion. What I'll reference in the answer to one of their previous questions. That is on interface test. So when you think about that location, that well, that's Woodford\/Osage. If you like that well and we do, that gives you a hint of what some of those wells might look like on the road ahead. And I think in total -- total lateral length, that's -- I think that was somewhere around 8,400, 8,500 feet, somewhere thereabouts.","Unidentified Analyst ","Do you think double laterals work better in that area rather than singles?","Lee Boothby","Double laterals, you mean SXLs, the 10,000-foot laterals? Is that what you mean?","Unidentified Analyst ","Right, exactly.","Lee Boothby","Yes, we're believers in 10,000 laterals. Have been for a long time. It's the most efficient development, makes a lot of sense.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Lee, quick question again. You didn't talk in a while you were sort of stepping up the amount of stand and fluid in the wells. And I know that it's not really the end-all, be-all. But what's your comments on that the states where you sit with that?","Lee Boothby","Well, I mean, we're not opposed drilling big splashy wells that get everybody excited from time to time. We've been more focused on what's the right way to develop a play, and I think that one of the things we were careful to talk about is we and industry, we're upping being fluid volumes and proppant concentrations over the last 2, 3 years as there's clearly been a direct relationship between volume pumped, proppant fluid and rate and EURs. So clearly, bigger volumes, bigger wells, and that was always an unbounded circumstance. And the part we were always careful to say is we're not (inaudible). We can certainly nod our heads when we see that. But we don't believe that the biggest job size is necessarily the right solution in development where you have to deal with other issues of drainage, interference, optimal vertical and lateral offset spacing. We really want to keep the stimulated rock volume on the high fracture intensity opposed to the wellbore maximize the recovery out of that stimulated rock volume. And I think with some of the larger wells, you got to worry about reaching out farther and maybe causing issues for yourself in development mode, and I think that's some of what people have suffered through that came behind some of the private operators that all they cared about is drilling big wells and telling you guys that 5,000-foot wells were the rest answer and all the rest of the stuff, we had to suffer through 4, 5 years ago. But they're gone, they took their bag of money and now it's time to develop the assets. And I just want you to know, we've been focused on getting ready to develop the assets, and we started. And we're excited about the road ahead because we've worked hard to get here.","Neal Dingmann","Great points, Lee. Just one follow-up, in the Bakken, we've seen a couple of operators like Marathon today, has really opened up choke sizes and seeing just some enormous IPs. Your thoughts when you see that? I mean, what is concerned choke size versus sort of choking those down and looking at the well data or the wellbores there.","Lee Boothby","Look, every operator is going to have their thesis on what they're doing and probably all have their own pressures and questions that we're getting peppered out. I'm going to stay pretty consistent. I'm not a believer. I grew up in production and reservoir engineering is kind of where I spend my time. I understand all of that stuff and I know that splashy IPs are splashy IPs and. Sometimes, they don't really tell you what's ahead. Our team has done a lot of good work moving back to STACK. I think we've done similar work in the Williston Basin as well, but the Stark pad that was mentioned, yes, earlier, several times during the course of last year. One of the really cool things they did there is they didn't maximize the early production rates out of those wells. Now we are telling about 100% return out of the 10 well-known DSU in the Meramec. Pretty exciting stuff. If you look at some of the early wells that were drilled around that area, and it'd be easier for you guys to find, you'll see some really high splashy IP rates. But you also saw some very high decline rates with those. So in places you have big IP rates and steep decline rates, the reservoir engineers are probably going to get more nervous overall and wonder if they are doing more harm than good. So I just think that it's probably best that you guys keep asking your questions, but let's have some balanced discussion about this particularly as we move into the development because these things maybe were important, you guys play with being derisked and then unfolding HBP. I believe we are going to do less and less reporting kind of on the road ahead. That's my personal view.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Marshall Carver with Heikinen Energy Advisors. [ph]","Unidentified Analyst ","I'm looking at the Newfield from the beginning of 2017 when you were showing 10% to 15% domestic growth with the flattish spend in '17 and '19, and that looked like it was based on $50 to $60 oil. Now you have decided to accelerate with 14% to 18% growth at approximately the same price in the midpoint of $55. I guess, what was the main thing that gave you the confidence and desire to accelerate spending versus a year ago? Or is this more than one thing? What are the primary reasons?","Lee Boothby","Well, I think one is the progress that we made for 2017. We aggressively invested in multi-well DSUs. I mean, that was something we featured in 2017. And we were careful to say we don't know what the answer is, but we're going to go up aggressively test these multi well DSUs and get the information. That was something, I guess, we spent most of the first half last year answering questions on. I can tell you now, looking backwards, I'm glad we did because we got a lot of great information. And the really cool thing is most all of those were very, very positive, right, in terms of how they worked out. So we've got that information now to incorporate our development. That gives you confidence to say, \"Hey, now we -- this is not uncertain as it might have been in the times past.\" We also feel that the back row environment little bit better, like 10% better than we felt a year ago when we were planning around $50. And then the efficiency gains of the team demonstrated returns while the rest of that's just math at that point. So we want to set a path, we're returns focused, we want double-digit growth inside of cash flow, we want to be sustainable. That's kind of where our focus is. And I think we also did some cool things in '17 that were part of the forward plans in terms of completion intensity, frac intensity, et cetera, that I think warrants good results as well. So there are a lot of contribute factors come up sizing of the job over what we have previously. I think we design the program around 2,100 by 2,100. Most of our wells that you see in '17 are of that intensity, just for reference.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay. I guess, as a follow-up, what percentage of them else would you say are in development mode in 2018 versus 2017 in the Anadarko Basin?","Lee Boothby","Well, I could argue that almost everything we're doing is going to be development mode since we're HBP in all those areas. The only question you can say is development will be around Northwest STACK, where's we're HBP-ing that acreage. So we've got, I don't know, a couple 2, 3 dozen wells planned up in that area there. And then the North SCOOP extension that I referenced earlier, we probably got a similar number of wells planned there make sure that acreage is kind of secure. So if you take those out, the total, it'd be something well north of 80%. 80%, 85% would be my guess. It's off the top of my head. But you can circle back with Steve, Danny, and they can give you details on that. I know, at present, to start 2019, 100% of the wells being drilled right now our development mode, just FYI.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Leo Marioni with Alliance securities. [ph]","Unidentified Analyst ","I was hoping you could talk a little bit to just that kind of the cadence of the production in the Anadarko Basin this year. Just kind of looking what you guys put slide deck. I mean, it looks like fraction might be down just very slightly in the first quarter. Kind of has a little bit of growth in the second quarter, but then kind of really accelerates in the back half year. Just kind of curious as to whether or not there's any particular maybe field constraints or infrastructure issues that are sort of causing this or maybe just kind of transitioning to doing a lot more in each pad. Maybe just kind of talk through that dynamic and how that's playing out.","Lee Boothby","Yes. There are a number of items. First off, I want to complement our team. I think they did a great job of fighting through the end of the fourth quarter first then the start of the first quarter of '18. It's getting far enough into the year now, getting out cold and West back then. So we had a number of freezing issues and challenges in our operating areas out of the Oklahoma and Williston. My guess is that we probably deferred but lost on the first quarter numbers that you're looking at, and we probably deferred something in the 3,000 to 5,000 BOE per day lost to weather just in that time period. So that's incorporated in that pie chart.","Unidentified Analyst ","All right. That's helpful, for sure. I guess, just high-level question here on the Anadarko Basin. Just kind of you guys obviously drilled a lot of wells, drilled a lot of wells and partners as well out there. I guess, one of the issues that kind of continues to come up is just being in areas with higher pressure versus lower pressure out there. Do you guys see any meaningful difference in the economics, whether in your slightly higher pressured environment or not?","Lee Boothby","Well, I think that we've been pretty consistent. It's something, I think, you can -- we see strong wells that we're participating in and drilling in. When you get into the wet gas condensate, black oil, just think of that portion of the portfolio, very strong returns across that -- those portions of the base. That's true both in SCOOP as well as STACK. Generally, the deeper, higher pressure areas will have higher IPs, rates, EURs. They've also got generally higher well costs. So for us, it's just math. But we frankly like investments in all 3 of those ranges, and I think that activity with industry over the course of the last couple of years, particularly in the northern portion of the play STACK, we and our friends in the play have been largely focused on the wet gas condensate and volatile oil because of the prevailing macro commodity prices, $45, $50 where we started that. That's the place he can go to get really strong returns. So I think you can see demonstrated in the play, the major operators, the focus has been on returns long before returns discussion became so popular as it is today. And then I've referenced the example in the call, and that was Jackson\/Florene pad that we drilled well into the black oil window. And the Meramec wells we added there, 90% returns. So there's been a lot of discussion about it. I mean, look, I'll take higher pressure where you get it. We're not afraid of lower pressure largely drill good wells. I think there's been too much talk about pressures, magic. I'm going to say something I've said for a lot of years. The magic comes from the team. And we've got a great team, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. They're going to kick ass and take names in this development.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern","Lee, I guess sort of a follow-on to the last question. Just thinking about where to drill in the Anadarko, I think, you explained the sort of oil growth this year as being drilling some gassier wells that are higher rate in the second half of the year. Why is it that those are sort of the dots that are lining up on the map versus the oilier wells, just given that obviously, gas prices haven't done much but oil prices are higher for a couple of years. Are you thinking about the gas wells just having a greater rate change in improving more overtime than the oil wells? Or sort of what's leading that the best economics right now?","Lee Boothby","Well, I can't say that we're really excited about drilling. You haven't heard me use the phrase dry gas. Generally, if we're drilling gassier wells, it's because the wet gas condensate or volatile oil. Most of the guys that we referenced is coming from -- as an example, if you go back to the fourth quarter of '17, we talked about OBO, 10-well OBO DSU that had come online down the SCOOP and making in excess of 200 million cubic feet per day, and I think we have 30-something percent working interest. That's all it took to skew the oil percentage in the quarter just very small amount. So as you have these gassier multiwell pads, which are a lot like when we used to turn on offshore platforms come in line with big production rates, they're going to skew small percentage points one quarter to the next. But the key, go back to the comments earlier in the call, is are you generating high returns, and the answer is yes, we want our team to continue to invest in those. So it's just a function of where industry is drilling. Usually, they are HBP activities, some of this that could be taking place as well. We've got some extensional HBP work ourselves out to the Northwest. Some of that's a little bit gassier as well. But we're not chasing -- after you've heard anything today, we're not trying to absolutely manicure micro percentages on the various product mix. We are chasing returns, and we'll let the product mix fall where they do.","Brad Heffern","Okay. And then on the SCORE, all the Osage wells on the slide are 5,000-foot or less lateral, other than that one interface test. Is that just a coincidence or is there some reason why you might not be able to get down to longer lateral in the Osage?","Lee Boothby","No coincidence. I'd say stretch your EMV dollars farther. So they're drilling 10,000-foot test in the horizon you're trying to derisk. Our team is pretty smart. They drilled 5,000-foot laterals, and they got 2 or 3 more wells out of it. So it was just the right plan to go out and get the information we needed to derisk the resource. And we have already drilled 10,000K Osage wells for the record.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to your host for any additional or closing remarks.","Lee Boothby","Well, I'm going to say thank you again for your time, your investment in Newfield. We look forward to updating you on our plan as the year unfolds, and we'll see others soon. Take care.","Operator","That concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.

For opening remarks and other housekeeping items, I will turn the call over to Steve Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Campbell, you may begin.","Stephen Campbell","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for dialling in today. Following this morning's prepared remarks from our Chairman, Lee Boothby, we will have members of our leadership team available to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Let me remind you today that this call is being recorded and will be available on our website along with our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations and @NFX. We will reference certain non-GAAP measures. So please see the reconciliation in our earnings release and in our @NFX publication.","Today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions that are based on our current views and reasonable expectations. In summary, statements in yesterday's news releases and @NFX and on this conference call regarding our expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including those we've described in our earnings release, @NFX, our 10-K and 10-Q, our prior outlook releases and other filings with the SEC. Please refer to the legends in our earnings release and @NFX for more information.","Thanks again for dialling, and I'll now turn it over to Lee Boothby.","Lee Boothby","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for your interest in Newfield Exploration. We will strive to keep our remarks relatively brief today, and we'll welcome your specific questions at the end.","As you can see from our first quarter results released yesterday afternoon, we are off to a great start in 2017, and we're building important momentum that will carry into 2018 and beyond. We remain confident that our near-term business plan is aligned with today's market realities.","When we released our 2017 outlook in February, we discussed our expectations for continued volatility in the crude oil markets as inventories around the world were worked down and OPEC cuts helped accelerate the balance in terms of global supply and demand.","Our 2017 plan was conceived with these realities in mind, and we used a $50 oil price for our budgeting scenarios. Our plan was carefully constructed to achieve several important objectives.","First, we've set the organization on a course to balance investments with cash flow, while sustainably delivering double-digit growth in the future. We minimized our outspend in 2017, and we anticipate achievement of balance within our planned period at mid-cycle oil prices.","In the immediate term, any outspend can be funded through cash on hand, which today totals about $500 million. Our spending levels were carefully set to ensure that we maintained a strong balance sheet and managed leverage during a period of continued oil price uncertainty.","Secondly, our plan was built to advance our learning curve in STACK through initial infill drilling on multi-well pad. It's imperative that we collect the necessary data and information now and use it properly to plan for the full field development.","The information we are collecting today related to geologic targeting, infill well spacing, completion design and flow-back practices will help us maximize our future returns and create long-term value for our shareholders. We owe it to you to get it right.","Third, we have some critical deliverables around exploration and the assessment of other liquids-rich targets on our acreage. 2017, we allocated about $100 million to test prospective horizon on acreage we own and control today.","In the Anadarko Basin, we affectionately refer to this program as our Sycamore, Caney, Osage, Resource Expansion, or SCORE for short. In terms of sequencing, it's important for us to understand the full scale and scope of our SCORE program in order to properly develop it. We're very encouraged by some of the early results we are seeing in SCORE today and look forward to sharing more information with you later this year as we collect more results from a larger subset of wells. So stay tuned.","And fourth, ensure that we timely identify any potential bottlenecks or roadblocks to our future development plans and move proactively to mitigate them. Newfield has a history of controlling its operations.","In fact, it was one of our founding business principles attached, etched in stone by our founders nearly 30 years ago. We've added several slides in @NFX today that summarize these important activities, which are setting Newfield up for full field development and STACK.","Recent steps we have taken to ensure firm residue gas takeaway, oil pipelines into new attractive markets and the ability to source and recycle water will continue to aid our execution and differentiate our company in the market.","We've increased our capital budget by 10% and adjusted the midpoint of our expectations for full year domestic production higher by nearly 2 million barrels equivalent. In February, some of you questioned our capacity to go faster.","We certainly have the organizational capacity to do so. And today, we are electing to lean in to some of the year-to-date successes we are seeing in our drilling and completion programs. Our increasing production profile and improved cost structure is helping to offset our revised spending outlook.","The increase in our capital budget is primarily related to greater operated and non-operated activity, allowing us to build on recent successes with enhanced completions, our ongoing optimization of full field development plans and incremental activity in active areas around us.","From a production standpoint, we are running ahead of our forecast early in the year. As a result, we bested the midpoint of our original first quarter production estimates by about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Our early momentum is expected to carry through the remainder of the year, and we raised our production estimates by nearly 2 million barrels of oil equivalent. Higher production levels are expected to add incremental cash flow during 2017 and help offset our near-term outspend at current oil prices.","The trajectory of our production today should lead to an improved outlook for our 2018, 2019 plans as well. We'll make the appropriate adjustments for our 3-year plan later this year or early next as we continue to collect important data from our STACK development plan and gain more clarity on commodity prices and our investment levels.","Let's briefly cover our first quarter financial and operating results next, and then we'll close with an update on the Anadarko Basin. Our domestic production in the first quarter was 12.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Total company production in the first quarter was 13.1 million barrels of oil equivalent. Of the total, 62% is liquids and 38% was gas.","For the first quarter, we had net income of $0.73 per diluted share. After adjusting for the effect of unrealized derivative gains, net income for the first quarter was $114 million or $0.57 per share, exceeding consensus estimates.","Our revenues were $417 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $167 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $243 million. Our cash flow closely matched our capital investments during the quarter. We included a table in @NFX that outlines our investment, which totalled $216 million in the quarter, excluding capitalized interest and overhead.","Our cash operating expenses for the first quarter stated on a unit production basis were also below our guidance ranges. You can see the continued positive improvements we have made in our cash operating expenses, and this should lead to improved profitability in the future.","Let's now talk in more detail about the Anadarko Basin. 2017 is a big year for us in the Anadarko Basin. We're gathering critical information that we will apply to our future development drilling campaigns.","This year, about 85% of our total capital investments will be allocated between SCOOP and STACK. We have our sites focused on several key objectives today in the Anadarko Basin. I'll provide a quick update on each of these before moving to Q&A this morning.","Let's start with an update on enhanced completions and the superior results we're seeing through the application of higher fluid and sand concentration. Over time, our average completion design has increased significantly to our standard today of 2,100 pounds of sand and 2,100 gallons of liquid per foot.","We're testing a few jobs that are significantly larger as well and tweaking multiple variables in our completions to identify the best path forward to maximize value. These variables include fluid chemistry to reduce friction, the use of diverters and dissolvable frac plugs, increased frac stages and stage lengths along with tighter perf clusters, hybrid fluids to maximize delivery and stimulate more rock volume, micro-proppants and the list goes on.","Year-to-date, we've completed 15 wells with the new 2,100, 2,100 completions, and the results continue to be very strong. These wells are outperforming our 1.1 million barrel type curve by a significant margin. This brings me to our second objective this year, to determine the ideal well spacing for future development drilling.","Newfield and our STACK peers are all working to solve the same equation: how do we create the most value through optimal well spacing and completion designs at today's oil price and service cost outlooks.","We are focused on better understanding how our development wells will perform when drilled in close proximity on multi-well pads and completed with our optimized designs. Although, we certainly won't have definitive answers this year, the information will help us to better define our optimal development well type curve.","Most of our activity in STACK this year will be on multi-well development pads. In fact, we haven't completed a new well in the last 60 days. We have 3 development pads in progress, with 10, 10 and 12 wells being drilled in the Meramec alone. We expect to have early flow data from these initial pads late this summer.","For the full year, we expect to drill 10 multiunit well spacing units and participate in several others to test varying horizontal and vertical spacing configurations as well as individual horizontal targets.","Third, we are ensuring our execution through control of operations. This entails the early identification of our future infrastructure needs and any potential bottlenecks that could negatively impact the timing or field-level operations.","This is a key ingredient being recognized as the top tier E&P company and frankly, it's often overlooked until it's illuminated by a problem that slows growth or impacts returns. Newfield has proven and experienced teams in place with a track record of superior execution. I can assure you that our personnel are on top of the issue identification and their timing of litigation the same.","In @NFX, we outlined 3 of the critical components we are focused on today. The first is gas takeaway. We recently signed an agreement with Enable for a ground field expansion of an existing system at favourable terms.","This 10-year agreement will provide 205 million cubic feet a day of takeaway by October of 2018 and get us to preferred markets along the Gulf Coast. Because it's not a Greenfield project requiring FERC approvals and is limited in its construction scope, we have high confidence in the timing of this expansion on our behalf, and it will meet our future need.","Access to premium oil markets. We're fortunate that the preponderance of our acreage is located in the black oil window. We moved early to incentivize a new oil pipeline for Newfield crude into Cushing, allowing us to receive a higher realized price. On Slide 8 in @NFX, we show the improvement in our historical differentials for our STACK barrels.","Water management. By year-end, we will have a cumulative investment of about $100 million in water infrastructure. This includes about 100 miles of water piping and an extensive network of intra-field water storage.","Our most recent investment is in the Barton water recycling facility, which will be operational later this summer. It's critical for Newfield to control its water chain and sourcing through use and recycle, and we will work to limit the amount of water that is ultimately disposed.","Lastly, we're actively assessing our SCORE program and the significant resource potential that exists in multiple STACK players across our vast acreage position in the Anadarko Basin.","It is important that we timely assess these horizons. And if proven commercial, understand where they rank in our portfolio and how we will incorporate them into our plan developments. We look forward to sharing an exploration update with you later this year. So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Before we open up the lines to take your questions, let me quickly summarize the key takeaways from today's call.","Know that we are very confident in our business plan. We think this is the right plan for the realities of today's volatile oil markets, and we have carefully balanced our investment levels with our funds from operations. The cash we have on hand is a comforting safety net during a time of uncertainty and will bridge us to our desired future state where we balance our investment and spending levels.","Newfield is executing extremely well today across the enterprise. Our outlook for higher production volumes is being driven by our enhanced completion practices and stronger well results across the company's portfolio, and we plan to do more.","As you can infer from our outlook, we're at significantly higher fourth quarter 2017 production rates, our strong results year-to-date will translate into positive momentum for our 2018 and '19 plans, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the future.","Thanks again for your time today and your investment in our company. And operator, we're now ready to take questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Glick with JPMorgan.","Michael Glick","Hi. Just on the Burgess well, could you talk about the completion design on that well specifically versus your base 2,100, 2,100 completion and the incremental cost associated with it?","Lee Boothby","Well, Michael, what I'll tell you is it was a 5,000-foot lateral. All we've said publicly is that it's a job larger in size than our 2,100, 2,100. I think in the @NFX, you could see the normalized performance on a 10,000-foot basis, and it's materially outpacing the other wells.","I think the most exciting part of that well, frankly, is that it sits right in the middle of our STACK acreage. It improves the productivity of that core position in the black oil window. And I'll just tell you, let's await some further results.","Our team has an exciting test that we talked about that we'll be conducting during the balance of the year, and we'll update you guys appropriately later in the year.","Michael Glick","Got you. And then on the SCORE program, I don't like the acronym by the way, you've seen some interesting results in the Sycamore and Osage, but haven't heard a whole lot about the Caney Shale. Could you talk about the potential prospectivity of that zone?","Lee Boothby","Well, it's the same geologic age as the Meramec section that we produced in STACK. And all of us, say, all of us, those of us active down in SCOOP. And I'll say tip of the hat to our friends at Continental for naming that some years back. That's appropriate call down there. We all focused on the Woodford. I think that was the early development in the east flank of Anadarko.","We've seen STACK evolve. We're getting through HBP mode. And we and our friends in the industry are at the point that we all said that we'd get to where we started evaluating these other horizons so.","Caney is a known producing horizon in basins to the south. It's known to be oil saturated. We think it's an attractive target. We're going to have drill some wells and prove that. That's what we aim to do in the second half of the year.","Michael Glick","Thank you.","Lee Boothby","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra","Good morning. Lee, the first question is these enhanced fluid volumes, does that increase the chance of well interference as you place these wells in full development closer and closer together?","And my second question is what's the willingness to outspend once you decide what the full field development scheme looks like?","Lee Boothby","On the first issue on interference, since most all of the wells up until the course of the last 12 months or so were single wells on individual DSUs, we know that they're unbounded. So that's one of the phrases that we used consistently. I think our teams have been careful to wrap the data accordingly.","As we move wells closer, there's you get the price element on the spacing equation. You've got the lateral offset equation on that. You got the vertical offset. And then in and amongst that you've got what's the right size job that you start moving these wells in and packing them in closer.","We're investing in learning today. Our team has been challenged, and I think we see it in our peers in the play as well to go invest in the learning\u2019s that we need to optimize development.","So our intent is to test the plays where the constructive interference becomes suboptimal, and then we'll all back up to whatever the right solution is at that time. But I think that that's why we stress the need for time, and time is part of the equation figuring this out.","So we'll have that information later this year. There could ultimately be tradeoffs on size of the job and well spacing, but what we're going to be solving for is maximizing net present value.","And I think that's what most of the companies that are in development mode are going to be focused on, and we'll give you what we think the solution is as that data comes available. The second question you have was related to - I'll flip that one over to Larry, and wonder if you can restate that just to make sure the brush on that.","Subash Chandra","Yes, sure. So as you figure out what full field development looks like, densities, laterals and targets, what's your willingness to outspend cash flows at that point once you're beyond the learning phase even though learning phase, I suppose, is ongoing?","Lawrence Massaro","Yes. So willingness to outspend cash flows will be dependent on the price environment we're in. So assuming we're back to mid-cycle pricing, we can continue to run small depths and still stay within the kind of leverage targets we've put out there. So we see that we can run at that depth certain and it just all depends on price.","Subash Chandra","Those asset sales are not a big driver next, say, 18 months or so?","Lee Boothby","We got $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. We feel pretty good. We'll continue to test the markets and be prepared at the right time, move assets into the market, but we have nothing active at this time.","Subash Chandra","Thank you. ","Lee Boothby","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Simmons Piper Jaffray.","Kashy Harrison","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So acknowledging that it's still early days on this front, if we were to extrapolate the outperformance you're seeing from your half completion thus far for the wells that you expected to drill in the future, do you think that the multi-year guide you provided last quarter assuming $50 to $60 oil could perhaps be delivered in those maybe a $50 to $50 commodity environment within cash flow?","Lee Boothby","Well, we were careful to give you a range, the $50 to $60 of the outlook that we provided in February, and that was basically so that you guys could all calibrate back and say, [indiscernible], this really is top-tier dirt. Look, what you can do.\u00e2\u20ac.","But getting to balance and being able to deliver double-digit growth inside of cash flow I think is a really nice place to be in. And we remain committed to that objective, and we see it out in front of us immediately on the road ahead. I think first quarter gives you just some ideas that the results we're seeing are pretty spectacular.","Clearly, there's upside. I probably acknowledge that. But our team takes great pains to apply appropriate risk adjustment, et cetera. We embed learning\u2019s curves in all of our forecast. I think our team does a fabulous job. I'll take the beatings for calling us conservative. We kind of like it. But we remember the days when we were being asked other questions. So I think we're in a great place today.","The momentum is clearly on our side. Our team is working hard to make the wells and the investments better every day. I told people I never bet against them. I wouldn't advise anybody else to bet against them. Our objective is always to beat what's out there. We're going to work hard to do that.","But we'll update you later this year on what we're thinking about '18 and '19. But right now, let's enjoy where we're at in '17, because we're ahead. We're building momentum. That's what we said we want to do. '17 is about setting up early. '18, exciting '18 forward, and we're ahead of schedule.","Kashy Harrison","Excellent response there. And then just I appreciated the color you provided on the steps you've taken to aid operational execution with respect to future gas takeaway, water management.","Are there any other significant operational constraints that you think that occur in general for the Anadarko Basin that investors may not fully appreciate?","Lee Boothby","No, I think there's a lot of if you build it, they will come and go back to field the dreams. And certainly, gas takeaway with all the wells being dressed up, drilled out to west and the gas here in hyperactivity areas has been an issue.","But I think industry is working pretty hard, and that's both midstream and upstream to make sure that, that takeaway capacity is available. We see a lot of activity there on multiple fronts. We found ourselves in attractive position to take advantage of our Brownfield opportunity that was very, very competitive with price. We think that was a good decision. We'll continue to work those issues. We invested in water and infrastructure before it was cool.","I remember we were doing recycling projects on water 15 years ago in the Arkoma Basin and weren't talking about it. So our team has a lot of experience with that. We try things that we think will make sense in terms of leveraging operational efficiencies and expertise.","And frankly, we'll continue to push. But I think the water infrastructure that we have in the STACK play is going to pay huge benefits on the road ahead. A lot of things are being done there.","As I said, look, our team has a laundry list of things. I'm sure the other top operators' teams likewise have that laundry list. They know and talk to one another. We share ideas. We'll all find the right solution. I'm not losing any sleep over the bottlenecks in SCOOP and STACK.","Kashy Harrison","All right. Thank you. Good quarter, guys.","Lee Boothby","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee Boothby","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer","On the balance sheet, you've highlighted, as you mentioned earlier, your goal of maintaining 1.5 to 2.5x leverage. And you're already slightly below the midpoint of that range. Wanted to explore the upper end of that range with you and what scenarios would you actually end up at the upper end of that range?","Does this signify willingness to drill through a lower oil price environment, say, a sub-$50 oil would continue in 2018 when you've got less hedging or is there a willingness to pursue acquisitions that would initially lead to higher leverage? Or do you just view the upper end of that range as highly unlikely?","Lee Boothby","Well, I'll catch my breath there, Brian. There's a lot in there. So I'm hoping Larry was listening closely. I'm going to flip that to Larry. And if he misses anything, I'll jump in.","Lawrence Massaro ","Hey, Brian, I just need to know what price environment you're talking about. You tell me that I could probably answer it. But now, look, clearly, go to your comment on acquisitions. It all depends on type of acquisition we do, whether it's a small bolt-on or something large. And yes, we're continually looking at that market at really high-quality inventory.","So that could affect it, but absent that, it really comes back to what price environment we're in. If we continue to see a deteriorating oil market, naturally that will increase your leverage there. And if you start going to low 40s, we'll have to adjust accordingly, right? And so we're going to monitor that. We know where we've been in historically on oil prices, and we're not forgetful on that.","And as Lee kind of points out, we're cautious. Get back to mid-cycle pricing, the type of assets we have, the durability, the strength of them, we can afford to go faster. And as we get into that full development phase where we've lowered the risk of the outcomes, we can afford to increase those leverage metrics if we want to.","But right now we're kind of just focused right on the middle of that range, and we can go up if we need to. But as Lee points out, we've got that $500 million sitting on the balance sheet. That's our insurance policy against this price environment.","That's why we put it on there and protected ourselves, and that gives us great comfort in that being able to execute this plan and kind of maintaining the kind of leverage you see on the balance sheet.","Lee Boothby","Brian, I'll only add this. It's real simple. It might be even clich\u00c3\u00a9, but clich\u00c3\u00a9 is sometimes worth repeating. I think what we're enjoying today is top tier dirt in the hands of top tier team, and we're going to continue to enjoy great things on the road ahead. And I'm just amazed everyday of our folks to be able to bring out the front lines. Hey, the future is bright. We're going to enjoy it.","Brian Singer","That's great. And then on SCORE, could you talk to what maybe add a little bit more color on what the hypothesis is in terms of how the pressure environment, the expected variability of wells, IRRs and production mix stack up, pardon the pun, versus your STACK assets?","Lee Boothby","Well, we wouldn't have talked about it if we didn't feel pretty good about it. We told all of you guys for 5 or 6 years that the Anadarko Basin east flank is exciting because it's got multi-pay STACK potential up and down that east flank. I think we're fortunate to be in the play with some other top companies and top names.","And frankly, we're all at a point where on the road ahead, we're going to chase these piece of information as well. We're just sharing what we call it. I'm sure everybody has got a different idea.","We think SCORE says what we're doing. We're working hard in those 3 horizons to expand our resource, and I think the early results there look promising. These are all zones known to be oil saturated, oil zones that have historically produced. We're going to go ahead and test them horizontally. I'm expecting success.","Brian Singer","Thank you. ","Lee Boothby","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna Financial.","Biju Perincheril","Hi. Good morning, Lee. Following up on an earlier question about sort of this bigger frac than in well spacing, when you look at the Burgess well, I guess, do you have any information about sort of what you think that drainage area will be?","And I'm just wondering, is there a possibility in the Meramec that you can develop this more efficiently with a bigger frac than pure well?","Lee Boothby","Those are all good questions. I - we have a employee, all employee meeting later today. I want to make sure I don't violate sacred covenants that we have amongst ourselves where we're investing and learning, and we're going to wait until we have the answer before we tell people what we think the answers are.","So I'm not going to take the bait on the Burgess. But on the second question, definitively, yes. I mean I think that when you think about the variables that teams are going to be solving for, our teams and other teams in the industry, price is going to be part of the equation. How close the wells are going to be horizontally and vertically is going to be part of the equation. Part of that total cost equation on the F&D side is going to be size of the completion and deal. So it's a complicated calculus that's going on there.","It will vary somewhat over time, as Larry indicated, depending on the pricing environment, but we're focused on maximizing NPV. The right solution, what are fewer wells, bigger jobs and higher recoveries at the lowest F&D and the highest rate of return, we're all over that.","At this point, what we're all over is investing in data acquisition information translation that we need to solve that and know that we know the answer and not just guess what the answer is. I think that's important.","Biju Perincheril","Got it. I appreciate that. And then it looks like you have had some interesting oily Woodford tests here in the northeast side of Canadian County. How should we think about development of that? Is that something that will be co-developed with Meramec there? Or I guess, where does that fall in your Q?","Lee Boothby","Well, I'm not sure exactly what you're talking about. But if I think about the northeast corner of Canadian County to move up tip of Cana into the oil window, that is the STACK play, and we started our drilling there in the Woodford. So we know and the industry knows that the Woodford is oil saturated all along that front.","I know there are a number of wells being drilled both in STACK and the merge play, which is just thinner areas of these horizons between STACK and SCOOP that are all producing oil.","And some of those are, in fact, interesting but not a surprise. I mean anybody that knows the play and knows the geology, it's not a surprise to hear that there's oil being produced out of the Woodford-Mansa pit.","Biju Perincheril","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ron Mills","Morning, Lee. Just a question on the multi-well development. Are all your rigs in the STACK now focused on drilling 10 to 12 well pads? And how are you developing that in terms of number of wells per lateral target?","Lee Boothby","So in the call I - earlier comments on the call, I noted that we hadn't completed a well in the last 60 days. These are things that we warned everybody about. We call this the lull period when you go from single well to drilling, complete, produce to the multi-well pad. So that tells you the answer is yes.","All of our rigs, the majority of our rigs are tied up on multi-well pads at this stage. From time to time, there will be maybe 1 or 2 wells, 1 or 2 rigs that get utilized on our exploration program. But as far as the development and the spacing policy, majority of the rigs will be on multi-well pad. They are today and they will be for the balance of the year.","Ron Mills","Perfect. And then relative to even your update at the end of March, your production even came in above what you had expected at the end of March. I'm assuming part of that's due to continued outperformance in the STACK. Any commentary on how much the Bakken contributed to that, which seems to be a little bit of a lost asset for you?","Lee Boothby","Well, it's not lost. I think it plays an important part in the portfolio. And our team - we actually made some notes in the press release on the well performance there. There's been some amazing things, upsize, completions, drilling, really strong wells there. So it shows why the capital continues to be allocated. We've got our 1-rig program there, really good performance.","But the truth is all of our, as I said earlier, all of our asset portfolio areas that are receiving capital are running ahead of schedule in that regard. So we're blessed to start this year with some really strong well results in multiple areas, and we hope to continue that through the balance of the year.","And that's why we're ahead, team does the best they can from one point to the next to give us the best available forecast. And sometimes you're fortunate to perform in the high end of expectations that's why we're in one of those cycles right now.","Ron Mills","That last segment, it didn't capture as much external attention as it probably should.","Lee Boothby","Yes. Yes. I've...","Ron Mills","And lastly for Larry, real quick. As you think forward with the new gas takeaway contract with your oil takeaway deals and once the water management system is fully operational, any thoughts as you think about that 3-year program, the impact that can have on cost structure or relative pricing leading to potential margin improvement? Any quantification of that?","Lawrence Massaro","We don't - going forward, I mean, you're going to probably continue to see slight improvement, but it's not - I don't think it'll be driven as much by the infrastructure stuff that we're putting in. I mean, we're advantaged. You saw that we put in the contract with Enable that was a great coverage for us on our gas takeaway, and it was an advantage deal.","How many more of those that are out there? I don't know. There aren't that many more Brownfield projects. So everything else going forward will be more Greenfield. And so I think that would be kind of keeping our margins from an infrastructure standpoint side.","Ron Mills","Great. Thank you very much.","Lee Boothby","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal Dingmann","Morning, guys. Lee, I appreciate your conservativeness. Just a question I had was on the revised guidance. Obviously, it was nicely - you had revised upwards. Is this for completion techniques? What are - is this just assuming the type curve or the 2,100 pounds? What does this assume on the hand completion?","Lee Boothby","Well, the base game plan that we have, so majority of our wells are presently programmed at the 2,100, 2,100. We've got a handful at best. Gary Packer and John Jasek and the team are working every day, they pick places to test, i.e., invest in learning\u2019s. And we're trying to test increased outsizes in areas.","So we've got that data set mapped out so that we can solve, ultimately solve the equation. But majority of the plan is based on the 2,100, 2,100 at this stage. And where we do plan to drill larger wells, our teams does expect that by putting larger jobs in plays that will yield a better result.","We actually do forecast those. There's uncertainty around it on things that you haven't done. And I think the real driver ultimately is what I said answer to the previous question. We've just been blessed where we've had outsized success on frankly everything we've touched so far this year. It's a pretty exciting time.","Neal Dingmann","And Lee, you mentioned, I agree with you the rock and especially where that Burgess well. How different will your completions be, I guess, when you look at kind of the upcoming completions in the Kingfisher or around the Burgess area versus like if you would think about that recent, where you'd be in that new extension area? Well, you assumed the rock's going to be pretty similar there so as such the completion would be very similar or it's just too early to know?","Lee Boothby","Well, remember that we're accumulating knowledge and learning, and I think that clearly, as we attack something new, we're going to use the benefits of everything that we've learned. People sometimes forget that we did what we did in STACK proper by design.","We held completions at a fixed level over a 2, 2.5-year time period so that we wouldn't be confused about what the geology was telling us. We saw that, that was a consistent result across that whole acreage footprint. That's an important piece of information.","Now we're back to saying, \"Okay. Now we'll upsize to completion and test that element.\" And frankly, it's working. And we're seeing it, and others are seeing it. We never advertised that the early 1,000 by 1,000 type jobs that was the ZIP Code we were in were optimal.","We actually said we're doing it this way because we think it's going to set us up for success in the development mode. That's just where we're at. So I can't tell you what the right answer is because we don't know right now.","But in general, the trend on everything that's being tested by ourselves and industry has been positive. Decreasing the spacing between perf clusters, you win. Increasing fluid volumes, you win. Increasing proppant volumes, you win. And great plays just seem to get better, and I think we're in the top-tier asset. It's performing. That's what I think.. ","Neal Dingmann","Lee, then sort of to that point - the point's well take in there, just do you guys with that conservative nature, how much more, I don't know if it's a timing question or whatever, but how much more would you all need to see in order to bump type curves? I mean, you continue, as you point out, to really have great success.","But generally, unlike some others that maybe will drill things out there after a couple of months, you guys generally have a bit more conservative nature. So I'm just wondering when is there a time point this year that we should look for updates on enhancements or is that just something further down the road?","Lee Boothby","All right. So I'm catching my breadth here. There's a lot in there. I make sure I follow this the right way. So here's the way I think about it. We're yes, we work everyday as far as we can to accurately forecast, accurately describe future states. And there's always uncertainty, upside and downside.","So first point I'd say, we're working entire team, entire management team working to understand what infill development looks like. That means the optimizing and spacing like we've talked about. And it's ultimately about determining the optimal completion within that vertical set.","So that's horizontal lateral offset and optimizing on completion. Just stated, we're very encouraged by the larger jobs and the impact we've seen on our early results. I think we're right to be encouraged and you're right to be encouraged when you look at the, I don't know, 40%, 45% uplift on the performance of these 15 wells with the larger jobs versus the type curve, it's great.","The challenge for us is to applying those learning\u2019s early to create value over that large scale development. That's backed by the NPV. It's a complicated equation, solving multiple variables, and we're trying to be not just cautious.","We're trying to be pragmatic and honest. I think in the end of the day, we're telling you that yes, these are bigger jobs, but I'll also tell you that I can't tell you that in development that that's going to be the well with the completion and the yield that we choose in the development.","And ultimately, once we choose that, you'll have the whole iteration of going back through and resetting on what the portfolio looks like with the appropriate size job, appropriate capital, et cetera.","So we're just trying to be honest with the data that's there and sort of politely, if we can, ask you guys to walk with us a little bit. We're going to keep you posted and tell you what we're thinking.","And when we learn something, our objective is to get the answer where we can definitively say this is the answer. Here's why we're going to do what we're going to do on each of these variables.","And at that point, ultimately, once the technical data is acquired and we've analyzed it, then the decision will be mostly what's the commodity price environment, where the decisions are being made.","And you could see some slight variability in terms of how you're attacking the development from period-to-period in response to the commodity. So we're focused on maximizing net present value.","Neal Dingmann","Thanks, so much Lee. That\u2019s great insight.","Lee Boothby","Thank you.","Operator","We have one more question left in queue. And we will take question from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital.","Dan McSpirit","Thank you, folks. Good morning.","Lee Boothby","Good morning, Dan.","Dan McSpirit","Can you express your current thoughts on the Bakken operation as either a recipient of more capital or a source of proceeds from a divestiture, recognizing there's no urgency to raise capital today?","Lee Boothby","I'm going to start by saying I love the Bakken, and I love our team, and I love the results they're posting. And we've demonstrated that we're going to make the right decisions over time. I know there's a lot of you out there that would've liked us to sell the Bakken when oil was at $26.","We said we don't think that makes sense. We've got $500 million of cash in the balance sheet. And the magical thing is with what our team does every day, Steve and I've been on the road talking to you guys the last 4 or 5 years, and it seems like we always have about 300-plus locations. And I think we built 300 wells in the last 5 years, and we still have 300-plus locations.","They're high return, we're actually - we've actually grown production with the 1-rig program. Larry likes the joke we should have gone from 4 rigs to 1 rig a long time ago. And it's a good asset.","It fits well in the portfolio. It doesn't presently compete on scale with SCOOP and STACK. We get that, but it fits nice right now. And we're not under any duress. We'll make the right decision at the right time. I'll close again by saying I love our team, I love the Bakken and I love the results they're posting.","Dan McSpirit","Wonderful. And just as a follow-up, Lee, if I could, I think essential to the story what I believe underscores the value proposition of the shares here is the improvement in capital efficiency.","To that end, can you comment and\/or clarify on whether increased recoveries or increased drilling activity will be the biggest driver or the bigger driver of a potential positive change in out-period production growth guidance?","Lee Boothby","So you want me to trade off increased recovery, i.e., improved yields from the well versus increased activity?","Dan McSpirit","Yes. Just what's going to be the bigger driver here and...","Lee Boothby","Yes. So clearly over the long run, given the economic strength of these assets' cash generation ability, these assets' pricing environment that we're living in today, ultimately, the value proposition driving value and pulling it forward is going to be approximate of activity to pace.","I think that's probably going to be the biggest driver, just given the overall scale number of location, scale of resource. When you start talking about billions of barrels of recoverable hydrocarbons, it's pace, and we get that.","So going faster and accelerating, bringing that future state forward is what we're going to be focused on. And the other aspect of the yield for the well is that optimization equation. We'll be going faster with whatever we believe at the time is the most optimal development. So I think it's scale, acceleration and optimization kind of in that order.","Dan McSpirit","Wonderful. Have a great day. Thank you ","Lee Boothby","Thanks, guys. Appreciate everybody dialling in today. We're excited. I hope that comes across in the call. We're off to a great start. I'm really looking forward to visiting with our full team here later this afternoon and enjoying this. But we're focused on the future, and we're going to be talking about how we can continue to outperform in the road ahead. So thanks for your investment in Newfield, your interest and your time. We look forward to visiting with you on the road. Have a great day.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And before we get started, one housekeeping matter.","Our discussion with you today will contain forward-looking statements, such as estimated production and timing, drilling and development plans, expected cost reductions and planned capital expenditures. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, they are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks.","Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors and risks, some of which may be unknown.

Please go ahead, sir.","Lee K. Boothby","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and thanks for dialing in today. Happy to report that the sun is shining and the sky is blue here in Houston this morning. And I know it's an hour earlier than we usually start, so just enjoy your coffee and we'll run through some of our mid-year highlights as quickly as we can. I'm joined this morning in Houston by Terry Rathert, our CFO; Gary Packer, our Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Campbell, our Vice President Investor Relations.","As you saw in last week's operations release, we are creating value through our oil investments in 2012. We improved upon our execution, we're meeting and beating production estimates, seeing solid results in all of our assessment areas and demonstrated that our asset portfolio has a deep inventory of solid, high return plays to invest in, both now and well into the future.","We believe that our diversified portfolio model provides us with a competitive advantage. In the slide packet we posted last week there is an interesting graph I would encourage you to review, shows the very deliberate steps we've taken over time to capture oil opportunities, accelerate their investment and carefully hedge both natural gas and oil to ensure the balance sheet strength to allow us the ability to execute our drilling plans. We didn't get here today by happenstance, and we appreciate the support of our investor base over that time.","What I see today is a very positive inflection point. Our transition to an oil company is real and more than half of our production will now be derived from high-value oil and liquids production. This is great news and we're excited about what this means for our future.","As you know, Newfield has certainly changed and evolved over time. We've transitioned from a Gulf of Mexico start-up nearly 25 years ago to a company today with core, onshore North American resource plays, lucrative assets in Southeast Asia, and a deep inventory in both oil and natural gas drilling opportunities. We've more than doubled our oil production over the last 4 years, we've transitioned from a company driving growth from natural gas to a company that is driving growth from oil, and we've done it largely organically. We have thousands of low-risk oil development locations that are ready to drill today in our core development areas and our recent assessment results show very exciting early returns in the Cana Woodford, Eagle Ford Shale and in 2 in new plays in the Central Basin region of the Uinta Basin.","More on our assessments later in the call. Our Chief Operating Officer, Gary Packer, will give you a good project-level overview.","I'm excited about our results here today and confident we will ultimately achieve our main goal, readying a development inventory of opportunities that will again propel us to double-digit production growth, driven by oil and financed through our internal resources.","I can assure you that our management team is united in delivering strong results for our shareholders and focusing on maximizing our primary product, cash. I'll turn it over to our CFO, Terry Rathert, to quickly cover our financial results from the quarter. Terry?","Terry W. Rathert","Thanks Lee. Our net income in the second quarter, excluding FAS 133 income, was $82 million or $0.61 per share. Revenues for the second quarter were $627 million. Value creation in or transition oil is evident. 86% of our revenues in the quarter came from our oil and liquids production. Cash flow for the period was $330 million. Our oil and liquids liftings in the second quarter of 2012 were up 40% over the comparable period in 2011 to 6.1 million barrels, or an average of more than 67,000 barrels of oil per day. Our NGL volumes in the quarter were about 530,000 barrels, only 4% of our total production had its realized price of $28 per barrel. Our oil and liquids production comprised 49% of our total production in the second quarter and we expect that more than half of our production will come from liquids in the back half of the year. I look forward to soon reporting our results in BOEs as compared to Bcfs.","I applaud our teams today for delivering outsized oil growth. We entered 2012 producing about 55,000 barrels and we expect to exit this year producing about 75,000 barrels. That's our daily rate. With no investments today being allocated to our natural gas assets, they're on natural decline.","Our natural gas production in the quarter was 39.8 Bcf, an average of about 440 million cubic feet per day.","Natural gas volumes year-over-year have fallen about 14%, which is about exactly in line with the decline we estimated in our full year guidance. We realized $3.48 per MCF on our natural gas sales during the second quarter. Allowing our gas production to decline is, again, the right economic choice. Too often, I hear people focus simply on absolute production growth. With natural gas around $3 and NGLs at just a third the oil price, our obligation to the shareholder must be to create value and we're electing to continue to invest all that we can in oil projects with higher returns as it is. We realized just over $94 on our oil liftings in the quarter. I'll be happy to address any specific questions related to the financials at the end of today's prepared remarks. But for now, I'll turn it over to Gary Packer to update you on a few of our recent operational financial highlights.","Gary D. Packer","Thank you, Terry. Last week, we issued a very comprehensive update on our year-to-date accomplishments. In the interest of time today, I will not rehash all the information, but I will share some insights on each of these areas.","Let's start with an overview of the 2 areas that have been in our portfolio for quite a while and are now seeing much better returns due to longer laterals, optimized completions and improved flow back techniques. Those areas are the Williston Basin and Eagle Ford Shale.","In the Williston Basin, our results are benefiting from steps we took to improve execution and get a handle on costs. Recall that we voluntarily slowed our operations here in late 2011, dropping rigs, deferring well completions and improving our field-level oversight to better navigate the challenges of a classic oilfield boom. These proactive steps are certainly paying off today. We are setting records on days to drill and case, averaging just 25 days year-to-date. This compares with 45 days 2 years ago, 35 days last year. We recently drilled and cased a 10,000-foot lateral in just 20 days.","Our development in the Williston Basin today is largely being conducted from common pad locations, these 2 and 3 well pad sites offer synergies in both drilling and completion timing and service costs are certainly moving in a favorable direction for us to date. We are taking full benefit of cost reductions and certainly anticipate realizing better benefits from these in 2013.","Today, we have an inventory of about 300 ready-to-drill locations in our core development areas on and off the Nesson Anticline.","The geology in the Williston is very favorable for development with stack pays, multiple benches to explore and in addition to the more than 50 Bakken Wells we have drilled to date, we have also drilled several Three Forks wells with good results. We are continuing our field studies to quantify the potential in the Three Forks, as well as the deeper ventures on our acreage. Ultimately, the Williston Basin will have tighter spacing and more development locations producing from varying depths than previously thought.","We have some pilot programs underway today to get us a handle on this, and there'll be more to report on this later. Our Williston Basin production recently hit 10,000 barrels equivalent per day, and our wells continue to perform very well. Our full year production in the basin will increase about 35% year-over-year. We recently added a rig and the economics of our investments in the area today warrant additional activity. We anticipate adding additional rigs in early 2013.","Let's move on to the Eagle Ford. Our recent Super Extended Laterals in the Eagle Ford have performed extremely well. The program's highlights can be summarized pretty succinctly.","First, we are seeing higher sustained rates over 90 days. This breakthrough is a result of changes made not only in the lateral length, but in how we are completing these wells, our controlled -- and our controlled flow back techniques. Our wells are producing about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and we have as much as 1,500-PSI flowing tubing pressure after 30 days. Again, we are intentionally managing the rates to limit pressure drawdown and maximize our anticipated ultimate recoveries over time.","Second, we are seeing higher EURs. Our production data is indicating significant increases in our recoveries and the wells are performing well above our type curves. We estimate that the EURs are in excess of 500,000 barrels equivalent. We need more wells and more time to confirm, but we are very encouraged to date.","And lastly, all of our improvements are translating into better economics. We are drilling these SXLs in about 12 days now and our drilling case cost are less than $3 million. Our drilling team has done an outstanding job lowering drilling cost. Completion costs remain high, but we are seeing signs of encouragement, our lower pressure pumping costs as we enter 2013 and be assured, we'll take advantage of these. Our completed well costs from pads should average about $8 million gross. At these costs, our Eagle Ford SXLs have a IRR of more than 35% and are confident that they will improve as we progress.","These recent breakthroughs have made our Eagle Ford investments competitive with other choices we have in the Newford -- Newfield portfolio today, and as a result, we are increasing our planned activity in the play and have allocated capital to drill at least 6 additional SX wells -- SXL wells in the second half of 2012.","Let's look at the West Asherton area as an example. At 120-acre spacing, on 18,000 acres, we have over 100 ready-to-drill locations. This equates to 35 million barrels or more, net to our interest. Industry wells just across the leased line are now being spaced at less than 80 acres. With continued strong results in the second-half SXL program, we will be in a position to allocate additional rigs to our Eagle Ford program in 2013.","I realize it's been a while since we've talked about the Eagle Ford play. You recall that we acquired the acreage for less than $500 an acre through an acquisition 2.5 years ago. And our recent success leaves us encouraged about the potential commerciality of the Eagle Ford across more of our acreage. Be assured, our teams are focused on expanding the economic footprint beyond just 40,000 acres.","Let's talk about our new assessment programs now in the Cana Woodford, the Uteland Butte and the Wasatch of the Uinta basin.","In late 2010, we started leasing east and south of the known Cana Woodford trend in the Anadarko basin. We have now been able to assemble rapidly over 135,000 acres for approximately $1,000 an acre. Our geologic concept indicated higher yields and the ability to produce from the oil phase.","Our 2012 program called for the rapid assessment of this acreage with the hopes to being able to push the play into development mode by 2013. Many of you likely questioned our decision to dedicate $300 million to a play we seemingly knew little about. But I would argue that's not the case at all. Recall that we have drilled nearly 400 cores horizontal Woodford wells just a few counties to the east in the Arkoma basin. We're a proven operator in Oklahoma and we have quickly transferred our learning curve to the Anadarko Woodford.","Since January, we have been running 5 rigs in the Cana. We are highly encouraged with our results and they are included in our recent well test in last week's operational release. In addition to these wells, we have also participated in roughly 40 industry wells operated by others. This success also provides us with increased confidence about the quality of our acreage. Our activity to date has focused on our southern acreage, which covers about 80,000 net acres.","We have initial flow rates of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in black oil content that ranges 25% to 65%, depending on where you are in the liquids phase. Our wells are exhibiting strong pressure and our controlled flow back techniques here as well, are helping us sustain strong flow rates over an extended period of time.","And our mid-continent team has done a great job of quickly applying our learning curves to drill cost-effective wells. Our first wells in this play took about 100 days. Pretty much anticipated in the early phases of these types of assessments. We recently drilled and cased a well in less than 45 days, an industry regional record. These efficiency gains translate into higher returns and will help us increase our annual growth. Although it's early, we estimate that these south Cana Wells have gross EURs of 1.1 million to 1.7 million barrels equivalent and will deliver 35% to 50% internal returns at today's commodity prices. I'm confident we will be able to continue to improve on our drilling performance and further optimize our completions.","Our activity in the second half of this year will be weighted towards the southern acreage, however, we are planning to continue our assessment of the northern acreage and an SXL will be drilled later this year. The area encompasses about 55,000 net acres and has potential for wells with a very high black oil content.","My last topic, before we open the call to questions, is the Uinta Basin. We are developing multiple oil plays on more than 230,000 net acres in the Uinta. Since 2004, we have been exploiting oil plays in the region and have grown to become Utah's largest oil producer. We clearly have a competitive advantage in this basin. Our 2012 program is largely focused on the Central Basin an area north and adjacent to Monument Butte. We methodically grew our acreage position in this area. Beginning in late 2009, we identified and captured new oil plays, 2 of which we are now entering on development, the Uteland Butte and the Wasatch. Our new plays have tremendous resource potential and their development has the ability to drive our domestic oil production growth for many years to come into the future.","Let's talk about the Uteland Butte first. Our early wells in this play were drilled under Monument Butte field. They IP-ed at around 500 barrels a day, but we were confident that the play was even more prospective as we moved to the north, deeper and into the higher-pressured regime. The data we gathered from these early wells was instrumental in our ability to capture additional acreage in the Central Basin during 2011. We have recently migrated our drilling campaign to the pressured regime in the Uteland Butte play. And our most recent well commenced production at nearly 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which, nearly 90% was oil. The well averaged nearly 1,300 barrels equivalent a day over the first 7 days of production. We have 2 wells to date in the pressured formation at the Uteland Butte and their average production is at least 3x that of a normally-pressured Uteland Butte.","Our first wells have now been online more than 30 days, and it's average production over this period is nearly 1,000 barrels equivalent per day. That means the well cumed about 28,000 barrels in its first month. This well has a lateral of less than 4,000 feet. So let me put these numbers in perspective for you. After drilling about 30 wells in the Bakken, we know that are 5,000 foot laterals cumed just under 20,000 barrels in their first 30 days. Our estimated EUR in the Bakken for a 5000-foot lateral is about 500,000 barrels and cost about $8 million. So our recent Uteland Butte pressured wells cumed normally -- nearly 30% more than the lateral and is 1,000 foot shorter and the well cost nearly $3 million less than its sister well in the Williston Basin. These early wells are indicating EURs of over 400,000 barrels. That's significant when you consider we have more than 70,000 net acres in this play. We are highly encouraged with the results to date. We plan to drill about 15-or-so additional pressured wells in the play later this year.","Our other exciting play in the Central Basin is the Wasatch. We've drilled more than 30 wells to date and the play has very strong economics.","Year-to-date, we have completed 18 vertical wells with an average initial gross production of nearly 900 barrels equivalent per day and 30-day average of more than 400 barrels a day. We recently completed our first 2 horizontal pressured Wasatch wells. The early flow rates on these wells are encouraging and we are looking forward to seeing what the near-term max rate will be, as well as the 30 and 60 day performance data.","Before we open the call to questions, let me mention our Malaysian operations where we recently set a record production of more than 30,000 barrels a day, net, and our gross production today is more than 75,000 barrels a day and our production here sells at Brent pricing. Like the rest of the organization, our team here has done a great job of bringing new developments online, drilling field development wells from platforms to maximize production and finding expiration projects to meet our future growth needs.","In the second half of this year, we have 3 high potential exploration wells planned. The first known is Paus North, a deepwater Block 2C and an appraisal of a 2008 discovery and that well is drilling currently.","With that, I'll flip the call back to you, Lee.","Lee K. Boothby","Thanks, Gary. And thanks to all of you for your interest and support of Newfield. We're very pleased with our performance at mid-year and are certain that our performance year-to-date and our positive trajectory are building momentum for what will be a superior 2013 and 2014 as we complete our transition to oil.","With that, I'll open the call for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Lively of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Lee, given the success that you've had now in the Cana Woodford and then, I guess, the incremental success from the Eagle Ford, can you provide an update on just overall portfolio and then any incremental rationalization plans?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I would say that the success, as Gary indicated, in both of those areas is very positive. We're still early days in the Cana Woodford, we continue to plan an aggressive assessment, shifting to development campaign in the second half of 2012. So as the year unfolds, we'll have a lot more data at year-end to fully and properly assess the potential and the game plan relative to Cana Woodford. In the Eagle Ford, I would say the transition to the Super Extended Laterals opens up an inventory of opportunities. If you think about the 40,000-acre position we've described historically as developable, the 7,500-foot laterals and the results we're seeing there make that a pretty exciting piece of business as well. Gary gave an example on a fraction of that acreage where we've got more than 100 ready-to-go development wells. You translate that across the broader package, you're looking at 250, 300  wells that we can pound down there in the Eagle Ford. So I think that, thinking about those assets, they provide a really nice opportunity to accelerate oil development activity and our further hope would be, particularly in the Eagle Ford, that with additional success, that we will be able to expand the economic footprint there as well. As far as rationalization, additional asset opportunities, I would tell you we have nothing on the radar screen at this point. We've done a lot of that work over the last couple of years, in terms of shedding nonstrategic assets. We have a lot of that activity in 2011. But truth be told, we've got a grow-hold-divest mentality within our management team and we're going to regularly look for opportunities to shed assets that we deem noncore, nonstrategic and really double down on the areas where we're getting the best returns and the best results to drive future production and cash flow growth.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And Lee, I apologize if I missed this, but what's the status of the Gulf of Mexico divestiture?","Lee K. Boothby","I don't know that you missed it, we're not at a point where we're prepared to discuss it. We've still got ongoing discussions and activities related to that. And my hope would be that we'll have resolution of that issue here within the month.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then last question for me. Gary, you gave some good cost details in some of the plays. But in the Cana Woodford itself, what have you guys seen in terms of pro well costs and then what do you guys think, pro forma, those costs would look like?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, I mean, it's really difficult early on in these plays, as I described, as you're still investigating casing programs and ways to optimize the wells at 100 wells -- at 100 days, clearly, that's not a description of what we ultimately anticipate these wells to take to drill. We're also investing a lot of science in the early wells. So I don't think any of that really is germane in this early -- really early phase. I would tell you, we -- the progression that we're going right now, our investment thesis originally, that we were going to drill these wells for about $8 million or so, and I think we're well on our way to get there. But we're still learning. But we keep the momentum that we have today and recently posting wells in the order of 45 to 50 days, we're well on our way to get there.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes. And I think, one last thing and then we'll move on to the next question. But on that point, is I'll refer you back to the history we've had, Gary referenced in the Arkoma Woodford as we moved in to development. We published a few years ago the second, third, fourth well on the section. We've demonstrated, time and again, the ability to drive those costs down. So I think we're in a really good place and a great trajectory and I think we're getting the pay off for the accelerated program that we kicked off in early 2012.","Operator","We'll go next to Leo Mariani of RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, there was an earlier comment, I think terry made it in his prepared remarks, about getting to a 75,000 barrel a day liquids exit rate. I just wanted to confirm that, that was the number you guys are expecting for the end of the year, because it certainly looks like it's above your guidance for 2012. Just wanted to get some color around that.","Terry W. Rathert","That's where we're headed toward the end of the year.","Lee K. Boothby","Now remember the guidance allows for potential planned shut-ins in Malaysia, for operations that Petronas has planned and some things that are outside of our control. But we've got great growth momentum in the oil and we expect that to continue through year end.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us a little bit more color on the potential size of the 3 exploration wells you guys talked about in Malaysia here that you guys are going to drill in the second half?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I think, the only color that we'll give is the one that's drilling. We've talked about a lot over the last -- the course of the last years, is the Paus well. It's on deepwater Block 2C, it's an appraisal well, drilling an up-structure fault block from a 2008 discovery. We've advertised that, that up-structure fault block could have 200 million to 400 million barrels of oil potential. It also has the potential of being gas condensate, which is largely what we saw in the original discovery well. Either of those outcomes, success case, we hope to put over an economic threshold in that project and allow us to continue to build our business offshore Sarawak, that's the game plan. The other 2, we haven't advertised and there'll be probably more color on those as the year unfolds. We expect to do those spud. The second of those will be a follow-up well on the SK 310, where we drilled the pinnacle reef gas discovery a little over a year ago. So we're drilling an adjacent pinnacle reef within about 3 miles of that discovery well. And in the interest of trying to not turn anybody away from questions, let's try to keep the questions to one, and possibly a short follow-up, and then we'll move down the list. I don't want to turn people away that are waiting in the queue.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, in the Cana, with the 6 wells that you guys drilled and various oil cuts and initial IPs, you mentioned that, that was really locationally driven. Was there anything to do with different completion techniques on any of those 6 wells? Or are you noticing anything different about how you're competing wells going forward?","Lee K. Boothby","I'll let Gary take that question.","Gary D. Packer","We continue to modify our completion techniques there. I would tell you that the control flow back is probably the biggest driver in what we're doing there. We continue to experiment with our stage spacing, number of clusters per stage and profit types and the like. But I would tell you that the -- I'd say the game changer for us year-to-date, and this applies broadly over many of the new plays that we announced last week, is the controlled flow back techniques, where we're just not opening the wells up haphazardly, we're actually bringing in rather slow. We're really taking great pains to minimize the draw down that we placed on the completion. We're seeing higher condensate yields as a result of that, we're seeing higher flowing tubing pressures sustain much longer and we think, we're maintaining better conductivity to the formation. We're seeing that in all 3 of our plays, and I think that's probably the biggest change that we've seen. But we continue to tweak it. Clearly, 6 wells is not enough to figure out what special sauce is and we'll just keep trying.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great, I appreciate that. And then one question quickly on the Williston. You mentioned that you might be looking at a downspacing program. Can you talk a little bit more about that and where specifically you're looking at downspacing?","Gary D. Packer","Sure. We actually have 3 downspacing or spacing pilots underway right now. The spacing on those projects would be anywhere between 750 and 1,060 feet. That's much tighter than what industry has done. But we're doing that as a means to really accelerate our understanding of what the proper spacing ultimately is. So we're not much different in the industry as far as how we have things booked currently, but I can tell you that some of the tests that we'll do may be pretty revealing. I would've anticipated industry to be further along with this. But we're not, and therefore, we're going to -- we're probably pretty aggressive this year in the 3 tests that we're undertaking right now.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, on the Eagle Ford SXLs. When you talk about drilling an additional 6 wells this year, can you characterize those? Are they more development wells based on the success you've seen, or more step out of assessment wells of other parts of your 40,000 acres? And then, I think you mentioned that you may be seeing more potential on your Eagle Ford or Maverick position beyond the 40,000 acres. Can you add a little bit more color on that and the timing of that assessment?","Lee K. Boothby","Sure, Brian. I'd characterize the wells that we'll drill the remainder this year as development. They will largely be 7,500-foot laterals, but we're actually going to attempt a 10,000 foot test as well. The reference to expanding the acreage block as we continue to move to the north, we get shallower in the section and we think some of the completion techniques that we've utilized that we think -- that we attribute some of the success that we've had in the SXLs, again, I don't think it's all about the length. From a completion standpoint we've changed our technique up quite a bit and we have not applied those to some of the shallower depths. So that's really what the objective there is. We ought to have one well tested in a shallower section later this year. And pending the results of that, that's something we'll be able to expand upon in 2013.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And as a follow-up going to the Uinta. When you think about the better performance that you're seeing in the pressured parts of the Uinta and mirror that in the context of getting Black Wax oil to market. Are you able to drill the same number of wells, get more oil out than you thought and get that oil to market? Or do you end up drilling fewer but better wells due to midstream constraints? Or is everything you're seeing basically just in line with your expectations?","Lee K. Boothby","Let's see here, I'll take that one and Gary can fill in any of the details that I blur. I would tell you that when you look at the uplift, and we talked about this, Brian, for most of the last year in terms of our plans and visions for the Uinta, particularly in the Central Basin acreage, we started aggressively assessing that vertically so we can understand the section that we were drilling through and we started talking about a transition to horizontal testing. We've been really excited about getting that program kicked off and the fact that these well results are coming back so strong provides plenty of options. First thing I would say is that we have the long-term agreements in place to be able to move our crude. So when you think about our game plan, it's doubling production out of the Uinta Basin between now and 2015. That will allow us to fully utilize the capacity that we've signed up for. And I think in that context, the sooner we get there, the better. So all things considered, if we were running full capacity on the basin as things were opening up, it would allow us to shift capital into other project areas, because we will be able to generate higher yield -- production yield per effort, utilizing the horizontal drilling. But again, remember we're relatively early. I mean, we're very, very encouraged with results. I think we've got good strong results and sustained production on the pressured Uteland Butte wells that we've announced. And then our 30 wells that we've completed in the deep pressured Wasatch gives us high confidence in that overall section. But we're still very early there. We've just turned on our first few wells and we haven't yet released that information. So we'll continue to work the marketing and export side, but there's not anybody out there that should be losing sleep over Newfield's ability to move barrels in the Uinta Basin. I think we're in real good shape there. Gary, you got anything you want to add?","Gary D. Packer","Well, I think, you're familiar, Brian, that everything we drill in the Central Basin is going to be yellow wax. We have no issues on the Black Wax side, as Lee referenced. We're currently moving about 7,500 barrels a day or so equivalent out of the Central Basin, most of that is all oil. With an aggressive campaign that we believe that we could yield from this, I mean, you can do the arithmetic as well as I can, with the kind of wells we're posting there, we could be looking, end of next year, 20,000 barrels a day or more and in that situation, we are going to continue to look to capture ever-increasing yellow wax markets. But that's a really good story for us, that kind of growth. So we continue to work it. We see a lot of opportunities both in the basin and out of the basin for marketing.","Operator","We'll go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just staying on the Uinta. There's been a perception out there that, just given the pullback in crude prices, some were speculating the Uinta is not as economic as other plays. Can you just talk about -- and you covered in the well cost a little bit, but can you talk about your IRRs coming out of Uinta and where that kind of rates in your program relative to other basins? Where you have development, like the Bakken?","Lee K. Boothby","Sure, David. When you look at the results that we posted last week, I would say each of these plays compare very favorably. As I referenced, and I only have 30 days to go on as we already described, but if you just look at the early results, it would indicate that a Uteland Butte well ought to compete very favorably with a Bakken well. Now that's only after 30, 60 -- and we have to watch this, as you well know, well longer than that. The trajectories of these wells are relatively unknown at this point because we're really blazing new territories, a new formation, drilling wells that have not been drilled before. But we're very optimistic. I don't know about the perception that's out there, but after 2 wells, these wells are over-delivering what some of our early modeling would suggest. And I would tell you I think they'll compete very favorably. But we have drilled far more wells in the Uinta Basin, and even more recently, in the Eagle Ford. So we have our minds clearly around where those compete, and they compete very favorably. But I would say, based on the early results, and that's all I could speak to at this point, that a horizontal program in the pressured Uteland Butte will not have any difficulty in any -- in a commodity price anywhere close to where we're at right now.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then let me just, as a follow-up. Some of your competitors talked about potentially adding rail coming out of the Uinta to ease up some of the capacity or take care of some longer-term capacity requirements. Can you -- have you heard that? And I know from Newfield's perspective, you're talking about you guys are fine as far as takeaway, but have you heard that? And if so, any comment on that?","Gary D. Packer","I think, yes. I have heard that. It remains a legitimate option to take to market and we're exploring opportunities to at least test some of those markets out. So, I'll confirm that for you.","Lee K. Boothby","David, I'll just jump in and add a couple of reminders. Remember, we've been operating out in the Uinta Basin since 2004. We've drilled more wells than anybody else out there. We're the biggest oil producer in Utah, we dominate the Uinta Basin particularly on the oil side, we've got all kinds of synergies that work through the system that are related to that, that frankly our peers don't have. So I think we're in a wonderful position in that regard. And I would count on you and your peers to start changing the game, if you will, and erasing the urban myth. There's been a lot of bad things written about crude in the Uinta Basin. Fact of the matter is, it's a high-quality, high-value crude. Just ask the refiners. And I think that the wax issue is way overblown. I think people just don't understand it, but it's a high-quality crude and the economics on these wells, if you got the kind of results that we've been generating out over the last 12 months out of the Uinta Basin, the vertical well program in the Wasatch, early return from the horizontal, our experience in multiple basins, you got to be excited about where we're going to take this thing from here. So I like where we're at and I think we'll just let the results speak for themselves as we move forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Subash Chandra with Jefferies & Company.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was curious in the Cana, Stevens County, Garvin County. Has there been results there before? Is this sort of a frontier program, if you will? And of the 6 wells, were any drilled -- of wells drilled to date in the Cana were any drilled in that area? And how much further south you think the play might extend for these million-barrel-type results?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I'll start talking while Gary is looking at a reference map. This is Lee. I'm going to remind you, Subash, that our odyssey in the Woodford actually started in this area in Southern Oklahoma, literally 10 years ago. And it started by studying the vertical wells and what's historically been called the big 4 play. And I think that Golden Trend area, if you want to go ahead and look for reference. And I would tell you that, not knowing anything about shale in 2002 or looking to redefining our strategy in the Mid-Con, we decided to go the unconventional route, relatively early on. One of the key pieces of data was some production logs that we ran in some wells that we had drilled, vertical wells, in 2001 in the Golden Trend and imagine my shock having grown up in the Gulf of Mexico to see that the primary producer in the big 4 in those wells that we ran those production logs in was the Woodford Shale and it was producing oil. Okay? Back in that timeframe, gas was the preferred commodity, so we went to the Arkoma Basin to chase gas. The fact of the matter is the Woodford in Southern Oklahoma has been producing oil for 30 or 40 years, it's just been co-mingled and therefore I think a lot of people missed the fact that it's been a real key part of the overall production down there.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, the only thing I'd add to that is I believe, Subash, that the majority of our wells have all been drilled in Grady County. We are intentionally not posting the well locations out there, but we've drilled a mix of wet gas wells and what we would consider classic oil phase. And some of those may get into Garvin, but we've not posted those to date. It'd be really speculative on my part to tell you, until we've actually drilled the wells, how far that will extend. But clearly, as we push the play to the east, we'll be getting in more of an elect [ph] window and you'll just have to stay tuned for our results as we do that.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the follow-up in the Bakken. Could you just spell out the rig count, I think you added a rig, what number of that is,, if you got up to 4, plan to get up to 4 or not this year? And then on the locations, I think you said 300, does that include Three Forks? And what sort of spacing in Three Forks that might include?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, the -- as far as the rig count, as I said late last year, we backed off to 2 rigs. We are -- we currently have 3 rigs. One of those is a new build that we've been swapping out for one of our existing in the rig fleet. And then we would look at adding another rig, a fourth rig, probably in 2013, as early as possible, pending capital budgets and so forth. As far as the Three Forks, I believe that has 2 wells per section, but I would have to confirm that for you. We've looked at anywhere between 2 and 4, but in that well count, I don't think we utilized the full 4 count in there.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Magner with MacQuarrie.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","I'm wondering if you could provide a breakdown in terms of price differentials, oil price differentials between your various domestic oil plays, primarily the Uinta, the Williston and the Cana Woodford?","Stephen C. Campbell","Joe, this is Steve, I'm happy to do that. I don't have it with me, but I will pull it up and send you a range of differentials for each of those areas, but we didn't see anything in the quarter that was out of the ordinary.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay, I guess I could follow-up with you off-line. There was a comment made about the yellow wax growth and there's been a lot of focus on takeaway capacity and locking up long-term contracts on Black Wax. Just curious, you talked about running 7,500. Now, what kind of limitations are there and what kind of capacity exists on the yellow wax side now and what will be required to expand or capitalize on some of those market opportunities you referred to, Gary?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, for some obvious reasons, I'm not going to be too transparent with you on some of the options that we're exploring out there. I would tell you that we see 4 to 5 different avenues to expand our existing marketing of yellow wax. I think no different than black, it is something that we need to continue to work. As we have on the black, to enter into long-term agreements to expand the capacity. But it is certainly not something that we could sit back and do nothing about, or we will run into a cap. So I would anticipate through the balance of 2012, seeing us enter into some commitments that would allow us to make some immediate enhancements to the refining capacity. That is something that ought to happen by the end of the year to get us into and well into 2013. But I would tell you that we're going to have to pursue some additional areas of marketing as we look to 2014 and beyond. It's something that we got a lot of effort at -- in right now, Joe, and we'll just have to visit with you later on the specifics.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Can you address at all the current capacity?","Gary D. Packer","I don't have the information in front of me right now. I'd hate to speculate, but it's probably on the order -- somewhere in the order of 15,000 barrels a day or so, which would be out there available. So we're going to have to go get a little bit more as far as to live up to the growth, the capacity that we have by the end of '13. But I'd say 15 is pretty close.","Lee K. Boothby","And Joe, our arrangements with the -- the 2 long-term arrangements have allowances in there for yellow wax as well. So we've covered ourselves in the short term.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. One last quick one, in terms of outstanding or ongoing assessment work. Any update on the Southern Alberta Basin at this point?","Lee K. Boothby","Well the update on the Southern Alberta basin is that we have no activity up there at the moment. I think that we've been monitoring industry activity. We transferred responsibility for that play to our exploration adventures team here in Houston. They continue to monitor activity, both on the U.S. side as well as on the Canadian side of the border. We've got term left there, some 3.5, 4 years remaining on our exploration phase and no need to aggressively pursue any activity in the short term. So monitor the results of some of the competitors in the area and we'll revisit that going into 2013 as far as the forward plan.","Operator","We'll go next to Anne Cameron with BNP Paribas.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Just a question on the Cana, given that you're ramping up activity as fast as you are. Could you comment a little bit on the midstream arrangement that you have in place? What stage are you with securing gathering systems and have you sought any partnerships with any midstream companies for processing?","Gary D. Packer","We're very far along in that and I would look for something -- we'll probably have something contracted in the third quarter.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Okay, no more details on that or...","Gary D. Packer","No.","Lee K. Boothby","Not at this time.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Okay, and can we have an update on your drilling program at the Pearl Development, offshore China?","Lee K. Boothby","Go ahead, Gary.","Gary D. Packer","Pearl's progressing nicely. We have our topsides rig and jacket all under construction in 3 different yards in China. Everything is progressing as scheduled, and we anticipate being in a position to be out and on production. Late 2013 would be aggressive, early 2014 is very likely. I actually visited the yards and visited our offices out there in April and was really pleased with how things are progressing.","Lee K. Boothby","I'll be making a trip this fall in August as well. So we're real pleased with the progress the team made in China.","Operator","We'll go next to William Butler with Stephens.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","In terms of Malaysia, you all had previously talked about expected downtime in the second half of the year and you all may have tried to address it with an earlier question. But can you be any more specific on the timing of that downtime and whether it should impact 3Q versus 4Q more?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. There is downtime. We were a bit oversold in the second quarter in some of those from a lifting standpoint. And that's the thing we have to keep track of, is some of those lifting impacts are going to be felt in the third quarter. So ultimately, I think the number's going to be somewhere around 300,000 barrels, we'll be impacted in the third quarter just due to timings or liftings. There will be an incremental shutdown that's associated with our Tapas [ph] facilities downstream of our PM 323 project just doing some platform modifications, which will impact our production. But that's all factored into the guidance that we have out there right now.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Is that Tapas, is that going to be third quarter also?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, that's going to be a third quarter impact at about 300,000 barrels or so.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one other question, there's been some increased discussion about the Pearsall, in the Eagle Ford area, and you all previously discussed that, particularly in Maverick County. How would your geology there differ necessarily from sort of the  [indiscernible] that guys like Cabot have pursued recently? Is that something that we could expect you all to have some potential for and have some oil there? Is that mostly going to be gas where you all are?","Gary D. Packer","It's our expectation that Pearsall in our area is primarily dry gas and then some of the JVs were announced, they were more of the wet gas liquid phase.","Operator","We'll go next to Kenneth Miller with JC Capital Management.","Unknown Analyst","I had a question on your return on investment capital criteria. What do you use for the allocation of capital to your projects? And how are these major areas that you discussed tracking these objective returns for the corporation?","Terry W. Rathert","Well, I would tell you, Kenneth, that we look at a variety of return criteria, it's not just one single thing such as rate of return or profit to investment ratio. And it depends in part on the nature of the project or the prospect and the level of uncertainty. But generally I would say that we look to our projects on a project-level basis to have in excess of a 25% pre-tax internal rate of return. In the international arena, we certainly look at things on an after-tax basis, because the nature of our activities in Malaysia, we're a taxpayer. When you look through our P&L, those current taxes are from Malaysia, because we've been extremely successful and highly profitable there. In domestic arena, due to the nature of high component IBCs, most of our current taxes are deferred, and so you'll see very little current tax. So generally I'd say that it's in excess of the 25% internal rate of return would be kind of a guiding type of value and the major projects that we invest in to deliver that in development phase. Clearly in the early stages in these assessments, we don't expect that to be the case. And I would ask you to go back and look at the history of our activity in the Woodford as an example. Where we started out -- I think, when Lee was in Tulsa and drilling those early wells, I kept telling you, we got to get through this first, 20, 30, 50 or whatever it is to make some better returns, and he kept telling me, we're getting there, we're getting there. Because we're driving the returns to experience and the activity and continuity of activities in these resource plays, you develop synergies and development cost efficiencies. And everybody that's in a major position in these plays can show you their track record of success in terms of driving costs down, improving returns through time. That's one of the benefits of large resource plays, and one of the reasons why you need to have a substantial acreage footprint for them to really generate the returns, because you have to get on that learning curve and drive the cost down. And that's exactly what we've done. So I would say, is that I think, we're on track in all of our resource plays. Where we're headed in that direction. Clearly, the first dozen wells are not going to be 25% returns. Those are more about identifying and assessing the opportunity and understanding where it fits in relative space in the portfolio, as compared to investing for that return to date.","Kenneth A. Carroll - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","But when you look at your entire investment properties, have you seen any long-term relationship between achieving your rate of return, rate of return on invested capital objectives, and either your stock price performance or enterprise value?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I think it's a very interesting, try to factor in and figure out what's at play when. If you go back to the early part of 2000, we're a gas-focused company, and we're driving those results in the Woodford and we had the synergies coming and then gas prices went down. We've converted and invested in oil. And so I think that conversion investing in oil, because it generates more cash and more cash flow will translate into share price performance. But it has to be recognized and has to have visibility and that's what 2012 is all about. It's showing the capability, the capacity of these resource plays, the new ones we've entered into in terms of the Central Basin and multiple play sites in the Central Basin, the Cana, Gary mentioned earlier, the game changing types of performance we're seeing in the lower Eagle Ford now with the extended -- the SXLs. Those, when there's clear visibility, will transfer into share price performance. And we have a deep portfolio of those and have done that. If you look through time, we've done that transition from gas to oil organically, not unlike we went from being a Gulf Coast player, where our reserve life was 5 to 6 years to having a reserve life of 13 organically. And so, those are -- they take time to go through those transitions but they will translate.","Kenneth A. Carroll - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Well it's been an excellent performance so far. One other quick question. With the 12 month, I guess, natural gas price drip now at $3.45. What would it take for you, I guess, either financially or maybe even emotionally to reallocate capital to your gassy Woodford properties?","Lee K. Boothby","I don't have any emotion attached to returns. It's all financial. So all it would take would be for the returns in those investments to compete with the returns we have in our oil portfolio. And I can tell you, it depends on the cost structure. If you had a unique cost structure in a gas basin at $3.45 where the cash generation for the dollar invested was equal to or greater than what it would be if I'm invested in oil at $90 a barrel, it would get allocated capital. Today, I don't know of a gas basin in North America where you can invest as much and get as high a return cash-on-cash as places like our Uinta Basin, the Williston, our lower Eagle Ford with 7,500-foot horizontals.","Kenneth A. Carroll - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Understood. What about at $3.85 to $4 gas? I notice your latest hedging position, you sold gas at about $3.85, unless I'm incorrect. So at $3.85 to $4, would that become competitive with the others or would it take even more?","Gary D. Packer","I'll answer that question with -- and then I'm going to move on to one more. And so if you look at our year-end reserves, our year-end reserves were down to just about $4, in the ZIP code of current oil price, and we have moved all of our proven -- substantially all of our proven undeveloped oil reserves into probable because we don't intend to drill in the next 5 years. So that's a $4 number. We still have gas production coming from the legacy properties we're not drilling and developing, but it's producing. And so we're, in essence, improving the certainly around cash flow from those operations with those hedges.","Operator","We'll go next to John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Just some quick ones. With respect to controlled flowbacks, what kind of an EUR uplift do you think you're getting by that approach?","Gary D. Packer","Well, John, it's a good question and it's something that we just don't have enough history yet to confirm it for us one way or the other. So I'd really would have say stay tuned in order to determine exactly what that's going to be. It's not -- if I think about like the Eagle Ford, to where it was and where it is today, on a similar well, I may be able to get to somewhere around a 40% increase. If you think about a well today, if it's 500,000 barrels or more, if we were in a $3.50 ZIP code before, that may be a hair aggressive, but we'll be keeping an eye on it.","Lee K. Boothby","John, I was just going to make it real, a real short technical answer, material. It's very material.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay. Uteland Butte in the high-pressure section, how much do you think the wells are draining?","Gary D. Packer","We'll have to spend some...","Lee K. Boothby",".","We only have 2, so we have 70,000 net acres. So they're each draining half right now.","Gary D. Packer","I can tell you our initial work. We're making the assumption that they're on 160s. But we're going to have to drill some spacing wells to really figure out how tight we can get that. But that's -- the work we've done thus far would indicate 160-acre space.","Lee K. Boothby","And John, when you put all of this together, the controlled flowback, the optimization of the completion recipe, getting a lot of data in multiple plays today in the wet gas condensating oil windows, and intuition would say that you would be moving towards a tighter spacing to optimize value and recoveries. So I think you'll see that progression over time. We're just early days. Excited. All signs are positive, and as I said earlier in the call, the sun's shining, and the sky is blue here.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Okay, one last one for me, Lee, is on the Three Forks. You didn't give any kind of performance information, can you say anything?","Lee K. Boothby","Yes, I'll let Gary give you some color. He was involved with the early wells there. We've primarily focused on the Bakken, but we've been following what industry has done. We've drilled a few wells and we've had good performance. Gary is up to the minute with the specifics.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, in regard to the Three Forks, we've drilled a total of 8 wells. We'll anticipate drilling about 4 wells in 2012. Just recently, we brought in a well, our Ingle [ph] well, and it was on the order of 1,400 barrels a day. So I mean, it's -- I would tell you right now it's -- at this point, from an IP standpoint, they're checking in a little shy of the Bakken wells. We had some early concerns that the Three Forks would be a little tougher drilling and we've overcome that quickly. And they seem to be drilling at about the same rate. We've just cut 2 full conventional course in an area that we would call Watford and Aquaria to better study the Three Forks, not only in the main bench, but...","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Turning to the balance sheet and specifically the credits stats of net debt to cap and long-term debt to EBITDA. Based on your own internal estimates, where do you see the range on those 2 ratios, say at the end of this year, whether pro forma for the asset divestitures or not?","Terry W. Rathert","Well, net debt to cap, we should end the year with about $3 billion of long-term debt, and that's if we run a balanced budget. So far, we're pretty much in that ZIP code. What's a little confusing is the fact that over the quarter end date, we had done one notes issuance and hadn't completely taken out debt that was on the balance sheet. So you do the net debt calculation and run a balanced budget, we'll have about $3 billion. So the net debt to cap ought to be in that 40%, low 40% range. And I think, that's probably a good range with or without any material acquisitions or dispositions.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. As a follow-up, if I could. In reviewing the Thorn [ph] and Grayson [ph] wells, the 2 wells drilled in the pressured area of the Uinta Basin, looks like they're about 6 miles apart -- located about 6 miles apart, you can correct me if I'm wrong. But what's the plan for additional wells drilled in the pressured area of the basin in terms of location distances here over the balance of this year? And could you remind us again, also of the pressure gradient of those wells versus others?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. Dan, the remaining program will be distributed across that area. You will not find it to be confined to any 1 or 2. We're not just going to snugging up against those wells. We're going to make sure we continue our assessment across the broader area. And the second question, what was your second question?","Lee K. Boothby","How many wells in the back half of the year?","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Well, it's just the pressure gradients of those wells drilled in the pressured area versus others.","Gary D. Packer","About 0.73 PSI per foot.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, and the vertical depth on the Grayson and Thorn wells?","Gary D. Packer","I believe they were, from a vertical depth standpoint, somewhere around 9,000 or 10,000 feet, and then the lateral lengths were somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 in lateral.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Tullis with Capital One South Coast.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. Jumping over to the Williston. I noticed in the ops update last week, you had one well drilled there at about $10 million for extended lateral. What are you averaging, I guess, across the up play right now for the extended laterals there?","Gary D. Packer","As far as an average this year, that $10 million is an awfully good number for us. If I rigorously calculated the average, it would probably be a hair more than that. But Cana is, I think, a representation of where we're at today. And certainly, with some of the benefits that I anticipate realizing from some completion cost reductions, we ought to be inside of that number as we look into 2013. Something that we're always -- I think it's important to recognize, we consistently are hitting it out of the park with our ability to drop days and cost out of the system on the drill side. The completion is an area that we don't want to take too much money out too soon. Because as we look there to continue to space tighter and tighter, as you well know, we've gone from 12 to 24. This year, we've gone to 32 to 38. And we're going to be looking at going to 42-stage completions. And that's an element of how we've been able to drive the EURs up to 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a well. So I don't think that's stopped and I hesitate trying to drive the cost out of the completion too quick. But I think that's a good ZIP code and just remember, that when we talked about it 1.5 years ago, we talked about reducing activity, we talked about a well that was north of $11 million, and I think folks were shocked at that, and then quickly, everybody realized that was kind of the standard cost, it was out there in the industry. So I'm very optimistic of where we've taken it and where we will take it.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, going back to the potential asset sale in the Gulf of Mexico, do you envision that selling as one entire package or do you think you might have to break it up a bit to multiple buyers?","Lee K. Boothby","I've said all I'm going to say on the Gulf of Mexico today. Hopefully we'll have more information in terms of where we're at on that within the month.","Gary D. Packer","We have time for one question. We're already over time for the call. So operator, one more call?","Operator","We'll take our last question from Rudy Hokanson with Barrington research.","Rudolf A. Hokanson - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Real quick and easy. On your general and administrative guidance, it's gone up a bit. And I know that you mentioned in the note regarding costs on the international side or with some planned production facility upgrades. And I was wondering if you could explain maybe what's happening with G&A for the whole year?","Lee K. Boothby","Rudy, it's really simple. The G&A cost, if you take the sum of what is shown is net G&A, presented by GAAP and those internal costs are capitalized, the numbers haven't changed. So the total of those 2 is the same, it's accounting landscape. And so the cost are right where we think they're going to be, have been and expected to be there all year. It's just accounting landscape in terms of what portion gets capitalized.","Lee K. Boothby","Thanks, Rudy. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for tuning in this morning. I certainly enjoyed the Q&A session. I hope the take away for all of you is that the management team and the organization is very excited about where we're at midyear 2012. I'm excited about the second half and I look forward to keeping you up to speed as we continue to have the good results rolling in for multiple plays. So have a good day, and thank you very much.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","Lee K. Boothby","Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Newfield's Third Quarter Conference Call. We've had a good year and are well along on our journey transitioning to an oil company. Our shift to oil began in mid-2009 when we made the decisions to defer activities in natural gas and focus on cash flow generation from our oil and liquids-rich assets. This has not been an easy transition. In fact, it's much easier to grow production and reserves than the development of natural gas assets. I know we're making the right economic choices to create the most value for our shareholders over the long term.","Our list of year-to-date achievements is growing. We've seen solid execution in our field operations. Our teams have done a great job of executing at the field level in each our core areas. We've delivered on our promises and raised our production guidance throughout the year. We've delivered strong results from our Cana Woodford play. Our South Cana wet gas results demonstrate that we are development-ready, and our exciting assessment program is evaluating the oil and liquids phase across our growing acreage position. We'll share more details with you later in today's call.","We're working to unlock the vast potential of the Utah's Uinta Basin. We're assessing multiple horizontal plays north of our Monument Butte field in an area we call the Central Basin. Here we are fortunate to have an oil sub-stratigraphic column that span several thousand feet and multiple oil plays are being tested. We're very encouraged with the results from our first 2 horizontal wells in the Wasatch.","Our SXL wells in the Eagle Ford are pointing to EURs of more than 500,000 barrels. Our SXL campaign in the Eagle Ford has been successful and we plan to increase our investment in the region in 2013. We've improved on our execution and are delivering outstanding results from the Williston Basin.","Today, we have reduced our days-to-depth to just over 20, lowered well cost, transitioned to pad drilling, optimized our completions and decreased the number of days up from rig release to oil -- first oil sales. Combined, these sections have dramatically improved our returns and we plan to increase our activity level in the Williston in 2013.","Our 2012 volumes benefited from significantly higher-than-expected oil production offshore Malaysia. In fact, our current estimates are about 1.5 million barrels higher than our beginning-of-year expectations. This achievement is the combined effect of better-than-expected field performance and proactive steps we took to accelerate oil production in net present value. We've improved our focus through the continued sale of nonstrategic assets. Over the last 18 months, we've monetized nearly $1 billion in properties. The most recent transaction was the sale of our remaining Gulf of Mexico assets. These assets contributed about 14 Bcf to our 2012 volumes through closing. Although we sold our shelf assets in 2007, the recent sale of our remaining assets in the Gulf was the final chapter in a 25-year story. The Gulf was damn good to Newfield over this quarter century. We got our start there, grew up there, made a lot of money over the years. This success allowed for expansion into onshore regions and internationally and served as the foundation for the development of today's portfolio of assets.","","Our asset sales since 2007 have allowed us to better focus our people and our capital on plays for our future, while providing the funds to bridge the delta between our cash flow and our annual capital investments during our transformation. Proceeds are being used to aid our transition to oil and accelerate our domestic liquids growth.","When we embarked on our journey to oil in mid-2009, we knew that our absolute production growth rate would suffer. In fact, periods of flat-to-declining absolute production were anticipated. But we knew that our focus was on the right commodity, oil. And we had confidence that our investments would be accretive to cash flow and would add value over the long term.","As I mentioned, one of the keys to our recent oil growth has been Malaysia.  In 2012, we benefited from flush production from new developments and the acceleration of our plant development drilling at East Belumut and East Piatu. In addition, debottlenecking the downstream infrastructure at East Belumut allowed for volumes to increase dramatically from this field, which has already produced more than 25 million barrels to-date. Our gross production in Malaysia recently crusted 78,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and our net production from our international operations is today about 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","These volumes are significantly higher than our beginning-of-year expectations. In fact, our Malaysian volumes are expected to be up 50% this year. I applaud our international team for the innovative work they have done over the last year to take us to new highs. The timing of this increase was well timed with the strength of the Brent oil prices.","These are very lucrative investments and we achieved payout in only 9 months at East Piatu, our most recent oil development. At East Belumut, the field paid out in about 1 year and has already returned more than twice our initial investment. These fields will experience natural declines from their recent production highs in 2013. Due to the fact that we accelerated our 2012 production in Malaysia, while simultaneously benefiting from higher oil prices, the change in our net revenue interest in 2013 will occur earlier than originally anticipated. Essentially, our net production is dictated by terms of our various production-sharing contracts. As a result, we expect that our 2013 international oil volumes will decline up to 25% from 2012 levels.","We're confident that our international oil volumes will show strong production growth again in 2014 and beyond driven by our Pearl oil field development offshore China, which will commence production in early 2014 and add about 15,000 barrels of oil per day net at peak production. In addition, we have several new oil and gas initiatives underway in Malaysia today. However, we are not yet in a position to disclose those details.","Onshore in the U.S., I'm encouraged with our progress to-date and I'm very excited about the potential of the oil and liquids-rich plays in our portfolio. The Uinta Basin, the Williston Basin, the Cana Woodford and the Anadarko Basin and our Eagle Ford program in South Texas, driven by our recent SXL success. The work in 2012 was dedicated to rapidly assessing these areas and expediting their move towards ultimate development. I'd be remiss not to point out that on October 5, the very day we closed on the sale of the Gulf of Mexico's deepwater assets, Newfield achieved a new all-time high to-date production rate of 923 million cubic feet equivalent per day. Post the Gulf asset sale, our production is now 52% oil and liquids. We still expect that our total liquids growth will be up 30% in 2012. As we say repeatedly, it's not just about absolute production growth that matters, it's cash flow growth and that's our singular focus today.","As to our planning for 2013, I can tell you that we're working on various budget scenarios and we'll have the specifics to share with you soon. I can assure you that our people and capital will be aligned to exploit our best oil and liquids-rich assets. I'm confident in our ability to continue to show strong growth in our domestic oil volumes. For 2013, we expect that our domestic oil volumes will again grow by more than 20%, which is consistent with our liquids growth trend over the last 4 years. Before we move to operational highlights, I'll quickly cover our financial results from the third quarter.","For the third quarter of 2012, we reported a net loss of $33 million or $0.24 per share. The loss was driven primarily by 2 items: first, we had an unrealized loss in commodity derivatives of $85 million after tax or $0.63 per share; second, we had a onetime charges of approximately $20 million that were reflected in the cash expenses for the quarter. The largest component of this was associated with the tender in early redemption of our notes due in 2016. Stated without the effect of these items, our net income in the third quarter would have been $65 million or $0.48 per share. Revenues for the third quarter were $615 million. For the period, nearly half our total production was oil and liquids, and that accounted for about 80% of our company revenues. Cash flow for the period was $308 million.","We continue to focus on growing oil and liquids volumes. Oil and liquid liftings in the third quarter of 2012 were up 20% over the comparable period in 2011 to 6.1 million barrels or an average of about 66,000 barrels of oil per day. Our NGL volumes for the quarter were about 700,000 barrels or about 6% of our total production. Our natural gas production in the quarter was just under 39 Bcf, an average of about 420 million cubic feet per day. Natural gas volumes year-over-year have fallen about 14%. We realized $3.41 per Mcf in our natural gas sales during the third quarter, $91.50 on our oil liftings and NGLs were sold for $26.71 per barrel. We'll be happy to address any specific questions related to our financials at the end of our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it over to Gary Packer, our Chief Operating Officer, for a few operational highlights.","Gary D. Packer","Thank you, Lee. Let's start with an update of an area that has certainly been thrust into the spotlight of late, the Cana Woodford. We are very encouraged with our results to-date. We're currently running 4 operated rigs in the area. We did a pretty good job of keeping this play quiet for much of the last 2 years. Over that time, we were able to amass a sizable acreage position. Since the last call, we have increased our acreage by an additional 7,000 acres. We now hold 142,000 acres. We included some new wells on last night's operations release and also updated production on the wells we've previously announced to include 100 days or so of data. Our controlled flowback techniques are keeping reservoir pressures higher, allowing for very strong flow rates over an extended period of time and enhancing ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons in place.","Our acreage today is in the heart of the play. In addition to the 10 wells we have released to-date, we have participated in about 40 industry wells operated by others, of which 25 are producing to-date. Our interest in these outside-operated wells has also provided us with increased confidence about the quality of our own acreage position. The lion's share of our activity to-date has focused on our southern acreage which covers about 80,000 net acres. One of Newfield's undeniable core competencies is our drilling completion expertise. By applying lessons learned in horizontal drilling throughout our focus areas, we have made huge progress in reducing days versus depth and total well costs. Our first well in this play took about 100 days to drill. We are now drilling in casing wells in just over 40 days. We know from experience that there is still ample room for improvement as we move this play further into development. Based on production so far, we estimate gross EURs of between 1.1 million and 1.9 million barrels equivalent. With the current cost and commodity prices, this results in 35% to well over 50% rates of return.","We also are actively assessing the old window along trend. To the north, we see the potential for a development with very high oil composition. In yesterday's release, we highlighted our first 10,000-foot lateral well drilled in the north area. This SXL well called the Klade has an additional -- has initial gross IP of about 925 barrels equivalent per day and a 30-day average of over 600 barrels equivalent per day. The production stream on this well is over 90% oil.","We have proven time and time again that extended laterals improve returns, and we will continue to drill SXLs through our acreage position. In addition to the prolific Cana Woodford play, we have other creative ideas to test and exploit [ph] in this thick stratigraphic column present across our acreage position. We are also close to finalizing a midstream deal that will give us the required capacity we need to march forth with aggressive development. We expect that our ultimate NGL pricing will be tied to Mont Belvieu and not the Conway hub. More on these details later this year as they get inked and put into motion.","Before we lead the Mid-Con, I want to point out that earlier this year, we moved one of our operated rigs that was running in the Cana over to the Granite Wash to test for Hogshooter play. Our first well was a barn burner with an initial gross production of more than 5,000 equivalent per day -- barrels equivalent per day. This well has averaged about 4,200 barrels a day over the first 30 days. Our working interest in this well is about 100%. We have a rig dedicated to the play now and we will be drilling -- and we are drilling our second well currently.","Now let's move to the Uinta Basin where our production is now 39,000 barrels equivalent per day gross or about 30,000 barrels of oil per day. In yesterday's release, we reported encouraging results from our first 2 horizontal Wasatch wells. The Wasatch is a high potential formation that spans more than 1,200-foot in thickness and has several specific targets. As you know, we've been actively assessing the Wasatch over the last 18 months and have drilled 35 vertical wells to-date. These vertical wells are highly economic and are providing us with comprehensive data along the entire stratigraphic column. History also tells us that we can enhance ultimate value creation through horizontal exploitation. Our 2 initial horizontal wells were drilled about 5 miles apart and tested the same geologic horizon, the uppermost portion of the Wasatch. Gross initial production from these wells has averaged about 1,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the composition was 88% oil. The wells' average 30-day production was about 750 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross and the 90-day average was about 625 equivalent. We are impressed by how production from these wells has held up over the 90 days and are anxious to drill additional horizontal wells.","Now when making comparisons to our 40 vertical wells to-date, it's critically important to consider that the fact that these completed laterals in these wells has only averaged just 3,200 feet. As we have mentioned more than once today, the key to ultimate economic success lies in longer lateral completions. When we project potential flow rates to 5,000 or 7,500-foot laterals in the Wasatch, I get awful excited. Our collective energy is being channeled to make this happen as quickly as possible. We are now working with regulators on a plan to allow for 1,280-acre units in long lateral lengths for ultimate field development.","As we have proven time and time again, longer laterals will provide positive benefits for all parties, like the higher percentage -- like a higher percentage of total developed acreage, reduced surface disturbances, higher recoveries of oil in plays, increased private and state royalties and increased production and severance taxes. We will keep you apprised of our progress as we move ahead. Over the next several months, we expect to spud 2 additional horizontal Wasatch wells. We will continue with an active vertical campaign as well.","In yesterday's operating report, we also provided an update on our Uteland Butte horizontal drilling program in the Central Basin. To-date, we have drilled 2 dozen wells in the play, about half of them are in the pressured areas. This play will continue to be actively assessed next year. Our strongest returns to-date in the Uteland Butte have come from the pressured regime where we have more than 70,000 net perspective acres. We've seen flow rates as high as 1,500 [ph] barrels of oil equivalent per day and oil content upwards of 90%.","And now onto Eagle Ford. We recently turned to sales our fourth SXL, and the early data looks consistent with our previous 3 wells. The most recent well averaged 730 barrels of oil equivalent gross over its first 10 days of production. Our super extended laterals in the Eagle Ford have performed extremely well. The wells averaged -- have averaged 530 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the first 180 days. This translates to an EUR of more than 500,000 barrels. Again, we are using controlled flowback to manage the production, limit pressure drawdown and maximize EURs. Our South Texas drilling team is able to drill and case these wells in 12 days for less than $3 million. We are seeing some relief in completion cost and expect the favorable trends to continue into 2013.","Once in the development mode, we reiterate our belief that we can drill and complete 7,500-foot lateral wells from common pads for less than $8 million gross. Our Eagle Ford SXL wells to-date generate internal rate of return between 35% and 50%. We are confident returns will further improve as we continue to apply our learnings timely to create value.","For 2013, we will be increasing our planned development activities in the Eagle Ford and expect to drill as many as 35 wells. In addition, we will be working more than 200,000-plus net acre position into the economic window. I'll now turn it back to Lee.","Lee K. Boothby","My apologies for the call in there. We weren't brave enough to hit the do-not-disturb button but Shell Trading apparently was trying to call into our call so, hopefully, they'll call back to the right number a little later. We'll continue on. So, thank you, Gary. And thank you to all of you for your investments in our company. We're excited about the results we're seeing today and our onshore focus areas. We entered 2012 with a game plan that called for rapid assessment of new liquids plays in the Cana Woodford, the Uinta Basin and the Eagle Ford. Our results are very good and we have very strong returns in each of these areas. We will continue to allocate our capital to these years and drive strong domestic liquids growth from our portfolio. We're confident that this is the right decision to create value for our shareholders, and we're going to continue working hard to make it happen each and every day. This time, we'll open it up to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to David Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly focusing on the international production down about 25% in '13. Can you give us just a rough estimate on what you think that's going to do to corporate EBITDA and how we should be thinking about that with respect to capital spending for '13, and your comments on living within cash flow?","Gary D. Packer","Well, that would be, of course, the barrels there are going to be missed from a cash flow perspective, but we, so far, have not set our capital budget for 2013. As we go through that process and decide how to allocate capital, both domestically and in the international arena, we'll be in a better position to share thoughts on that with you when we come out with our capital plan in '13. But probably there would go -- will be a few barrels that won't be delivering revenue in 2013 as a result of having produced those barrels in 2012.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just to dive into that a smidge more though, looking at the EBITDA contribution from your International business, I would speculate it would probably, with the exception of asset sales, lead to CapEx being down on a year-over-year basis. Am I off the mark on that?","Gary D. Packer","Well, if we used EBITDA as one component or our cash flow as one component of the sources for CapEx, then we'd have to clearly say that there is a lesser amount there to fund CapEx. But we have other alternatives, and again, we haven't established the 2012 -- 2013 capital budget for neither the international or domestic piece. And prior to doing that, it would be premature to say what the implications on our CapEx budget is going to be.","Lee K. Boothby","Dave, we've got our Board Strategy Session in early November. So we're not going to comment much more than that until after we've had a chance to play out our process to go through internally. We're on the same schedule that we've been on for what seems like forever and a day. We'll go through that session, we'll work our plan and when we get our 2013 details put together, we'll share them with you. But we wanted to give everybody a heads up on accelerating 1.5 million barrels into '12. We can't manufacture barrels so we're accelerating activities that impact 2013. Net-net, it's been a positive. We've got some challenges there in 2013 and we've got some options. So let us work through our plan and we'll give you more details at an appropriate time.","Gary D. Packer","I would just -- one other thing, David, and that is in the context of -- we're talking about growing our domestic production oil at the same pace [ph] or better than we have in the past and so those barrels deliver a lot of cash, just like the international barrels. So, you do have a very rapidly growing cash flow stream from the domestic production.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I appreciate that clarification. One just a quick one if you can, on the Cana forest, if you can kind of walk through the latest cost on the super extended laterals there, kind of well design. And then are you guys going to be trying to target specifically more of an oil window than you have in the past? Or do you have enough well results to be able to delineate what is a larger portion of the oil window there?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, we would tell you that clearly, David, you recall that we entered 2012 with a strong assessment program in the Cana Woodford. We did focus most of that capital spending in '12 down in the south for obvious reasons, and we've gotten really good results. I think our team has, over the course of the last year, grown our production out of that area to upwards of 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a standing start. So we've got good momentum there and good, strong well results but we are going to have to continue to assess the various regions of the play as well. So you'll see a heavier emphasis on development going to '13, but we're going to continue to step out and evaluate our acreage. You'll further recall that we -- when we put that position together, we talked a lot about this over the last year that about half of our acreage we felt was in the wet gas condensate window and about half of it was in the oil window. So clearly, as we move through the acreage block, we're going to have a distribution of wet gas and oil. We'll just have to drill the wells, get the results, and then we can give you a stronger opinion in terms of how to think about the portfolio distribution between those 2 phases. But also I'll let Gary comment on the cost and then we'll move on. [Operator Instructions]","Gary D. Packer","Gary again. Yes, Dave, as far as the cost go, in the Cana for development, we're still targeting something a little over $9 million a well. Well cost by industry and certainly, we're no exception in 2012, a bit higher than that -- have higher than that as we've climbed that learning curve, really happy where we sit right now. Our wells are a little longer than what industry has drilled . We're about 4,700 feet with industry drilling about 4,000-foot laterals. I would have to be projecting for you to talk about the SXLs. So if you allow me to -- the fact that we've only drilled one of these, these wells would be about 7,500-foot or so. I would expect EURs to rise considerably from the 1.9 million-barrel range that I spoke about earlier. These wells would be 2.5 million to 3 million barrels or so and the well cost would probably, on a development basis, move up from that $9 million a well or so to probably something that would be more in the order of $11 million for that 3 -- that 2.5 million to 3 million barrels. Very, very strong economics. Some of the best we would see in our entire portfolio.","Operator","We'll go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple -- let me spend my bullets on the Uinta. If I look at that, and I know it's early, but the Wasatch versus the Uteland Butte, it looks like those first 2 Wasatch wells, and again it's only 2 wells, but it looks like they're tracking above the Uteland Butte. Are you seeing anything different? Or what's different zone or can you talk any more about the difference between the 2?","Gary D. Packer","I would share the same observation, as you, David. The wells are tracking slightly about -- above the Uteland Butte. It's really too early. With 2 wells, that's all we have to deal with. As you're probably familiar with, there's a whole series of stack zones and it's very important -- you don't have the level of continuity across the acreage position in the Wasatch so you're relying on frac-ing across multiple intervals. We've proven in our first 2 wells that we can do that. I certainly wouldn't say 2 wells demonstrates the consistency by which we can deliver that production but we're highly confident, and as I said in the earlier, we're going to go ahead and drill several wells over the next few months and validate that. The benefit of the Uteland Butte is the fact that we see a high degree of continuity across the acreage position. So at this point, I would tell you geologically, high continuity across the entire acreage position in the Uteland Butte, still driving to improve our completion techniques, which will ultimately really drive the return there. Wasatch, a little different. Really focusing on getting the wells drilled to the entire length, more diversity, geologically. But certainly, really like what we see to-date, and yes, it looks like it would generate a return that would be a little better than we would see in the Uteland Butte.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes, David, Gary touched on it in the call. I'll just throw this in. Remember the 35 wells that we drilled in the vertical section, they're completed in multiple intervals within the 1,200-foot section. I think, on average, we've had a half a dozen completion intervals in each of those wells. So we're getting a pretty good data set to know that we're moving oil out of a significant total percentage of that 1,200-foot from the vertical wells. A key next step is going to be working through, getting to the point that Gary talked about where we can drill the longer laterals. That's really where you get the leverage out of it, but we're very excited. It's only 2 wells. It's the only 2 wells we have but a good place to start.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for a follow-up, a year ago, and Steve this is similar question I asked you last night, but a year ago, you guys 5 to 6 rigs running, you thought you were going to ramp to 8 to 9. You've kind of stayed at the 5 to 6. Can you just talk about why the lower rig count this year versus what you had previously expected, what's driving that?","Stephen C. Campbell","Sure. I think it's a good question, David. We look to capital allocation. We look across all the investment opportunities we have in the company. You're well familiar with our commitment to live within our resources. As we looked into this year, we were assessing multiple areas, both in the Cana, the Eagle Ford and the Uinta. What we saw this year was there's a high degree of consistency in the results that we were getting out of the early Eagle Ford and the South Cana. As a result of that, we made sure that we pounded away at those to deliver the production commitments that we had made. What we've of served in the Uinta is that we really like the results that we're seeing, but we still haven't narrowed in -- narrowed down that distribution. We're seeing results both extraordinarily high and we're seeing some poorer wells as well. So we've made the decision as we -- going into the back half of 2012, and you'll likely see this as we enter 2013, is to continue to drill more wells there, but we need to refine the distribution. I would caution you to not count rigs. I would tell you this year -- next year, we will drill more wells in the Central Basin than we drilled -- horizontal wells than we drilled in 2012. We're just seeing some pretty incredible improvements in efficiencies that allow us to drill more with less as well.","Lee K. Boothby","And other thing, David, one of our objectives going into this year was to have multiple developable oil plays within North America. So exiting '12, we've got good strong success in 4 areas, and I think it takes some of the near-term stress off the Uinta so that we can take that methodical march through the assessment program, get our learning curves in order, as Gary indicated, and be prepared to ramp up as the refining volumes start coming available late '13 and '14 going into '15. So I think we're in good shape there and we'll continue pressing ahead, but I like the fact that we've got 4 areas we can allocate capital to this year relative -- excuse, going into next year relative to oil in North America.","Operator","We'll go next to Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the Cana here. Trying to get a sense of what percentage of your 142,000 net acres in the play has been de-risked at this point?","Gary D. Packer","Well, Leo, the area that we have the most well control to-date by both Newfield and industry would be the 80,000 or so that we have to the South. So clearly, that's the area that we would feel most confident right now. If you look at the entire area, Newfield has participated in about 46 wells that have been drilled in that 80,000 acres, of which about 22 are on production. So my highest confidence is there. There are certainly holes in that 80,000 that we have to fill in through additional drilling, but it's the area that we have the highest confidence. As we move to the north, Newfield in the oil window, which is what we'll be targeting, only has a handful of wells. Really, our second well that we drilled up there, the oil window, this Klade, that's the 10,000-foot well. So I would advise you that the balance of that acreage position, we like what we see in the oil window but we certainly need more drilling before we can call it a development play and it's still very much assessment.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, thanks. And I guess unrelated question here. Just trying to get a sense of what your well cost was on the first Hogshooter well. And maybe you can you talk about well cost in the horizontal Wasatch and the Horizontal Uteland Butte currently.","Gary D. Packer","In regards to the Hogshooter, that well cost us a little over $8 million. And if you go back and you want to talk about the Cana, I think you specifically referenced the horizontal Uteland Butte wells and the Wasatch. The wells in the horizontal Uteland Butte in the geo-pressured section, and I think this is a good proxy for the Wasatch as well, those wells will be somewhere in the vicinity in the development mode of about $5.5 million or so. Just like I referenced in the Cana earlier, in 2012, our cost have been higher there because we are drilling -- these wells were never drilled before 2012. So we certainly had a learning curve. So you can add a couple million to each of those as you think about the actual realized cost in 2012. But when we think about the depth of the portfolio and several thousand locations we have, we're really targeting a $5.5 million well. The rest of it is really investments for science.","Operator","We'll go next to Amir Arif with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First question is on the '13 international oil volume outlook. How much of that is related to production declines expected at the sea level versus the net oil number you show having reached payout? And if it is a payout issue, does that change as you get some exploration success or is everything ring-fenced?","Lee K. Boothby","Let me jump in and I'll let Gary give you whatever details that I leave out. I think the PSE structure, as you return capital from the project coming online, you go through a series of payout tranches, if you will. Generally, as the projects have returned the capital, you get to lower net revenue interest, so lower net barrels coming back. So a portion of the decline year-over-year because of the acceleration is related to that activity. The other piece of the puzzle is that we've had the benefit of flush production in a couple of these key fields and they've way outperformed. So we know going into 2013, one would expect that you'll see natural field-level declines. I'm going to guess that, off the top of head, and Gary can set this straight, but I'm going to guess that from what I've seen that it's somewhere around 50-50, 40-60 depending on how you slice it because remember price -- product price is part of the equation as well in terms of determining net barrels. So if you could tell us the oil price, we can probably nail it down closer than that. But I think that's a reasonable proxy.","Gary D. Packer","I think you're pretty close, Lee. Certainly a majority of the decline is something that we have not observed yet in our East Belumut PM 323 field. This is the area that we've accelerated now into our third phase of development drilling. We're observing the movements in context [ph], but the well -- the field is producing great. But just doing the modeling that we've done, we would anticipate that we would come off plateau in 2013 and that's what's been baked into our numbers. Your observation on additional investments, we have a Phase 4 drilling campaign. If we were able to get Phase 4 approved, that would result in incremental capital, a change in the payout structure, and we could see our net the barrels increase as a result of that investment that we would make but that is something that's not approved yet.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the '12 CapEx. Are you still comfortable with the $1.7 billion, and if you can just confirm that's a growth number, not a net CapEx number, and then just timing of when you will be putting out the '13 guidance.","Stephen C. Campbell","Yes. We're still within the guidance range on capital that we previously communicated. In the vicinity of $1.7 billion, that's correct.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And -- I'm sorry, and '13 guidance is -- I know mentioned soon. Is that December or February?","Lee K. Boothby","Well go through the process in November. Generally, we take the input from the board, refine that process through year end. Historically, we'd  come out, generally, in early part of the year, notionally, February with guidance. I would tell you it would take place likely sometime between year end and February we'll be in a position to communicate.","Operator","We'll go next to Subash Chandra with Jefferies.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First on the Maverick Basin, what was the cost of that extended lateral? And remind me if this was a normally pressured part of the play or not.","Lee K. Boothby","Well it's -- as far as the cost, I'll let Gary get to you on the cost. The Eagle Ford that we're drilling, first of all, our acreage is all in the oil window, so it's black oil and it's all slightly overpressured, I guess, relative to normal. I don't have the number, but I'd say slightly overpressured relative to normal.","Gary D. Packer","Yes. You're right on the pressure, Lee. In regards to the well cost, we've only drilled one well. So you have to put it in that same population like I was talking about the Klade, the 10,000-foot well there. You ought to be thinking about a well cost as we get into pad development within the 7,500-foot, which is what our wells have been to-date of the something in the vicinity or right under $8 million, that's what I believe we'll be drilling our wells for. When we step out and drill the 10,000-foot laterals, those wells will be in the $9 million to $10 million window. Now because of the configuration of our acreage position, we will not be able to go to entirely one well or another. I would tell you, you should be thinking about the vast majority, maybe 3\/4 of the wells in the play to be in and around the 7,500-foot lateral. Balance is filling in the corners, and to the greatest degree possible, 5,000 and 10,000-foot laterals.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And final one for me, is there a reserve impact on -- for the Malaysian PSE?","Gary D. Packer","No. There's no reserve impact. Those values are all calculated into the numbers we have at year end. Of course, every time you prepare a reserve report, you use a price at that point in time. So depending upon what the pricing will be for this year end, the volumes in those contracts, regardless of field performance, go up and down purely as a function of price. So it'll be a combination of the 2, but we've already accounted for those in our reserves.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Going back to one of the earlier questions on South Cana, Woodford. Are you seeing a major difference in well costs in the wells that are tracking 50% or more oil versus those that are tracking 30% or less? And can you talk to whether you feel that can isolate the higher liquids wells from a drilling program, and what percent of your southern acreage that represents?","Gary D. Packer","We've got a lot of questions in there, Brian.","Lee K. Boothby","A lot of questions in the assets. I hope you remember them all.","Gary D. Packer","We do not see a material metal difference in the well cost between an oil well and a wet gas well, okay? In regards to our ability to distinguish between wet gas and oil, certainly there's a difference as we move from the shallower. If you think about an east-west look through the play, whether it's in the north or the south, we see the oil window somewhere in the vicinity of 8,000 to 12,000-feet or so, and you see the gas window coming in at about 12,000 feet down to about 6 [ph] feet. If you look at our acreage position, there's only a few thousand feet difference between what we would place from TVD standpoint between the oil and the wet gas. There is not a big difference. We are still defining exactly -- we had some lines drawn that we thought we had a pretty good understanding of where the oil wet gas line was. We've recently completed 3 wells, some of which are in the materials we've released to-date that would demonstrate, it's kind of a blurred line. And so I would have to kind of visit -- get back with you later we'd -- to really see what the relative proportions are. In general, I'd say you're probably 2\/3 wet gas to 1\/3 oil. But that's still something that's changing.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And if I'm allowed a follow-up after my 3 questions, first question, can I ask on the Hogshooter, you mentioned in the press release 90% of the 5,100 BOE a day was liquids. Can you talk about the NGL oil split there and repeatability?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. I mean, what I'll tell you is, is just some -- I have a 40-day number handy. So that 40-day number is, as I referenced earlier, about 4,000 barrels equivalent per day. The constitution of that was about 2,650 barrels of oil, 780 barrels of NGLs and about 3.9 million cubic feet a day. And that's a 40-day average. So that's, what, 75% oil, 90% liquids or so.","Operator","We'll go next to William Butler with Stephens.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","In terms of the Eagle Ford, and you all broadening the acreage that you think is perspective from recently 40,000, I believe, up back towards the 230,000, can you all be more specific on what has changed for you all to you make that area more perspective in your minds? Is it well cost? Is it completion methods? Is it offset operators? What combination of sort of if you could rank them, what's changed and where are you so much more positive on it?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, well, let me clarify something you said there. We are not projecting now that the 200,000 acres is de-risked by any means. So let's first focus on the acreage position that we've been very active in. The biggest thing that's changed for us between 2011 and 2012 is the length of the lateral that we've drilled from 5,000 to 7,500-foot and probably more importantly than that, the great work that our completions teams have do in trying to figure out that special sauce that it's going to take to unlock something that is different from the Gulf Coast basin. We're really pleased with what we've done. And it's not just one thing. There is a number of things that they've gone to really unlock that and really create the value there for us. So our reference to the 200,000 acres in the balance of that acreage position, we'll be moving into a shallower section. It's certainly still all black oil, and what we'll be doing is applying for the first time these enhanced completion techniques that have worked so well for us on the 40 to that broader acreage position. We will be careful early on. We're going to moving up into the McKnight area. We'll still be staying in largely Dimmit and Zavala County. We'll drill a few wells early in the year. We'll assess those results, and if they look encouraging, we'll continue to expand that position where we try this new technique. But it's still early days in that regard.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you all mentioned there the 500,000 barrel EURs. So over what acreage position does that number apply then?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I would tell you that the safest place to start is start with the 40,000-acre position that Gary was talking about. We said that, that position was a developable before we had, had this success and this success certainly enhances those results. The ultimate spacing in terms of a lateral offset between wells, our team's still working through pilots in that regard. That will have a -- be a factor in terms of the total well count and a totally EUR ultimately. We'll keep you apprised as that develops. Saying, greater than 500,000 barrels says that we're very confident with 500,000 barrels and there upside beyond that and it's going to take time to see what that upside looks like. So we need more time with the wells that we have online and more wells in total to get to where we've got a statistically valid subset. But we're very encouraged. And of the broader acreage position, remember we drilled assessment wells there back in 2010 and early 2011. So we know that, that acreage is oil productive. Our hope, to Gary's point, is that we can transport some of these learnings into those other areas and expand the economic footprint. And I think your question there is the right one. Just watch for an expansion in the economic footprint, go from something 40,000 acres to north of 40,000 acres, and as we've got confidence that it's expanding, we'll keep you updated.","Operator","We'll go next to John Herrlin with Societe General.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Most things have been asked. I was wondering with the Wasatch, whether you could see yourselves being totally horizontal there in the future? That's it.","Lee K. Boothby","I believe the answer to that is, yes, John. I think that we're very encouraged with the vertical well results that we've had, strong positive economics there. Once we get to a more favorable regulatory layout, the 1,280-acre pilots that are in the early stages of being permitted in the basin, I think you'll see a transition over to horizontal drilling. I think the future in the basin is horizontal, but clearly, we do have strong, positive vertical results in terms of economics and there'll a mix as we transition that direction. I'll let Gary give some additional color.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, John, the only thing that I'd add to that is I agree absolutely with what Lee said, that it really goes back to a question that was asked earlier, I think, by Brian regarding the well counts. If you think about 2012, we drilled about 30 vertical Wasatch wells. Due to the success that we've had in the horizontal program thus far, we really have hit the pause button on the vertical program. We'll drill some wells to get the required geological control, but we don't want to fall into a trap where we overdrill the vertical and then we have issues by drilling horizontals in the same spacing. So that is an issue. I would expect us certainly to some vertical drilling in 2013. But it will be a fraction of what we did in 2012 for all the reasons I just said.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Lively with Tudor, Pickering.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I know there's a lot of questions on international, but just have a few more. Can you remind us, in 2012, what is the international as a group? What is that as a percentage of the total EBITDA for the company?","Gary D. Packer","In 2012, it would probably be in the range of 40%.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so if you think about that for next year, 40% production is declining, I guess, you guys said about 25%. So you are losing that EBITDA. But how much CapEx are you going to deploy in Malaysia next year?","Gary D. Packer","Well the final -- like I said earlier, the final of CapEx that we are going to deploy in both the international and domestic arena is not settled at this time because we're going through those processes. I think Lee mentioned that we have a number of things that we're working on there that we're really not in a position to talk about. They will influence our thoughts around CapEx, depending upon how they come together and the timing of when they come together. The largest component of CapEx that we know is committed is the Pearl development in China and that's all -- China and Malaysia both make up the international component. I'll focus you again on the domestic growth in liquids as the offset to this because our liquids growth in domestic arena, and when we have more liquids in the domestic arena and we're going it in the domestic arena, and it makes up a big chunk as a difference between what we're going to see as a result of the contract terms in international and 2013 and 2014 international is a growing story again.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm just thinking about next year in terms of how much capital you guys have put to work this year, what the potential for spending is next year. I'm assuming it's lower than $300 million, which is plus or minus, I guess, what you guys have spent this year and the free cash flow change over that international asset as it relates to your ability to use that free cash to plow into the domestic assets. And so I guess the question is, is, I mean, what other opportunities are you guys looking at in terms of -- are you looking at more asset sales to help maybe fund that gap, if there is, to keep the oil growth going domestically?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, Brian, I'd love to engage and have a discussion on all those points. But again, I've got to respect our process. We've got a board meeting in 2 weeks, we'll talk about all these things. Get board-level support, and we'll work diligently from that point forward to provide you guys with the information that you need. We can't talk about the other things that we've got in the air at this point, and historically, that means that we're not in a position to talk about it. As soon as we are, I think you'll have some clarity on a couple of those questions that you've asked. So we'll keep you apprised. We're just not prepared to say any more than what we've said today.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's understandable. Just one clarification. When you say 25% product declines next year, do you mean exit over exit or are you talking about average over average? Just a mechanical question.","Lee K. Boothby","I was talking about average over average and I said up to 25%. So remember, we accelerated 1.5 million-plus barrels into this year. One of the ways to think about is if we'd left the plan as it was and hadn't attacked it, that we'd had that distributed over the 2-year period. So our team has done great work there, each of the last 3 years, and they've found a way to outperform. Hell, I'm counting on them again. But at this point, we wanted to at least turn the lights on and let you know that this is an issue that we're working on. We thought it was something that you'd want to know about, and we're going to work it just like we have the last 3 years.","Operator","We'll go to Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","On the subject of decline rates, can you give me an estimate on what the underlying -- what the decline rate is on the underlying gas asset base, the domestic natural gas asset base?","Lee K. Boothby","Oh, I was waiting for somebody to answer. I guess you're talking to me, Dan. I'll jump in. Well, I'll start you with -- we said in the call that 14% is what we've seen kind of year-over-year in the comparable period. Remember we said that we thought natural gas declines this year would be up to 15%. I think we've been just under that during the course of the year. Obviously we're not investing in the dry gas when you think about the dry gas portion being the underlying assets. Year-over-year I would expect the decline rate to be something less than that, kind of in total relative to those assets and then we'll get the offsetting benefits of the associated gas that's going to come onto the equation -- come into the equation with our oil development. So 14% is what we've seen over the last 12 months and I guess 2% to 3% on the base underneath that, but I don't have a firm final estimate at this point. I'll let Gary give you any additional color that he might want to add.","Gary D. Packer","No, I think that's about right.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, recognizing the relatively low oil cuts at least on the southern part of your acreage perspective for Cana, can you speak to how Cana well produces over time? That is, how does the gas cut and the NGL cut change over time and maybe use the right 1H-9 well as one example since that's the model well and those from the larger sample set. At least an estimate, please?","Lee K. Boothby","Dan, I don't have it in front me this morning but Steve included recently a slide where we went ahead and did the calculations of the -- I'll remind everybody that when we report the oil cuts that those are separated volumes. All you have is the raw gas and the condensate being reported as that cut. So when you go through the conversion through NGLs, the way to do the math is roughly the following: you'll start with your separator volume, shrink those -- excuse me, start with the separator volumes. The yield on those is around 130 barrels per million NGLs. So a $10 million a day type stream would yield 1,300 barrels of NGLs. Shrink the gas volume by 30%. So you'd end up with 7 million cubic feet a day of sales gas, the 1,300 barrels of NGLs plus the condensate that would have been reported. And I think when you go through the math, those low percentage separator yields turn into 2\/3 or more total liquids, and I would expect that over the life of the wells that you'd probably track plus or minus 5%, one way or the other, around that midpoint. If you haven't seen that slide, get in touch with Steve and Danny, and they can put it in your hand. I think that it lays all that out relative to the well, but I didn't bring it in here with me this morning.","Operator","Due to time constraints, I would now like to turn the conference back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I'd just like to thank everybody for your interest and investment in Newfield. I hope the takeaway for you this morning is we're very excited about the success that we've had on the operational front in multiple areas with regard to the aggressive assessment programs that we've executed in 2012. We've got great results. We got a wonderful team. They're going to deliver going into '13. It would  be the fourth year in a row that we've had a 20-plus percent liquids growth in North America, and we're going to do that again in 2013 and I think the future is bright for Newfield.

[Operator Instructions]","Now Mr. Lee Boothby, please go ahead, sir.","Lee K. Boothby","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thanks for joining our third quarter conference call. It's hard to believe that 2014 is nearly behind us. This has certainly been a great year for Newfield, and our operational momentum will carry us into 2015.","Newfield posted another solid quarter, and we've continued our solid track record of execution across the company. Our third quarter production was 500,000 barrels above our guidance midpoint, and our full year production is now navigating to the high end of our production guidance. As you can see at @NFX, we again raised our expectations for production from our 4-key focus areas. We're delivering on our 3-year plan, which combines strong liquids growth, cash flow growth and balances our annual investment levels with cash flow in 2016.","The last 8 weeks in the energy markets have been brutal. We were all reminded that oil is still a commodity, and resets and equity valuations can rapidly occur. Cycles are an inevitable part of our business. And after more than 1\/4 century, Newfield has certainly navigated through several commodity cycles. We have a proven track record in making sound business decisions, and we have a deeper portfolio of opportunities today than ever before. We have a strong hedge position, and we have options. And that places us in a very good position today.","Over the last month, we've been evaluating a range of oil price planning scenarios and testing the economic sensitivities around our investment programs. Although we don't plan to officially issue our updated 3-year plan until February, there are some interesting takeaways from our ongoing work that I'll share with you this morning.","Following my remarks, we will briefly cover our financial and operating results for the third quarter. Last night's @NFX publication summarized our recent operating highlights, and our Chief Executive Officer, Gary Packer, will provide additional details and update you on the great progress we are making across our operating areas. As always, we will be happy to take your questions at the end of the call.","Since the beginning of 2013, we've been managing our company under a rolling 3-year plan, and the fundamentals of this plan will remain largely unchanged.","Number one, we will continue to focus on liquids-rich plays. Under any foreseeable near-term scenario, we still see oil as the right commodity for our investments. Our natural gas assets are HBP and will remain a great option for future investment. We will continue to make investments that will grow our economic inventory and build for future success.","Secondly, we are moving toward balance between our cash flow and our annual capital investments. Our rapid oil growth, cash flow growth and improving margins are working to close the gap, and we expect 2016 to be the time period where we will achieve balance under various commodity price scenarios. This operating and financial discipline is important, and at Newfield, it is a priority.","And third, we will flex our investments to deliver attractive liquids growth, optimize our rates of return and preserve financial strength.","Having a few focus areas provides us with options, and we will continuously work to modify our investments to deliver the best outcomes for our stockholders.","Our planning efforts can be summarized by addressing a few key questions. Number one, oil prices. How low? How long? And what's the impact on our 3-year plan?","We have significantly hedged our oil production for 2015 and 2016 and recently added positions in 2017. Newfield has long believed in hedging as a prudent way to mitigate risk to the business plan by ensuring cash flow and returns. We are one of the most hedged companies in the peer group today, and our hedges are well above the current strip prices.","Today, we're about 80% hedged for 2015 and have protected a $90 oil price. Our 2016 volumes are about 60% hedged at a similar price. And the recently added hedges in 2017 total about 20% of production, protecting a high $80s oil price.","Our 3-year plan is based on a $90 oil forecast. We estimate that a $10 drop in oil price would impact our 2015 cash flows by about $65 million. Again, illustrating our hedges go a long way to protect cash flow and preserve the foundation of our 3-year plan.","If oil prices navigate to an $80 world, service costs will undoubtedly reset. By design, we typically hedge forward a significant portion of our production over a 2- to 3-year period. This protects our returns, while service costs reset and margins improve.","How do we best flex our investments to maximize returns and advance the company? Question number two. But we are fortunate to have options. Our belief that having more than one investment region is reinforced in times like today. Our capital investments consistently shift to maximize returns, optimize oil production and grow cash flow.","Our highest-return investment region today is the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. There is a gravitational pull to add activity in our SCOOP, Springer Shale and STACK plays. All of the investment scenarios we are considering for 2015 have an increasing percentage of our capital being allocated to the Anadarko Basin.","In SCOOP, we are in field development, and the efficiencies of pad drilling are evident. As you can see in our @NFX publication, we continue to drive well costs lower in STACK and are encouraged by the great results from our recent STACK lateral spacing test of the Upper and Lower Meramec Shale. We will be increasing our activity levels in STACK, as we drill to hold acreage and continue to prove up more development inventory for our future. Our new Springer Shale play is providing very high returns, and also, we received dedicated rig activity during our 2015-2016 programs.","In the Uinta, we remain encouraged, and results from our recent Central Basin horizontal program continue to bear fruit. Our recent wells have strong production results. They're all SXLs, and we are pushing well costs lower to improve returns. We will continue to push forward in this high-potential oil play.","Without a doubt, our operations in the Bakken continue to get more efficient, allowing us to deliver more for less. Last night, we again posted new best-in-class wells in the Bakken, drilling and completing SXLs for under $7 million. These are highly efficient operations.","The key takeaway today is clear. Newfield has high-quality options. We will consider multiple scenarios and put forward the best plan to maximize oil growth, grow cash flow, improve returns, balance our budget in the planned period and to add inventory for the future. Our workforce today has been focused and mobilized to work STACK geologic plays in liquids-rich resource areas and can easily be shifted to ensure we align our talented people, the best in the business, with the best projects in our portfolio.","Number three, what's the most appropriate level of investment under a reduced oil price environment? As I mentioned earlier, we are running scenarios in oil prices ranging from the mid-$70s to the mid-$90s. Consistent with our past practices, our hedges will not be used to justify drilling in plays with inferior economics. Our 3-year plan outlined expected annual investments of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in the 2015-2016 time horizon. These are still appropriate bookings today, with an $80 oil price likely causing us to shift investment levels towards the lower end of this range.","At the low end of our investment range, I'm confident we can still deliver strong production growth in 2015. Our solid performance over the last 2 years has created momentum, and we will work to keep our standing as a top-tier oil growth company. Again, we plan to issue a more comprehensive update to our 3-year plan in February 2015.","Larry Massaro, our CFO, will now cover our third quarter financial results before turning the call over to Gary. Larry?","Lawrence S. Massaro","Thanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter production was 12.7 million barrels equivalent, surpassing the midpoint of our guidance by 0.5 million barrels. The sale of our Granite Wash had a small impact on the third quarter production, and you will notice in our guidance that it impacts the fourth quarter by approximately 900,000 barrels.","Our year-to-date outperformance can be attributed to contributions for each of our focus areas. With all key plays coming in ahead of guidance, our domestic liquids production growth was up 7% over the prior quarter and 40% over year. In the areas we are focusing all of our capital, total production from 2014 is expected to be up over 50%. Our cash flow in the quarter, excluding changes in working capital, was $321 million, which equates to about $2.32 per diluted share.","Earnings during the quarter, excluding the items listed in our release related to unrealized derivative gains, were $72 million or $0.52 per share. We met both cash flow and earnings expectations, once again.","Our cash costs on a unit of production basis were in line with our earlier guidance projections, and we should continue to see improvement over the 3-year plan. During the quarter, we received cash from nonstrategic asset sales of approximately $600 million, the proceeds of which were used to cull and retire the $600 million of senior subordinated notes that were due in 2018. This reduced our total debt to approximately $2.7 billion and lowers our debt-to-EBITDA to less than 2.","As Lee mentioned, our plan is designed around improving several distinct metrics: liquids growth, cash flow and managing the balance sheet. The decision to monetize nonstrategic assets and strengthen our balance sheet has helped protect us in softening oil price environment.","Even with softer prices, our portfolio is very resilient today, offering both scale and quality. The cornerstone of this program is Anadarko Basin. The STACK and SCOOP plays have years of drilling inventory and are providing us with 30% to 50% rates of return, even at today's lower oil price. Our hedges are very strong and ensure that approximately 70% of our oil production, over the next 2 years, will get $90 price without further deterioration.","The foundation of our 3-year plan is sound, and it will continue to be optimized as we adjust our plan to the market. We intend to deliver on our objectives.","Let me quickly update you on the sales process for China business. In August, we set our production facility at Pearl and are today drilling development wells on the field. We expect to have first oil production in November. In early 2015, we expect the facility to produce at the peak gross rate of 40,000 barrels of oil per day. We continue to work with our bid group to divest our China business and anticipate resolution later this year. We will keep you informed on the progress of this sale.","I'll turn it over to Gary now for operations update. Gary?","Gary D. Packer","Thanks, Larry. Let's start our operations update this morning in the Anadarko Basin, where we continue to add acreage. We now have 275,000 net acres, up 25,000 acres since our last update. Our Anadarko Basin production in the third quarter was 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up more than 15% over second quarter and doubled over our comparable period in 2013. As you know, our year-end exit target was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We reached this milestone in the third quarter and now expect to average nearly 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the fourth quarter.","Our SCOOP midstream partner has done an excellent job, keeping pace with our growth and recently completed significant upgrade to our system, adding 75 million cubic feet a day of new capacity. Today, we have capacity to move 275 million cubic feet a day of gas, and additional expansions are planned early next year.","We are in development in our SCOOP -- South SCOOP play and continue to see very strong well performance. Our recent Briar pad came online during the quarter. This is a 5-well pad, with 4 of our wells being drilled as recent infills. The Briar #1 and #2 average 1,250 barrels of oil equivalent per day over a 60-day period. The Briar 3 and 4 are more recent and averaged 1,375 barrels of oil equivalent per day over a 30-day period. These wells have a 10,000-foot lateral, and 50% of our production is oil.","As we've said before, the [indiscernible] SCOOP is multiple stacked horizons to pursue. The first was a new play recently announced, the Springer. Stay tuned for more in 2015 and '16.","In the third quarter, we disclosed our first operated well in the Springer, the Jarred. The well had a lateral length of less than 5,000 feet and initial production of nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 85% was black oil. The well's 30-day average production was 1,220 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and the oil percentage remained at about 81%. This is an exciting new play and lies within our SCOOP acreage footprint. The Springer has higher porosity and permeability than the Woodford and is slightly geopressured.","To date, we have participated in 9 wells and will be participating in about a dozen more wells over the next few months. Industry is today running 8 rigs in the play, and we are planning an active operated rig program here in 2015. We will have more details to share with you early next year.","Our recent drilling in STACK has helped the production delineate about 2\/3 of our acreage. in today's @NFX, you will see a graphic depicting step-out locations and 30-day rates on some important recent wells. We continue to see great results across our acreage position and are growing more confident every day about the scope and scale of this large resource development and try saying scope and scale and SCOOP and STACK in the same paragraph fast.","We recently tested our first STACK laterals in the STACK play, 2 wells drilled in the Upper and Lower Meramec Shale. The Connie and Freeman wells, spaced 880 feet apart at the surface and were stacked 275 feet apart in the Meramec. These upper and lower spacing tests have excellent well performance. The wells had a 30-day average gross of 935 and 680 barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively. The average oil percentage was 86%.","These STACK laterals have been online for 90 days, and we've seen no interference between these wells. Although it's very early, both wells are performing above the type curve for the play. We are highly encouraged with these tests, which confirm the ability to have multiple development layers within the Meramec Shale.","Our drilling program today is helping the production delineate our acreage of tomorrow and provide confidence in our future development of this play. The recent John well was drilled near the northwest boundary of our acreage. This was a significant step-out, and we now have strong well results more than 30 miles apart. This is a -- there's a graphic at @NFX that depicts the size of this development.","Our 2014 program had several key objectives: holding our acreage through drilling; early testing of well spacing patterns for full field development; and importantly, testing the STACK potential in multiple horizons.","We are progressing all of our objectives and continue to see improvement in our well cost and our rates of return. Recent well costs in STACK have been around $10 million, with a new best-in-class well at $9.8 million. Our drilling and completion teams are doing a great job in the field, and we know the learning curve will continue to advance.","Let me make a few quick comments about the Williston Basin, before jumping into the Uinta. Our Williston team continues to set the standard for development plays in this basin, and they are delivering excellent results. Year-to-date, our 10,000-foot SXLs have averaged $7.5 million, including facilities. This was down another $400,000 from our update last quarter. A recent best-in-class well was drilled and completed for $6.8 million, including facilities. The well had an IP of nearly 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross and averaged nearly 900, 700 and 600 barrels equivalent per day over the first 30-, 60- and 90-day periods, respectively.","Our third quarter net production averaged more than 19,000 barrels a day, of which 83% was liquids. We are on track to grow our Williston production nearly 50% this year. Next year's program, we get the full benefit of these learning curves, and we expect to deliver more for less, as we do in each of our plays as we advance this development.","Our Uinta production has exceeded our beginning-of-the-year forecast by more than 800,000 barrels, and we expect the year-over-year production will be up 15%. Recall that our beginning-of-year projection was for 5% growth. During the second quarter, we released about a half dozen SXL wells, and we are running 3 rigs in the Central Basin horizontal plays today. We expect to have a similar update for you early next year.","Our most recent wells continue to show strong productivity and cost improvements. A new best-in-class SXL was drilled and completed for under $11 million. Lower completed well costs are the key to transforming these plays into large-scale economic developments of our future.","We are also encouraged with the significant rail volumes for the Uinta crudes today. For the first time, between 20,000 and 30,000 barrels a day are leaving the basin, and markets for this valuable product are expanding. We are confident that this will ultimately lead to improved differentials. Newfield's growth forecast is tied to our takeaway capacity, and we expect that our production will rapidly increase through 2016, as new refining expansions are completed on our behalf.","I'll turn it back to Lee for closing comments.","Lee K. Boothby","Thanks, Gary, and thanks to all of you for participating in today's call.","2014 is shaping up to be an excellent year for Newfield. We're delivering on our promises and navigating through our 3-year plan that makes us bigger, stronger, more profitable, with a deeper inventory. We're focused on liquids and cash flow growth, while being ever mindful of our capital structure and liquidity. We enter 2015 with great operating momentum and multiple options to create value for our stockholders.","One of our core values is adaptability. We have demonstrated our ability to weather cycles, and our strong hedge position ensures cash flow to underpinned our drilling programs. The value of our hedge book today is nearly $500 million. Our hedge position is among the strongest in the industry, and it will make a positive difference for our investors on the road ahead.","Thanks for your investment and interest in our company, and we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit more to well costs here. Obviously, you all made a comment that improving those is really the key, one of the keys to improving returns here. It seems as though you're not anywhere near development mode yet in STACK or the Uinta, but costs have come down. Would you guys kind of be able to kind of venture any other kind of quantitative reduction? I mean, you think you could see another 10% or 15% reduction, as we get into a full pad drilling development mode in these plays? Any insight you have would be appreciated.","Lee K. Boothby","Thanks, Leo. I'll start off, and I'll leave it with -- to Gary to give you any color and information. I think the observation that you made is key, that our key plays, STACK and some of the SCOOP acreage are certainly not in development today. We mentioned South SCOOP's in development. Our Bakken and our Eagle Ford are in development. And when you look at what we've been able to drive, our teams have been able to drive, in terms of those development efficiencies, translate into lower cost, lower unit cost and improved returns, we're confident we'll be able to translate those. But as we've said, for much of this year, STACK -- our STACK play's going to be dominated by HBP efforts. And we're really complementary, Gary and the team in terms of being able to work in some of the spacing pilots, et cetera, but we've already driven cost in STACK down below, with our best-in-class well, below $10 million. And if you go back and look at the plan when it was released late last year, you can see that, that was a cost regime that we expected to get to in like year 2 to 3 in the plan. So very, very encouraged with what we're seeing there in the Uinta Basin, results with SXL wells, getting the right equipment and focus. That play is not in development today, either. So all of those gains are still largely out in front of us, and that's part of what makes us really, really excited about the -- our future.","Gary D. Packer","I think you pretty much said it, Lee. I mean, driving the Williston down from $11.5 million to $7.5 million is just self-evident of what we can do in development plays. It's what we'll continue to do. I'd refer you to our February '13 @NFX. We described a range of outcomes, the lower end being development, and I believe we're locked and loaded on delivering the low end of those well costs for each of our development plays.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right, that's really helpful. And obviously, you guys also spoke about wanting to increase capital in the Anadarko Basin next year. I certainly realize that plans are not fully set at this point, but I guess is it fair to say that other plays that are largely HBP, such as Bakken and Eagle Ford, potentially could see reduced capital, as we increase capital into your kind of higher-return plays that are still HBP-ing, like STACK, for example?","Lee K. Boothby","Yes. I think what I said is that we expect to see an increased percentage capital allocation into the Anadarko Basin. We'll wait to set the final capital plan that we'll announce in February. But the bookends in terms of the $1.6 billion, $1.8 billion are intact. I think we continue to state that we'll shift CapEx and people towards the highest returns. We've said that to Anadarko Basin. And at the end of the day, I think you'll be pleased with the plan that rolls out in February.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","A nice improvement on your Anadarko wells quarter-over-quarter. When we met last, you talked about some of the surface constraints and just kind of the buildout of really gas gathering artificial lift and the like in STACK. Can you give us an update on how that fits in, as you are moving across the basin and when you get to an optimal level in your 3-year plan on that?","Lee K. Boothby","Sure, David. I guess, there's 2 pieces to that. As you are well aware, down in SCOOP, we have that gathering in place. And as I addressed in my comments, we're seeing that expansion in key plays with all of our growth expectations. Up in STACK, it's a little bit of a different story. We're about to execute a gathering agreement here in the very near term, which will kind of lock us in for the lion's share of that STACK play. We've spent a lot of time looking at both processing capabilities and residue takeaway. We believe that from a processing standpoint, there's enough projects, either in place or committed to at this point, to meet all of our needs. Residue takeaway is certainly something we have an eye on. There's a number of projects, while not in place today, that we're confident between '16 and '17, we'll be able to meet all our needs to get gas out of the basin.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. And then in your @ -- in the @Newfield, which is great, you didn't include the Eagle Ford volumes. Could you just give us what the liquids and gas was for the Eagle Ford in the quarter?","Gary D. Packer","Eagle Ford was about 12,000 barrels a day, and it's about 85% black oil.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Okay. And then the -- and I know this is tough, given the China sale process is ongoing, but the big move in oil prices elicited a lot of questions from investors for us. So could you bookend what your expectations would be, it can be as wide a range as you like, of what is reasonable, given the pullback in Tampa? So what proceeds you should -- we should start expecting for that sale.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes, I appreciate the question, David. But we're going to stay consistent with what we've said for most of the last 1.5 years. It's a quality asset. The divestiture process is underway. We're doing it for strategic reasons. Certainly, oil prices have softened. We'll know more on what to think about that asset in the future, when we get the bids in. So let us work through the process, and we'll give you information as it unfolds.","Operator","And next, we'll take a question from Michael Rowe with TPH.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering a little bit more about the Springer Shale. I know you all will talk more about this asset in 2015, but looks like you highlighted in your presentation that you think there's a good amount of inventory in your SCOOP South acreage. So could you maybe provide some more context around that and then whether or not you expect any prospectivity in your SCOOP North acreage?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I think we've been consistent since we originally announced our plans in the Anadarko Basin, the original leasing that what we liked about the east flank in the Anadarko Basin is that it provides multiple levels that we thought ultimately would be perspective. And while our initial focus was on the Woodford because of our expertise in that horizon, we clearly recognized several other horizons that ultimately led to the STACK plays. So you can look back through the materials that Steve and Danny had put out, the IR materials. And you can see indications of other horizons on some of those cartoons that we believe are prospective. It's not too hard to draw connections between some of the horizons that we have in the northern part of the play with the southern part of play and vice versa. As far as the Springer Shale, in context, we're fortunate that it covers a significant portion of our acreage footprint down in the SCOOP play. As indicated, we're about 10 wells into that with good strong results. So it's going to be a significant contributor for Newfield, but there's a lot of drilling yet to be done by ourselves and the industry before we fully understand the extent of that play.","Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just staying in the Anadarko Basin, on the STACK vertical spacing test, were those 2 wells staggered in a SAL 2 [ph] formation? Or how exactly was that -- how exactly does that pattern look? And I guess, which of those 2 wells was the more shallow well?","Gary D. Packer","Okay. They were staggered, 800 feet apart, which would be obviously 6 wells per DSU on equivalent. The Meramec in this section was about 400 foot thick. They were 275 feet apart vertically, so they were staggered in that fashion, yes.","Lee K. Boothby","And there's a diagram in the @NFX publication that shows you the -- where those wells, how those wells were laid out. And please remember, we're -- while we're going to continue to work to gain information on spacing, our primary focus is on HBP. So these wells are being drilled across lease lines, so that we can protect the acreage. So it's an excellent graphic, and I'll turn it back to Gary.","Gary D. Packer","Yes. It's on Slide 8 in the @NFX, and it also illustrates in there, Michael, that the Connie well was the shallowest of the 2 wells that we drill there.","Operator","And now we'll go to Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Want to both commend you and thank you guys for clearly articulating an outlook for '15. Obviously, there's going to be some variability in it, but relative to peers, that's definitely a welcome insight. Above and beyond that, when we think about your hedge position and the comment that you indicated that protects cash flows while service prices maybe recalibrate, can you talk a little bit about the flexibility of your rig and your completion commitments or contracts, with respect to how quickly you can change that rig fleet or renegotiate that pricing?","Gary D. Packer","Sure, Dave. First of all, as far as completions, we have no long-term commitments on the completions, so we have ultimate flexibility in that regard. Regarding our rig fleet, we have similar flexibility. I'd suggest about 50% of our rigs we have are under contract, and even those contracts are rather limited. They range anywhere from 6 to 9 months, maybe 18 to 24 months on the outside. So a ton of flexibility. And as I think Lee referenced in there, we're going to go ahead, and we'll exercise that flexibility, as required, to where the best returns are being generated.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. Appreciate that. And then maybe switching back to China for a second, if we just think about your interest in the well on a flowing basis, so call it almost 20,000 flowing per day, probably maintains peak rate for, oh, 1.5 years or so, is it reasonable for us to assume at those levels that daily cash flow from it would be $800,000? And maybe over that time period, it would be $440 million. Just trying to come up with a number at which you would say, \u201cHey, we're not going to take a price below a certain level.\" And my math would equate to like $440 million of cash flow during that 1.5-year period. Am I off base in thinking about it that way? Or is this -- we need -- or our plan is to just be U.S. onshore. And I don't want to say, we're going to get rid of it at any price, but I'm just trying to get a sense for that.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes. Well, again, I appreciate the question. I'm going to turn this one to Larry, but I want to make a -- reiterate something we've said consistently since we announced that our plans were to exit China. Exit from China for Newfield is not a sale at any price. We're in a strong position. Our job is to maximize value for our stakeholders, our shareholders, and we intend to do that. So keep that first and foremost in your analysis, and I'll turn it over to Larry to give you some color on the ones you asked.","Lawrence S. Massaro","Yes, this is Larry. That's not far off. I mean, you're looking at somewhere north of $200 million a year of cash flow. I think you could probably go for about -- yes, the plateau is probably more like 2 years that you're looking at there. And so I think your figures are pretty accurate.","Operator","And next, we'll take a question from Ipsit Mohanty with GMP Securities.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities L.P., Research Division","Just wanted to quickly -- maybe I can get a little bit of color on the Meramec wells that you've been involved. When I counted them, to me, it was -- one of your neighbor there is -- they came out with a well which was probably higher on the 30-day IP rate, but yours has a much better oil cut. And just any broad strokes on the geology? Is that variable? Or specifically across your acreage, are you seeing variability in your threshold regimes, so on and so forth?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, certainly, if you look at it, just from the wells that we released today, you can see that we have a very consistent oil percentage, as we go from the John clear down to the southeast to the Slash C. If I go from west to east out of the Cana field, which was dry gas, as we move further east, certainly, we will see a reduction in GOR and an increase in oil cut. And I think we've published in things that actually demonstrate that in our numbers. So yes, we do see a variation across the area. What we like about it is as we move further to east, obviously, the preferred commodity increases, and we get to preserve our cash flows and our returns.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities L.P., Research Division","When you think about you've alluded to the fact that you would be basically choosing the best-return asset in your portfolio, and Anadarko Basin takes place, but within that basin, when you think about the Springer in '15 and how do you -- how you plan to allocate capital to hold acreage and develop, would you -- in terms of -- so where I'm going with it, the 30 days, but when you look at it from a rate of return, just how do they compare with, say, the SCOOP and the STACK and as well as Uinta Basin?","Lee K. Boothby","All right. So I'll -- I think I've got the gist of your question, so I'm going to answer it as follows. Anadarko Basin, we talked about the gravitational pull is strong. We've said that it's our intent that in all likelihood, irrespective of the oil price environment we see going into '15, it's going to get the lion's share of our capital allocation percentage. We've been accelerating there each of the last 3 years. We started with about $300 million investment level in '12 and to $500 million. We'll be close to $800 million this year. So clearly, all of that's working together. I think when you think about the other things to talk about, STACK, derisking, 2\/3 of the acreage we mentioned on the call has been derisked. And I think that clearly, the results have been strong and consistent across the broad areas. So hence, the derisking and the confidence in that being a large-scale development play. I'd love to run the development today, but that would be an illogical statement to make and a bad decision. We wouldn't pass the IQ test because we're focused on HBP-ing our acreage and continuing to gather spacing results, so along the lines what Gary articulated. And we would expect that, that will play out over the next, plus or minus, 3 or 4 years, as far as getting that acreage held by production. But I don't see it shifting strongly to development inside of the next couple of years, because we've got a lot of wells to drill there. The fact that we're drilling strong wells with solid returns makes those decisions very, very easy, and we'll continue to optimize in that regard. In terms of the rate of return question, you can just count on the following. Newfield is going to work every day. Gary Packer, I mean, folks running our business work every day to optimize our investments. So we're shifting capital where we're generating the best returns. We're going to drive our planned results. And as I've said, Newfield today, we have a lot of high-quality options, and you can expect us to make smart decisions in the next inning.","Operator","Our next question will come from Richard Tullis with Capital One.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","Lee, looking at the well results that were provided in the @NFX document this quarter versus last quarter, it looks like, particularly the SCOOP and the STACK, the 30-day rates, really most of the IP rates took a nice step-up versus the first half of the year results, and I realize there's probably some differences in lateral lengths. But any change in drilling completion methods? What was driving the better results in the third quarter completions primarily?","Lee K. Boothby","Yes. I'll let Gary give you some color on that.","Gary D. Packer","Yes. No. No, we're going to continue to drive and look to optimize. And it's something we stated all along, Richard, is this: don't focus on individual wells, because you guys can't know the things that we're changing. In actuality, the well lateral lengths are pretty darn similar. And what you saw there was, whether you're looking at IP, 24-hour IP or 30-, 60- or 90-, as you alluded to, we're seeing anywhere between 20% and 40% improvement. Now these are obviously all unbounded wells. And over time, we'll get into development, and some of those numbers will down a little bit. But we're extraordinarily excited about the profiles that we're generating now, our completions team and the teams that we've got in the Mid-Continent are really refining the recipe for what's going to work with us. And I continue and I expect that we'll see further improvements.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I think we've gotten a lot of good color on the SCOOP and the STACK, so I'm going to shift gears over to Williston for my 2 questions. My first one is that new nat gas flaring rules now in place have the potential to restrict new well drilling in the Williston Basin. Do you anticipate this presenting an impediment to your drilling plans in 2015?","Lee K. Boothby","The answer is no. We are meeting, I believe, today -- Newfield's current production meets the standards that are going to be necessary 2 and 3 years out. So we're very comfortable with where we sit today. We have our eye on it, can't -- we always got to be working this, but we're quite comfortable with the arrangements we have in place and the infrastructure we've got established to date to meet all those requirements.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. That was a comforting answer. And also, with regard to Williston, there's some disagreement that's emerged as to whether or not the more expensive plug-and-perf completions provide a real economic advantage over sliding sleeve. Do you currently favor one method over the other? And if so, can you add some color on that preference?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. Clearly, we have a preference. We continue to utilize the plug-and-perf versus the cemented options that are out there. As far as color goes, I think at the end of the day, where we are focused on is it's all about returns. It's all about cost, and we have examined many of the different outcomes that have been reported. And while we do see isolated areas where one completion may be preferred versus another, you step back across the board, and we still see the ultimate benefit, the best returns being generated by the processes and the procedures that we're utilizing, and we can't really argue with that, when we're sitting here looking at wells today at $6.8 million. We have AFEs coming in that we'll probably participate in well over 60 wells this year. We still see AFEs coming in at $14 million and very, very high and expensive completions. And that's just -- again, we've looked at it all, we've examined all, we see the whole bandwidth of outcomes out there, and we like the plan that we've got in place.","Operator","And we have time for one last question, and that question will come from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The balance sheet's been strengthened by the Granite Wash divestiture. You highlighted your hedge position. If we look at the outspend of cash flow before asset sales, it's been relatively constant in recent years. How do you think about that? And how should we think about that going forward? Should we expect a tolerance of that constant-type level of outspend? Or do you see a significant narrowing? If prices fall, do you have tolerance so that actually widen?","Lawrence S. Massaro","Yes, Brian, this is Larry. No. I mean, this year, look, we went into it knowing we were going to have a significant outspend. That plan that we were executing on has been in place now for a couple of years. And as part of that plan was we were going to have a narrowing of that deficit next year and then look for getting to cash flow-neutral kind of in 2016. The recent softening in oil price certainly bring us -- it was another challenge for the industry, but we've run a number of scenarios that allows us to still reach our objectives. And so we're going to keep spending discipline. We're going to narrow the deficit. And we're going to seek being cash flow-neutral as soon as possible and look for that in 2016. We'll start to look to the -- if oil prices stay down, we'll look to the low end of the capital range that Lee talked about and narrow down that number. So we don't expect to see that same deficit next year.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes, I'll just jump in, Brian, and add that we stressed it in the call, but at the end of the day, we're going to maintain, at Newfield, operating and capital discipline. I mean, I think at the end of the day, it's important. That's what we've committed to do with our board. That's what we've been working towards. And again, everything that we're doing today is in concert with the 3-year plan.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","As a follow-up, looking at Slide 9 of @NFX, you've got your STACK well performance type curve and the performance versus that type curve. And it looks like the well performance is generally online, in line with type curve until -- with the type curve until about day 200. And I'm wondering if there's something that you're seeing in the decline rates at that point or if it is just the well count is still too small, so it's hard to draw any big conclusions.","Lee K. Boothby","I like your lead off, Brian. I think that the thing about STACK, and I don't think we can stress this enough, that we're sitting here, giving you all of the data that we've generated in the STACK play kind of as it rolls off, and compliments to our technical team. I mean, our folks did the analysis and did the forecast on the type curve before we'd ever drilled one of these wells. So you'll never hear me say anything bad about performance in line with the type curve. And clearly, as we drill wells, to Gary's point, we'll have some wells above and below the type curve. But the recent results, while they're going to be very, very early in this curve, are strong. I think the play is getting stronger. And don't forget, the cost that we've taken out of the equation is the biggest positive, I think, when we think about the overall play. And that's really what's driving the improvement in the returns. We're excited about the play, and it's just normal statistics in terms of that play, out through 500 or 600 days, if I'm remembering that curve. So we're really feeling good about the play.","Okay. And thank you very much again for dialing in for today's call. We look forward to updating you on our further progress early in the new year. Have a good day.","Operator","And once again, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation."],"15618":["Newfield Exploration Co.

Please refer to the legends in our earnings release and @NFX for additional details.","Thanks again for dialing today. I'll now turn the call over to Lee Boothby.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter conference call and operational update. We appreciate your interest in Newfield.","In addition to our earnings release and operational updates yesterday afternoon, this morning we announced the signing of two separate agreements to sell our onshore Texas assets for a combined price of nearly $390 million. The transactions include our unconventional assets in the Eagle Ford Shale and our conventional natural gas assets in south and west Texas. Current net daily production from the combined assets is approximately 12,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which about 35% is oil.","Upon closing, the proceeds from these sales will replenish our cash balance and will be available to fund an acceleration of our activities in the Anadarko Basin at the right time. Newfield continues to high-grade its asset base.","Well, it's certainly been a very busy summer. Here at home, we worked due diligence on a recent STACK acquisition which we've now successfully closed and several weeks ago we issued an interim update release to raise our production guidance and highlight the continued advancements we are making as we HBP our premier STACK position.","In addition to the energy conference schedule over the last two months, which was quite heavy, we were able to catch up with many of you on the road and various discussions along the way. If we didn't get a chance to see you recently, simply know that our near-term objectives are very well defined.","Number one, HBP our STACK play; number two, maintain a strong balance sheet; number three, sell non-strategic assets; and four, ready the organization for the timely acceleration of our top tier developments in SCOOP and STACK when the commodity prices provide the right signals. Certainly, proceeds from today's announced asset sale give us this flexibility.","We continue to deliver outstanding results and our performance is differentiating the Newfield story. Since we recently issued an interim update in last night's earnings release and @NFX is full of details, we will focus our call this morning on what's new and leave ample time at the end to address any specific questions that you have.","So, let's get started with a quick summary of our second quarter financial and operating results. Our domestic production in the second quarter was 13.7 million barrels of oil equivalent and total company production was 15.3 million barrels of oil equivalent of which 45% was oil and 63% was liquids. This was slightly ahead of the projection we gave you in our June update \u2013 interim update release.","For the second quarter, we had a loss of $3.36 per share which included the impact of the ceiling test write down, derivative losses and G&A expenses associated with our restructuring of the organization. Excluding these items, net income for the second quarter was $64 million or $0.32 per share on revenues of $381 million.","Net cash provided by operating activities was $306 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $228 million. Our earnings per share and cash flow compared very favorably to Street estimates for the second quarter. Our cash operating expenses for the second quarter stated on a unit of production basis were below guidance.","Year-over-year, our lease operating expenses are down about 25%. This is a nice combination of higher volumes and the great strides we have taken to improve our cost structures throughout the organization. Our domestic LOE for the second quarter was $3.37 per BOE, down another 4% from the first quarter of the year. As always, we updated our guidance numbers in @NFX for the third quarter and full year.","For the second quarter, we had $12 million or $0.06 per share in one-time G&A expense associated with restructuring on the continued refinements we are making in our organization. We're estimating additional one-time cost of $18 million for the remainder of the year with about half expected in the third quarter.","Important to note, are some very healthy trends underway in our consolidated cost structure. I think it's definitely worth spending a moment to highlight a few of them for you. First, our lower LOE is being driven primarily by SCOOP and STACK. Our recurring lease operating expense in the Anadarko Basin is currently less than $2 per BOE, the lowest of all of our operating regions. Since this is our fastest growing region, we are seeing improving LOE cost on a consolidated basis.","With the lion's share of our capital being allocated to Anadarko Basin, production in our remaining operating regions is on decline. As higher cost areas naturally decline and our growth accelerates in the Anadarko Basin, we expect to see continued positive trends in our margins.","Upon closing the sale of the Eagle Ford and south Texas assets, we should see further improvement in our consolidated cash operating cost on a unit of production basis. Our differentials to both NYMEX WTI and Henry Hub are improving as well. This is a direct result of the shift underway in our production mix by basin. Our lowest realized oil price is the Uinta Basin, our highest is STACK and we expect the continued favorable trends in our revenue per BOE going forward.","Lastly, this list of positive trends has reduced G&A expense, something that has been underway since the oil price slide in the second half of 2014. We moved early and aggressively to reposition Newfield for the prospect that oil could remain lower for longer. These tough decisions have paid off, we consolidated our Denver, Tulsa and Houston offices and re-aligned a more efficient workforce into The Woodlands. We anticipate that these steps will result in more than $60 million in annualized savings in 2017 forward or about 30% less G&A expense than in 2014.","As I mentioned earlier, STACK is driving our improved oil price realizations. Our new STACK oil pipeline to Cushing is operational and we are seeing great market demand for this high quality barrel. Our most recent batch sales have sold for NYMEX WTI plus about $0.50 per barrel. So even after transportation expense, we are netting NYMEX less $2.50 per barrel. Substantially, all of our oil production in STACK should be fully on pipe during the third quarter.","On the balance sheet, you'll see we ended the quarter with $165 million in cash on hand post posting of our recent STACK acquisition. The proceeds from the sales of our Eagle Ford and conventional south Texas gas properties will replenish our cash balance and more than bridge any deficit between our cash flow and planned investments in 2016 and 2017.","Let's talk in more detail now about the Anadarko Basin. STACK has certainly garnered a great number of headlines recently and is one of a few select areas in the country that has seen an increasing rig count in the face of low commodity prices. Industry activity has led to the drilling of more than 500 STACK wells to-date with consistent results across a multi-county area. This extensive well control along with our more than 100-plus operated STACK wells today provide us with heightened confidence in the size of this prolific resource, the depth and quality of our undrilled prospect inventory and its ability to drive corporate growth and production and reserves well into the future.","Recent transactions in STACK have been extremely competitive and valuations for undeveloped acreage have been very strong. Our legacy acreage position in Kingfisher and Canadian counties is now sandwiched between recent billion dollar plus transactions and undeveloped acreage values of $15,000 to more than $20,000 per acre.","In this business, there is significant value created by identifying an unseen opportunity and founding a large scale resource play. Even post-closing of our recent STACK acquisition, our all-in acreage cost in STACK total less than $3,000 per acre. Our low entry cost should boost our full cycle rates of return as we drill thousands of development wells over the next few decades.","We have a top tier acreage position in STACK and it's detailed on page nine in @NFX. And there are several key things to note about this acreage. First, our acreage is largely contiguous and lends itself to a very efficient future development. In HBP mode, we have largely drilled lease line pairs, purposely leaving nearly two miles of undeveloped ground between our initial wells. This will be ideal for proper infill spacing in the future. The contiguous nature of our acreage will allow for more than two-thirds of future wells to be super extended laterals or SXLs. We have proven time and again that SXLs are the most efficient way to develop resource plays.","Second, we have exposure to all hydrocarbon phases across our acreage. As you transition from dry gas in the Cana Field and move north and east, you enter the oil window, which is what we originally targeted when our leasing began here five years ago. Today, we have solid representation to the west where we are confident that EURs and gas content both move significantly higher.","For us, it's about rate of return. Well costs are lower in the oil window. As gas content increases to the west, EURs also rise. It all has a great ROR, and we are very fortunate to be represented across the entirety of the STACK play today. Oklahoma, more specifically the Anadarko Basin, provides commodity diversity and optionality. Once HBP'd, we will have the flexibility to target the right commodity at the right time.","And third, we can now see the end of HBP and are planning for full field development. We expect that our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian counties will be about 95% held by production by year-end 2016. For much of the last 12 months, we've been primarily drilling to hold acreage in the northern and eastern portions of our acreage. Although we have continued to see very consistent results, I can assure you we are looking forward to the high-grading of drilling locations during the future development phase.","Newfield and others are pressing forward with several important pilots in STACK. We are all working to understand the optimal spacing for our future development wells. Fortunately, we share working interest in many of the pilots conducted to-date. We're accumulating a great deal of information from both our operated pilots and outside operated pilots where we own interest. By early next year, we should know a great deal more in terms of thinking about the development phase.","In @NFX, we show recent 24-hour production results from our new Raptor-X pilot, which just commenced production. As you'll see on page 10, this pilot includes four wells and was drilled to test a 12-well spacing configuration, two layers in the Meramec, upper and lower. With wells drilled approximately 880 feet apart, the Raptor-X is showing strong early results. 24-hour production rates range between 1,400 and 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","We are very encouraged with these early results. But as one of our completion engineers stated, bad things show fast, but good things take time. We will continue to watch these results over the next several months to draw meaningful conclusions to aid in our future development decisions.","Our Chlouber Pilot is currently drilling, with five infill wells spaced 1,050 feet apart to test a 10-well configuration in the Meramec, upper and lower, two horizons. Following the Chlouber, we will commence the Dorothy Pilot in the fourth quarter. The Dorothy will include four wells to test 5,000-foot laterals. Our planned spacing between wells will be 1,050 feet, simulating five wells in a single Meramec horizon. We expect to have information to share with you early next year.","To-date, we released information on about 100 STACK wells. This is a very large sample. In fact, the largest in the industry. Our longest-producing wells have now been online for four years or more. Newfield as founder of the play has more operated well data than any other player in the region. When looking at the long-term production from our wells to-date, we see outperformance to our previous 950,000 BOE average type curve. Today, we raised EUR on our average type curve by 15% to 1.1 million barrels gross equivalent for our unbounded wells on our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian counties.","Let me be clear. This new average type curve is reflective of only our legacy acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian counties, which constitutes nearly 200,000 net acres where we have significant well control and long-term production data.","Clearly, as we move to the west in Blaine and Dewey, we expect that these areas will likely have a different hydrocarbon composition and likely a different type curve. As we gather additional information from our operated wells planned here in 2017, we will share results and update you on our expectations. For now, there's lots of information from our peers who are having great success in Blaine, and we look forward to wells in this area very soon.","Regardless of where we drill in STACK, we know that targeting and geology will continue to be extremely important. In addition, completion design and size will contribute to EUR. But the simple issue for us will be, how do we maximize our rate of return across the play for decades to come? We will continue to work the issues and navigate to the optimal completion. It's early. We don't have all the answers, but we are very encouraged by what we've seen.","We continue to make great strides operationally to improve efficiencies in both drilling and completion. We are firm believers today that larger proppant and fluid volumes are both leading to higher EURs and improved production performance. Today's type curve increase is not merely a reflection of larger completions. We have only recently begun testing the larger sand and fluid concentrations, and we will continue to gather more information on the road ahead. As we learn more about the subsurface across a very large area, we will adjust our completion jobs to create the best recovery, highest returns, and maximum net present value.","Today, we're pumping more proppant than we employed in 2014, early 2015 and testing a combination of cross-link and hybrid fracture stimulations. Our goal is pretty simple, arrive at the best rate of return for development and create the most long-term value for our shareholders.","We know that there are significant efficiencies still to be captured and are highly confident in our ability to deliver additional efficiencies and development. In fact, a recent best-in-class well was drilled and completed for less than $6 million gross.","We have been working behind the scenes over the last several years to prepare the full field development in STACK. Although, many of these initiatives don't benefit us today, they will be hugely instrumental in the future.","Here are some of the things that we've been doing in STACK. We have carefully placed our HBP wells, our lease line pairs of HBP wells have left the acreage in the best position for future drilling and development optimization of well placements. We have nearly two miles of virgin surface and subsurface acreage between about a third of our HBP wells drilled today.","We made significant investments in an extensive water infrastructure network to allow us to officially source, move, store and recycle water during our upcoming development operations. We worked to develop an expandable natural gas gathering and processing system with our partner, MarkWest. Newfield and others are today considering a new open season on several proposed pipeline projects in STACK that will add 750 million cubic feet a day of takeaway in 2019 and beyond. We're confident that the infrastructure will be there to timely manage our growth outlook from the basin.","Lastly, we are actively permitting for full-field development and preparing for higher levels of activity in the future. We expect that about two-thirds of our wells next year in STACK will be development wells drilled from common pads. We look forward to continuing to drive down cost, exploit operational efficiencies and improve our margins.","As mentioned earlier, we closed on our recent acquisition of acreage in STACK. This was a great fit for us with about half of the acreage overlapping our legacy STACK acreage in Kingfisher and Canadian Counties, and the remainder gives us a solid representation to the west.","In addition to the Raptor-X Pilot, we had four additional wells that recently commenced production. These wells are outlined on page nine in @NFX. The rates on these wells were impressive and range from about 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent a day to more than 2,000 barrels oil equivalent per day. Each of these wells has strong liquids rates between 80% and 90% of the total production. We have additional wells planned in these areas for later this year.","With strong results in STACK, we plan to increase activity in the second half of the year and we will look for additional opportunities as we enter 2017. We've today announced a revised production outlook and capital budget for 2016. Our plan to keep a rig active in our new STACK acreage and our quickening pace in days to depth is affording us the ability to drill additional wells this year with the same rig count. Our beginning-of-year plan called for the drilling of about 50 wells in STACK. Today, we estimate that we will drill more than 60 wells in 2016 including all pilots.","Our new guidance for 2016 domestic production is 53 million to 54.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Recall that we have now raised guidance three times due to superior operational results year-to-date, and we are now including volumes associated with our recent STACK acquisition and additional planned activity in the second half of 2016.","In China, our Pearl Field continues to produce near peak rates and the expected natural decline has been slower to materialize that forecast. We also increased our expectations for China due to this continued outperformance. In fact, our guidance for 2016 is now about 700,000 barrels ahead of our beginning of year projection.","Our second half estimate for this year reflects our expectations for natural decline as well as the timing of liftings. Peal continues to produce near peak rates over 25,000 barrels of oil per day. China liftings in 2016 expected to total about 5 million barrels of oil equivalent.","When combined, the total company production for 2016 is now expected to be 58 million to 59.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our production guidance today includes our Eagle Ford and south Texas properties through yearend. Upon closing of these sales in late September, we plan to again update our production guidance for the year.","Our capital budget for the year is now $700 million to $750 million, there's a helpful table in today's @NFX publication that reconciles or budget back to the original $625 million to $675 million beginning of year plan. Our increased capital budget is supported by an improved outlook for 2016 cash flow from our legacy production as well as anticipated 2016 investments in our recently acquired STACK assets. In addition, we now have better clarity around the asset sales proceeds and timing. At current commodity prices, we expect that our capital spending will exceed cash flow by less than $100 million. Again, proceeds from the planned non-strategic asset sales should be an effective tool in managing our debt levels and maintaining a superior capital structure.","So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We appreciate your interest in our company and your investment in Newfield Exploration. I'm confident that our new near-term business plan is sound, and that we are executing well along the path that will make us better, more efficient and more profitable in the future.","Operator, we're now ready to take the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Morning. Lee, you talked about potentially two-thirds of your wells being development wells next year. How do you reconcile that with the new higher average EUR that you put out? Because presumably in development mode, you would, given HBP status, you'd be able to move your rigs to some of your best acreage. Is that a fair comment?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, we're just trying to give you some color that we've \u2013 through the execution of the operating teams and just been outstanding, again, year-to-date both in terms of time, efficiency and cost. We're in a position now that we can see 95% of our legacy core position in Kingfisher and Canadian will be HBP at year-end. So, it's rational to set up a program that is going to become increasingly development-dominated. So, relative to that program, we're saying that two-thirds, estimate \u2013 or somewhere around two-thirds of the wells we expect to drill in that acreage position in 2017 will be development wells. So, to that end, that's the point that was being made there.","Certainly, there are incremental efficiencies that will be gained in development that we've talked about, the ability to shave somewhere around $750,000 to $1 million off of a well and drill from common pads where you got infrastructure and facilities in place. We believe that's still achievable and certainly will be something we'll realize. That will translate to higher returns on a well basis.","And there's outstanding information that we outlined in the call that none of us have at this point, and that'll be the information that we pull, it will take some time over the next course of the next year or so. We and our other friends in the play will be studying the pilot data to optimize both lateral distance between horizontals laterally and vertically, the vertical offset throughout the STACK productive intervals. So, those will be pieces of the puzzle that we won't completely know but we'll have \u2013 we have plenty of data to know we can enter the early phase of development with confidence and with high expectations in terms of the results.","I think the last part of your question having to do with expectations per se, I would say because of those cost savings, the efficiencies, the shift to two-thirds of the spending on development wells and the ability then because it's HBP to sort highest return to lowest return areas, we'll be targeting the highest return areas of the play. And that's the part that we referenced in the call that'll be very, very exciting.","So, team's excited. We're going to continue to execute through this year, but the team's worked hard the last five or six years to get ready for development, and I hope they're listening in right now because I know they're going to enjoy it and have fun. We're going to have fun reporting on the results.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. And then my second question just relates to the completion design. You've started to use increased levels of proppant. What are your plans going forward? Are you still seeing improvements, and do you continue to think increased proppant concentrations can further help?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the team, and I'll let Gary give you some color here in a second, but I think the team has done a good job in a workmanlike fashion, focused on development to get us information, kind of using the old scientific method of don't change 15 variables at once so you confuse yourself. We've been marching through this development step-by-step with a very logical approach. First step, you go back to that was a big step change was the reduction in spacing between perf clusters. And that was something we saw outstanding results a couple of years ago, and it led to the first increase in the type curve.","Since that time, the team has been working on various combinations of fluid volumes and proppant and mix in terms of the fluid systems. And again, they've taken a very sequential, methodical approach so that we can understand the data that's coming back to us. Again, focused on development not the short term. So, we're at the point today where we're testing higher fluid volumes and higher proppant volumes and I indicated in the call commentary earlier that we're seeing some encouraging signs. But a lot of the higher volume and higher proppant is fairly recent data and not really a part of most of the work that's been done in terms of the 100 well data set that's been released.","And then ultimately, we know from past experience in other plays that not every area in this play will probably have the same frac recipe. And so you'll end up with some areas that you think that option A is the best approach, other areas will be recipe B and some other area might be recipe C. But in general, I'm confident that we have the data and are acquiring the data we need to optimize. And I'll flip it to Gary to see if he's got any other color he wants to add.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I think you said it well, Lee. We are utilizing lease line pair tests where we're able to compare some of these results that Lee alluded to with increased proppant or increased fluids so we can make better direct comparisons between those results and we'll have more to report on that over the next 90 days or six months.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Next, we'll move to Jason Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. Lee, you've done a great job of tacking on acreage over the last few years. So just, it seems like most of the major packages are now spoken for. I'm just wondering, are there any incremental opportunities at this point in the Anadarko that you're interested in, or are you happy with where things stand now?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Jason, first of all, thanks for compliments to the team. It's certainly been an outstanding first half and a good quarter. Thank you for those comments. And we were joking before the call started, amongst ourselves, that one of the things we're proudest of over the last \u2013 there for the last several years is, our team's put exploration back into Newfield Exploration's name in a big way. And that's a big driver in terms of the results in the portfolio and the quality assets we have. And I'd be remiss not to give them all a pat on the back.","And of course, the operational guys coming along behind that, driving down costs farther, faster than we might have otherwise imagined. It's just icing on the cake. So, the team is performing at a high level. And I'm being polite. But I'll just say that if we have anything going on in exploration and\/or if we had our eye on any other acreage, the last thing I'd do is announce it on this call, because we have a lot of friends and a lot of competition.","But the truth is, the big obvious packages have largely transacted, you've got three large transactions within the core STACK position there that we talk about, just in the last seven or eight months. We were fortunate to pick off the one that we wanted. And the other two went for attractive prices, saying that Newfield's acreage is in a really, really good spot.","So, as far as I'm concerned, we've got really strong companies in the play, credible operators. Everybody has got a great acreage position, it's a big area. And we're moving to the point where I think people can share and help each other optimize. It's going to be a pretty exciting time for the play going forward.","We'll all continue to compete with each other because that's just what we do. And hopefully, we can find some areas to scrap for some additional acreage. And anybody has any out there that you want to sell, please call Larry Massaro right after we get off this call.","Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for that. And I guess, just on the other side of the equation, with the Eagle Ford and south Texas now announced, and the focus, clearly, on the Anadarko going forward, where does everything else fit, just in terms of capital allocation? I guess I'm just \u2013 maybe just looking for also an update on statuses on those ongoing JVs and projects you guys are working on in places like the Uinta and the Arkoma?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Wow, you guys are doing a good job this morning. Steve is going to rewrite his instructions. Two questions, you guys are probably driving four or five (30:42). I'll see if I can cover the key points.","First off, I'll just say that I think we've demonstrated over the last several years that our team \u2013 and that means the entirety of the team, management team, asset teams, operating folks, commercial side \u2013 have become accustomed that assets have a life cycle. And we've embedded within our leadership team the grow \u2013 what I call the grow, hold or divest mentality, and it's something we talk about every day. Leaders throughout the organization have to ask themselves, are we trying to grow an asset and are we holding this asset, are we divesting this asset, and that leads to very healthy dialogue.","So, we've been consistent. I've been consistent that it's not a question of if, it's more a question of when. We have no need to sell any other assets today, with the announcement of these transactions, but we all know that, at the right place and time in the future, that there will be additional asset transactions, and I know that our team will perform at a very high level when that day comes.","Oh, JVs. Gary's reminded me that part three of your second question, I think, was JVs, so I'll let Gary give you some color on kind of where we're at on the JVs.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","As you alluded to, we had a JV in the Arkoma Basin. That will be restored in 2017. We look forward to getting back into that area and continuing the trajectory of improved EURs and lower cost there. In the Uinta Basin, we had a 20 well program. We're about a quarter of the way through that. We went into it with a thesis that we can apply learnings elsewhere in the organization and realize those benefits in the Uinta. We went in there very encouraged and we remain so. It's very early days there, but we like what we see so far.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Next, we will move to Josh Silverstein with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess just taking on some of those other assets out there. There is still a lot of transportation and processing costs that are still bogging down cash flow a little bit. Just wanted to see if you're able to renegotiate some of those? It seems like there is still kind of assets that you're sticking with right now, and the opportunity to reduce the roughly $70 million, $75 million of those costs?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I think the outline that Gary gave you, the JVs in the Arkoma and the Uinta were not chosen by accident. Certainly, we've got technical and economic drivers in terms of wanting to continue to advance the ball and the learning curve, but the fact of the matter is, the drilling activity delivers volumes. Volumes go a long way towards offsetting those costs. So, we get high returns. We get to advance the learning curve, and we get to offset volumes. So, I'd say that the team's focused on it. And we'll continue to work it going forward. I really like the logic that the team used to put these in place and, frankly, I think they did a good job getting them negotiated and executed.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And can you just talk a little bit more about the rig moving into some of the western or northern acreage in the Anadarko Basin? Just kind of where you guys are testing it, any of the pilot space \u2013 pilot opportunities that you're thinking about for next year there as well?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the pilots are generally associated with the areas within our legacy Kingfisher, Canadian Country acreage footprint and areas immediately west of there. And I think that we're in a number of pilots operated by others and we've got several that we're operating ourselves. And with regard to anything outside of those confines, I would simply say that I'll reference my Newfield Exploration comment earlier. And we'll just have no comment on anything that might be exploration.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we'll move to Kevin Smith with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kevin C. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good morning and congrats on another solid operational quarter. I believe you touched on this on your prepared remarks, but just trying to make certain my notes are correct. So, do you plan to keep a rig in Blaine County on the recently acquired acreage?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're going to continue to run a rig there in that portion of the acreage that we've had really good results on between now and the end of the year. Yeah.","Kevin C. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got you. Do you have a number of wells you plan on drilling on that acreage by yearend?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Look, we're tied up on pilots and a lot of other activity. It's probably four wells or five wells just given the time horizon that we're looking at. But probably four or five incremental wells would be my guess.","Kevin C. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly, I realize, I apologize three questions. But do you have any HBP worries outside of Kingfisher and Canadian County? And I'll jump back in queue after that.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say we don't have any HBP worries because the team is executing on a pretty workmanlike fashion. Some of you guys, most of you guys probably met John Jasek by now, but he and the team are all over that. And so I don't lose sleep about acreage that needs to be HBP'd. And I think they've got a good plan. They're executing well, and we'll stay on top of that. But we don't have any material issues in that regard. And I'll remind you that the acquisition that we recently closed on, 95% of that acreage is HBP. So, there's not a short-term driver to have to drill. There's a desire and a want to drill. And we'll just call that development, and I'll reference the earlier comments on the percentage of wells drilled in development in 2017.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Next, we'll move to Jeff Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, and I echo the compliments on the strong quarter. My first question is, how do you account for the outperformance of Pearl?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The outperformance in Pearl is pretty easy to account for, and I don't \u2013 I apologize, Jeff, I don't know that I've ever had a chance to talk to you about it. But we have a history of \u2013 we kind of pioneered some of the horizontal oil developments in shallow waters in Southeast Asia. We had operations in Malaysia where we developed several fields. The Pearl field was our first horizontal development offshore in China, but I would \u2013 as far as operating development. But I would tell you that reservoir simulators are great tools, and teams do a great job of putting all the data in, but every single field, every one that we developed in Asia outperformed the initial reservoir simulation.","And there's a number of reasons for it. It's fluid properties, the quality of the reservoir, it's the math not being perfect when you go vertical to horizontal comparisons, a whole host of things. But I would tell you, none of us are surprised it outperformed. But when you have a lot of really talented people and reservoir simulators telling you the answer is X, you can hope and pray that it's X plus. But until you see it demonstrated, you know, it's an unknown.","So, we took a conservative posture on the front-end. I think it's a prudent way that the team described it. And frankly, we've benefited at Pearl by all of the things that you'd want working in your favor. There's more oil in place than probably was imputed. We're getting a higher recovery efficiency than you might otherwise have assumed. The rates have sustained themselves for far longer than any of the reservoir simulations would have predicted.","And today, with a couple years of production data, the team is able to recalibrate the reservoir simulation and we know at some point it'll go in decline but we want to enjoy this plateau production for just as long as we can. Cash is king. Larry tells me get the cash in the bank is the objective in China. And he never lets any of us forget it.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Well, it's a high-class problem to have, and I'm sure there's a few people that were looking at that asset and didn't make a good enough offer that are gnashing their teeth right now.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're probably right. And they're welcome to pick the phone up and call Larry. Larry does transactions both ways. He's happy to buy and sell.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Got to get Larry busy. Could you...","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We got to keep Larry busy. He gets in trouble if we don't have him busy.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Yeah. I know how that works. Could you remind me what the average lateral lengths were on the Raptor-X pilot wells?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","10,000. That would be feet, not meters.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I'm sorry, I couldn't hear it. Did you give an answer?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","10,000 feet. 10,000 foot laterals.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","10,000. Okay. So, they were SXLs. Okay.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","If I can ask one last real quick one. On slide 11, you show a comparison between two SXLs and one XL. I was wondering if could tell me what was the average cost of the two SXLs and the cost of the XL?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't have that information in front of me. I think that they're all part of the progress that we've made. So, my guess is that the SXL wells would be in line with kind of the average we've had year-to-date. And you got the color on that? Gary has dug it up. I'll let Gary answer that question.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, generally speaking across the area, year-to-date our SXLs have been about $6.8 million. We expect that number to go down to $6.2 million by yearend. The XLs that we've drilled year-to-date run a little over $5 million and we continue to see good trajectory on those and we'd like to see them by yearend to get down to around $4.5 million. So that kind of gives you a feel.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Next we'll move to Kashy Harrison with Simmons Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kashy Harrison - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So, with the successful divesture of the Texas assets, you now have about $390 million of dry powder. How are you thinking about deployment of that capital to the STACK in 2017 just given the current forward strip?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you got $390 million coming in in September there and $100 million plus that we had on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter so I'd say the cash balance will be settling somewhere in the $0.5 billion range which is a nice luxury of \u2013 I'll quote the earlier commentary, it's probably a high-class problem in today's world.","And I think that we said in the call that it positions us very well because we're able to rotate our operational and technical talent into focus in the development phase of the SCOOP and STACK assets that we've been talking about at some length this morning. That's positive. And it gives us the ability to accelerate that development activity at the time of our choosing, which we've been consistent over the last couple of years saying that when the market forces indicate that stepping on the accelerator is the right option, this play is going to get \u2013 we're going to accelerate.","And I think the \u2013 we're reminded of the volatility that you've seen in the commodity here over the last two and a half years and we expect that's going to continue for the next \u2013 I don't know, 12 months, 18 months. And hopefully, we'll get some clarity somewhere along the way to accelerate development. But it's a good place to be and we're \u2013 we continue to be more focused on the things that are generating the really exciting returns, and we've got the cash to do what we need to do to take care of the business.","Kashy Harrison - Simmons Piper Jaffray","And just a follow-up from me. As you enter full-field development mode and start thinking about bounded EURs versus unbounded EURs, do you have any initial expectations on the impact for activity maybe perhaps based on your experience in either the SCOOP or the Bakken or some other region?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I'd start out by saying that in development, first objective is that you do want to have some level of interference. So, it'd be illogical to think that you're not going to space this at a point where you've got what we call constructive interference. That's what we're drilling the pilots for. I mean, I'd be doing nothing but speculating. I think that in a lateral sense, if you go off of demonstrated activities in an individual layer, five wells, six wells, seven wells per horizon, you've got a lot of examples where that's worked effectively. So if I were leaning into something, I'd probably say that I would expect that kind of spacing per layer. The big question remains, how many layers and what the vertical offset is going to be as you develop the other areas. We'll be optimizing \u2013 mentioned rate of return as a driver, but ultimately, we're optimizing to maximize net present value.","If you go back historically and you got to remember that a lot of these historical plays that long-term production are gas, we're producing oil here, so there are other variables, but typically, 10%, 15%, 20% type of interference for what it affects \u2013 impacts the EURs would be expected as you optimize. And I think we've been consistent on reminding everybody of that, and I think if you listen carefully to the call script earlier, there are a lot of factors that get involved. Oil price is a factor. Well cost are a factor. You've got a \u2013 there's a continuous optimization program there. But I think the best guidance I can give everybody is that don't run with the unbounded type curves and think that's going to be just exactly what the development wells will be. If it is, then we're going to keep drilling closer until we find the optimum spacing. But at this point, we're excited. We've got strong data, 100 plus wells, demonstrated 1.1 million barrel EUR, and the pilot projects are underway. So, a good place to be and a lot of good information and as I mentioned earlier, quality operators to help us solve that problem.","Operator","Thank you. And we do have time to take two more questioners. Our next question will come from Stephen Berman with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Stephen Fred Berman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks. Lee, the Raptor pilot and the four wells on slide nine that all came with the Chesapeake acquisition, I think I heard you say, can you talk a little bit about how much of that was Newfield involvement on the drilling and completions versus the prior operator?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We inherited, as part of the acquisition, the activity. Give our friends at Chesapeake a pat on the back. I think they got the pilots moving in the right direction. It was one of the items that was very attractive to us about the package, because it would accelerate our knowledge base, and I think they made a smart call and they've started this one out, as I mentioned in the call. It's a two-layer test. They've got the first four wells down. So it'd be six wells per layer, 12 well DSU.","The other two pilots that we did mention earlier back in the second quarter, that are Newfield operated would be the Chlouber, which is presently drilling, and the Dorothy, which is going to be drilled before year-end. The spacing in these are reasonably similar. I think you can do the math. The six well scenario gives you 880-foot lateral spacing and the five well gives you 1,050 feet. So, we're going to have good pretty tests kind of in that range. That's similar to the spacing that we've had in the well pairs along lease lines. So, we'll have a lot of data to kind of calibrate.","And again, I'd take you back to the discussion we had earlier in this call in the Q&A on Pearl, it will give our engineers an opportunity to optimize their simulations and give us the answer. So, we need time. I think that \u2013 I hate \u2013 I know you guys aren't typically very patient, but the truth is, in all honestly, you need to give us and our friends in the play time to get the data, analyze it and tell you what the right answer is. Impatience is not going to accelerate that process.","Stephen Fred Berman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","And the four wells on slide nine, the Wittrock, Stangl, Stark and Indominus Rex, those were pretty much Chesapeake as well?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Those were all part of the acquisition. That would be correct.","Stephen Fred Berman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. And then one follow-up. The incremental or additional CapEx you announced with the release, how is that broken out between Q3 and Q4? Can I assume it's more back-end loaded?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, it's front-end loaded.","Operator","Great. And we'll take our final question from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Lee, I think it was probably a pretty important comment you made earlier that, you said that the current type curve uptick really is predicated on that 100 well set and isn't \u2013 doesn't really bake in too much on the enhanced completion front. Just kind of wanted to get your gut take on how much data you are going to need, kind of timing, and how impactful these enhanced completions could be, because it does look like every well you've kind of just annotated on the map here, of recent wells, is 25% or higher above kind of peak rates versus what you have in the type curve here. Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I think that \u2013 go back to 100 well base though. I think what's really important about that is, we've drilled east, west, north, south across that 200,000 acre legacy position over there in Kingfisher and Canadian counties. So, we have a good data set. So, it's well founded. On top of that, you've got a lot of activity by others now, and the Devon would be one that comes out, the recent transaction that's now Marathon over to the east, you got a lot of data that you can put down on that footprint, say, wow, there is lots of really, really good wells being drilled. If you time vintage them over the last four or five years, you'll see a general continuing improvement as the organization, ours and the industry, the other players in the play, have learned.","So, we're at a good place. You are correct. I'll say it again, that the 1.1 million barrels is based upon Newfield's operated data, 10,000 foot laterals in that core footprint. So, we haven't used any of the acreage to the west, any of the acreage in any of the other areas. So, that's the basis for that comparison. And frankly, it's just the progression of the things that we've been doing in terms of optimizing completions. Crystal clear, but a very important point. I think you were good to follow-up on it.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Just quickly for me too. I know that's an average type curve across the Kingfisher, Canadian area. Could you give us a sense on how much variation you have in there between really where do you think is true hotspots and maybe something that's more on the fringe? Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would tell you that we've been consistent on this since day one. It's been \u2013 the play has been incredibly consistent across that footprint. Where we have the data, we've had incredibly consistent performance, both Newfield operated wells and outside operated wells. So, we understand it. It's easy to understand. The 1.1 million barrels is a good representation of that area. So, that's reiteration.","Beyond that, since it's been consistent, we also said peak 10P\/P90 ratios have been very tight in this play. One of the tightest of all the plays that we've studied. That remains true. And you all know that since it's an average, there'll be some wells above it, some below it. But that's a good representation of what the average well looks like, based on that data set.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our time for Q&A. I'll turn the call back over for any closing comments or remarks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, again, hopefully you can tell our team is excited. I'm happy to \u2013 really pleased to be able to put these results out. It's good to get the Texas divestiture on the board and behind us. We're excited about back half of the year. I appreciate your interest and investment in Newfield and we look forward to updating you on the road ahead. Thank you very much and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at any time and have a great day."],"15615":["Newfield Exploration Co.

For opening remarks and other housekeeping items, I'll turn the call over to Steve Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Stephen C. Campbell - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning and thanks for joining us today. By now, we hope you've had a good chance to review our release and the @NFX that we issued last night. The slides in @NFX will be helpful references during our call today.","Following prepared remarks from our Chairman, Lee Boothby, we will have our executive assembled and ready to take your questions. As always, please limit your time during today's call to one question and one follow-up. This simply allows us to get to more of your questions.","Let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website along with our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations. Today's discussion contains forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and most reasonable expectations. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. A full disclaimer is provided in our earnings release and in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q.","Thanks again for dialing in today, and I'll turn it over to our Chairman, Lee Boothby.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for dialing in to our third quarter conference call. Your investment in our company is very much appreciated and we look forward to providing you with a solid operational update today as well as taking your questions at the end of our prepared remarks. It's hard to believe that 2015 is drawing to close. Despite the challenges presented by low commodity prices, Newfield has worked to differentiate itself from the pack through solid execution, quality assets and the sound business plan. We're executing very well across the organization today.","Although the lion's share of capital is being invested in Anadarko Basin, we continue to deliver best-in-class wells in the Williston Basin and we are actively working to improve our base production levels and reduce our cost structure across the enterprise. We truly have an all-hands-on-deck mentality today and we're aligned to deliver on our key goals.","Just as important as today's production beat is the progress we've made to lower our cost and expenses. Notice that our third quarter cash operating expenses were significantly lower than guidance. We are building on these efficiencies as we prepare to enter 2016 and leaving no stone unturned when it comes to the pursuit of margin expansion.","We're successfully retooling our company to be profitable in a lower commodity price world. Newfield is differentiated in several distinct ways today. First, we're focused. Over the last five years, we've sold non-strategic assets, reinvested proceeds into our plays of the future. We've realigned our organizational structure to reduce G&A expenses while deploying talent to our highest return plays, SCOOP and STACK.","Second, we've demonstrated the ability to effectively manage the inherent risk in the E&P business. We took proactive steps last year to ensure our cash flow by hedging a significant portion of our production into 2017. In addition, we strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position through key capital market transactions earlier this year. Our strong financial footing has been paramount to building shareholder value in today's oil price environment.","We intend to emerge as a better, stronger, and more profitable company when commodity prices recover. And lastly, we're very fortunate to have an asset that can deliver both strong returns and growth in a low oil price environment. The Anadarko Basin offers strong returns today and we know that development economics will be significantly better tomorrow.","We are highly encouraged with the results we're seeing today in the Anadarko Basin. There is a comprehensive update in today's @NFX publication. You'll see that our teams continue to advance learnings to deliver superior well results, optimize completions, and improve returns","It's important to note that for the first time our net daily production from the Anadarko Basin has now eclipsed the combined production from the remainder of our domestic assets. This is quite a milestone considering that the SCOOP and STACK plays literally started from scratch just four years ago.","Due to the strong growth from the Anadarko Basin and our efforts to maximize base production across the company, we today raised our full year expectations for 2015 production and we will enter 2016 with strong operational momentum.","In STACK, we have now drilled nearly 70 wells and have seen strong well results across our acreage. With each well, we gain increased confidence in the play. Although the primary focus of our STACK drilling program today is to HBP our acreage, we are learning about well spacing both on the surface and sub-surface and we will be ready to enter full field development in 2017. Our growing Anadarko Basin assets provide us with a deep inventory of high return drilling locations that will lead Newfield's growth and profitability for many years to come.","Other critical 2015 initiatives relate to our efforts to improve margins across the company. We have worked to significantly improve our cost structure. These gains have many contributors, including high-graded capital investments, reduced service costs, innovative efforts to lower LOE, redeployment of our people, and the right-sizing of our workforce. Our estimated 2015 lease operating expenses on a unit of production basis are expected to be nearly 25% below 2014 levels. We are expecting that LOE will be down an additional 5% to 10% from current levels in 2016.","Our 2015 estimated net G&A expense will be down about $25 million over 2014 levels, adjusted for one-time reorganization costs. Our 2016 G&A expense is expected to be down $40 million from this year's level. In addition, our future realized prices are expected to improve in STACK through better oil price differentials. We're seeing great demand for our STACK barrels today due to both API gravity, crude quality and geographic location.","Before covering our financial results for the third quarter, let me make a few preliminary comments about 2016 and how we're seeing our business plan taking shape. We're running multiple scenarios in preparation for 2016. Although fluid, I can share with you some of the bookends around our analysis. First, we're working toward a capital budget that substantially balances with our expectations for cash flow inclusive of hedge revenues.","As we've said repeatedly, our primary focus today is on maintaining liquidity and a strong balance sheet. We expect to enter 2016 with ample capacity under our $1.8 billion credit facility. This is an investment grade facility with no redetermination concerns. Its term was extended earlier this year out to 2020. We estimate that our maintenance capital funding level is around $900 million. Nearly $800 million would be associated with drilling and completions and the remainder would be allocated to infrastructure, leasehold and land renewals. At today's strip prices, our 2016 hedges should add about $260 million in revenues.","This year, our Anadarko Basin volumes will be up nearly 50% over 2014 levels. We enter 2016 with momentum and expect that the continuing growth of SCOOP and STACK in 2016 will more than offset the natural declines in our other domestic areas that are not receiving capital investments today. Our production throughout 2016 is expected to be relatively flat throughout the course of the year, should we undertake maintenance capital investment levels. This will put us in a great position to accelerate and again focus on strong growth once the commodity prices provide the appropriate catalyst.","We plan to issue our final 2016 capital budget and guidance along with our fourth quarter and year-end earnings in February of 2016. We're confident in our plan's ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, generate lower operating cost, improve our returns, and advance STACK toward full field development in 2017.","Let me quickly cover our financial results for the third quarter. Increasing volumes coupled with improved costs in the unit of production basis define the quarter's highlights. Margin improvements were evident in our cash operating cost. On a unit of production basis, LOE was 15% below our guidance for the quarter and nearly 25% below the comparable period in 2014. G&A expense, excluding one-time costs associated with our reduction in force and restructuring cost was about $3 million less than guidance.","Our capital investment budget for the year remains approximately $1.4 billion and includes capital invested year-to-date to acquire additional land and leasehold in the Anadarko Basin. Through the first nine months of this year, we sold $77 million of non-strategic assets as we continue to refine our portfolio in high-grade investments. Year-to-date, we've invested about $1.1 billion excluding capitalized interest and internal costs. There is a helpful table on page four in @NFX that outlines our capital investments by quarter, which includes our change in accruals.","In terms of production, we extended a healthy streak of beating our projections through solid execution and improving well performance. Our domestic production in the third quarter exceeded our guidance midpoint by 400,000 barrels, led by the Anadarko Basin. For the third quarter, our production in the Anadarko Basin came in about 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our forecast, split equally among our three primary commodity products.","Total production in the third quarter was 14.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which 63% was liquids. Our consolidated oil production during the quarter was 42% higher than the same period of 2014, adjusted for asset sales. Domestic production was up 10% year-over-year, adjusted for asset sales. Domestic production grew 3% quarter-over-quarter to 12.9 million barrels of oil equivalent. We lifted about 1.4 million barrels in China during the quarter, surpassing our guidance by about 125,000 barrels. Due to our production outperformance year-to-date, we're again raising our annual forecast. Our full year company guidance is now 55.3 million barrels to 55.8 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our domestic production is now expected to be 50.0 million barrels to 50.5 million barrels of oil equivalent.","Discretionary cash flow from operations was $280 million or $1.72 per share. Discretionary cash flows were a couple of pennies light to consensus primarily due to divesting or payout of previously expensed cash-settled restricted stock in the third quarter as well as severance and other reorganization costs.","Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes several one-time items detailed in our release, was $0.21 per share. The most significant item was a non-cash ceiling test write-down related to the significant drop in oil prices. As a full-cost company, this charge was certainly expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-Q. This is a non-cash charge and has no impact on our credit facility or debt covenants. These impairments are a function of full-cost accounting and significantly lower commodity prices in the 12-month trailing average.","Let's move on to our operations update. I'll spend the rest of today on the Anadarko Basin. We're excited about our recent results which demonstrate material gains in several important areas. First, improving well performance. You can see from today's results that our production from the Anadarko Basin is tracking well above expectations. Today, we raised the expectations for our fourth quarter average daily rate from the Anadarko Basin to about 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, that's 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day ahead of our beginning of year estimate and 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day higher than our estimate last quarter.","Second, we're seeing continued gains in drilling efficiencies, which are leading towards lower well cost. In our STACK play, our estimate of well cost at the beginning of the year was $8.5 million. Today, we're drilling and completing wells for $7.5 million or less. Our days to depth are averaging about 16 days and our best-in-class wells are drilled in 12 days. Third, we're effectively optimizing completions. We're making material advancements in our completions and early results are very promising.","Lastly, we're planning for future development. We have marketing agreements now in place for both oil and gas takeaway in STACK, and we're developing an extensive network to allow for the distribution, recycling, and reuse of our frac flowback water. This will be advantageous as we enter full field development.","Let's talk about each of these gains, starting with the improved well performance. In @NFX, we released results from 22 new SXL wells. We now have 68 wells in our STACK dataset and the results have been very consistent across an area that covers more than 1,500 square miles and spans more than 50 miles from corner to corner. In fact, there is a tighter correlation in our STACK results than in any of the resource plays we've been associated with to date. Our most recent wells have higher 30-day and 60-day rates, and not all of the wells have yet reached 90-day production rates. Average 30-day rates from our 22 new wells exceeded last quarter's wells by 100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a wellhead basis, the oil percentage from our new wells averaged nearly 80% over the first 30 days of production.","By the end of this year, we expect to have drilled about 100 STACK wells. This is a very significant dataset and it is providing us with high confidence in our future forecast. SCOOP is in full development and pad drilling is generating strong returns.","Our recent Williams five-well pad came on at about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross, of which 70% was oil on a two-stream basis. We have two additional SCOOP pads that will begin production shortly and help push our average net production from the Anadarko Basin to about 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter.","We continue to lower well cost in STACK through innovative bit designs, mud and motor optimizations and the targeting of the most affective drilling zones within the Meramec and the Woodford. Today, well costs are about $7.5 million but, more importantly, we can see the path to significantly lower well cost once we move to pad drilling and full field development.","We estimate that more than half of the cost savings seen to date is related to efficiencies and field level optimizations and not simply result of lower service cost. From our participation in outside operator wells, we know we are leading industry in drilling days and costs.","Perhaps our most significant developments to date are coming through recent completion optimizations. Recall that our first 26 STACK wells had identical completions. We felt early that it was critical to have a large, consistent sample set across our acreage footprint. In 2015, we began to optimize completions in both SCOOP and STACK, adjusting different variables to find the optimal well for full field development. Recent variables explore the use of zipper fracs, diverting agents, high concentrations of fluids and proppants and slickwater fracs. We're very encouraged by the early performance results from these optimizations.","Within a larger sample set and time, we will know the magnitude of the impact on our EURs and rates of return. Stay tuned, we'll have more to share with you in the way of data very soon. We recently signed new agreements that will help ensure that we have good markets and the best possible differentials for our growing STACK production.","As of today, our STACK oil is trucked to Cushing, Oklahoma. Under our new agreements, we'll begin piping about one-third of our STACK production in January of 2016. And by the end of the second quarter, 100% of our STACK oil will be piped into Cushing. We've seen a growing appetite for our STACK barrel, which is a 42 degree to 45 degree API barrel. We will soon have the ability to batch our oil to ensure the best price. We expect our differential to NYMEX WTI will decrease from about $4.50 per barrel today to about $2.50 per barrel early next year.","As you can tell, our remarks today, we are very encouraged with the continuing progress that we're making in the Anadarko Basin, and we'll be happy to discuss additional details during our Q&A.","So, in closing, I'd like to say Newfield is an very good place today. But we didn't arrive here by chance. We took the right step 12 months to 18 months ago and hedged forward oil sales to ensure our cash flow. We upsized and extended our credit facility through 2020, ensuring our liquidity position and eliminating redetermination risk. And we sold $2.5 billion in assets at yesterday's commodity prices.","These strategic decisions were timely and help put Newfield in an advantaged position today despite a very challenging macro environment. We're fortunate that we can provide our shareholders with both volumes and value. Growth and shareholder value creation are not mutually exclusive regardless of where we find ourselves in the inevitable commodity price cycles.","Thanks for your investment in our company and we look forward to taking your questions. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we will take our first question from Richard Tullis with Capital One. Please go ahead.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Good quarter, Lee. So, we saw a nice uptick in the STACK well productivity. When you take a look at the latest SCOOP oil wells with a 90-day oil production, looks like there was a bit of drop in the percentage of oil, my calculation is like 42% versus 51% from the earlier results. I might be off a little bit, but what was the main driver for those declines?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it's important when you look at the Anadarko Basin and SCOOP and STACK \u2013 and I'll get to the specific question in a moment \u2013 to remember that we're drilling across various positions that have been phase envelopes. So, you're going to see a natural variation across the play. We've got plenty of data. We know where we are in the phase envelopes, we know what the expectations are. But from quarter-to-quarter or dataset-to-dataset, you'll have pad wells coming into play.","As we move towards the development, you'll have both the noise that comes in from OBO activity as well. But small variations, a few percentage points one way or the other, are nothing to be concerned about. So, what I would tell you on the SCOOP wells down there, we had the five-well pad that was referenced, we're very, very pleased with the results, and they're in line with our expectations in the play. And the same is true with regard to STACK. I can't think the last time we had any surprises with regard to phase composition and production types in this play. We've got plenty of data and it's pretty well defined at this stage.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. And last question from me, what's the current oil price realizations in Uinta?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, the current oil price realizations, we continue to sell that crude at a discount -- seeing currently about a $13 differential to WTI.","Richard M. Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a bunch. Appreciate it.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thank you. Have a good day.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Kashy Harrison with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Kashy Harrison - Simmons & Company International","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I know you've outlined a path to balance CapEx and cash flows in 2016 while keeping domestic production flat. I was hoping you could provide some just early color on what production allocation may look like between the SCOOP oil, SCOOP condensate, SCOOP Springer and STACK?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I had said carefully that we're going to come out with our final guidance which will include an update on the portfolio, well count locations and the 2016 mix in February 2016. We're going to stick to that schedule. The commentary on maintenance capital was to give you a reference point. We've said pretty consistently on the road since earlier this year that in a $50 and below world that you can probably expect Newfield to execute a balanced plan. We're presently in a $50-ish world. When you think about it in those regards, so we're thinking that more likely than not we'll have a balanced program going into 2016, put ourselves in a position to time the recovery, if you will, in the commodity and step on the accelerator at the right time.","But balanced program is the right place to go and it will be Anadarko-centric. We'll have to finish our HBP drilling, which will be a large part of our activity in 2016. And then once we move into the full-field development stage in STACK, notionally 2017 forward, you'll have a more consistent forecast from that point forward.","Kashy Harrison - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Thanks for the color there. And do you have any planned non-core asset divestitures that you may use to fund full field development maybe in 2017? Or just add to liquidity and improve the balance sheet?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've been careful to say that \u2013 and I think we've demonstrated it with $2.5 billion of asset sales that funded our transformation \u2013 every asset has a lifecycle. So over the course of time, and it's not question of if, it's when, and clearly, we do have other assets in the portfolio we could consider for divestment. But specific answer to your question, we have nothing \u2013 no planned sales at this point in time. We do have assets that would be considered for disposition at the right place and time when we choose to accelerate activity in the Anadarko Basin. So answer to that's yes, not today.","Kashy Harrison - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Well. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys, I was hoping you could break down the complexion of the wells, the 22 wells in STACK you brought on in the quarter in terms of how many of those targeted the Meramec versus the Woodford? And I was just curious if there was any update on any of the previous spacing pilots out there on STACK?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Leo, most of the wells, in fact, probably all of the wells in the quarter were actually Meramec. So that really answers that. What was the other question you had?","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just looking for an update on some of the previous spacing pilots that you guys have looked at there?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, everything \u2013 we continue to produce above the type curve on those wells. We've got a total of five wells, or five patterns I guess, that we've got in place and we have no other plans this year and we'll be looking into 2016 and maybe we can sneak a few more in. As Lee alluded to earlier, our focus is all about the HBP there.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Leo, I think the other thing to remember when you look at the overall dataset, as we approach 70-odd wells, through the course of the drilling, we've got about two-thirds of the total test in the Meramec and about a third in the Woodford, if I remember. I think those are numbers that we've put out previously. Obviously, as we move around HBPing, there will be places where we're testing Meramec and places where we're testing Woodford. But it's been roughly pretty consistent around two-thirds, one-third over that time period, the last four years.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. That's helpful. I just wanted to qualify the one comment that you made, Lee. You talked about the theoretical maintenance CapEx of $900 million and flattish production. Is that flat year-over-year in 2016 versus full year 2015 or was that flat with fourth quarter of 2015?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It would be flat year-over-year when we're talking about maintenance capital. But I would say that with the scenarios that we're running at this point in time, we would expect quarter-to-quarter in that regime to be pretty flat all the way through the year.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert DuBoff with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Robert DuBoff - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. It looks like China has outperformed your guidance all year; is it really outperforming expectations or is this just related to the timing of liftings and how should we think about production of that asset going into 2016?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say that China is producing in line with our expectations. It's a function of timing of liftings, and we're running slightly ahead of the schedule that we put out at the beginning of the year. But we're pleased with the performance in China and we'll update you forecast-wise on what that looks like later this year as we get ready for next year.","Robert DuBoff - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And just a follow-up, thinking about a more balanced budget for 2016, what would be the appetite for adding acreage in SCOOP and STACK? And can you comment on the market for those assets currently? And kind of your outlook for M&A in a $50 oil price world?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that \u2013 look, we've got competitive advantages and strong position, and we're going to compete for every acre that makes sense. Certainly, we understand the play and we've got a good strong position and we'll look to add to it opportunistically when those opportunities present themselves.","Robert DuBoff - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ipsit Mohanty with GMP Securities.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Good morning, folks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Just looking at the significant improvement you're showing quarter-over-quarter on STACK wells, to the extent that you can, what's the biggest reason for these wells? is it just drilling completion techniques or is it something in the acreage that you're going and drilling at various portions?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd say that I listed a whole smattering of things that we're testing and I guess the first thing I would tell you is, remember that we're relatively early in this dataset. Not all of the wells have made it to 90 days. So we had good 30-day and 60-day data. The focus is on optimizing completions. And we've kind of got a menu, it's sort of an all of the above, things that make sense.","I listed diverters, we've previously talked about reductions in cluster spacing on the perfs, targeting, where do you target within the various horizons for the best completions. It's a combination of a lot of factors, and I think the follow-on point that you're probably wanting to ask is when do you see this translate though to EUR. We'll give you an update on our thoughts on EUR when we come our with our 2016 plan.","But, clearly a 100 barrel oil equivalent per day increase in the average quarter-over-quarter. 1,000 barrel a day type 30-day IPs. We're excited about it. I think that's the key takeaway.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Lee. And then when you talk about maintenance capital, there's another goal, I believe of achieving HBP in the STACK. Is that possible by year-end 2016 with a maintenance capital or you need to push it to 2017?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that what we said earlier this year is that we were going to stay aggressively focused on HBPing our STACK acreage as that was our pressing need. Now we're fortunate that we have high return wells that we're drilling, we're not in development mode. So, typically we'll drill a 10,000-foot well, and we'll protect two sections, and then we'll move about two miles away and we'll drill the next two section.","So, it's a lot of work, we'll be at about 100 wells by end of this year. We'll need a touch over 200 wells to get the core footprint HBPed. So, it tells you that there'll be a lot of drilling. The rig count is shifting in favor of STACK. That's been happening during the course of the year. I would guess that at a level of funding that you're talking about, $900 million, $1 billion type funding, somewhere in that zip code, we'll be 90% plus HBP by the year and we'll finish up the HBP early in 2017.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, Lee. Great quarter.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you and good morning.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Dan.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","The STACK wells continue to show improvements in productivity, whether you measure it in absolute terms or on a per foot of lateral basis. What should we expect in terms of the rate of change going forward, given the completion optimization operations underway today?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that the shortest answer is that it's still early innings. I think there's a lot going on, a lot that we're doing, a lot that other competitors in the play are doing. I think we're all learning from each other. Clearly, I would expect to see some continued learning and positive results related thereto, but the pace, the actual rate of that change, I'm not going to try to answer that today. I just think that we're still early innings and there'll be some more wins before this is over with.","Daniel Eugene McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan Guffey with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys, and congrats on a great quarter.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dan.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Just wanted to dive in a little bit more on spacing. I know you mentioned you're done with spacing tests for this year, just curious your thoughts on if 880 feet or six wells per section is the right spacing? And then, also on your third and fourth test that you guys did, or I guess your third specifically as you were previously defining it, you had two in the Meramec that were stacked and staggered, vertical spacing was around 175 fee. Are you seeing any degradation or communication that's pushing down or pulling down some of those production rates from those pilots, or are all of them essentially at or above your type curves?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, let me \u2013 I'll start with a high level commentary. I don't know that we said that we weren't doing anymore pilot tests between now and year-end. I think we'll have ongoing well pairs, two-well pairs. We have no specific multi-wells spacing pilots being drilled. But we do continue to \u2013 we do plan to continue to drill two-well pairs where we can across the acreage footprint, just makes sense so you can gather the information.","I think the results that we've seen from all of the wells that we released to date have been in line or above the published type curve. So we've been very pleased there. We've not seen any negative interference effects or degradation. So, another thing to be very pleased with.","The closest we've been able to get is 880 feet, I believe. And the reason for that is, when you drill across lease lines, State of Oklahoma rules that's as close as we can get. So, practically speaking, that's about six wells per horizon, if you wanted to think about it at that level. I think we feel pretty comfortable with the results we're seeing there. We'll have to wait for the mood, the shift into development to drill multi-well pilots and I'm sure we'll test spacing tighter than that once we get there.","But right now, we're very encouraged with the results. We'll continue to add to the dataset. When we get the acreage footprint HBPed, it's going to be a pretty fantastic place to be, because we'll have all of that spacing and well performance data before we ever actually get into the development mode. That's a luxury we haven't had in any of the previous plays.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. So, I mean, it's sounds like the data, what you gathered this year, the inventory number that you provided at the beginning of the year this year, the inventory in STACK should significantly increase when you put your numbers out in February of 2016, is that correct?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, we're very encouraged. We'll update the inventory and the well counts and give you that information as part of our year-end dataset, consistent with what we've been doing the last two years, three years.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then again on optimizations, I know you said you're kind of \u2013 it's a full menu of trying out many different types. I guess, how close do you guys feel like you are to reaching optimization and do you think all of 2016 will get you to where you need to be when you enter full field development mode and actually have a recipe that you consistently use?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I would tell that we'll continue to learn as we move through the development of this play. I would expect to see continued improvements, as we said earlier. I think the key to remember is our team starts at time zero in these plays not to chase press releases and big IPs, but to design the development well. So we're working on the development well designs today. We want compact, tight, complex, fracture networks, and that's really what the focus is.","I would take you back \u2013 I don't know if we've talked, Dan, but I'm sure you've heard Steve and others and some of the materials we've put out. I love looking at what the team's accomplished in the Williston Basin, and we're drilling and completing 21,000 foot wells, 22,000 foot wells there today for $5 million, including facilities. And those wells are virtually identical to the types of wells that we'll be drilling in STACK. So, when we get to development mode, I wouldn't bet against team Newfield.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Fantastic. Thanks for the update, guys, and congrats again on the quarter.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Advisors. Please go ahead.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Morning, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","The fourth quarter guidance of 74,000 barrels equivalent a day, what's the oil percentage expected in that?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Gary will flip the page in the book here for you.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's about 36%, somewhere thereabouts.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And so, you are on trend still to get to the 40% oil percentage in 2016, so that kind of continued to pick up into next year.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I don't know if you heard the earlier response, David...","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah. Basically, (36:18)","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...the small variations quarter-to-quarter, that's just noise. I think the trajectory is all positive, and we're really pleased with the performance against the type curve. So I think we're all set there, it will just be a question of pace.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Yeah. We've seen other operators \u2013 you're meeting or exceeding your oil volumes, and then getting an uplift of incremental gas and NGLs that are kind of gratis or gravy on your economics. And do you expect that to continue as you look forward or is that just \u2013 or do you still get to the same mix of 400,000 barrels of oil and 950,000 barrels equivalent from an EUR standpoint? Just trying to get an idea of \u2013 oil's making it but does gas and NGL even beat more and give you some more juice?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, I think that the politest answer I can give today is let us accumulate some more time on the wells that we've released today. We're going to add additional wells in the course of the fourth quarter. So, we'll go into next year with 100 wells in our dataset. So the dataset is growing at a pretty rapid pace in that regard. Clearly, with the uplift that you're seeing on the early returns on these wells, my expectation is it will ultimately translate to an uptick in EUR. So you will see improvement across the product mix: oil, NGLs and gas.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","And then, I think, talking to Steve last night, there was some downtime in the Eagle Ford in the quarter and then you had higher ethane in the Williston that brought your NGL realizations down. How does that flow forward into the fourth quarter?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","The NGLs that we saw increased in the Williston Basin. We'll \u2013 we're anticipating that it will flow into 2016.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Okay. So that keeps going. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's all about capture up there.","David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors","Thanks, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep. Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one last question and we can take that from Josh Silverstein with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Morning, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Josh.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You mentioned some of this in your comments with the transportation moving from the truck to pipe, increasing some of the netbacks by about $2 per barrel. I was hoping you guys could provide whether it's in terms of BOE or percentage, the margin uplift you guys are anticipating seeing as we flow through next year as the Anadarko Basin becomes the majority of the domestic volumes?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think probably the best answer, rather than me making it up on the fly, is just to tell you that let us complete the plan. We'll get the details of the plan and when we release all that information, you'll have all of that data in there. I mean, I think trend lines quarter to quarter that you've got in 2015 probably give you pretty good visibility. We're not going to change dramatically from one quarter to the next, but small percentage changes can be driven by the things I referenced earlier in the call: pad drilling, locations, all kinds of different things that play into that.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And if you guys were in that the $900 million maintenance mode, where would that low 50-ish percentage of the Anadarko Basin flow through to 4Q 2016? Is it well over 60% or is it just kind of a gradual step-up each quarter?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure I followed the questioning. So, let me ask you to go ahead and repeat.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, the Anadarko Basin production has obviously increased as a percentage of total domestic volumes. I was just curious, if \u2013 it sounds like upwards of 90% of the spent is going to go into that Basin while the others...","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","... somewhat decline. Where does that kind of percentage go to looking out a year?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I'll stick to the same comment. We'll give you the 2016 absolute figures when we come out in February with that data. The trend line, I think you're on to a good line of reasoning. I think the Anadarko is going to become a more dominant part of the portfolio. We mentioned in the call that we've gone past 50%, and clearly, the margins are improving there. So, Anadarko Basin, the economic draw, the gravitational pull, we've been talking about the last two years or three years just continues to get stronger and stronger. And it will translate to materially improved margins 2016 forward. We kind of like that.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","(40:50)","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess, think that was the last call. So, we'll go ahead and thank everybody for tuning in this morning. Appreciate the questions. Look forward to updating you on the full year 2015 results and our 2016 plan going forward.

For opening remarks and other housekeeping items, I'll turn the call over to Steve Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Stephen C. Campbell - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. By now, I hope you've had a chance to review our release and our @NFX that we issued last night. As always, the slides in @NFX will be a very helpful reference during our call today.","Following our prepared remarks from our Chairman, Lee Boothby, we'll have our executive team here and available to take your questions. As always, please limit your time during the Q&A to one question and one follow-up. As you know, this allows us to get to more of your questions at the end of the call. Let me also remind you that today's call is being recorded, and it will be available on our website along with our earnings release, the accompanying financial tables, and non-GAAP reconciliations. We will reference certain non-GAAP measures, so please see reconciliations at the end of our earnings release today.","Today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates, and these assumptions are based on our current views and our most reasonable expectations. In summary, statements in this morning's news release, our @NFX, and on this conference call today regarding expectations, predictions, or the future are all forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations, including those we described in the press release and @NFX and our 10-K, which was also filed yesterday.","Thanks again for dialing in. I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman, Lee Boothby.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon, including the filing of our Form 10-K. We will do our best to briefly summarize our 2015 results, as well as update you on the progress we're making in our Anadarko Basin assets and our plans for 2016. As always, we will leave ample time to take your specific questions at the end.","These are indeed challenging times for the energy sector. More than a year ago now, we grew concerned about lower-for-longer commodity prices and took progressive steps to strengthen our hedge book, reduce investment levels, right-size our workforce, and preserve margins by slashing costs across the business. These efforts were evident in our fourth quarter results and our outlook for improved costs and expenses in 2016.","With the challenges presented in 2016, we must remain vigilant in our pursuit of lower costs and improved efficiencies. We continue to adapt our near-term business strategies to preserve the health of the company and ensure we are in the best possible position to not only weather 2016 but to emerge with improved margins and a readiness to compete and win when commodity prices ultimately strengthen. I'm confident that we have the people, the plan, and the assets to get it done.","Our priorities as outlined in our 2016 outlook released last night are crystal clear. Number one, preserve liquidity. We reduced activity levels and better aligned our investment plans with cash flow expectations. You will see that our 2016 budget is down more than 50% from last year, and we have high-graded the lion's share of our capital to the Anadarko Basin, where returns are more resilient today.","Our second priority is to HBP STACK. STACK is a premier asset with industry-leading returns under any plausible long-term commodity price scenario. It's critical that we retain our acreage and continue to push toward full field development, where we are confident that the returns will continue to get better.","Third, reduce operating expenses and preserve margins. This is a continuation of the solid progress we made in 2015. You can see from yesterday's guidance that 2016 LOE and G&A expenses are projected to be down significantly. And we are looking for other avenues to safely reduce expenses.","And fourth, we're commencing a process to sell additional nonstrategic assets. We've had a number of inbound calls and progressed some of those discussions. However, none to date have resulted in a transaction. These discussions have encouraged us to launch a more organized effort to gain price discovery and ultimately transact on select assets. Although we have a desire to sell assets, we are not alone in that wish. We recognize that this market could quickly become saturated with distressed sellers. Proceeds from a potential sale would improve our financial flexibility and allow for opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions and acceleration in Anadarko Basin activity if oil prices rally, or to simply manage our short-term borrowing levels.","I can assure you that our people, from the office to the field, are focused and aligned to execute these four priorities. A little later in the call, I'll provide more details on our 2016 outlook. But first let me cover our 2015 highlights.","2015 was a great year for Newfield and its stockholders, as we continued a multiyear streak of solid execution against our targets and delivered on our key objectives.","Now to the highlights. Early 2015, we recapitalized our company and took proactive steps to reduce leverage and enhance liquidity. When coupled with our strong hedge position, these measures helped to offset the negative impact of low commodity prices and differentiated our balance sheet from many others in our peer group. The strong financial footing allowed us to successfully execute our game plan.","Our 2015 game plan was certainly simplified. Capital investments were reduced by about 25% over 2014, and we were laser focused on our exciting Anadarko Basin drilling programs, where we saw improving drilling and completion costs throughout the year. In 2015, each of our focus areas exceeded our beginning-of-year production forecasts, and we beat our guidance, which was raised twice during the year.","Production was driven by SCOOP and STACK, which achieved a record fourth quarter net production average of about 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. From a startup less than four years ago, SCOOP and STACK today comprise nearly half of our total company production and over half of the total proved reserves.","We took aggressive steps to reduce domestic LOE, and our per-unit expense is down by more than 25% compared to 2014. We acted quickly to address G&A and took action in 2015 and early 2016 that have reduced our head count by more than 20%. These measures equate to an estimated $45 million per year savings in 2016 gross G&A.","Our Anadarko Basin proved reserves increased 50% to 269 million barrels of oil equivalent. Positive additions helped partially offset significant price-related revisions. Total company proved reserves decreased about 20% year over year to 509 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which about two-thirds are proved developed. Proved reserve additions during the year equate to a reserve replacement ratio of approximately 180% or 350% depending on the inclusion or exclusion of positive revisions. There's a detailed accounting in cost incurred in reserve additions and revisions in our release and our 10-K.","Let's move on to a summary of our fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Our production in the fourth quarter was above guidance at 14.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which 47% was oil and nearly two-thirds were liquids. Fourth quarter domestic production was at the top end of guidance at 13.5 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our Anadarko Basin production beat our forecast levels by nearly 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Excluded several items listed in our release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $50 million or $0.30 per share on revenues of $362 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $289 million. Our hedges added about $500 million in incremental revenues in 2015 and helped to underpin our cash flow. We estimate an additional $365 million in hedge revenues over the next two years at current strip prices.","Our 2015 production was 56 million barrels of oil equivalent, of which 5.4 million barrels came in from our China assets. Adjusted net income for 2015 would have been $164 million or $1.02 per share when excluding unrealized losses on commodity derivatives, the premium to call notes, and impairments. Revenues for 2015 were approximately $1.6 billion, and consolidated net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was approximately $1.2 billion.","Let's talk about 2016 and the key objectives in our near-term business plan. As I said in my opening comments, 2016 is all about preservation of liquidity, holding our STACK acreage, and finding creative ways to improve margins in a low oil price environment. We have a deep, high-quality, and economically resilient inventory to attack today in the Anadarko Basin, and this is the centerpiece of our 2016 plan. Our total capital budget is $625 million to $675 million, down more than 50% at the midpoint from 2015.","There's a pie chart on slide 8 in our @NFX publication that depicts our plant investments by region. On a unit-of-production basis, our outlook for cash operating costs has improved and can be attributed to the following. Our domestic lease operating expenses on a unit-of-production basis are expected to be more than 15% below 2015. As we focus our investments in the Anadarko Basin, the benefits are increasingly more apparent in our margins. Lease operating and transportation expenses here are just over $5 per BOE, the lowest in our liquids portfolio. As SCOOP and STACK production growth offsets declines in areas with higher operating expenses and lower realized prices, we expect to see continued improvements in our margins.","As I mentioned earlier, our gross G&A expense is expected to be $45 million lower than 2015, and we continue to look for ways to reduce G&A and streamline our operations. Despite the large cut in our capital investments, our 2016 domestic production is expected to be relatively flat, with 2015 at about 50 million barrels of oil equivalent. China liftings are expected to total 4.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, and no additional investments are planned in China.","About 80% of our 2016 budget is planned for the Anadarko Basin, so this is where I will focus the remainder of our discussion. SCOOP is currently in active development, and we are drilling wells from common pads using shared production facilities and accessing markets through established midstream infrastructure. SCOOP constitutes about $200 million of our 2016 investments. Within our SCOOP program, we will focus largely on SCOOP oil and the Springer Shale in both nonoperated and operated areas. We continue to see good Springer results and benefit from the fact that much of our prospective Springer inventory is already HBP'd.","STACK investments, which total about $300 million in 2016, will be focused on HBP'ing our acreage and ensuring that we hold this premier asset for future development. Today, about 50% of our acreage is held by production. We expect to invest $50 million to $80 million in land costs in the Anadarko Basin, largely in the STACK area. We're confident that our returns will further improve as we transition to full field development.","There are some slides in our @NFX publication that I'll reference today, starting with slide 12. Here notice that we are now reporting our well performance on a three-stream basis. We made this change for a few simple reasons. First, it's better disclosure and reports actual volumes by product from plant settlements and eliminates the need to estimate NGLs. Second, our type curve is three stream, and it makes comparisons to our average expectations much easier.","On slide 14, notice the significant improvements we are seeing in well productivity. This illustration chronicles STACK well performance by year and clearly shows the improvements we have made to optimize completions and targeting. Here we show all 77 wells drilled to date, plotted against our type curve by year. And all information is on a three-stream basis. We will continue this practice going forward.","Last year, we raised our three-stream STACK type curve by about 20% from 800 Mboe to 950 Mboe to reflect data from large sample of wells. Our 2015 wells are performing well above the type curve today. As we've said, our STACK type curve represents a play average across a vast area. History tells us there will be variability in individual well results over a large area where all hydrocarbon phases are present. And we remain very encouraged by the consistency of the well results over the last three-plus years.","On slide 13, we plot results from Newfield and industry wells throughout the STACK area, where confidence in the play continues to grow. Today, there are more than 30 rigs running, and about 350 total wells have been drilled and completed to date. There are an additional 100 wells permitted. We have announced a leading position in the oil window and are benefiting from technology, service sector infrastructure, and the science being done by large, high-quality operators all around us.","In 2015, we expanded our footprint and extended our acreage position to the north and west, where we are seeing high levels of industry activity today. In addition to the primary Meramec and Woodford targets, we have additional prospective horizons that we and industry will be testing in the future. We have thousands of prospective wells in inventory and realize the importance of holding our acreage for the future benefit of our stockholders.","We continue to see improvements in our drilling efficiencies. On slide 15, we show our completed cost per lateral foot and the progress we've made over the last several years. Lower costs per foot have come by targeting the most effective drilling zones, improvements in penetration rates through changes in bit designs, as well as drilling fluid and motor optimizations. From our participation in the wells drilled by others, we know that our results are industry-leading. Our best-in-class SXL wells are drilled and completed for about $750 per gross perforated interval, including facilities. We expect that our 2016 wells will cost about $725 per gross perforated foot.","Well costs across our acreage will vary, and the reasons are very important to understand. First, drilling depths range from more than 12,000 feet to less than 8,000 feet. Second, in some areas to the north and west, we are often required to set an extra casing string, and this adds about $0.75 million or so to completed well cost. And next, about one-third of our total wells in 2016 will be XL wells, 5,000-foot lateral lengths. We plan to test XL wells this year to better understand the economics of XL wells while holding acreage that would not allow for the drilling of SXL wells. Several of our peers in the area have seen solid results from XL wells, and we intend to continue to deliver the same.","And finally, we continue to tinker with our completions to find the most optimal design for future development. We're employing zipper fracs, diverting agents, higher fluid and proppant concentrations, and using both hybrid and slickwater fracture stimulations across the Anadarko Basin. We're very encouraged by the strong performance from 2015 wells and the improvements that have accrued over the last several years. These ongoing experimentations will create variability in both well cost and production performance.","Although the STACK drilling program provides industry-leading returns at today's oil prices, it's more important for you to understand where we are heading. We envision significantly lower well cost once we move into full field development. On slide 15, we contrast in difference \u2013 in today's costs with what we internally refer to our vision well. We have a line of sight on completed well costs, including facilities, as low as $6 million in future development.","On the left side of slide 16, we outline our 2016 assumptions for STACK well costs, operating expenses, and our average working and net revenue interests. To the right of these assumptions, we show pre-tax rates of return using a variety of well costs and commodity prices. You can see the impact that a $5 move in oil or a $0.5 million reduction in completed well costs has on our returns.","We've taken steps to secure takeaway and attractive markets for our growing Anadarko Basin volumes. As of today, we're beginning to move STACK oil by pipe to Cushing, Oklahoma. By midyear, we expect that 100% of our production will be on pipe to Cushing. This is a high-quality crude, and we expect our differential will ultimately be about $2.50 off NYMEX WTI. You will see improved differentials in our guidance today. We remain very encouraged with the continuing progress we're making in the Anadarko Basin, and we'll be happy to discuss additional details with you during Q&A.","Let me close with a summary on the remaining investments in our 2016 CapEx. We plan to run a single rig in the Williston Basin through midyear and expect to complete 12 to 15 wells this year. Our most recent wells have been drilled and completed for just under $5 million, including facilities.","In the Eagle Ford, we will invest solely through our outside-operated program in the Fashing area, and this constitutes about $28 million. Although these teams have done an outstanding job to enhance economics, we simply must shift our limited capital towards the Anadarko Basin and our HBP needs.","We also expect to invest about $23 million in two joint ventures that we have recently signed last year, one in the Arkoma and the other in the Central Basin of the Uinta. In each of these ventures, a significant portion of our interest is carried. Our rationale is fairly simple. One, demonstrate recent advancements in drilling and completions, gain a better understanding of play economics, and offset firm transportation and refining commitments that are negatively impacting our cost structure today. In the Arkoma Basin, we've already drilled several of the wells with superior early results on production and cost savings. Newfield is the operator of both ventures.","So once again thanks for dialing into our call today and for your interests and investment in Newfield Exploration. We are fortunate to have premier assets in the Anadarko Basin, and we are actively driving down our well costs and improving returns. Our priorities are very clear today. They are centered around preserving liquidity, maintaining a strong balance sheet to weather a very challenging period of low oil prices. We know the importance of holding our Anadarko Basin acreage to drilling and retaining this important asset for our future growth. I'm confident that we have a sound near-term business plan to not only survive but to emerge as a leaner, better-focused, and more profitable company.","That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. And we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Morning, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Dave.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Just kind of thinking a little bit about some of the spacing information you guys have shared with us in the past. Can you update us as far as, now that we have longer production history, what both the horizontal spacing still looks like and what the vertical spacing looks like from kind of a stacked and staggered approach?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I can tell you what we've done. We haven't put any new information out, so you can go back and pick up the results that we've put forth. The tightest spacing that we've tested \u2013 and, remember, these are generally wells drilled on either side of lease lines. So in Oklahoma you got to be 440 feet off. So the tightest spacing that we've tested in STACK at this point's about 880 feet. And we won't be able to go below that until we drill an actual spacing pilot on a DSU. So at this point that's the tightest we're going until we get our HBP situation satisfied. And then within that, Dave, there were multiple tests \u2013 Woodford\/Woodford, Woodford\/Meramec, Upper Meramec, Lower Meramec, in a variety of different offset distances.","I would tell you that it's a relatively loose data set at this point, and I wouldn't draw any huge conclusions from it. But everything is positive. All the wells continue to perform at or above type curve. We saw no negative effects at the tightest spacing, so we're very, very encouraged in terms of thinking about what the ultimate spacing might be. And we continue to think that we'll have multiple layers ultimately to be developed.","I will point out that some of our high-quality peers in the area that have already got HBP acreage have some high-density pilots planned, and we'll be watching with great interest. It's easy to see what they're thinking, and frankly their thinking is in line with our thinking in terms of the number of horizons and the ability to space wells out in the four to eight wells per horizon type level.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay. Appreciate that. But you haven't seen many differences in terms of any communication (23:27) \u2013 okay.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All positive at this point.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Perfect. And then, when I think about the forward production guidance \u2013 and wells are outperforming type curves \u2013 what did you use as far as a type curve in that production guidance \u2013 i.e., trying to get a handle on the conservative nature of guidance, perhaps?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll say thank you on behalf of the entire team for calling our guidance conservative. My friends sitting around me would tell you that they're focused on costs and efficiencies and driving those down, but as I indicated in the call, our focus is all about HBP today. I think that we're very, very happy to see where the wells sit relative to the type curve. We're not making any type curve adjustments at this point in time. I mentioned in the call that while we haven't seen any material variability across the acreage at this stage, there's still that potential. And we don't see a need to adjust the type curve up. From a positive point, if it continues to perform at those levels, that will translate to a positive outcome relative to the 2016 guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Morning.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Dave.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Lee, just let me \u2013 so can you give me those HBP numbers again? I kind of cut out there in part of the call. It sounds like \u2013 where do you think you'll be end of 2016 and then where at the end of 2017 as far as HBP in the STACK?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","2015, I think I quoted in the prepared remarks that we ended the year right around 50%.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yep.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll remind you, Dave, that we added acreage during the year, and I mentioned that, to the north and northwest. I don't know if you heard those comments. So there's a little bit of a bounce in terms of where we stand on HBP -","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","\u2013 versus what we might have projected when we had a lower acreage count. So that's the first thing for you to consider. The numbers we're referencing are relative to the current footprint. So 50% HBP. The core, the original STACK acreage where we drilled when you look at that map and the added effects, you'll see that that's been pretty well peppered, so we'll have a lot of activity moving north and then ultimately northwest over time. We would expect to end 2016 at around 65% or so with the reduced capital program, HBP'd. We would expect 2017 to move up in the 75%, 80% range, assuming a continuation of same. I think ultimately we'll keep you posted as we go. We're picking up incremental acreage on poolings, so there'll be some noise from period to period in terms of what the actual acreage account is. But I think those are pretty good numbers. So 50% at year-end, 65%-ish at year-end 2016, 75%-ish at year-end 2017 is what we're thinking right now.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful, thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, if \u2013 I'll just ask this question because \u2013 and you may hate me for it \u2013 but the entire story right now on your stock seems to be, right, somehow Newfield has to issue equity, they got to do capital markets, they got to sell something, even though your balance sheet's strong. From my seat, right, you don't need to do anything. Can you just talk how you're thinking about your capital structure and anything you can say along those lines?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think I'll start by saying we never hate you, just for the record.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","You may hate the question, but just not me. Okay. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't even hate questions. I think that we all recognize that the current business environment \u2013 I called it challenging. This is my 33rd year in the business. There have been four major events, so that means every eight years or so we go through one of these periods. What bothers us most about the current period is it embodies part of 1986, part of 1998, part of 2008. So it's serious. And, frankly, I think industry \u2013 some of the people that have taken steps in that regard are doing so probably because they see the environment as equally challenging. Frankly, our view is that since we're going to protect our assets and protect the investment of our stakeholders, stockholders, we're going to keep all viable options on the table to preserve the health and the enterprise. I think I said that in the earlier comments.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yep.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Our bias, as you know, over the years, we've funded \u2013 the entire transformation the company has been towards asset sales, and we've talked about moving that process along. I think the shift from non-core assets into the SCOOP and STACK assets in the Anadarko Basin makes sense. We've been on that path for the last three or four years, and we'll continue. But we sold $2.6 billion of assets over the last five years, including just under $100 million of assets that nobody heard about in 2015. So it's been an important part of the game plan, and I think that we'll continue to be prudent in that regard.","And I think that the broader question that you're probably asking \u2013 we've seen peers accessing the capital markets. We do understand the rationale. We can see the need to enhance liquidity, manage debt levels. We've reduced our capital spend back towards cash flow, and I think we're taking all the prudent steps that we can. But part of being prudent is that you always keep all the options on the table to preserve balance sheet strength, and that's what allows us to execute our near-term plan. It was critical to us in 2015; it'll be critical to us again in 2016. So I think that's kind of my long-winded view. But again, 1986 was bad; 1998-1999 were no fun; 2008 no fun absolutely. 2014, 2015, now we're into 2016, might be the worst of them all.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Let's hope not. Thanks for the color.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Dave, and if it's not, we're going to be in the adequate position to step on the accelerator on the ride up, but we want to see positive movement in the markets before we step on the accelerator.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sounds good. Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Glick with JPMorgan.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So maybe to follow up on David's question there. I mean, can you just speak a little bit more to leverage and kind of what your comfort levels are from a ratio perspective over the next year or two?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we've been pretty clear and spoken about that quite a bit over the last year or so. I think we found ourselves \u2013 and, again, compliments to our team here. Proactive timing and execution last year left us in good stead. We look at where we finished the year, and that all feels nice and comfortable. Last year, we were sitting here talking about how difficult the business environment was at $50. Today, we're sitting here looking at numbers in the low $30s. So it's certainly in a different environment today. But I'll let Larry give you his color on leverage ratios and how we're thinking about it.","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I think we've said in the past that we've kind of targeted a net-debt-to-EBITDA roughly around 2. I think that's a really good healthy enterprise in these kind of lower commodity prices you're seeing. That \u2013 challenging, and companies certainly experiencing higher leverage ratios. We're not immune to that either, although we've been able to, through the actions that we pointed out, kind of keep it in and around there. So we'll continue to monitor that, and that's our expectation, is to stay at healthy levels, but that'll be dependent on product prices.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then shifting to STACK, you obviously went through the year-over-year improvements. But could you maybe provide a little bit more detail on the drivers in 2015 in your plants and test techniques in 2016?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I rattled off a lot of the things that we're doing in the call. I think I'd reference you to the call script, and certainly you can follow up with Danny and Steve if you want additional details. But we're testing larger job sizes, hybrid fracs, higher proppant concentrations, tighter fracture cluster spacing. It's an all of the above, but our team has demonstrated over the last three or four years that the scientific method works at Newfield. So we don't change 15 variables at one time and then tell you, \"Look at the great job that we did.\" We actually do it systematically so that you can understand what you're doing. So I think our team will take those steps during the course of the year, and we'll be able to tell you as 2016 unfolds what we believe the secret sauce is for the STACK play.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Silverstein with Deutsche Bank.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Good morning, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Josh. Hello?","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hello, can you hear me now?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I can hear you.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, guys, and good morning. Was just thinking along the lines of the asset sales. I note the program has started to divest assets in the Anadarko Basin over 50% of total volumes in 2016. Just trying to get a better understanding of how you guys want to transition the company over the next few years. Is the goal to really make this kind of a pure-play focus on the Anadarko Basin so you could sell assets elsewhere and redeploy a more capital to consolidate the Anadarko Basin? Just kind of thinking how this transition period works as you guys are trying to set up for the next cycle.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I'm not sure I understood all your question, but I'll take a stab at it, Josh. So the first thing, we have been rotating into the Anadarko Basin over the course of the last three years, just given the scale and scope of the asset portfolio that we put together there and the results being posted. I mentioned that we sold $2.6 billion of what we call nonstrategic assets over the last five years. That helped fund our transformation including building those positions that we love dearly today.","Our focus has to remain on HBP'ing the STACK acreage. We've got most of SCOOP taken care of. We do have some wells planned there, as indicated, in 2016, but it's mostly about focusing on getting STACK HBP'd and putting us on a position so that in 2017 we can start some of the tighter spacing pilots and a move towards development, which was one of our targets that we talked about during the course of 2015.","We want to remain opportunistic, obviously, relative to opportunities that will come up from to time in those core areas, and we want to be able to take advantage of it. You saw us add 20,000 acres in the core of SCOOP and STACK in 2015, and it's my hope that we'll see additional opportunities like that develop in 2016 and on the road ahead. We want to keep Newfield strong and in a position to act.","Ultimately, relative to what we call nonstrategic assets, we've said consistently over the last couple years it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. I think our team broadly, that means all of the folks that work in managed assets, understand that we're making smart decisions for in the business in the intermediate and long term. And I think that they've shown the ability to deliver results in that area. So, as we make those decisions, we'll shed assets in areas if we get an attractive price, and we'll have that cash available for the all-of-the-above strategy that I've kind of outlined in the Anadarko Basin. If we don't see a good price, we're fortunate because of steps taken last year and results posted in 2015 that we don't have to do anything. I think in that regard, we'll be patient and make sure that if we sell an asset, it's at a price that we'll be proud to tell you about.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The stimulus for us has been inbound calls, and people know that we have quality assets and we've been open about saying that at some point in time, we'll let them go. I said clearly in the script that we've had lots of discussions on lots of assets. We're just telling everybody now that it probably means that \u2013 show up with your best number or expect to participate in a process. That's the polite translation of what we said today.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. Yeah, that was the gist of the question, and clearly the production's going in that direction, the capital's already there, and just wanted to see if that was kind of the longer-term trajectory of where the (36:10) -","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(36:10). The gravitational pull continues to get stronger and stronger and stronger every day. We love it.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. Lee, as far as 2014, just curious, if we look at that 2015 curve and if you compared maybe first half of 2015 with second half of 2015, if you would have seen a meaningful difference, a meaningful improvement?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Subash, I mean, obviously, if you look at the curve, I can tell you constructively that since the first half of the curve has most of the well count, the highest number of wells, that's the part that you ought to lean strongest on. As you move to the end of that curve, that's where \u2013 the oldest well from 2015. So the first half of the curve has all the benefits of the most recent activity and results. Clearly, it's well above the curve. We want to be able to see that sustain itself before we make any additional adjustments to the type curve.","But, in general, if you look at all of the wells, since there's 50-some odd wells, if I'm remembering correctly, in that curve, every bit of it's fracking at or above the type curves. So that's part of our comment saying we feel really, really good about the results being posted. My hope is that the work the teams are doing today with all of the testing in terms of variables on the completion side will further enhance productivity, but I'm really proud of what the teams delivered in 2015 and excited about 2016.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah. That's helpful. So, along those lines, in these latest oil wells, latest-gen STACK wells, are you seeing any change in how they perform naturally, what they produce at when they're on artificial lift, the duration artificial lift, et cetera. So perhaps the curve after day 90.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, again, I'm going to remind you \u2013 and I don't have the stats in front of me. I'd tell you follow up with Danny and Steve. They can give you some color on the number of wells per unit time on that curve. I just know that if you look at the second half of that curve, it's first half results, kind of the way to think about it. But the first half of that curve is all the results. That's kind of a way to think about it if you want to think about it on average. So it's not a single well outcome, it's a composite average of all the wells that have been drilled.","Operator","Our next question -","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Follow up with Steve and Danny. They can give you additional color you might want there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Yeah. Just two quick ones for me. Lee, regarding asset rationalizations for something like Utah, will you open a data room, or will you be more passive in what you were describing as companies approaching you?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, we've got some quality companies where we have people that we know and trust that \u2013 would probably entertain discussions with them directly. No reason to run a process if you don't have to. There may be some assets that we choose to run a process just to make sure that we've got a broad test of the market.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And next one from me, in the @NFX, you had the STACK well cost; what about the SCOOP? About the same or \u2013 ?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the SCOOP, I would say that we'll pick up the normal efficiencies. We're in development there, but I would expect that you'll see well costs in a similar vein to what we've been advertising there going forward.","John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, John.","Operator","The next question comes from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. Good morning.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","On the JVs in Arkoma and Uinta, what's the scope of those programs now? And do you see this as something that could lead to a bigger JV down the road?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the scope of the programs are to test what we can do with current technology. So I'll use the Arkoma as a basis for the discussion, because we've not started drilling in the Uinta, but I'll give you some color there as well. So the team had the idea that we've learned a lot since we stopped drilling dry gas wells in the Arkoma several years ago, after the financial crisis. We moved from gas to oil in terms of our focus, and we wanted to go back and see if we could apply those learnings and how to translate it in terms of spud-to-TD times and cost.","So we've drilled five or six wells there now on this promoted basis. I think the exciting part was the very first well in the program was drilled in half the time of the best-in-class well drilled five years earlier. So that was a real shot in the arm. And then the productivity of the well \u2013 we'll update you, these programs, later in the year, but just to give you the early returns on that well, productivity of that well was the best in the field. So that gives us visibility in that dry gas asset there in the Arkoma that at gas prices down in the $2.50, $2.75, if oil decides to hang around in the $35, $40 range, we could go back to work drilling gas wells and not lose any sleep over it. That's kind of exciting. At the same time, it probably tells you that lower-for-longer on natural gas is going to be around for a while.","The other side of that on the Uinta, that's oil. And we had the same learnings that we've taken both from the Anadarko Basin, the Williston Basin, and the Eagle Ford. And we've put a team together, and they've been working for the last year or so. The teams that delivered the sub-$5 million cost in the Williston, and their challenge is to go to the Uinta Basin and prove we can do it there too. So the first part of this is to go back, can we drill them faster? Can we drill and complete the wells much more cost-effectively? We know what the producibility is out there. We've got lots of good production. We just need to drive the costs down. And on the other side of it, we've got some commitments to refiners. So this gives us an opportunity to demonstrate the economic value of the asset, continue to advance the learning curve, and satisfy the requirements to move oil to the area of the refiners. So it's kind of a win-win-win proposition in that regard. We'll start the drilling on that program here sometime in the second quarter.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. And then, especially in the Uinta, do you see, with the commitments to the refiners, this program to get a longer-term JV there?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think with success, we're open-minded. It's a win for the refiners in Uinta, it's a win for our partner in the Arkoma. Good business relationships tend to grow, and we're open-minded in that regard. If it's beneficial to Newfield and our stockholders, and beneficial to our partners, you'll probably see more of that activity.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And my follow-up was in the STACK area. You've been looking at \u2013 kind of back into the sort of the latest wells, even adjusting for the two-stream versus three-stream. There's been a nice pickup in the latest batch. Just wondering how much of that is where you're drilling within your acreage versus some of the completion optimizations you mentioned before, and can you sort of give us some idea of where you are with the completions today versus, say, a year ago?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say the completions are probably moving toward the middle innings, if you want it to put in baseball terms. And I would say that the results you're seeing are a product of geography, geology, and creativity. So it's kind of all of the above. It's not just completions. It's not just geography, geology; it's a combination of factors that led to that improved performance. And I don't a percentage breakout for you. Maybe talk to Steve and Danny and they'll give you some more color, but that's the right answer.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Will Derrick with SunTrust.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Will C. Derrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Question \u2013 talking about completions, in the STACK with your recent wells and updated completions, are you all seeing any improvement in oil rates, I guess, over time as a cut of the whole mix?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that if you look at the shape curves on slide 14, demonstrated relative to our type curve, you'll see pretty good conformance. We've seen good consistency. The hope would be that some of the combination of factors that we're talking about, higher proppant concentrations, one of the things I know Gary and the team are working on today. We're working on tighter cluster spacing, talking about diverters. There's all kinds of different points that are being attacked. Ultimately, the objective is to improve the yield on a cost basis, and that would mean improving the economics. If we get the double benefit, if you will, of multiple factors working for us, then you could see an uplift.","But I think the \u2013 with four or five years of producing history now, the actual production characteristics of the target reservoirs are pretty well understood. You'll need to calibrate based on where the wells are located, so that you know that you've got where you are in the phase envelope. Most of our acreage is in the oil window. There's a wet gas condensate window. There will be a volatile oil window. Generally, the volatile oil window is very narrow. You'll grade ultimately into dry gas, so there'll be a large area of dry gas as you move west and southwest away from us. When you talk to Newfield, you're talking about oil window play, largely. We do have some exposure in the volatile oil and the wet gas condensate regime, but we don't have any dry gas exposure at this stage.","Operator","And that concludes today's Q&A session. I'll return the floor to our presenters for closing remarks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I just want to say thank you again. I know it's a tough time for everybody these days, and I know it's no fun for our investors and analyst friends that are working with the same issues that we are, but I want to conclude with both saying thank you for your support and thank you for your investment and interest in Newfield. And I hope you take away from this that we remain excited and encouraged about the road ahead, and we will deliver. Have a good day.","Operator","Okay. This does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"15432":["Newfield Exploration (NYSE:NFX) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 24, 2013  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Lee K.

And before we get started, one housekeeping matter.","Our discussion with you today will contain forward-looking statements such as strategic initiatives and plans, estimated production and timing, drilling and development plans, expected cost reductions and planned capital expenditures. Although we believe that our expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, they are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks.","Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors and risks, some of which may be unknown.

[Operator Instructions] Mr. Lee Boothby, please go ahead, sir.","Lee K. Boothby","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. Operationally, we're off to a great start in 2013. In fact, we're right where we want to be towards our execution of our 2013 through 2015 plan and we're looking forward to sharing our updates with you today. As always, members of our management team are here today to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","In late 2012, we made some strategic decisions that defined Newfield's future direction in our path to long-term value creation for our stockholders. First, the future of our company is in North America and we are now laser focused on delivering profitable growth from our 4 domestic growth engines, the Cana Woodford, the Uinta Basin, the Eagle Ford and the Williston Basin. You will see that our progress this year to increase the liquids production, lower drilling costs, optimized completion practices and improved overall project returns, provide significant encouragement across all of our liquids focused plays.","Second, we're on track to deliver strong domestic liquids growth in 2013, '14 and '15. Our track record of more than 20% compound annual growth rate in domestic liquids production growth over the last 4 years, helps to validate the growth potential of our assets and we believe our 2013 domestic liquids production should increase nearly 40% over last year.","We'll provide some additional comments later on the strength of our production and helpful guidance for the next quarter.","And third, as we announced at year-end, we are exploring strategic alternatives for international businesses. These are quality assets with proven people, a track record of execution and significant upside through our prospect inventories. Our recent 1.5 trillion to 3 trillion cubic foot original gas in place discovery certainly validates the quality of our inventory and the upside in our Malaysian business. The process is progressing well and we expect to have our data room open in early May.","I'm absolutely confident that we're making the right strategic decisions to build value for Newfield stockholders. Our leadership team understands the critical importance of superlative execution in 2013 and we are united in our plans to deliver on our results. You will see today that our first quarter accomplishments are certainly a step in the right direction.","Let me share a few of our exciting highlights to kick off the call.","Our Cana Woodford production in the first quarter was ahead of our original plan. We continue to see very strong oil performance and our economic footprint is expanding. Our most recent wells have averaged nearly 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent production per day, that's gross initial production, and our 60-day average gross production is about 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","As we have proven time and again, our drilling performance and scalable resource plays shows rapid learning curve advancements over the first 2 to 3 years. In the first quarter, we lowered our drilling case cost per foot by about 30% when compared to our 2012 actual results, and 20% compared to our fourth quarter 2012 results. We're now drilling and casing our South Cana wells for about $925 per completed foot. And we expect to continue to show future efficiency gains as our development progresses.","From our working interest in outside operated wells we know that we are leading the way in achieving these efficiencies in the Cana Woodford. And there's additional information in today's @NFX to illustrate this point. In the Williston Basin, we delivered some of our best wells to date during the first quarter. As a result of recent wells and better-than-expected performance from our existing wells, we've increased our growth estimates for the Williston Basin. We now expect our Williston production to grow 25% year-over-year compared to our original target of about 15%.","Our 4 most recent Bakken wells had average initial gross production rates of more than 3,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day and nearly 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over their first 30 days. During the first quarter, we also drilled 2 Three  Forks wells with an average gross initial production of nearly 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day and they averaged nearly 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the first 30 days.","In the Williston, we continued to show well cost improvements, excluding about $900,000 in facility and artificial lift cost, we are now drilling and completing our wells for $8 million to $8.5 million. Our average completed well cost in the Williston for our Super Extended Lateral wells in the first quarter was $8.9 million and we recently drilled and completed a best-in-class well for $7.4 million. Including facility and artificial lift cost, our average gross completed well cost in the Williston in the first quarter were $9.8 million.","In the Eagle Ford, we continue to post solid efficiency gains by drilling Super Extended Laterals, or SXL wells, as we call them, we believe that the longer laterals improve returns and we're implementing them across the company's portfolio today.","In the first quarter, our average well cost in the Eagle Ford were $7.7 million, down from a fourth quarter 2012 average of about $8.4 million. We are now drilling exclusively for multi-well pads in our West Asherton area and are today completing a batch of 6 new wells. These completions will help drive that 12% quarter-over-quarter liquids growth that I referenced earlier.","Lastly, we're progressing well in the Uinta basin, both in the greater Monument Butte unit and in the Central Basin region. Our early 2013 focus has been on improving drill times and optimizing our completions in the Uteland Butte. During the first quarter, we completed 4 additional Uteland Butte wells, with an average gross initial production of about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","Recent results are consistent with our prior wells and provide us with continued encouragement on the size of this resource and our future growth outlook. All of these wells had lateral lengths of about 3,800 feet.","In March, we spud our first Super Extended Lateral well in the Uteland Butte, a 9,900-foot lateral, results are expected midyear. Later in the call today, we will discuss our plans to drill longer laterals in multiple zones across the Central Basin.","Our Uinta production is expected to grow about 10% in 2013 and 20% in 2014. This increase comes to the addition of new refining capacity in the Salt Lake City region. Although we have the refining capacity in hand today to execute our 3-year plan, we continue to explore other options to move crude out of the Uinta basin and into new markets. These new markets could provide competition for our crude, better price differentials and allow us to grow future oil volumes at a quicker pace. Before we move to a more detailed discussion of our focus areas, I'll cover our first quarter financial results. To aid your modeling efforts, I'll also provide some guidance on our second quarter liquids growth and expected costs and expenses.","For the first quarter, our results exceeded first call estimates. We earned $0.45 per diluted share on revenues of $651 million in the first quarter. Our cash flow from operations was $323 million. Our production in the quarter was ahead of our original plan and cash operating costs were lower than our full year guidance ranges.","Sales were 11.7 million barrels of oil equivalent in the first quarter, which included 9.1 million barrels of oil equivalent from our domestic operations. Our international liftings were about 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our production in the first quarter was 56% liquids. We've completed our transition to a liquids-focused company. Most of our reduced costs early in the year, like major expense, for example, were simply related to the timing of our full year capital expenditures.","When looking at individual expense categories, you will notice we increased our domestic transportation expense. As our NGLs become more material with growth in the Cana Woodford, processing costs were reflected in the transportation expense. Our realized prices are higher by a like amount and offset the higher transportation expense.","Consistent with our beginning-of-year forecast, we expect to see strong liquids growth in the second and third quarters. This increase is largely related to new pad completions in the Bakken and Eagle Ford and continued growth in the Cana. We expect that our domestic liquids production in the second quarter will be about 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent, that's up more than 12% from our first quarter production.","Our international liftings in the first quarter came in higher than our beginning-of-year expectations at 2.6 million barrels. And we still expect to produce about 7.2 million barrels of oil equivalent for the full year. For the second quarter, we expect international oil liftings to be about 1.8 million barrels. As you know, we are exploring strategic options for these businesses but our forecast assumes a full year run rate for ease of modeling.","I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gary Packer to cover our operating updates. Gary?","Gary D. Packer","Thanks, Lee. Good morning, everyone. We have some  meaningful updates this quarter and we're excited to share them with you today, most importantly, to demonstrate that we are on target to deliver on our 2013 through 2015 plans. Our domestic production is now revving up significantly and we expect to see momentum build into 2014. Our liquids growth improved our cash flow and transitioned us once again to a company delivering double-digit profitable growth with spending levels better aligned with our cash flows. Many of the highlights that I will cover this morning are detailed in our newly designed @NFX Publication.","Let start with the Cana Woodford where we have 7 operated rigs running today in the Anadarko Basin. Our first quarter net production averaged 14,400 barrels equivalent per day, that's about 4,300 barrels a day higher than our fourth quarter 2012 average. We continue to see excellent well performance. Our recent focus has been in the south wet gas and oil portions of our acreage, and we've completed 6 new wells in the first quarter and they are performing ahead of our type curves.","Our net Cana production should exit 2013 at about 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from about 10,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter last year. At that level, it will become our largest producing asset. That's impressive, when you consider this has taken less than 3 years to move this play from the initial concept phase. Our Mid-Continent team has done a great job for us and they are working other high potential play concepts today.","Our drilling in the Cana is becoming increasingly more efficient. This is not a surprise to us, as we have demonstrated these trends in multiple areas like the Granite Wash, Arkoma Basin, Monument Butte and the Williston Basin, to name a few. We are drilling our wells faster and cheaper through innovative bit designs, mud systems and modified casing programs.","Our quarterly average drilling case costs in the South Cana were about $925 per lateral foot, or more than 20% lower than our fourth quarter average of 2012. I fully expect to see more gains as the year progresses.","Our 3-year plan is focused on the North and South Cana. These development areas have about 500 potential locations on about 4,800 net acres. These areas are where we currently have the most well control and the focus of our near-term drilling program.","Today, we're leveraging other people's money and are rapidly collecting that in the central region of the Cana Woodford. Today, 2 outside operated rigs are running and we have interest in many of these new wells. This helps us to cost-effectively expand our economic footprint and better understand our ultimate resource potential. With a handful of successful wells in the central region, we could add operated activity later this year. We estimated up to 1,000 potential drilling locations in the central region alone.","Our Williston team is executing extremely well today. Our production early this year is ahead of schedule and we expect oil growth this year from the Williston of about 25%, that's up from our original expectation of 15% year-over-year growth. We expect to grow about 25% year-over-year again in 2014. Our drilling teams are capturing efficiencies through the longer laterals and pad drilling, and as we summarized in our operations report last night, our most recent completions in both the middle Bakken and the Three forks are performing very well.","In March, we added a fourth operated rig in the Williston Basin. All of our drilling today is being conducted from multi-well pads. These reduce the time between wells, allow us to simultaneously complete our wells faster and cheaper and we save money with shared production facilities. At our current pace, we expect to drill about 35 operated wells in the middle Bakken and 7 wells in the upper Three Forks this year.","During the first quarter, we completed some of the best wells to date in the Williston Basin. These were not only the highest IP rates we have seen, but more importantly, they captured efficiencies through less drilling days and optimized completion practices. In our Sand Creek Federal area located in McKenzie county, we completed 2 wells in the middle Bakken and 1 the Three Forks. Our 2 middle Bakken wells have averaged gross initial production of 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day and a 30-day average of 1,100 equivalent per day. The Three Forks well has a gross initial production of 3,450 barrels of oil equivalent a day and averaged 1,100 barrels over its 30 days as well. Lateral lengths in these wells were approximately 10,000 feet.","Our returns in the Williston Basin continue to improve through lower completion cost and in the quarter, we drilled a Three Forks wells with a 9,000-foot lateral for $7.4 million. That was a best-in-class well, facilities and artificial lift, add another 900,000 barrels. Let's move to the Uinta Basin.","We estimate more than 760 million barrels of oil equivalent incremental net unrisked resource potential in the Central Basin across our 139,000 net acres. The size of the prize makes this an important asset for the company. In fact, the basin has the scale and the resource potential to drive our corporate growth and profitability for more than a decade. Our objectives in the basin today are clear. Number one, is moving Uteland Butte and Wasatch plays into rapid horizontal development. To date, we've drilled nearly 50 Wasatch vertical wells and 4 Wasatch horizontal wells, and about 15 horizontal wells in Uteland Butte. Production data from both horizontal and vertical wells provides encouragement for the potential of these 2 plays. Our goal is to efficiently accelerate development activity levels in Uteland Butte and the Wasatch.","Second on our list of these objectives, is to partner with state authorities to advance regulatory rules to allow for the drilling of the optimal well. Current regulatory rules and setbacks from section boundaries limit our maximum potential length to date to just under 4,000 feet. We are working hard to advance these rules to allow longer lateral wells, as our lateral lengths contact more of the productive horizon, our production rates and EURs will increase, while our cost per lateral foot decrease, ultimately, improving returns. In addition, they reduce surface disturbances and truck traffic due to fewer locations, longer laterals certainly are our future.","I'm happy to report today that we are drilling our first SXL well in the Uteland Butte, a 9,900 foot lateral. We have 15 additional permits approved by the State of Utah in hand and plan to drill 5 to 6 additional SXL wells in 2013.","We will use the upcoming results to push for expanded permitting for SXL wells in 2014 and beyond. In the Wasatch, we have collected production data from the 50 vertical wells in the performance from the 2 producing horizontal wells that continue to impress us after nearly 300 days of production. We have a solid understanding of the resources with at least 5 major identified productive oil horizons throughout the 1,200 foot vertical Wasatch intervals. This is an oil saturated horizon, offering potential for multi-horizon, stacked, lateral developments. We are today working to secure permits for SXL wells in the Wasatch formation and hope to drill our first SXL wells later this fall.","Third, it is imperative that we accelerate through tremendous value of our giant waterflood asset, the greater Monument Butte. We estimate more than 2 billion barrels of oil in place. We have completed more than 600 40-acre waterflood patterns and we have more than 1,000 patterns remaining to complete.","As part of the waterflood development, we plan to drill more than 200 20-acre infill wells per year and convert about 200 wells to injection per year over the next 6 to 8 years. During the first quarter, we averaged 4.2 days to drill a Green River well and increased our water injection levels to a recent high of 85,000 barrels a day. We are maximizing our production, utilizing our facilities to gather and reuse water and improve the overall efficiencies of our operations.","We are running 3 operated rigs in Monument Butte today, drilling 20-acre infill wells and completing our substantial inventory of waterflood patterns. Soon, we plan to test 10-acre pilots in multiple areas within the unit.","And fourth on our list of objectives, we must secure expanded and long-term markets for our growing Uinta production. We have taken some significant steps over the last 18 months to secure future markets for this oil growth. Today, Tesoro is in the first of 2 planned turnarounds to ready their facilities for an incremental 9,000 barrels a day of refining capacity, which is expected by late 2014. We signed 7- and 10-year firm agreements with Tesoro and HollyFrontier, securing 38,000 barrels a day of firm refining capacity. We expect to grow or Uinta gross production to about 50,000 barrels a day by late 2015.","In addition, we are aggressively exploring refinery markets outside of the Salt Lake City region. Just last week, we railed about 30,000 barrels a day, with more planned, to a refinery outside the Salt Lake City Basin. Our ultimate goal is to create new markets for this high-value crude and provide future visibility on our growing oil sales. I strongly believe that we have resource in the Uinta to support these markets for our growing oil production.","In the Central Basin, all of our first quarter horizontal completions were in the Uteland Butte. We've completed 4 the wells and average initial gross production rates of about 1,000 barrels a day with a 30-day average, on the first 2, of about 715 barrels of oil equivalent per day. These wells are consistent with our first 11 wells and we look forward to our midyear results from the first SXL wells in the Uteland Butte and we expect it to be a game changer for our economics.","Our goal is to continue to improve productivity and returns while lowering our F&D cost. The Uteland Butte is  a play that could rapidly move to horizontal development in 2014 through 2015.","Our net production in the Uinta Basin in the first quarter was about 21,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and reflect higher than normal oil inventories in the field. We talked about this on our February call, so this is not a new issue and its impact was included in our full year guidance.","The inventory build in the field is related to turnarounds in the Salt Lake City refineries that I previously mentioned. These are scheduled facility maintenance and recent expansion efforts to build capacity for our feed. We remain confident that our net sales will increase to about 22,000 barrels a day in the second quarter and more than 25,000 barrels a day in the third and fourth quarters as the new refining capacity becomes available.","In the Eagle Ford, our development efforts are focused on the West Asherton field and we are seeing exceptional improvements in our returns. Today, we are running 2 operated rigs and drilling SXL wells in common pad locations. We are right on target with our Eagle Ford plan and expect to drill about 35 operated wells in the play in 2013.","During the first quarter, we drilled 6 new Eagle Ford wells with average lateral lengths of about 7,500 feet. These wells are in various stages of completion today with one of the pads in early flowback. Our operation teams did an excellent job for us in the first quarter and our well costs were lowered by more than $400,000 when compared to our average cost in 2012. Recent SXL wells were drilled and completed for $7.7 million, gross.","As we predicted on our original guidance, our production ramp in the Eagle Ford in 2013 will be back-end weighted, due to the pad drilling and the timing of our simultaneous completions. Our Eagle Ford net production averaged about 4,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, with no new pads coming online. We are looking for a surge of oil production from new pads in the second quarter and third quarters and expect to exit 2013 at about 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We expect that our Eagle Ford production will grow 75% year-over-year in 2013, an additional 50% in 2014. Our Eagle Ford returns today are among the highest in the company. We estimate that our SXL wells and gross EURs in excess of 550,000 barrels of oil equivalent with a production stream that is largely comprised of black oil.","That's a quick highlight reel from our major areas of operations. In summary, we are executing very well in 2013, we feel confident in our ability to meet our expectations for the year. I'm encouraged by the improvements we are seeing in our drilling programs across the company and we're refining our completions to maximize EURs and production, with today's execution building positive momentum for 2014 and 2015.","I'll now turn the call back to Lee for any closing comments.","Lee K. Boothby","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, to all of you for joining us today for our first quarter update. Over the last several months, we've made some significant strategic decisions and have aligned our capital, personnel and talents towards a common goal. Being a profitable North American-focused resource company. Our capital investment program this year remains at the $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion range, the delta between our cash flow and our investments levels will be financed through our $1.25 billion credit facility, which was undrawn at the end of the first quarter.","Our domestic liquids growth in 2013 is very strong and you see from today's results that we are improving returns and profitability throughout our operations today. We provided some quantitative examples of lower well cost, more effective completions, higher EURs and improving operating expenses. Our domestic focus today is on 4 key resource plays and we're transferring best practices rapidly amongst these areas.","I appreciate your investment and continued interest in our company. Know that we are confident in Team Newfield's ability to execute on our plan and the plan trajectory will make as a larger, stronger and more profitable company.","Operator, I'll turn it over to you to assemble the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, with production exceeding kind of the high end of your guidance in the quarter, having production exceeding your expectations across your 4 key areas and taking up the Bakken production estimate, there was no adjustment to the full year '13 guidance. Kind of curious if you can walk us through, are you expecting maybe greater declines on the gas front or just being conservative as you are working on executing your plan throughout the balance of the year?","Lee K. Boothby","Dave, I think it's, very simply, that it's early in the year. We're off to a good start. We are very encouraged by what you articulated across all of those areas. I think that sustaining that momentum during the course of the year certainly would be strongly positive relative to the forecast plan. But we're early, stay tuned and we look forward to updating you on our progress at the end of the second quarter.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up. In the Bakken, can you kind of walk through maybe any discernible differences between the 2 Three Forks wells that you drilled? Obviously one of them was an absolute standout. And just trying to think about was there any sort of design difference in the well, geologic difference, anything like that, that helps you think through the targeting of your next 7 Three Forks wells?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, we think they were both great wells, Dave. I think, as you indicated, one is absolutely outstanding and we hope it has many brothers and sisters. I would take it as very, very encouraging. As far as design differences, I'll flip it over to Gary, I'm not aware of any design differences between the 2 wells. I think it's just a matter of uncertainty when you drill through a play like that, but we'll keep them both. Gary, do you have anything on that?","Gary D. Packer","They're in 2 different areas of the field, that probably has something to do with it. I'm not aware of any differences in the design that we have between the 2 wells.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Subash Chandra with Jefferies.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First of all, I got to see the @NFX document back, very helpful. First question, I guess, Lee, if you could just remind me on the international sale, potential tax treatment and repatriation cost that might be associated with bringing those dollars back, if any?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I think that, Subash, I don't know that I've had a chance to talk to you, but I know we've been in the road a lot over the last 6 to 7 weeks and talked to a lot of folks. I think the way Terry described it, very clearly, is that it's a tax -- it'll be a tax-efficient transaction. We'll end up leaving 10% behind for whatever the realizations are in China and everything else comes home.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And my follow-up is, so the rail options, I guess, you're working on here are pretty small, and I assume there are sort of ways to maybe get rid of some of the inventory you've built. But could you address maybe how scalable this current effort might be?","Gary D. Packer","It's something that we're exploring. I would suggest that for the barrels that we've moved thus far, we have an opportunity to probably move about 3x of that this year, it's something that we're currently exploring. It -- we're not going to announce where we're moving it, but we're moving it to one of the coastal refineries. And based on how those runs take place, it's our belief that they could be materially scalable from where we're at today.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So 100,000 barrels is sort of what you think you could do this year, and that includes what you -- your materially scalable comment?","Gary D. Packer","I would say we could probably do an incremental 100,000 barrels this year and that's just in, basically, batch loads. Based on how that goes, we could scale it significantly over the year, yes.","Lee K. Boothby","I think, Subash, remember, we're limiting, within the next 2.5 years, within the constraints and the timing of the expansions we've already signed up for. So part of the scalability comment is kind of above and beyond and accelerating some of that inventory. Looking forward, it's going to take some time to develop those markets, but I think it's very encouraging that there's interest being expressed on multiple coasts today and we hope to be able to establish some outlets outside of Salt Lake City. I think that'll be net net positive for all of the -- our operations in the basin and, frankly, for everybody operating in the basin.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just hoping to dive into the Cana Woodford a little bit more. You guys reported a strong batch of well results this quarter. Of notice in that, that group of results, your 60-day rates were actually a little bit better than your 30-day rates. Just wanted to get some comments from you guys on why you think the declines have been so shallow in that play? Kind of what have you learned so far? That would be helpful.","Lee K. Boothby","Leo, thanks for reading the information, that makes the guys feel good. I think there have been a lot of people involved in the company pooling that information together and delivering results. Remember that we've been pretty clear over the last several months that in 3 of our key areas, we're utilizing control flowbacks, so we're not producing wells to maximize IPs, we're producing wells to maximize EURs and return. So with that, we're managing the drawdowns. Downhole, we think that gives us a much more effective stabilized completion and drawdown regime for the wells and should ultimately translate to what we're seeing in early returns, higher EURs and higher returns for the wells. So that would be part of the reason you'll see a higher later rate that you're just working through the math of managing the drawdowns.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So I guess, wanted to also get your sense on the Cana. Obviously, you guys have increasing lateral lengths there. You talked about some cost reductions in terms of drilling dollars per foot. Just wanted to get a sense of what the current long lateral well costs are right now, and I guess, you guys are hopeful that you continue to see improvements there, so just wanted to get a sense of where they are now and where you think they could go, eventually, here.","Gary D. Packer","Yes. As far as the long lateral wells, they're typically in about $11 million range, that would be in a southern gas area. In a development mode, we think we have opportunities to bring those down further. This is all in the area in the south. As we move to the north, we have an opportunity to remove a casing string. We've done that, thus far, this year, that brought -- drops out about $500,000 to $750,000 off of that, those wells are a little shallower, and we don't require quite the same casing program that we do in the south, so I would drop that roughly $1 million.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Amir Arif with Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just as you move from '13 into '14, I mean, your production growth profile that was laid out increases from 5% to 18%. Can you tell us if that is achievable with the current run rate of capital spending? Or does that require a pickup of drilling in your key plays?","Lee K. Boothby","The short answer is yes. It's achievable with our current run rates. And if you look at the 3-year plan, '13, '14, '15, I think the range of capital spend across that 3-year planning horizon was $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion, so you can assume it's about $1.5 billion a year. I think that's a key point in that 3-year plan, and I think that also is exciting because what we're seeing here, early in the year, play out or the gains in our operating teams around the portfolio translate through that 3-year plan because we're anchored on the de-risked portion of the inventory that we carried in into this year at the end of 2012. So I think we're in good shape to execute and execute it in range with the forecast CapEx.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up question, just on the Uinta, as you get new takeaway capacity there, will you get the differentials at that time, or have you locked that in as you locked in the new takeaway capacity for the region?","Gary D. Packer","We have no fixed contracts on the barrels that we're moving right now outside of the basin. So basically, we're floating with the market, and it's being priced similar to what we have in the basin. If your expectation -- if we enter into a longer term agreement that it would be a price premium to what we currently would see.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just on the rail issue, can you guys talk about what the cost is to rail that out? And I realize that you don't have contracts in place and, obviously, you've left the differential for the region, but could you just talk about what the cost would be?","Lee K. Boothby","No, I think it's premature to talk about the costs, I mean, we'll tell you more about the rail option as we get more information. I think the exciting part is, we're moving the barrels today, we're testing the markets and all of that will develop as we move forward. Gary, if you have anything you want to add?","Gary D. Packer","No, I just say, David, it's really net neutral to where we're currently at right now when we take into account the price we're receiving and the transportation. So it's really -- it's too early to tell. I look at these as kind of some test runs that we're making to see how it goes, not only for Newfield but also the refiner.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. I think, Gary, in the Uteland Butte, can you talk about the wells, I think, it's 11 wells you drilled, prior to the ones you released today, can you talk about what those look like at the back end of the curve? If they're holding up, et cetera?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, everything is holding up in those wells. They've -- they flattened out pretty well and as you see, I mean, we're, essentially, you see a similar phenomena here to what we see in the Cana. We're seeing 60-day and 30-day numbers about flat with each other, about 600 barrels a day, and I think that gives you a vision for what's taking place. In February, in our @NFX we put out some type curves and I'd say, the wells are performing very well with the type curves that we published there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the extended offset dates, you mentioned that you do plan to test some of the deeper benches in the Bakken later this year. Can you just talk about that? And what is your hypothesis on this potential across your Bakken acreage position?","Gary D. Packer","The -- we'll be testing -- excuse me?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A deeper Three Forks bench, sorry.","Gary D. Packer","Yes. We like the potential and while it's pretty preliminary for us, up on the Nesson Anticline, so I would say, in the areas of Westberg and Lost Bear, we see the second benches as prospective. We're going to be drilling a well here shortly that will target both the second bench, the first bench, as well as the Bakken and we'll be analyzing that for communication across all those zones and see how they perform. If the second bench test is perspective there, as I said earlier, we see those benches perspective across the entire Nesson. As we move off the Nesson, we see it, at least at this point, we see it less prospective, but it's early.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, thanks. And then just following up on the Uinta rail test. Can you just give us the chronology of kind of what to expect here? You're doing the rail test now, how long do those tests continue? And then, how long would the next step be, assuming the next step would be just determining whether signing a contract or -- I guess, give us the positive case, in terms of how you would get from these tests to future incremental production?","Gary D. Packer","Got you. Well, as far as where we sit right now, we have already backshipped the volumes that we spoke to in the @NFX publication. We are currently in discussions of moving a volume that could be up to 3x or 4x that and, with success in those negotiations, those volumes could start moving as early as May. We have adequate capacity and inventory as we currently spoke and this gives us some additional flexibilities to navigate the turnarounds that are currently taking place with the Sora. It will be premature for us to talk about how that translates into a longer-term agreement but that is certainly something that we are interested in, as well as the refinery [indiscernible]. So it's a -- but that is something that I would look for at the end of the second  and through the third quarter, for us to give more transparency on these additional rail options.","Lee K. Boothby","And Brian, I think it's important to remember that we've got all the refining capacity we need in place out through 2015. So think about the rail, it's either acceleration or it's growth beyond the planned horizon at this stage. So we'll keep you posted as the information comes in and we'll walk together.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","David Heikkinen","Your Uinta program and your guidance doesn't include any of the other outlooks, either rail or the pipeline study. That's not in your guidance. And then your current 2013 production, any volumes, that 100,000 barrels, that would be moved wasn't in the original target as well.","Lee K. Boothby","The volumes in terms of the 100,000 barrels a day, David, I'll remind you in the February call, we talked about inventory, managing inventory through the turnaround. So if that -- I wouldn't be thinking about that as an incremental volume just in terms of working through the barrels that we've got in the field today.","David Heikkinen","Okay. And then in the Eagle Ford, can you just get to the 7,000 barrels a day, are you basically just completing the 6 wells that are waiting on the pad, the completions are underway, how does that stagger, as you think into 2000 -- into the second quarter, how many wells you'll have waiting on completion and kind of same thing in the third quarter?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, we have a series of -- David, we have a series of completions all planned in pad sequence for this year. It looks to me as if we -- in the second quarter, we'll be bringing on approximately 16 new wells through pads that will be contributing to that. So it's not just the 6 that we've already drilled. As we head into the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, we see about another half dozen wells coming in. So in order to achieve the kind of -- this ramp-up that we focus, we've got quite a few.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Peter Kissel with the Howard Weil.","Peter Kissel - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe just one more on the Uinta rails here. Just curious to see what the current rail car availability looks like for the insulated rail cars? And how much of a bottleneck that could be to scalability that was mentioned?","Gary D. Packer","Certainly, it's a limitation today. We have the rail cars arranged to move the volumes that we've already spoken of in the batch -- in a batch mode. If we wanted to ramp it up more, certainly, it would be something that would have to be addressed. But we're not contemplating that at this point, our focus is on moving the volumes that we've already mentioned, as well as the optionality that we have in 2013 and it's my understanding that the rail cars are in place to do that.","Peter Kissel - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one other quick question on an asset that hasn't been mentioned in several quarters and that's the Arkoma Woodford. With the run-up in strip prices here, is there any point in the near future where you see that competing well for capital versus the 4 main areas that you've highlighted in the call, or is that still pretty far down on the totem pole?","Lee K. Boothby","I wouldn't say it's down on the totem pole, I'd say, it's HBP, so we've got that position all taken care of, it is dry gas. We've stayed away from having the conversations about a price trigger relative to activity. Although the run-up, we're certainly closer to the point where you can start thinking about investing there. But our plan is anchored on the 3-year horizon on the liquids plays and I would say that we've got a ways to go on gas before the returns on -- in the Arkoma, gas are going to compete with the returns that we're generating in oil today. Especially with the operating gains that we're seeing day-to-day.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rudy Hokanson from Barrington Research.","Rudolf A. Hokanson - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Quick question. Could you talk a little bit more about the prospects with the Wasatch wells, where you were talking about 5 -- I think you said 5, possible areas with the stacked lateral? I was a little confused about what you've been finding there? And if you could talk more about what the potential might be.","Lee K. Boothby","Rudy, I'll talk just very briefly about it and then I'll flip it over to Gary, because I think he's gathering a couple of facts for you. Remember the 50 wells that we talked about drilling, the vertical wells. So each one of those wells is drilled through the entirety of the 1,200-foot Wasatch section. On average, those wells have had about 6 completion intervals throughout that 1,200-foot section, so co-mingled completion intervals. So we know there's mobile oil from top to bottom in that 1,200-foot section, and we know that, that mobile oil was distributed across the entirety of that basin. And you can look at the maps that we've put out here over the last 2 or 3 months where they've got updates in terms of well activity to kind of get a feel for the scale and scope of that footprint. What Gary was talking about, as we've presently got 2 wells down that are under completion, which were our first 2 stacked laterals and they're shown on one of those handouts that we talked about. What Gary went on to say is that there are several horizons and it's 5 or more, if you want to think about it in those terms, that we would imagine being able to think about multiple stacked horizontal developments in terms of each one of those horizons through the 1,200-foot thick Wasatch section. But I'll flip it back to Gary, I think, he got some additional color.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, I guess the way we think about it, Rudy, is, over 1,200 feet, we have 26 mapped horizons. In those 26 mapped horizons, we can see 5 different target intervals where we think we can connect up to 5 in each one of those horizontal wells. That allows us to adequately drain the entire resource. So as currently as being talked about, when you think about the Bakken, with the Bakken targets, as well as the multiple benches in the Three Forks, it's very conceivable that you can imagine, on an upside case, where you could have multiple horizons in each one of these -- multiple horizontals, in each one of these 5 horizons. Now I'm painting a picture for an upside case, that you could easily see how you could be talking about 15 or 20 wells a section from a horizontal standpoint to adequately drain these resource. Now that number has not reflected any of the numbers that we've talked about. Even when we talk about unrisked resource in our February announcement, I think we were talking about 4 to 6 wells a section and that would be in the absolute upside. But as we get more and more information, this becomes a potential reality. What we're currently doing right now in the 4 wells that we've currently drilled, 3 of those wells have all targeted the same interval, and we like what we've seen from the 2 that have been placed on production. The fourth well has been drilled in a stacked perspective immediately above the horizon that we've historically drilled. So now, we're in the process of completing these wells, and we'll be able to monitor how they interfere or communicate with one another and drain that horizon. Based on that information, it would be -- we believe, it could be scalable to the other horizons. It's very early on, and again, as I referenced in the call or in the -- in our prepared remarks, the key to this is also getting the SXLs drilled, getting these long laterals contacting more area. We believe, with the information we've already accumulated in conversations we're having with the state this month, we believe we'll be able to get our first well drilled, SXL well drilled this year. Based on how that one goes, we'll attempt to make that scalable in 2014. So it's very early but we like what we see so far.","Lee K. Boothby","And Rudy, I would just think, very simply, the easiest way to think about this is the Wasatch, that 1,200-foot thick interval, is a 3D spacing problem, that's what we're trying to work through, is the 3D spacing.","Rudolf A. Hokanson - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","As a quick follow-up, as you work on this as soon as you drill, how are you using seismic to help you delineate what might be down there? I'm just thinking of all the advances going on with seismic and being able to read some of these things that are going on in various reservoirs. Are you increasing your use of seismic or is this still more of a using original information and then relying upon the engineering of the well right now?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, we've got 3D seismic data across most of the acreage in the Central Basin. We've got a team of people that are working all the high-end attributes and modeling across the basin, that's part of the value of having those 50 vertical wells, plus all of the data that we've got in Greater Monument Butte. And then we're also going to have microseismic data on the 2 stacked laterals that Gary just talked about, and that's to test both the vertical propagation of the frac, as well as the lateral propagation. So I think we're loaded up on the technical side and as data flows in, I think we'll build or refine it, and it will be part of the solution in terms of the 3D spacing challenge that I talked about in the earlier question.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan McSpirit been BMO Capital Markets.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You speak to the Cana Woodford becoming the company's largest producing asset. Does this mean or does that mean this play affords the highest rate of return among the 4 core areas, or is it simply more scalable than others at this point in time?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I think we're generating really attractive returns in all of the development areas today, and I think we've documented that fairly well. And certainly, we've been consistent over the course of the last several months in talking about the Cana Woodford, particularly, the wells we drilled down in the South Cana area, both in the wet gas window and the oil is generating some of the highest returns in the portfolio. But clearly, because of the scale and scope of our operations in the acreage footprint and, remember, the success that we had in '12 on derisking acreage, we're in a great position here to do what we said we were going to do at the beginning of last year, accelerate the development. So what you're seeing is the accelerated development in the Cana Woodford. We're able to move the volumes today there, but that's one of the advantages that we have with our portfolio is we can shift capital around between the 4 areas and balance out the needs at any given point in time. Today, Cana Woodford is carrying the freight and the other plays are generating nice returns as well, but it is a strong part of our growth engine.","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Got it, okay. And as a follow-up, can you give us the operator rig count for first quarter '13 across the different operating areas? What does it look like at year-end here, again, across the same operating areas? And forgive me if I'm overlooking this guidance in what may you have already published.","Lee K. Boothby","You're asking about our operated rig count?","Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Correct.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes, I think that information was provided in February, but for the one that we spoke, we plan on having 7 rigs running through 2014. So it's consistent with Lee's prior answer about kind of a flat capital program. So we're currently running 7 rigs and that's expected, we expect to run 7 rigs in '14 as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gil Yang with DISCERN Capital.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Could you talk about the stacked laterals? A lot of companies have talked about doing stacked laterals but it never really seems to take off as much as the promise. Is there a real advantage here? And what are the risks of pursuing that strategy?","Gary D. Packer","Gil, we've actually explored and drilled some stacked laterals already. We've already done this in the South Cana, for instance, where we've actually drilled laterals in a staggered fashion to minimize interference. And that's proven to be quite effective. We've also drilled stacked laterals in the Granite Wash. As you remember, as we were pursuing the Marmaton, Redford, Cherokee and so forth, those were also multiple horizons drilled within the same Granite Wash section and we've proven that, that to be an effective, accretive way to develop the asset. So -- and obviously, in the Bakken, it's currently taking place. And whether you want to argue about communication, there is a certain -- as we've always talked about, a certain desired amount of communication. But it's also about, as we drill these stacked laterals, just making sure we get adequate recovery of the resource that's in place. Some of it may be in acceleration, some of it's incremental. So I think we're just applying a development scheme that's already -- we've already utilized in other areas.","Lee K. Boothby","I think the thickness of the section, Gil, is the key when you're thinking about comparing the results between where various stacked lateral approaches have been utilized. And we've got over 1,200 feet a section here, so we're in good shape.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","And maybe I've misunderstood, you're not talking about stacked laterals out of the same vertical board, you're talking about just stacking laterals out of separate vertical boards?","Lee K. Boothby","No, separate individual wells. So the only -- a part of the stacked laterals at that the horizontals are going to be stacked in the section.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay, got you. All right. So there's no effort to put multiple laterals into the same vertical bore?","Lee K. Boothby","We have no interest in increasing the mechanical complexity with multi-laterals out of a single well bore. Not what we're talking about.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","All right, that's sort of what I was thinking. Second thing, with the Bakken savings, do -- you cited $900,000, maybe you talked about this in detail earlier, I missed it. But the $900,000 savings facility, is that repeatable per well, or is that on the first well you can somehow do some savings?","Lee K. Boothby","The savings part was in the execution form at a  field level. The $900,000 that you're talking about, I think, is a facilities and artificial lift -- completion in our -- facilities, infrastructure and artificial lift cost associated with the wells here. So you've got to drill and complete plus facilities costs and we're giving you both sides of that equation. Gary, do you want to add there?","Gary D. Packer","No, I think that addresses it.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay. So the $9.8 million that you cited was the all-in well cost, including the facilities fees?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. We've historically recognized that a lot of times when our well costs are being compared to some of our competitors, that the facilities costs are being left out of some of the numbers. So we wanted to provide you the transparency in the breakdown between facilities and total well costs. So we are clearly seeing advantages this year that we had not even anticipated as we entered the year through additional efficiencies in what is a rather mature play for us. But then we're also providing you the extra clarity on the facility piece of that.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Jack Aydin with KeyBanc.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","One question, MDU is building a refinery in the Rockies. Are you talking to them? And trying to lock in some supplies to that refinery? Or could you give us a color on it.","Lee K. Boothby","Jack, I'm sorry, but it broke up when you were talking, we didn't hear who you were referencing.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","MDU.","Gary D. Packer","Yes. I'm not familiar with that refinery, Jack, and so I can't really comment.","Lee K. Boothby","I guess, I'd like to thank everybody for tuning in this morning. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress after the close of the second quarter. Thanks for your investment and interest in Newfield. Have a good day.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir.","Lee K. Boothby","Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter and year end 2011 conference call. I'm joined in Houston this morning, our Chief Operating Officer, Gary Packer; our CFO, Terry Rathert; and our VP of IR, Steve Campbell. Following today's brief prepared remarks, we'll be happy to address your questions. ","Our call today will focus on 3 main topics: First, a summary of the fourth quarter financial and operating results and our 2011 highlights; second, I'll discuss our year end 2011 proved and probable reserves and how the shift to oil that we've been presenting since 2009 is evident in our results. And lastly, I will cover our simplified game plan for 2012. Our focus is clear and I'll summarize our planned activities and capital plans in our key oil and liquids-rich plays. ","So let's go through our fourth quarter financial results.","Our net income, excluding the impact of the FAS 133, was $127 million, or $0.95 per share. Our results were below first call consensus primarily due to lower natural gas volumes and an increase in our DD&A rate, partially offset by higher oil volumes. Our increased DD&A reflects our ongoing shift to oil. Revenues in the fourth quarter were $677 million. For the quarter, oil and liquids comprised 40% of our total production and more than 70% of our total revenues. Our shift to oil began 3 years ago and we are well on our way to becoming an oil company in 2013. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $387 million or $2.87 per share. ","In the fourth quarter, our oil and liquids liftings averaged nearly 64,000 barrels a day. They increased about 9,000 barrels a day, or about 15% compared to the third quarter of 2011, and totaled 6 million barrels. When compared to our first quarter 2011 oil liftings, our fourth quarter oil sales were more than 30% higher. We are achieving strong growth from our oil plays and we will continue to focus both our people and capital on these plays in 2012. By design, our gas production is on natural decline. This the right economic decision with today's weak natural gas prices and we are making no investments in dry gas today. Our natural gas production in the fourth quarter was 44 Bcf, or 478 million cubic feet, per day. Our gas production declined about 20 million cubic feet over the course of the year. ","We had some great highlights in 2011 that will set us up for outperformance in the future. Let me run through a quick list. Through several transactions in 2011, we captured approximately 75,000 net acres north of Monument Butte in Uinta Basin and expanded our dominant position in the region. We are the 800-pound gorilla, with more than 230,000 net acres in the basin and a potential to develop multiple new and exciting oil plays, both vertically and horizontally. We secured our future in the Uinta with signing of 2 agreements, a 7- and 10-year term, with 38,000 barrels of oil per day in refining capacity for our Uinta Basin oil growth. We assembled more than 125,000 net acres in the Cana Woodford play and Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and then yesterday's release disclosed this as our stealth play. We invested approximately $100 million in leasing in 2011 to extend the Cana Woodford south and east of the known fairway and expanded our composite footprint in Oklahoma's Woodford Shale play to about 300,000 net acres. Our technical people did a great job of identifying an opportunity to extend this play to the Southeast and our land professionals moved quickly to capture it for us. Our acreage is not in the dry gas portion of the play. We've identified a liquids-rich and oil-prone extension to the Cana and we are expecting strongly competitive returns from our investments. We have a long and proven history in exploiting the Woodford formation in Oklahoma and have a very aggressive assessment program planned for 2012, which I'll discuss in a few minutes.","We commenced production from 3 new offshore developments, 2 in Malaysia and one in the Gulf of Mexico in late 2011 and early 2012. These new developments added about 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net of new production. We refined our asset base and sold $710 million in nonstrategic assets in 2011 and early 2012, an additional $18 million in sales will close the coming weeks. This is a program that we will continue as we work to build the Newfield of the future, and focus our people on the best return projects in our portfolio. ","Yesterday, we also disclosed year end proved and probable reserves for 2011. Our optional reporting of probable reserves makes us somewhat unique in the industry. Internally, we are managing our company on a 2P basis and believe that our disclosure provides greater transparency on the reserves over time. At year end 2011, our proved and probable reserves totaled 6.5 trillion cubic feet equivalent, a 5% increase over 2010. Our probable reserves showed the depth of our inventory for future growth. Of our 2.6 trillion cubic feet equivalent of probable reserves, about 42% meet the technical definition of proved but simply lie outside of the 5-year development window. Therefore, they're technically classified as probable per SEC guidelines. Our emphasis on oil is reflected in our reserve report. We've increased the oil and liquids component of our reserves to 40% of total proved reserves. Our 2011 proved oil reserves increased nearly 30% over 2010. Our natural gas reserves declined 6%, representing our continued slowing of natural gas investments in the coming years. ","Proved reserves at year end 2011 were 3.9 trillion cubic feet equivalent, up about 5% from the prior year. In yesterday's release, we provided proved reserves for the last 3 years to help with your comparative analysis. For 2011, we organically added about 860 billion cubic feet equivalent of new proved reserves and acquired about 50 billion cubic feet equivalent. We sold more than 120 billion cubic feet equivalent with our ongoing nonstrategic asset sales program. These sales generated more than $400 million of proceeds in 2011. ","We replaced more than 400% of our 2011 production with proved and probable additions and more than 300% of 2011 production with new proved reserve additions. About 45% of our proved reserves are undeveloped and about 55% are proved developed. With our continuing increase in oil reserves, the present value discounted at 10% of our proved reserves grew more than 20% to $6 billion after-tax. If you have any additional questions on our reserves, we'll be happy to address those at the end of today's call. ","Before moving to or 2012 game plan, let me provide a quick update on our nonstrategic asset sales program. Each of our Domestic business units has contributed and there were more than 40 individual transactions that comprised the $728 million in total realizations. In early 2011, we set out on a path to refine our asset base. By selling nonstrategic assets, we were able to reallocate both people and capital to higher valued projects and assets that we see as an important part of our future. There are some detailed tables in last night's release that show the impact of asset sales on our production by division. The largest transaction was the $276 million sale of about 23,000 net acres in the Williston Basin, located West of the Nesson Anticline and our Catwalk area. We sold current net production of about 300 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 8 drilled and uncompleted wells. This sale allows us to focus our development drilling efforts on high-graded areas in the basin. I'll talk more about our increased Williston Basin activity levels in just a moment. ","In early 2012, we announced that our Gulf of Mexico assets were now nonstrategic to our future and announced plans to explore options to capture the most value. I'd like to spend the remainder of today's call on our 2012 game plan. It will be an oil-focused program and our activity levels will only revolve around a few key assets. As I said in our last conference call and on the road recently, we're executing a simplified game plan in 2012 and we are confident that we can deliver on our key goals and expectations. From the macro perspective, our short-term view on natural gas is pretty negative. In recent years, our industry has discovered massive natural gas resources. Although most of the industry is shifting to oil and liquids-rich drilling programs, there's a tremendous amount of associated gas and, even with our weak economic backdrop, U.S. natural gas supply remains strong. 24 months\u2019 strip price for natural gas is has fallen 25% since late October. Our shift to oil began in late 2009 and since that time, our oil and liquids growth has a CAGR of 20%. Our transition to oil has not been easy and we are accepting declines in our natural gas fields.  We are executing this transition to oil with a careful eye on the balance sheet and we work diligently to sell nonstrategic assets and deploy the proceeds towards lucrative oil plays and necessary debt repayments. ","In a given calendar year, a $100 million investment in our natural gas portfolio would provide twice the production growth from an equal oil investment, but with today's disparity in oil and gas prices, the cash generation from the oil investment is nearly 2.5x that of natural gas. We are focused on one overriding product, cash, and delivering sound returns for our investment decisions over the long term. I am confident that our 2012 game plan will further our transition to an oil company and lead to improved returns, higher revenues and strong cash flow production growth per share. Our 2012 capital budget will range from $1.5 million to $1.7 billion. This is down approximately $400 million from our investment levels in 2011. As we've done over the last 3 consecutive years, we plan to live within our internal resources. We've used a combination of cash flow and nonstrategic asset sales to maintain a strong capital structure. Our expectation is that natural gas prices will remain challenged in 2012. With that outlook, it is prudent to limit investments and accelerate our transition to an oil company, a target we fully expect to achieve in 2013. In the second half of 2012, we expect that more than 50% of our production will be from oil and liquids. Substantially all of our total budget will be allocated to oil and this program is expected to grow our oil and liquids production by more than 20% in 2012. Due to reduced investments in natural gas, our gas production is expected to decline up to 15% in 2012. Our production guidance is a product of making sound investment choices in 2012 and ensuring that we position ourselves for stronger oil growth levels in 2013 and beyond. Our goals in 2012 are to maximize our revenues, cash flow per share, improve upon our per-unit of production operating margins. For all the reasons referenced, absolute production growth is not an emphasis for us in 2012, and we expect that our production will range from 290 to 300 Bcf equivalent or flat to slightly higher than 2011 pro forma for asset sales. You will see in our first quarter guidance that we've deferred approximately 2 Bcf of gas production through curtailments and deferred well completions in the Mid-Continent. We may also elect to curtail, shut in or defer additional natural gas production should prices further deteriorate.","Our largest investment areas in 2012 will be the Uinta and Williston Basins, the Cana Woodford and Malaysia. I'll provide a brief overview of these programs before closing the call and taking your questions.","Our oil production in the Uinta Basin is expected to grow more than 20% in 2012. We will allocate over $500 million into the Uinta Basin of 2012. To date, we've drilled 9 horizontal wells in the Uteland Butte and 17 vertical wells in the deeper Wasatch. Our results to date are consistent with our expectations and we have an aggressive assessment and development campaign planned in the region in 2012. These new plays, along with our Green River development at Monument Butte, provide strong returns and will add significant value for us in the future. In 2012, we expect to drill up to 65 wells in the Central Basin. This includes up to 30 horizontal wells with an emphasis on our pressured Uteland Butte play, along with horizontal assessments of the Black Shale and Wasatch intervals. Our first pressured Uteland Butte well is drilling today and completion is planned in the coming weeks. Our first horizontal Wasatch well will spud in March with results expected late in the second quarter. These plays will accelerate our oil growth and drive our transformation to an oil company. We expect to run 7 to 8 rigs in the Uinta Basin in 2012, with 4 to 5 allocated to the Central Basin. We've reduced our historic 4 to 5 rig count in the Monument Butte Field, Green River targets to a planned 3-rig program in 2012. We are focused on driving outsized oil growth from this asset and our new refining agreements give us the visibility we need to double our production levels out of the Uinta Basin by 2015.","We will invest about $200 million in the Williston Basin in 2012. You'll recall that our activities in the basin slowed in late 2011 to ensure that we limited our budget overexpenditures. We deferred the completion of about 17 wells and dropped 3 rigs. Since then, we sold a package of the assets, which included 8 of the uncompleted wells. Our crews have completed 3 wells since January 1 with an average 24 hour IP of 2,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Plans are to have the remaining 6 wells completed before mid-year, and we expect to run 2 to 4 rigs in the Williston Basin during the course of the year. Our current production is about 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and is expected to grow about 35% in 2012 compared to 2011 levels.","In 2012, we expect to drill about 25 new wells in the Williston Basin. Our drilling is focused on identified locations in the Middle Bakken and Sanish\/Three Forks across our acreage. We have about 60,000 net acres in core development regions along and southwest of the Nesson Anticline and an additional 40,000-acre position, all held by production in the Elm Coulee. We have more than 250 identified development drilling locations today and plan to increase our activity levels in the Williston Basin going into 2013. ","Let's move on to our newest area, the Cana Woodford, where we plan to invest about $300 million to rapidly assess our new acreage in the Anadarko basin. We call this play stealth throughout 2011 as we assembled a 125,000-net-acre position.","From a pit perspective, this new area is great. From a proven operator in Oklahoma and in the Woodford where we have drilled more than 375 horizontal wells to date, our new acreage has scale of thousands of potential locations and running room. We have great relationships with service providers, and it can compete for the services we need in Oklahoma. Regulations in Oklahoma are favorable and we can get the necessary permits we need in a timely fashion. And lastly, this play has both oil and liquids rich gas, which will keep the economics competitive within the best of the Newfield portfolio. We are ramping to a 7 operated rig program in early 2012. Our rapid assessment, pending success, will put us in a position to further increase activity levels into 2013. This play has potential to drive material future oil and liquids growth for Newfield. We've drilled a few wells in our acreage to date and are encouraged with the early returns. In addition, we have interest in a few industry wells on and around our lease position that have also been very positive. Consistent with our previous disclosure in new drilling areas, we will wait until we have adequate production data from a sampling of wells before we discuss our results publicly.","It would likely be midyear before we are in a position to provide you with a meaningful update. In Malaysia, we are seeing record gross production today of about 70,000 barrels of oil per day. And today, we're the fourth largest producer in the country and the third largest producer in the Malay Basin. These are material oil developments to Newfield, and to our partner, Petronas. Our projects in Southeast Asia are all oil. For 2012, we will allocate about $235 million internationally, with approximately $135 million to Malaysia. The remaining $100 million will be for the development of our Pearl Oil Field in the Pearl River Mouth Basin offshore China. Our first production is expected in late 2013 or early 2014.","Our net production today in Malaysia is a record 30,000 barrels of oil per day, 1,000 barrels of oil per day higher than reported last night with early and good news this morning. Our people in Malaysia continue to outperform and we're really excited about the potential looking forward. Our Malaysian crude trades at a Brent price and we are seeing excellent returns from these oil developments. We will accelerate development of our Malaysian producing fields and test new oil and natural gas exploration prospects in 2012. Our East Piatu field came online in November and is today producing about 12,500 barrels per day, higher than our earlier expectation of 10,000 barrels per day.","We have recently accelerated Phase 2 development well campaign, which will allow us to keep production at maximum rates. The Puteri field commenced production in October and is today producing about 8,000 barrels per day. Our exploration efforts in Malaysia are ongoing with some exciting oil and gas exploration wells planned for 2012. Recent positive changes and deepwater PSE terms, deepwater natural gas PSE terms, provide compelling investment options in our portfolio today. In addition, we continue to seek new opportunities in Malaysia to ensure future oil growth.","In the Maverick Basin in Texas, we plan to invest about $100 million in 2012 and run a one-rig drilling program. We're drilling our second Super Extended Lateral in the Eagle Ford today, and our first well is now being completed. These wells are part of a planned 4-well pilot program of SXL wells in 2012 on our southern acreage block. In addition, we will be testing prospective targets during the course of the year in the Austin Chalk and drilling oil wells on our Georgetown play in northern Maverick County. In closing today, let me summarize our focus in 2012.","Our efforts will be laser focused on growing oil production and reserves. Our oil and liquids production in 2012 is expected to increase more than 20%. This growth will come from our ongoing success in the Uinta and Williston Basins, Malaysian oil developments and initial volumes from our new liquids-rich Cana play. Success in the Uinta Basin and Cana Woodford will lead to material reserve bookings at the end of 2012 and set us up for superior growth in high-value plays in 2013. We are taking the right steps today for our future. We will continue to improve our organizational focus. Focus was one of Joe Foster's sounding principles for Newfield and we will not stray. The success of our nonstrategic asset sales program is helping us allocate people and capital to the best projects. Focusing on fewer activities will help lead to superior results in our operations. We will continue to live within our means and align our investments with internal resources. We have ample resources to grow our oil projects and expect that our nonstrategic asset sales will continue. We will manage our balance sheet, and as always, maintain a strong capital structure. We will not lose sight of the future and will continue to build the people and prospects for the future. We've made significant investments in Team Newfield over the last 3 years and our recent expansions into exciting new areas like the Central Basin in Utah and the Cana Woodford in Oklahoma help to ensure that we have the plays in our portfolio today for our future growth. I'm excited about 2012 and confident that we are executing the right game plan to continue creating long-term value for our shareholders. Operator, we'll move to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And ladies and gentlemen, we'll go first today to William Butler with Stephens.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could specify on the Woodford Cana, a little bit more on the counties that you all are in.","Gary D. Packer","Yes. The Canadian and Grady Counties, which would be specifically the areas east and southeast of the historic Cana field.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. So would you be primarily east of there of where Continental has got a big acreage block? Does that sound about right?","Gary D. Packer","I think Continental has the lease position across the entire play. So I really couldn't speak to that. But I'd say, east and primarily southeast of the historic Cana field.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And did you all \u2013 and I hope I didn't miss this, but did you all disclose, in terms of what you all are expecting oil and NGLs cut-wise on a percentage basis?","Lee K. Boothby","We did not.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. Would you like to?","Gary D. Packer","We have no plans to talk about that until we feel we have fully assessed the position. We're drilling wells across the acreage and once we have our arms around that, we'll be able to bring it forward. Clearly, it's targeting both oil as was referenced in the call, as well as condensate gas and NGLs also play part of that, of course.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. Thank you. As we start thinking about 2013 and the things you all are doing to position yourself for that, how should we think about the growth for the year?","Lee K. Boothby","We haven't put any growth numbers out. Obviously, for 2013 at this point, I would say that let us execute our plans during the course of 2012. I expect that sometime around midyear, we should have a basket of results that we can talk about in terms of how it sets up the back end of 2012 going into 2013. But ultimately, our objective is to navigate forward with an oil-driven growth profile and get back to where we can deliver double-digit growth driven by oil. I think that transition from a gas-dominated production mix and oil-dominated production mix will take a couple of years. And on the back end of that, we'll be back to the game plan that we've been talking about over the last couple or 3 years. Again, oil-dominated production, oil-dominated reserves.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one last question. As you all think about gas curtailments, what other areas besides the Woodford and the Granite Wash would you all consider further curtailments if you did?","Gary D. Packer","That's really the area, William, that's where most of our natural gas is coming from and that's where we'd focus it.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Will this be further curtailments in those areas then, switch it?","Lee K. Boothby","That's correct. We have -- some of it's associated with capital programs and completions of wells that are natural gas focused that we're rolling out of 2011 into 2012 and some of it will just be relative-to-zone margin gas. The other part of it would be just deferred gas as we look to step into completions and we probably have broader shut-ins than we otherwise would have to do in order to ensure the effect of completion of offset wells.","William B. D. Butler - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what gas price and for and sustained for how long would you all -- are you all considering further curtailments?","Lee K. Boothby","I would say at this point, we don't have a specific target price. I mean, clearly, we've said if gas prices deteriorate further, I would say that if gas prices fall below $2, you might see some dramatic adjustments at that point. Where we sit today, I think that the game plan is pretty well set. We'll accept the decline on our gas assets because clearly, they are cash flow positive, covering operating cost. We just won't be investing any new capital in gas projects.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Kistler with Simmons & Company.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Real quickly, looking at your potential divestiture plans. Can you talk a little bit about whether you'd consider selling additional Bakken? And then, on the opposite side of that, are you looking at any potential acquisitions to bolster oil production growth, whether they'd be corporate, asset specific, leasehold, i.e. more acreage at Cana Woodford, just kind of give us a sense of each side of that equation?","Lee K. Boothby","Okay. So on the first side, I would say we have no additional plans to divest Williston Basin assets. We've described those as bridge assets. We've got a strong development inventory and we're looking to ramp up activity there. So I'd say that's not on the short-term target list. The only thing that we've announced at this point, Dave, is that we're going to pursue options to maximize value of our Gulf of Mexico assets that could involve divestiture or a number of deal terms, trades, et cetera. We are going to be open to any and all of that, but in the end of the day, it's going to be about maximizing value on those assets and that could mean that we produce out the producing fields. The only thing we've stated there is we have no additional intention, no intention of drilling exploratory wells, prospectively, and no material capital allocated to the Gulf of Mexico in 2012. So I think that's the only thing that we've kind of flagged for consideration in 2012. Beyond that, we still have additional assets that are more appropriately, I would say, described as part of our past as opposed to part of the future, and we'll continue to consider opportunities to shed nonstrategic assets in lieu of repositioning our human assets in terms of higher priority projects. In terms of the leasing or acquisitions, clearly, we've said publicly that we think that the current environment and environment we'll likely will see over the next couple of years likely will favor some M&A-type activity. We intend to keep our toe on the water, if we find opportunities to strengthen the portfolio at attractive prices, we'll probably take advantage of those opportunities. But clearly, not going to target any of the areas that we're specifically focused on in that regard. Beyond that, in terms of leasing, I would say that we've got no outsized leasing plans afoot starting 2012. But obviously, we'll continue to add acreage where it makes sense as long as we can get the acreage at attractive prices and it fits with our overall strategy.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. Thank you. And then, just looking at your reserve revisions, you had some negative revisions associated with a number of different things: waterflood responses, higher gas production cuts in part of Monument Butte, some well failures on the Gulf Coast. Could you give us some additional color on those? Is this a onetime cut or is there potential that these have additional downside related to them?","Terry W. Rathert","Dave, I think you got the list right and most of those are onetime, I will say that we gave some geographic descriptions of where some of those were along the Gulf Coast. We've had some historic well bore fayers [ph] and some really old wells and wells that have been pretty active, I call it, geologic section. We think those are pretty much behind us as they've continued to diminish over time. The vertical wells we referenced in Mid-Continent in a couple of areas we had some old vertical production sections that were opened over very large sections and they saw the effects of horizontal completions offset. With the relatively low pressure in today's gas prices, it doesn't make sense to go back and try to bring them back online and do the workovers necessary to return to production. So they're almost an artifact of what you think of as a price revision, de facto that they saw some offset well interference. In the Greater Monument Butte, yes, there is waterflood timing issues in terms of recognition and in the other areas you mentioned, we tried to extend the field to the Northwest and we encountered an area that was, we believe, influenced by the Duchesne fault in the region and put a little more gas in the section than we would otherwise seen. That additional volume of gas basically made them more gassy and not as attractive to continue to drill in that area. So we've directed our activities away from that and maybe, I'd ask Gary to expand on the fact that we recognize that today and we've actually moved our activity in the Rockies away from that region and he can address our plans for drilling there.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, Dave. As we encountered more gas to the northwest to the field, this is really -- it's not in the Central Basin, but it's outside of Greater Monument Butte-Eunice. Made some gas wells and the fact of the matter is, is historically, you would have been able to blare some of this gas. Regulatory changes have prevented that. Therefore, we kind of flooded our infrastructure with the natural gas which caused some back pressure that cost us to not want to drill there anymore, or at least temporarily. So as we've redirected our activity, you'd see all of our Green River activity has been redirected into our 20-acre infill drilling within Monument Butte proper. We'll run about 3 rigs there this year, and we're having good success in that, and that's really where the Green River will be focused. Their rest of the drilling campaign up in the Central Basin, which is really where a lot of the growth is going to be in our future.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","That's helpful. On the waterflood timing issue, is that something where once the response is achieved would you actually see a positive reserve revision from that?","Gary D. Packer","That would be my expectation, yes.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, just looking over at the service cost environment, up in the Bakken, I know you guys looked at some of the folks who, when you were in not -- in a non-operated position and the well cost there, can you give us kind of updates of your cost and the cost that you've experienced in non-operated positions as well?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, we -- I haven't updated that look that we made, Dave, of the non-op position. I can tell you what our view of it is.  Right now, we're looking at somewhere in a kind of a low $10 million well cost for a 1,280-acre well. That's maybe upwards of about $1 million lower than what we previously had talked about. There's a couple of things. I think just improved execution is going to drive most of that versus service cost changes and in 640-acre wells, we\u2019re going to be looking at somewhere around $7 million well or so, in that vicinity.","Operator","We'll go next to Subash Chandra with Jefferies.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Hypothetical here, but when do you think you would go after that Tcf-plus gas probable inventory, at what gas price would you renew activity?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, Subash, I'm going to guess probably not $2.50.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I hear that loud and clear. But do you think is it a 5 number or a 4 number. Any flavor?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, we're going to be consistent on our answer with what we said previously. We've got plenty of attractive oil investments in the portfolio and to pursue gas investments, the gas investments have to have competitive returns with our oily portfolio. So you either have to see oil come back dramatically on price or gas declines. So you close of the gap between the 2 product types. That'll really make the gas inventory attractive. Most of our gas assets are held by production, so the fact of the matter is, we can sleep good at night and we're not going to lose the leaseholds. The only issue you'll see is what you've seen the last 3 years, you'll see as we move oil into the 5-year window and push gas out, you'll see that repositioned into the probable reserves. The bigger issue, I think short-term, on the overall reserve issue is, what is the SEC price going to be at year end 2012, and what are the result and impacts there in terms of reserve classifications? I think that's something for you to keep your eye on.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Could you provide maybe a boundary of what type of PUDs, dry gas PUDs remain at risk in the 2011 reserve report if it was to get pushed out of the 5-year window?","Gary D. Packer","I think you for the most part, most of our gas PUDs have been pretty well been moved out of the 5-year with window as demonstrated by our capital plan. We have no plans to drill gas wells in 2012 and that pretty well holds true through that 5-year window, so almost all of our gas PUDs are already out there as a practical matter.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And in the Cana, just not on operational results, of course, but how much, how many rigs do you think you'd need to run to retain the acreage?","Lee K. Boothby","We've looked at that and based on the current acreage position we have right now, we could, as we entered this year, we had 2 rigs, we've got 5 rigs running now. As alluded in the call, we'll be -- we would anticipate 7 by year end. We could get to 10 rigs and that will allow us to hold the entire 125,000-acre position.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So 10 rigs. So you would hold that in the current year, or --","Lee K. Boothby","No, we would --","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Over what time frame?","Gary D. Packer","Subash, I think that was about 3 or 4 years, that's a combination of drilling. It's not just drilling 5,000-foot laterals. This year, we'll be expanding our lateral lengths. So there certainly has to be an element of expanded lateral lengths in order to accomplish that.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, so the Super Extended Lateral, that has to be applied for on a case-by-case basis, and do you think that there just might be statewide approval of that at some point?","Gary D. Packer","I think some of the recent legislation opens the door for that. And I think we would anticipate broader application for the Super Extended Laterals.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of selling a material-producing asset like the Gulf, how do you think of that shrinking to grow, so to speak, versus the 10 Bs or so that you've sold in 2011?","Lee K. Boothby","I think we would think about it in terms that we've described. It's a value proposition. We can hold those assets and take the cash flow off of those assets and redeploy them over time, or we can find an attractive transaction or series of transactions that allows us to maximize value and then reposition to take the capital and redeploy it into other areas and the people and reposition on the higher priority projects. But I think it's just a more visible manifestation of what we've already done during the course of 2011 with our nonstrategic asset sales. I think that's the key with the Gulf, that we\u2019re deeming it nonstrategic.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. And a final one for me, what are these Malaysian IRRs on a per well basis, perhaps or project basis?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, by the nature of the PSC terms, you're kind of capped out even at the higher oil prices. I'd say we're typically looking, we did a look back here recently and we were north of 30% returns on a project like East Piatu, but you probably struggled to get much over 35%, I would suspect.","Operator","We'll go next with Gil Yang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk about the natural gas exit rate versus 2011's exit rate? Is it going to be down 20%, 25%? Is that a reasonable assumption?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, natural gas, you\u2019re talking about for '12?","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. The exit rate.","Lee K. Boothby","In '11 versus exit '12?","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes, we said that the natural gas volumes will likely decline up to 15%. So I think you'll be inside of a 15% decline rate. 60% of our production last year was natural gas on a 300 Bcf total, so you do the math on it. I'll let Gary give you some other color.","Gary D. Packer","Yes, I think our fourth quarter numbers were about 44 Bcf, Gil, and first quarter we're sitting at 39 so that's down about 10% or so. A lot of that's going to be driven by just the timing of completions. As you know and as we've talked about publicly, we made a considerable drop in operational activity in the fourth quarter. That lack of completions in drilling then follows through. That bow wave hits you in the first quarter. And as we put rigs back to work, and get back to a more normal state of operational activity, that number will grow generally. But its 10% quarter-on-quarter.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But does the 15% reflects the volumes for the entire year versus the volumes in the entire year of 2011?","Lee K. Boothby","Year-over-year.","Gary D. Packer","That's correct.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Can you comment on the DD&A rate, took a sort of jump in the fourth quarter and understandably it's because the oil is more of the focus. But given that, Lee, you said that the transition's been going on since 2009, is there anything in particular that caused the jump in the fourth quarter? Is it because of the Asian production came online and that carries a heavier DD&A rate, which I see in your guidance it does. Is that part of it?","Lee K. Boothby","I'll let Terry take that one since he's in the middle of all that.","Terry W. Rathert","Yes, if you break it into the pieces, you have a international DD&A rate, which is clearly much higher than the domestic part of when you bring that production into the mix. It has a heavy influence on the domestic front. It shifts to continued investment in oil. At $2.50, that's still, if I did my math right, in the range around $15 a barrel. So when you think about the DD&A rate is going up, it\u2019s a matter of fact that, that and the fact that if you go back 3 years, we had full cost ceiling test write-down when natural gas prices and oil were very really low. We had this big, deep reset of our cost pool at levels which absolutely were not sustainable because of the then current way the full-cost ceiling test rules worked. And you just expect that to continue to change as we go to oil, we'll continue to move up.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. Lee, you mentioned the idea of focus of the company and can you talk about your longer-term strategic view. You mentioned that you might do some other acquisitions again in new areas. Can you talk about how you think about the long-term focus of the company given that you got Uinta, you got Bakken, you got now the Cana, Eagle Ford, Asia, maybe a new asset. Where should we be thinking about the strategic long-term focus of the company going?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, Gil, we've said publicly over the course of the last few months that our objective, over the next 3 to 5 years, is to expand our foundational asset portfolio. So we've had 2 foundational assets that we've talked a lot about the last 4, 5 years, Monument Butte Field, which is a Green River story, Green River oil sands story, and the Woodford Shale. The Woodford Shale positions largely natural gas, we've expanded that position with the Cana, I'll come back to that here in a moment. Focused on wet gas, condensate and oil, which I think will improve our mix in the Mid-Continent Region. And then the Central Basin, we took steps in 2011 to materially expand our acreage north of Monument Butte, added north of 75,000 acres to go into the position that we already had there, to take our total position up north of 230,000 acres. The Central Basin expansion provides a whole new opportunity set to us relative to what we've had historically in the Uinta. And we're excited about that, and we're accelerating our horizontal testing in multiple horizons but we're going to attack in the first half of '12. So ideally, we've got the 2 foundational assets we've talked about. We believe the Central Basin could be a third piece of that puzzle and I would say that I hope that the Cana Woodford could be another piece of that puzzle in that regard. But ideally, 3 to 5 years out, we'd have somewhere between 4 and 6 foundational assets and that's what we spend all of our time talking about and focused on. We put out the logic that the balance of our development inventory, which hits on a number of the projects that you talked about, Williston Basin, historically, Gulf of Mexico, Southeast Asia, our developable portion of the Eagle Ford today, et cetera, et cetera. We look at them as kind of bridge development assets and it's kind of bridge to the future. They're attractive assets, good returns, but they've got less than a 10-year development inventory. So the key for us is to manage that activity within the context of our capital program. We'll look at the some of those areas for potential growth towards the foundational assets and in some of those areas, that may require taking advantage of acquisition opportunities at various points in time to expand the portfolio. So, I think it's going to be a mix of activities. But overall, I think about foundational assets and the bridge assets being a bridge to the future.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great, Lee. Final question, going back to I think one of the previous questions. At what price gas would it be drillable? If you just kept oil the same, understanding it needs to be competitive with the rate of return, but could you just give us an idea of either what that rate of return is today that you would need to gas to get to be competitive or at least what the gas price is to get to that rate of return?","Terry W. Rathert","I would -- kind of shooting from the hip here a little bit. But I would think if we saw service costs in the area of the Woodford that are not heavily influenced by the oil price around them, where there's more normal pressure pumping cost, we observed in the past, we're in the $5 range then this things could be moving right back on top of the radar screen and be highly competitive. Because it's almost, it's just pure margin, right? I mean, in essence, you take at 250, you can't get compelled to do much of anything in natural gas almost anywhere. The reserves have a positive value to us at year end pricing, they're just beyond the 5-year window. You move the pricing up $1 and it becomes a pure dollar profit and cash flow. And any other thoughts?","Gary D. Packer","Well, I think the most -- my first thought there, Gil, was is if we saw improved gas prices, we'd just have higher discretionary cash flow and we would move to drill more oil, quite honestly.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, right. But at some point you'll say maybe I can drill more gas and it sounds like maybe $5 is a point where that happens if costs come down maybe 20% or something like that?","Lee K. Boothby","If you put it in return space, we've well documented the returns from our oily portion of our portfolio, Gil. You can do the calculation yourself. But you're going to need 35%, 40% plus returns to compete on a return basis on the back end of our oil assets. So it will just be a function of what can we generate out of the gas investment versus the back end of our oil portfolio.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Anne Cameron with BNP Paribas.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","You've described your asset sale program as a desire to reinvest in your existing inventory. Where will, if you manage to sell the Gulf of Mexico this year, where will those cash proceeds go?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I think, quoting Gary's response a moment ago, we'll look to utilize those assets to accelerate development in our oily portfolio. We hope that with success on our aggressive assessment programs in the Uinta and the Cana Woodford that our -- the oil development inventory is expanding. We know we've got the ability to expand activity in the Williston Basin today. So we've got places that we can take that. We're actually doing some tests in the Maverick Basin of Super Extended Laterals, pilot project success there. We can go and attack that project as well. So we've got multiple projects in the portfolio that we can attack and we've got development projects overseas in Southeast Asia that are oil as well. So we've got plenty of places to reallocate that capital that would be realized from any divestiture.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","I guess I was actually just asking where will the first dollar go, which play, between them?","Lee K. Boothby","Okay, well I, sorry. I guess I give you a really long answer. I'll let Gary give you a short answer since he directs where it goes.","Gary D. Packer","I guess I'd have to say today that the first dollar, we'd probably bring into the Bakken. It's not because it generates the highest returns, it's that, right now, we have some pretty material assessments going, and I'd like to see some were activity and more results from the Central Basin, the horizontal program, as well as the Cana program. But the Bakken and in the other area I'd put more immediately is our 20-acre infill play at Monument Butte. It generates superior returns, it's well understood and our, on our regulatory and our permitting environment is improved. So those 2 areas where we'd take incremental activity sooner than others, sooner than the others.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Okay. Great. And are you still leasing in the Cana at this point?","Lee K. Boothby","I really couldn't comment on that right now.","p id=\"142743717\" name=\"Anne Cameron\" type=\"A\" \/>","Okay, okay. So if 10 rigs are what you need to get to hold your position there, what do you think the max, like from a logistics perspective, what's the max rig count on 125,000 net acres you have that you could run?","Gary D. Packer","Yes, I mean, historically we've got up to 17 rigs running in the Woodford Shale. The team did a great job, but that's running pretty hard with the teams that we have in place. As I said earlier, 10 rigs running through 2016 allows us to hold our position, assuming it stays where it is right now. So somewhere in that 10 to 17 window is probably a feel good for us, a sweet spot, so to speak.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then the 198 Bcfe negative performance revision on your reserves, would you be able to quantify how much of that is proved developed and how much of that is PUD?","Terry W. Rathert","The majority that would be proved developed is you had a wellbore failure as the majority of the wells were producing, obviously, if you had vertical wells were on production were adversely affected, that would be producing. We moved, I think, the note showed that we moved 87 Bcf of proved and undeveloped reserves beyond the 5-year window. That clearly is the largest piece of the proved and undeveloped.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","And that does the 5-year rule count towards the negative performance revision, or is that, just fall into a bucket of like other negative revision?","Terry W. Rathert","Well that's where the revisions  go. So when you move them out, so that goes into that line because you don't have another -- you don't have the 5-year rule category line on the -- so we bump it into that revisions number.","Anne Cameron - BNP Paribas, Research Division","Is it part of the 198 that you outlined as the negative performance revision?","Terry W. Rathert","No, in the line item that you see in the description, it is not part of 198. It's part of the total revisions.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the Uinta Basin, can you talk to your capacity for growth on oil production until the downstream contracts that you've signed come online? And then when those contracts do come online, should we think about that incremental barrels a day as the upper limit for your capacity for growth or should we expect additional unlocking of downstream capacity?","Lee K. Boothby","I'll give you a high level and I'll let Gary fill in the details. First and foremost, I would look at the contracts that we have in place to give you comfort zone visibility of expected growth profiles out of the basin on the low end of the scale. So if you think about exiting 2014, it will be my expectation of a 40,000-barrel a day minimum, low end of the range. If you took the existing arrangements that we have in the basin with other refineries outside of the longer-term agreements, we've got another 10,000-odd barrels that we move today so you're looking at 40,000 to 50,000 barrel a day if you just utilize these agreements and keep existing arrangements in place. Getting to a 50,000-barrel a day type number in 2015 gives you a 2x growth rate over a 3-year time horizon out of the basin. And clearly, I would say that Gary and his teams probably won't be satisfied with stopping at that point, but I'll let Gary give you any additional color.","Gary D. Packer","Brian, I guess the only thing that I would add is that those contracts allow for the initiation of additional capacity as early as 2013 and there's a ramping of activity that comes along with that. So I would look for it as a pretty much a steady growth rate in a 20% to 25% this year. I would look for, in excess of that in 2013, which really sets the table for what Lee was referring to, is something of 40,000 to 50,000-barrel a day rate in '15 and beyond.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Thanks, that's helpful. And then looking at the Granite Wash, how much of the shift and the redirection of capital away from the Granite Wash would you say is gas price related or for CapEx constraints in the context of your portfolio versus is related to either inventory or resource visibility reasons and maybe you can touch on the commodity price environment you'd allocate back there as well?","Lee K. Boothby","Let me see if I got your question. If I didn't, try again. But I think the first part of that question is that obviously, we've tested multiple horizons in the Granite Wash. We've talked publicly that the shallow horizons are high Btu and high condensate yield and they've generated attractive returns. That still true today, and on a $2.50 gas, the returns have diminished over the 35%, 40% returns that we're talking through most of 2011. The way that I would look at it near-term is we're taking the rigs that we've had deployed in the Granite Wash, and were moving them to the Cana Woodford in the short-term. Gary has repositioned the rigs there for the assessment program that's going to be a pretty aggressive effort in the first half of 2012. And again, that's focused on wet gas condensate and oil targets that we believe will generate superior returns. So that's what we're pursuing and that's the most notable part of the shift in terms of rig count. And clearly, the deeper portfolio in the Granite Wash the doesn't have the condensate yield, I would put that on the to-be-deferred-in-the-future discussion, and we have no interest in pursuing at this time. We don't have to. Our position's held by production.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for our question-and-answer session today. I'll turn it back over to Mr. Boothby for closing remarks.","Lee K. Boothby","Operator, if there's anybody still there, well, we've got time for 2 more questions.

Our discussion with you today will contain forward-looking statements, such as strategic initiatives and plans, estimated production and timing, drilling and development plans, expected cost reductions and planned capital expenditures.","Although we believe that expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, they are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risk. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors and risk, some of which may be unknown. Please see Newfield's 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause actual results to vary. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of today's date, and unless legally required, Newfield undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with Newfield's earnings release and any other applicable disclosures, are available on the Investor Relations page of Newfield's website at www.newfield.com.","Before turning the call over to the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lee Boothby, please let me provide a housekeeping request. [Operator Instructions]","Mr. Lee Boothby, you may begin.","Lee K. Boothby","Thank you, operator. Hello, and thanks for your interest in Newfield Exploration. We appreciate you dialing in this morning.","I'm joined in Houston today by Gary Packer, our Chief Operating Officer; Larry Massaro, Heir Apparent for Chief Financial Officer; Terry Rathert, our Chief Financial Officer for most of the last 20 years and Founder of the company. And we'll be answering your questions at the end the call.","First, we're going to go ahead and divide today's comments into 3 segments: We'll first summarize the year-to-date highlights. You'll see Newfield is executing very well in domestic focus areas and we are on course to deliver on the 3-year plan, which we initially shared with you in February; Second, Larry Massaro will cover our third quarter financial results and provide some thoughts around the capital structure behind the execution of our plan; and then third, Gary Packer will provide operational updates from each of our domestic focus areas.","In yesterday's release, we introduced a new resource play in our own backyard in Anadarko Basin called \u201cSTACK\u201d. This play adds thousands of new potential drilling locations and expands our visible inventory in an area that we have a proven operational track record. We're very excited about this significant expansion of our position in the Anadarko Basin.","So let's start with the summary of the year-to-date highlights. On October 22, we signed an agreement to sell our Malaysian business for $898 million. We expect this transaction will close in the first quarter of 2014 and we plan to use the proceeds to continue to accelerate our domestic liquids growth and reduce our short-term borrowings. This transaction is the first of 2 that will ultimately divest our international businesses and transform Newfield into a North American focused resource company. Today, we are increasing our expected 2013 production for the second time this year. Our 2013 production is now expected to exceed 48 million barrels of oil equivalent. Domestic production will be about 40 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our total capital investments will total about $2 billion this year when we include the Anadarko Basin acquisition that we announced in August.","We're delivering operational efficiencies. We recognized that top-tier resource companies must constantly strive for better margins, higher cash flow and improved profitability. Our Williston Basin and Eagle Ford programs have performed very well with achievement of lower cost. In less than 2 years, the SCOOP and \u201cSTACK\u201d Plays in the Anadarko Basin are expected to go from a start-up to more than 31,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day early in 2014, and nearly 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net by the end of next year.","We're demonstrating drilling and completion efficiencies in all of our key plays. In addition, we've expanded our drilling inventory. Today's announcement of \u201cSTACK\u201d play adds thousands of new perspective oil locations with the potential for strong growth and returns. As a result, we will add an 8th operated rig in the Anadarko Basin next week. In addition, we have advanced our learnings in the Central Basin of the Uinta, the fewer days to depth in our recent SXL wells and strong initial production numbers. Our Patterson Well in the Wasatch IPed at over 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross from a 3,200-foot lateral, a record Newfield well in the Uinta Basin.","Our recent accomplishments have created certainty around our 3-year plan, which was rolled out in February of 2013. Today, we have year 1 nearly behind us, and have even greater confidence in our ability to hit our corporate level targets. We intend to deliver on our promise of doubling liquids production from our 4-key plays by the end of 2015.","We believe that having several resource plays in which to invest is a competitive advantage, and allows us to seamlessly ship learnings in capitals to the plays that provide both certainty and solid returns. At the same time, we continue to advance new plays that build visible future inventory.","Later this week, we will have our annual strategy session with our Board of Directors. The work product from this meeting will confirm our 2014 through 2016 plans. As a group, we will determine the best use of capital and fine-tune our investments for our plays to ensure we deliver on our stated production forecast and capital spending plans. Following board approval, we intend to share the details with you before year end.","Several weeks ago, we announced the planned retirement in August of 2014, of our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Newfield Founder, Terry Rathert. As many of you know, Terry has worn many hats at Newfield, and his leadership has been instrumental in Newfield's success over the last 25 years. His successor will be Larry Massaro. Larry joined us about 2.5 years ago and has been leading our Corporate Planning and Strategic Efforts, including our international divestiture.","I'll turn the call over to Larry, to cover our third quarter financials and provide some color on our financial strategy. Larry?","Lawrence S. Massaro","Thanks, Lee. For the third quarter 2013, we earned $0.70 per diluted share, excluding the impact of special items detailed in our release. Remember that our international businesses are classified as discontinued operations and earnings from those businesses are reported on a separate line on the income statement. Our $0.70 per share in earnings, include $0.47 from continuing operations, and $0.08 from discontinued operations. Earnings from discontinued operations were lower by $0.15 per share as a result of our previously announced purchase where our outstanding preferred shares involve our Bowl High Bay [ph] assets. This transaction was done to simplify the sale of our China business, and we expect a corresponding increase on our proceeds from the sale.","Our third quarter revenues were $675 million, including $189 million from the discontinued operations. Cash flow from operations before working capital changes was $403 million. Our volumes in the third quarter are more than 600,000 barrels equivalent above guidance, with more than 1\/3 of the additional production coming from our new \u201cSTACK\u201d play.","We produced just over 12 million barrel BOE in the third quarter. This includes 10.4 million BOE from continuing operations, and 1.7 million BOE from discontinued operations. We are on track to grow our domestic liquids more than 40% year-over-year, adjusted for asset sales. In addition to meeting our production expectations, we also met or exceeded our original cost guidance. For example, our 2013 domestic LOE forecast stated on a unit of production basis is now expected to be more than 10% below the mid-point of our original guidance.","For the fourth quarter, we expect production to total about 12.4 million BOE, which will include about 1.9 million BOE from discontinued operations.","Let me talk for a minute on our financial structure and how the planned sales of our international businesses will be used to fund acceleration of our domestic businesses. We expect to close the sale of our Malaysian business in the first quarter of 2014. Proceeds will be used to pay down our credit facility and restore its full capacity of $1.4 billion.","As previously stated, our forecast 2014 investments will still exceed cash flow, although by a lesser amount than 2013. We will fund the 2014 plan similarly and expect that our China sale will offset the deficit and again, restore the facility later in the year. Longer-term, we will focus on improving returns and margins and driving towards free cash flow. We will maintain our financial strength so that the featured discretionary spending can be focused on building, drilling and inventory.","I'll turn the call over to Gary for the operations update.","Gary D. Packer","Thank you, Larry. Our teams are executing very well, in 2013. We're building strong momentum as we enter 2014. I'll provide you with some summary comments on our key liquid developments in Williston, Eagle Ford and Uinta and reserve most of the time for our SCOOP and \u201cSTACK\u201d plays.","So let's get started with the Williston. Our net production was 13,400 barrels of oil equivalent a day, well ahead of our guidance of 11,800. We expect that our Williston production will show year-over-year growth of about 40% in 2013, compared to our original growth forecast of just 15%. Our continued performance in the Williston relates to better performance from existing wells, faster drilling times, which lead to more wells drilled during the year and earlier first production followed by -- following fracture stimulation and completions, basically reduced cycle time. Our completed well costs year-to-date have averaged $8.7 million per 10,000-foot SXL and our well cost includes $800,000 in artificial lift and facilities.","Our 2013 wells are costing about $2.6 million less than a comparable well in 2012. We completed 17 new wells in the Bakken during the third quarter, with initial average initial gross production rates of 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day and about 570 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the first 90 days. In addition, we recently completed a well in the second bench of the Three Forks, our Anderson 10H well. This well had an initial gross production of about 1,775 barrels of oil equivalent per day and a 30-day average of about 620 barrels of oil equivalent gross. We believe that at least 1\/3 of our development acreage could be perspective for development of multi-zones beneath the Middle Bakken.","We are operating a fourth rig -- 4-rig program in the Williston today, dominated by multi-well pads and SXLs. Our early planning for 2014 envision similar levels of activity and continued production growth.","In the Eagle Ford, our activity in West Asherton is in full development mode. During the third quarter, we brought on line 20 new wells, and lateral lengths range from 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The real impact from the new wells can be seen in our fourth quarter guidance where we are expecting average net production of more than 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","And here's a summary of our Eagle Ford highlights. Third quarter net production averaged 8,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We expect our full year production will increase about 70% over 2012 levels. For 2014, net production is expected to grow about 30% year-over-year. Our average gross completed well cost year-to-date for a 7,500-foot SXL of $7.3 million. And we expect to drill 36 wells in 2013 and about 20 wells in 2014. Our 2014 program will include 7 wells in the operated portion of our Fashing field in Atascosa County.","Let's move now to the Uinta Basin. Over the last several months, we have collected a significant amount of new data in Uinta, specifically in the Central Basin. This new data has helped to reinforce our view of the resource potential in the basin and we continue to advance our learning curves and work toward lower well cost in Uinta development. Our investment levels and growth outlook in the Uinta Basin will be determined by available refining capacity, the evolving regulatory environment, and the allocation of capital to the projects with the best returns in our portfolio.","And let me quickly address each of these topics. First, let's talk about refining. In the third quarter, our Uinta Basin net sales averaged more than 2,000 -- 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, lower than our forecast of 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our sales were once again negatively impacted by unplanned refinery downtime. Fortunately, the out-performance we have seen in other focused areas more than cover this shortfall. Again, this is the advantage of having multiple focus areas to invest our capital.","As we plan for 2014 and beyond, be assured that our investment levels in the Uinta Basin will be timed to match available growth in refining capacity and our ability to sell our production. As I mentioned in recent months, we've been experiencing refinery interruptions that affect our sales, and there's an interesting graph in @NFX that helps to eliminate this impact. As you know, we've signed agreements with both HollyFrontier and Tesoro that adds about 20,000 barrels of oil of new capacity in the basin by 2016. Over the last year, our sales have been impacted by both planned and unplanned refinery interruptions. Until we have better visibility that these projects are advancing timely, we will modify our plans accordingly. As a result, over the last 2 months, we've been shifting capital to the Anadarko Basin, our SCOOP and \u201cSTACK\u201d plays provide superior near-term returns, and we maintain our Uinta inventory for long-term growth as our leases are held by production.","The second item relates to regulatory environment in Utah. We are working with state regulators to mend field rules, to allow for the drilling of the optimal future well and spacing. Utah is a pro-business state and they understand how SXLs improve returns and reduce environmental impact. We recently received approval to drill 2 incremental density pilots and 3 1,280-acre DSUs in the Wasatch, giving us the ability to drill additional SXLs in 2014. These pilots will test a multi-well stacked pad development concept. In our @NFX publication on Page 18, we've included a graphic that depicts the multi-well potential in both the Uteland Butte and the Wasatch formations.","The final priority I want to reference is the optimization of our drilling and completion operations. Our recent well results are greatly improved and show the advancement of our learning curve. In @NFX, you can see the results of our recent Uteland Butte SXL wells, which have doubled the initial production of our SXL -- our XL wells and averaged about 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross. A third SXL well in the Uteland Butte is in its early days of flow back.","In the Wasatch, we recently completed our best well ever in the Uinta Basin. The Patterson XL had an initial gross production of more than 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and this is only a 3,200-foot lateral. We estimate that our 5 short lateral wells drilled to date have an average EUR of about 500,000 barrels equivalent. In late November, we plan to spud our first SXL in the Wasatch. We are confident that SXL wells are the key to unlocking the ultimate economic potential of this basin like they have elsewhere. With the ability to shift capital efficiently through our portfolio, we have options today to deliver on our stated corporate growth objectives, improve the certainty of our projections and manage through any of these uncertainties.","Let's move now to the Anadarko Basin. In yesterday's release, we disclosed a new resource play in the Anadarko Basin. Since catchy play names seem to be in, we reference ours as the \u201cSTACK\u201d. The play was recently expanded through the 70,000 net acre acquisition closed in the third quarter. \u201cSTACK\u201d denotes the \u201cSTACK\u201d nature of this new oil resource play combining 2 plays, our North Woodford and our new Meramec Shale plays. There's a graphic in @NFX that defines the stratigraphic column and depicts the 700-foot of oil saturated interval that we are exploiting. The primary producers are the Meramec Shale and the slightly deeper Woodford Shale. However, there are other perspective formations across our acreage as well. The Meramec is a Mississippi in age [ph] shale that lies directly above the Woodford. It ranges in thickness from 275 feet to 475 foot across our acreage, and has comparable porosity to the Woodford and permeability is significantly greater in the Meramec. While Mississippi in an age [ph], this play should not be confused with the lime play further to the north.","We now have more than 225,000 net acres in the Anadarko Basin. This includes more than 170,000 net acres perspective in the Cana Woodford, and more than 150,000 acres in the \u201cSTACK\u201d. To date, we have drilled 7 SXL wells in the \u201cSTACK\u201d, in which 3 of these wells are in the Meramec. All of the wells results can be seen on Page 9 of -- in NFX. Our Meramec wells have been very encouraging with initial gross flow rates averaging more than 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 70% of the production is liquids. These are great early results in a new resource play with initial wells delivering solid rates of return.","The pipe curve for our \u201cSTACK\u201d and SCOOP place are very similar. These early returns will only improve as we have shown time and time again that we can improve margins by lowering development costs, optimizing completions to enhance both production rates and EUR. This is an oil play and we will be testing additional intervals and spacing in 2014 to determine our optimized plans. Our new acreage requires us to drill wells over the next 2 years, to hold the acreage by production and therefore, we have been shifting capital into the region. Next week, we will add an 8th operated rig in the Anadarko Basin, and we're planning to run at least 2 rigs in the \u201cSTACK\u201d in 2014. We will have more to share with you by mid-2014, and be able to more accurately communicate our ultimate resource potential that enhance drilling inventory. This play has the potential to add thousands of drilling locations to drive our liquids great -- growth well into the future.","Our third quarter net production in the Anadarko Basin averaged 22,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or about 3,700 ahead of our guidance. This was related to the early completion of some new multi-well pads and altering our own operated stimulation plans. We expect to beat our 2013 net production target for the Anadarko Basin of 7 million barrels of oil equivalent. We have 2 new pads coming online late this year, and expect a significant bump in production yielding a first quarter 2014 average of 31,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day net. The Anadarko basin has quickly become our largest producing asset at Newfield. We are extremely excited over Anadarko Basin's program and its ability to drive corporate growth levels.","In closing, fun facts in our SCOOP program our 2013 wells in the SCOOP wet gas averaged over 1,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day in gross initial production, and our 30-day and 60-day average rates are the same at more than 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 22% of the production is oil over the first 60 days.","In our SCOOP oil play, recent wells have had average gross initial production of more than 1,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and averaged nearly 1,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day over their first 90 days, more than 50% of this production is oil. These are all outstanding wells.","I'll turn it back to you, Lee, for closing comments.","Lee K. Boothby","Thanks, Gary, and thanks again to all of you for joining us this morning. In today's updates, I hope you can sense our excitement around our 2013 results and our outlook for the future. We are focused on delivering our results and making the final transition to becoming an on-shore focused resource company. Through the remainder of this week, we will be reviewing our strategy with our board and discussing the various scenarios that we have to deliver on our desired outcomes. We have options through the deep inventory of liquids drilling projects that we have in our portfolio. Using these options, we will select the best path forward to build value for our stockholders. I look forward to providing you with our outlook for 2014 through 2016 prior to year end.","At this time, we're happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Subash Chandra with Jefferies.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So first, I guess, on the Meramec versus the Cana, is there a way this time to calculate oil in place by the 2 separate targets?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, we said in the call script, we've gathered some substantial core data. We've got core through the entirety of the section, our team's not yet had a chance to access all of our data, they are in the lab being worked through. So I think the final -- we are fine under those numbers, will take place through the balance of this year. And soon as we can get into a place to give you some more color on the several [ph] resource, which I'd expect sometime early next year, we'll put that out in the form that you can digest. But at this point, reference the call, we've got 700 feet of oil column. We've successfully tested 2 of 5 or more horizons in that 700-foot interval with 10,000-foot laterals. Those wells on a composite basis, the first 7 wells out of the sheet in the play, are generating returns in excess of 35%. I mean, that's exciting. When you think about what we've shown that we can do in terms of switching learning curves down, and I think we are off to a great start. And, I think, we've got a really bright future ahead in this play. And certainly with the 700 feet of oil saturated section, there's a lot of resource here to be worked.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay as a follow-up, Lee, I think, previously, we had talked about North Oil using -- that term having 20,000 acre position initially to work and develop. Any further thoughts on that, what the prospectivity now could be after these Q3 results?","Lee K. Boothby","I think if you go to the @NFX publication, we've actually shown the acreage block and it's, obviously, substantial. When you look at the distribution of the 7 wells, they test a block of acreage that's about 10 to 11 miles by 10 to 11 miles. So, we've got a sizable portion of the total acreage block that's already been tested, and we'll continue to expand that with wells we have planned through the end of this year and early into the next year. And I think from a de-risk standpoint, I don't have a firm final number, but I'd say we're probably at a point where we think we've probably de-risked something like 30% of the acreage somewhere and that's good [ph].","Subash Chandra - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. So 30 to 150.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with RBC Capital.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question on the pending China divestiture. Is that something you think likely you can get announced this year? Any guide you can give us in terms of timing as when you think that might come here?","Lee K. Boothby","Yes. We're working on that right now trying to get clarity around our Pearl development. As you know, the -- we have had to go do some of those additional inspections around the insulation process. And so once we get that, we give clarity to potential buyers and kind of hopefully get that process wrapped up in 2014.","Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, just in terms of your new \u201cSTACK\u201d play here. Are you guys seeing other competition out there from other operators? And do you think there's more acreage that's available that you guys could potentially capture in both \u201cSTACK\u201d and SCOOP?","Lee K. Boothby","Well. I would say that, obviously, it's been a hot play and I think that -- I got to take my hats off to our team for what they have done in building this 225,000-plus net acre position. Relative to the \u201cSTACK\u201d play, we've quietly chased that acreage for well over 2 years. And I think the announced acreage position that we added in August really cored up that area. And at this point, with 150,000 acres, and average working interest of around 60% across that acreage position, we are very excited about the potential there. And clearly, our team continues to look for opportunities, since we are actively drilling, we're likely to continue to take up interest through the pooling process in Oklahoma, but we don't have any other large-scale leasing programs underway at this time in that area.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys just talk about the -- I don't know what the depth goes from in your slides, goes from 8 to 9 to 11,000 feet as far as the \u201cSTACK\u201d. Can you just talk about the general geology of what's your space in the Meramec as far as North to South, East to West that type of thing?","Lee K. Boothby","Sure, David. I mean, essentially, I think the biggest thing we need to be clear about is how Meramec sits in space to your point. The Meramec sits between the source rock, which is really the Woodford Shale and the Meramec does have some self sourcing. But it's all sitting under a seal that Chester Shale, and I think, it's Slide 7 of the deck that's out there, we show a cross-section. This is a bit of a surprise for us, quite honestly, when we drilled our early wells targeting Woodford, we expected to see a limestone in there much further down depth from the chuddy [ph] lime or the chat [ph] that you see much further to the north near the Kansas border. We ended up finding the Shale there, and we took some core and we're quite excited about it. It's really a silica-rich, calcareous shale. We took the core, got excited about it and ultimately drilled our first well, which turned out real nice for us. So as you take this play further to the north, ultimately what happens is you lose that Chester seal that's on top of it, and you end up without a cap to it, and then that's -- it's much shallower, slightly under pressure. And then the bugs [ph] that were played up there on really some small kind of stack [ph] traps up in the lime play, is how that differs from the play that we are pursuing, which is really a much heavily fractured shale formation, much like the Woodford itself. Now the play does extend further to the East, but again, they have a lot of well control out there and we've already alluded to, we've already determined kind of where we believe the sweet spot is at this play, but ultimately, it's going to take more activity to ultimately firm it all up. But I would expect, and as we already alluded to -- the well results look very, very similar. We're looking about somewhere between, ultimately, 800,000 barrels or 1 million barrels. That's awfully strong. With the returns that we have, we're really encouraged.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up. How should we think about, and whoever wants to take this -- I know you said you've been chasing this for a couple of years, but when you guys issued your guidance, I guess back in February for '13, '14, '15, do you have any of the \u201cSTACK\u201d built-in here or was it just more of the SCOOP in the forward guidance?","Lawrence S. Massaro","No. The only thing we had at the time that we did that would have been the Woodford targeting, the Woodford portfolio. We didn't build any of this into the inventory.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Amir Arif with Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just first question just on the Meramec. I think the IPs are showing little cuts of 70% and 90% but you're talking about 40% on the EUR. Do you have enough -- do you have some production history for the EUR numbers? Or is that just your initial estimate based on the number of wells you have right now?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, remember there's a 2-product phase and a 3-product phase number, so when you look at well test, we are quoting essentially liquid barrels with a separator and then raw, rich gas. When you look at 3-phase product strain, you're converting a portion of the gas strain to NGLs, it's just simple math. If you go back to the 2-product strain, you can see that the liquid yields in these phase are very, very strong at 70%, 75% on the early pull back, when you convert a portion of the gas strain to NGLs and you change in total mix. That's a 2 [ph] product strain.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. As a follow up, can you just tell us how many wells you have tested in the Meramec by year end '13 and then by year end '14, based on your drilling plans?","Lee K. Boothby","I think there's 3 more -- I'll let Gary -- Gary's looking through his notes, but I think we'll have 3 more between now and year end. Obviously, part of the 2014 start into discussions with the board we've got a notional plan. It was time but we're going to have to wait til we get the final approval. Any color on that Gary?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. We'll probably have in the Meramec by year end 2013, we'll have production history on 3 wells, we'll probably have 5 drilled. And as we head into 2014, ultimately, the decision will be made on the fly as we're seeing more results. With 2 rigs running up there, we ought to be able to drill somewhere around 20 wells or so, targeting both the Meramec and the North Oil. And I would suggest right now, it's probably equally split between the 2 plays.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gil Yang with DISCERN.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","It's been great getting results. Can you just talk about that SCOOP oil curve and versus the results? I mean, that well -- the well results are substantially above that curve. Is there -- were you pumping that so that it's running above the type curve and should fall back down? Or is there just sort of an early indication that maybe your curves way too conservative?","Gary D. Packer","Well, I hope it's the latter, Gil. The reality is down in the SCOOP areas as you head east to west across the play, you really change faces pretty rapidly as we go from the wet gas to something that's -- to the oil-oil [ph] and then something in between. So as we look to bin these wells in the different categories, sometimes you end up juicing the overall decline based on just the mix of wells that we place in there. So I think some of that is what you're seeing. That said, I think generally in recent activity over the last quarter or 2, we are seeing performance across the board in SCOOP higher than the type curves of what you see represented in the deck. And we'll be looking at that very closely and I would anticipate revising that number up a little bit, but that's maybe a little premature. We still -- our result is obviously using the controlled fallback technique consistently and we are seeing better EURs over time as we lower that.","Lee K. Boothby","The other thing to remember, is that year we gave you the best shot we had with the data that we had at year end '12. We've been drilling these wells and accumulating the data. Those type curves were built for a much broader total area for the play. And we'll take the data that we've got and we'll revise on this, as we see the technical data giving us a push in that direction.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if I could sort of paraphrase what you both said is that the actual 7 SCOOP oil well's may be in a somewhat gassier part of the play so they're a little bit more productive on average, than that type curve was built before?","Gary D. Packer","So, the gassy oils are in the wet gas portion of the play. It's possible that a few of the wells as you transition, you could have some wells that are more gassy than the oil wells and therefore, that's what you're seeing. But as I said, I believe we will see the type curve navigate higher overtime. But you're sitting there and those wells today are probably 70% returns and will only get better from there.","Lee K. Boothby","If you look at the @NFX publication, they've laid it out, actually show you where the wells are and what the liquids mix is on Page 12 or SCOOP oil and Page 13 of that presentation is the wet gas. You can see the distribution of wells and where they're at. Clearly, the SCOOP oil wells have -- are consistently higher oil yields from the 2-phase basis and I haven't added it up to get an average, but it looks like the average is somewhere around 50% or a little bit higher, and those 7 wells are part of that curve. But it clearly, very, very oily.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","My second question is just on page -- regards actually Page 17, you show that nice ability to move barrels via rail, if the local refinery capacity cannot take the barrels, I think? If I'm interpreting that correctly. If that's the case, have you explored just the idea of rather than being confined to the basin, just what's the opportunity cost of actually just moving -- railing the balance out and foregoing necessarily selling to the local market?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. We've been looking at all these options for quite a while, Gil. Yes. I mean, we moved 250,000 barrels out this year, and the frustrating part from our perspective is in addition to that, we've still built our overall inventories by an additional 65,000 barrels. And that's led to some of the reallocation of the capital trying to marry our production growth with the inventory growth. And your question is, is that we looked at it? And the answer is certainly yes. As we sit here today, we have 2 contracts in place that are ultimately going to leave us 38,000 barrels of contracted barrels in the basin. I would expect over time, what we'll see is that our production is going to far exceed the contracts that we currently have in place. And as we get better visibility of that, we will look to move more of the barrels outside the basin and that's likely going to be via rail. So still being worked. We need better visibility in all this. And yes, it is something that we considered a great deal.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the \u201cSTACK\u201d play, you mentioned an @NFX that you're planning to assess the lower Meramec, and then also what the right spacing is next year. Can you just add some insight into what your hypothesis is on both of those?","Gary D. Packer","Sure. The lower really only means that it's older. And as you cut across the play, as you can see from the diagram that's in there in Slide 7, there is some section in there that we haven't tested yet. We're very excited about it, we just haven't got around to it in the wells that we are drilling so we would expect that it would perform similarly to what we already have. But we haven't put a bit into that lower section. As we already referenced, it's quite thick, and -- but we're very optimistic for that. The other portion to your question is on spacing. That's a good question. As we've seen in the South more recently, we've had spacing pilots of 5, 6, and 8 wells per section. The 5 and 6 well spacing units we operated and the 8 was operated by another party. Our first observation was is that we thought 5 was going to be a little tight. Then we got onto our most recent branch pad, it's 6 wells per section and we're seeing them perform extraordinarily well. So I would say 6 is probably a place that you'd say maybe is the high side, but that's only in 1 interval. What really remains to be seen in the Meramec, is how many different levels that we can target in both the Meramec and in the entire \u201cSTACK\u201d play in the Woodford. So it's very possible that you could end up with somewhere between maybe 4 and 6 wells per section, so you got to really think about it as multiple horizons across the entire area. So there's a diagram in there, I believe, that demonstrates some in the Uinta. And by analogy, I think, you can kind of see what we're thinking, much -- very similar to what's been discussed in the Bakken and the first and second benches of the Three Forks. That's a concept that we think applies very well here.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful color. On a more big picture question, the assets held proceeds from the international certainly helped the balance sheet here. To what degree are you willing or planning to kind of dip into those proceeds in terms of spending and cash flow in the coming years versus balanced CapEx and cash flow?","Terry W. Rathert","Yes Brian, as I indicated, our goal is to bring everything back into balance. But certainly, looking out next year, there's going to be a deficit. We don't expect that to be as large of a deficit we see this year. And between the 2 asset sales, that should more than cover the proceeds we need to kind of restore the fall [ph].","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisor.","David Heikkinen","Looking at the \u201cSTACK\u201d and kind of as you get into the details of development, can you go through third quarter and fourth quarter just number of wells you completed both in the SCOOP and \u201cSTACK\u201d? And then you said you have 2 pads that are going to be completed at the end of the year. Just wanted to get into those specific details.","Gary D. Packer","I don't have any -- as far as the quarterly activity, David, I can't really provide that to you. I'd just suggest you get with Steve later on and he'll provide the details to you.","David Heikkinen","How many wells do you have [indiscernible]","Gary D. Packer","We have 3 wells on production currently and I think those were all well illustrated in detail in there.","David Heikkinen","3 in the Meramec...","Gary D. Packer","In the Meramec and then we have 4 on the Woodford. So those are all illustrated in the @NFX. As far as the timing of those, I think we had 2 of those wells very early in the year, and the third of the Meramec wells was later in the year, early third quarter.","David Heikkinen","And then for your development type curve, you show how many days of flat production do you think while you're kind of draining that production network?","Gary D. Packer","It looks like it's somewhere around 50 days or so. I really wouldn't think about it a drained list [ph], the fracture network. This is something that we induced through the choke to really hold these wells back. And then ultimately, the purpose is as you described; it's to allow the frac to close in a more controlled fashion. There's probably a lot more to it than that, but probably 50 days or so.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Nelson with Citi.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Starting there, to play sort of devil's advocate, you had a very clear acquisition price of about $900 per acre for those assets, you did mention in your prepared comments that there were some HBP requirements? I'm just wondering if you could sort of shed any light on what makes -- how to have made that an apples-to-apples per acre comparison what the value might be there?","Gary D. Packer","Well, from a value standpoint, I'm not quite sure what you mean on an apples-to-apples comparison. I mean, we look at -- the acquisition price was somewhere in the $600 to $900 an acre. We've accumulated acreage in that position in grassroots leasing prior to making the acquisition that we did. So as far as...","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, I guess what I was trying to get at is if the acreage was expiring. I imagine you're going to pay the teller [ph] a lot. So HBP requirements sounds very reluctant [ph] to that acquisition or in general?","Lee K. Boothby","Let me back you up here and help you to think about the acreage a little differently. We drilled the well, acquired port data, had proprietary information that no one else has and we bought the acreage at a very attractive price. That's the way to think about the \u201cSTACK\u201d acreage. It's an exciting play. We had an opportunity where we had proprietary acreage -- technical data and we took advantage of it.","John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then I guess sort of a bigger picture follow-on. You've seen consolidation activity in both the Eagle Ford and the Williston. And obviously, you'll bring in a tremendous amount of investor proceeds through the international sale, but I'm wondering if you thought about potentially monetizing those assets and also further accelerate development in the Anadarko Basin?","Lee K. Boothby","Well, I think we've proven over the last few years that we are willing to move assets for the right reasons at the right time. I mean, prior to the Malaysian announcement, we had over $1 billion in the preceding 2 years, so we'll have divested nearly $2 billion to accelerate this transition to onshore North American resource play company. I think the assets we've got, we've been clear, we like. We're excited about the results that we're generating on these plays, and we've also stated that we continue to believe that we have any optionality to move capital amongst 3 or 4 different development programs is a real benefit relative to planning and certainty and outcomes in that regard. But we'll continue to look for opportunities to maximize the value of our assets. And along the way, somewhere, or someplace and sometime, I'm sure we'll have something else that we divest or acquire. But right now, we have nothing else on the block.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","With the Meramec, you mentioned that it was very permeable. How permeable?","Daryll T. Howard","You got me there.","Lee K. Boothby","John, it's really good stuff, I like that. Let me jump in, while Gary is looking through his notes and say something. We're not going to have the -- we don't have the core data fully evaluated at this point, but the data that we do have, which was early on the first quarter that we've got showed that the porosity current data. And the Meramec was above a cycle, on all basis about a cycle above the data that we had generated out of the Woodford. So just on a relative comparison basis, which was Gary's comment, the Meramec is superior based on the data that we have analyzed to what we've seen in the Woodford. And I think the early production performance and the sustained nature of that performance all fits with that coordinator. I guarantee you, Gary will have the detail in his back pocket for you the next time you ask.","John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research","Well, Campbell can always get it to me. In terms of \u201cSTACK\u201d play, pad drilling 2015 and middle through '15?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. I think that's a reasonable expectation, John.","Lee K. Boothby","You know John, when you look at that acreage, the other neat thing about it is it's really pored up, it's backed up well for drilling 1280s which, certainly Oklahoma has moved a long way, to allow us to do that. So generally, we drill these long laterals, we're knocking down 2 sections per well. And I think as we move into the pad drilling and spacing, we'll probably be working on either side of the lease line to make sure that we're maximizing the HBP efforts on the acreage.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up question from Subash Chandra with Jefferies.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just want to confirm. So you're doing the control flow back in \u201cSTACK\u201d just as you are in down south?","Lee K. Boothby","We are. I would say that what we've seen in \u201cSTACK\u201d and if you look at those curves, there's the -- whatever it is, 40, 50 days, it's kind of flat line of that period is kind of flowback and then there's the little dip that you see in the production curve. That's actually going from primary production flow to artificial lifts. So you see the conversion. Each one of the play is different, down south we've got a much longer time period for plateau production. And then out in the Uinta, again, we're using controlled flow there. That 2,200-barrel of oil equivalent per day well that we talked about was flowing at 2,500 psi when that data was recorded, so we've got plenty of horse power behind those stands [ph]. So each area is going to be a little bit different and we're using it because we think it's the right approach, in terms of bringing back these wells in the Uinta [ph].","Subash Chandra - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so we'll kind of follow-up on the development type curve here in \u201cSTACK\u201d. So how many days forward are we seeing the artificial lift? And then finally, where -- what's the pressure gradient up here versus SCOOP?","Gary D. Packer","The pressure gradiant here is just slightly, it's normal. And in some cases, a little ahead of normal. Depending on where we're at, some of these wells will run gas lift initially in these wells. Sometimes they'll come in for quite a while without having to put any gas to them. And others, will put gas to it yearly to help it unload. So I would say generally speaking, you ought to see anywhere between a week and 60 days, depending on the well that we're talking about here.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Majid Nikhanj with ITG.","Manuj Nikhanj - ITG Investment Research ULC.","This is actually Manuj from ITG. I just have a quick question on the Meramec. So you mentioned that it's partially self-sourced and then primarily sourced from the Woodford. Can you just give a bit more color on that? And the Woodford, I would assume, it's overpressured in that northern region. Is that correct to assume?","Gary D. Packer","If it's overpressured, it's just slightly overpressured. And yes, we see organics both -- the Woodford Shale is the source for both the Osage, the Mississippi, this Meramec play that we've got. But we do see organics in the play itself, so when we actually look at it, we've been surprised at the amount of vertical fractures that exist in the Meramec. And that's going to be attributed to probably some of the sourcing that took place as well.","Manuj Nikhanj - ITG Investment Research ULC.","Got you. So it's kind of like thinking of it as like partially self-sources, as well as sourced from the Woodford? So all the maturity should be the same?","Gary D. Packer","You've got all that fetch area on the East side of the Anadarko, so the Woodford is generating, everything is moving up. You've got the top seals. So there's a lot of things that come together here that really keep the oil trapped in the right places. So we're very, very excited about it. It's rich and we're going to have a lot more data here in a few months when we get finished with the core data and the production data.","Manuj Nikhanj - ITG Investment Research ULC.","Okay. and the outline that you guys put on Slide 9 of your presentation for the Meramec overlap, and it ends kind of a Northern Kingfisher, is that just a function of where the Chester is or...?","Gary D. Packer","That's an outline that we thought was appropriate to describe the play.","Lee K. Boothby","Yes. I think what you're describing is accurate. Basically, the Pennsylvania came in and eroded off the Chester. So as you wrap yourself around the play, you would go from the chat play up to the North. And that same seal is removed as you move further to the Northeast. That's how you'd describe it.","Manuj Nikhanj - ITG Investment Research ULC.","Okay. And so there's a number of private operators up in Kingfisher that are active. Are they chasing that same target as you guys or are they -- do you know that they're drilling horizontally in Kingfisher?","Lee K. Boothby","I believe what's taking place, and I could be mistaken, but there was some early plays trying to chase the chat further up there. And there's also been some drilling that the Devon did, playing a slightly thinner Woodford over there and they had some success, which has given us some encouragement that Woodford and may extend a little further a little bit. So as far as there's a hunting play that's out there, which is deeper, that's underneath the Woodford. But to our knowledge, we've tried to capture what we believe, ultimately, will be the core of the play.","Manuj Nikhanj - ITG Investment Research ULC.","Okay. And then just the very last question is, the well-cost range, I think you've increased the upper end of the range for that North Oil area to about $13 million from, I think, it was just $10 million? Is that just a function of reduced cluster spacing among your laterals?","Gary D. Packer","Yes. We've been able to continually take trouble out of the system and during our drilling cost's down, but as we've moved in transition in the tighter spacing, the completion costs have gone up some. The good news is that the UR's have gone up disproportionately. So it's been a real good trade for us. I suspect, like many of these plays, we'll get more and more experience and we'll start backing off on the size of the jobs and be able to take some cost out of there. But we're continually we're reminded here basically taking cost out of your completions is not a place to start early in the play. It's all about returns.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Philip Cannell with Mariner Investment Group.","Philip Cannel","What are you guys thinking in terms of after-tax proceeds on the Malaysian sale?","Lawrence S. Massaro","So yes, we don't anticipate paying any tax on Malaysia. We're going to bring that cash back tax-free. So you should see some adjustments for working capital, but that will be minor so it should be able to get almost full proceeds back.","Philip Cannel","Okay, and then in terms of China, is it a similar expectation in the year?","Lawrence S. Massaro","Well, China, we would end up with a 10% tax on the proceeds there. And so, factor that in for next year whenever we get that sale complete.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Andrew Coleman with Raymond James.","Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to get into, I guess, the dispositional environment a little bit more. I'm just kind of googling here a little bit in the last few minutes. It looks like there's the St. Louis line, is kind of mentioned, as well as there's the Osage, Meramec and Schooner trend, I guess. I'm guessing you're in the Schooner trend -- that's some papers back in the late 70s you're talking about. But I guess, is that accurate? And, I mean, I guess, they talk about that as, I guess, a deeper gas play. So I guess, do you have processing capacity locked in to kind of handle some of this wet gas and liquids as they come along?","Gary D. Packer","Okay. You got a lot of questions in there. That's okay. No, that's good. But I see Google is working for you. So yes, to answer a couple of your questions, yes, this is in the Schooner trend. Yes, the Osage is the formation that exists between the Meramec and the Woodford Shale, and we believe it ultimately, it could be a target here. And I think we alluded that in our script. As we've already talked, primarily most of this is an oil product that we're pursuing. There is a lot of gas in the area. As far as capacity, we actually met on this yesterday afternoon with our team up there. We believe there's quite a bit of excess point capacity in the northern portion of the Anadarko Basin. We are currently going to be going out for an RFP with a number of providers to make sure that we can lock that in. But within the near term, fortunately, most of the product is going be oil, and we have good access to markets there. And we don't anticipate -- all of the wells that we've booked up to date have been timely, and we don't anticipate any issues there.","Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And I guess there's probably isn't issue with the -- you've mentioned also I think in the comments earlier about the -- I think the Chester, I guess thinning, and then as you go to the north, I mean, is that needed as a frac barrier?","Gary D. Packer","No. I wouldn't think of it as that. I mean, the Chester was really just what kept all the oil in the Meramec and the Woodford. It kind of formed the trap. The zone is -- when you're sitting at 200 to 500 feet, we're not worried about a frac barrier here at all, so I wouldn't think of it as that.","Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, last question, I guess. How expensive are the fractures that are in the formation? Are they directionally significant? I mean, is it something that would drill like the old Austin Chalk play? Or is it -- do you have a lot more ability going in kind of lay in your own fracs and place some possibly?","Lee K. Boothby","Let us go back to what I said earlier. Let us finish our technical analysis. We've acquired a lot of data over the last few months. We'll have more to say on the play early in the new year, and we'll keep you guys posted as well results roll off. But there's a lot of fractures and we're excited about the play. I think those are the few key takeaways today.","Lee K. Boothby","I'd like to thank everybody for dialing in today. As you can tell we're excited about how things are playing out, excited about getting year 1 of our 3-year plan behind us, and excited about the visit we had with our board on the balance this week. We look forward to updating you on our 3-year plan before year end and we look forward to seeing you on the road as we continue to update you on the progress in these plays. Have a great day.

For opening remarks and other housekeeping items, I will turn the call over to Steve Campbell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Stephen C. Campbell - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for dialing in today for our call. Following today's prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Lee Boothby, we will have multiple members of our management team here to take your questions. As always, please limit your time during the Q&A to one question and one follow-up. This simply lets us get to more of your thoughts and questions.","Let me also remind you that today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website along with our earnings release, the financial tables and non-GAAP reconciliations and our @NFX publication. Today, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. So, please see the reconciliation in that earnings release and in @NFX.","Today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions based on our current views and reasonable expectations.

Please refer to the Risk Factors in our earnings release and @NFX for additional information.","Thanks again for dialing in. I'll now turn it over to Lee Boothby.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for dialing in this morning. Last night, we published our financial and operating results for the first quarter and updated our guidance along with additional color in our @NFX publication. Let's jump right in with a quick summary of our first quarter results.","For the first quarter, both earnings and cash flow per share came in above Street estimates, and our production was at the upper end of guidance ranges. In short, we're off to a great start in 2018 and continue to have high confidence in our ability to deliver our three-year business plan that we outlined for you in February.","Adjusting for unrealized derivative loss of $0.39 per diluted share, our net income for the quarter would have been $165 million or $0.82 per share. I would encourage you to see the explanation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures at the end of our first quarter news release.","Our first quarter revenues benefited from higher production and stronger oil prices and were $580 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $260 million and discretionary cash flow from operations was $321 million. Our total net production in the first quarter was 176,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 42% was oil. We obtained record net production for Newfield during the quarter and the Anadarko Basin.","Our SCOOP and STACK net production averaged 117,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we expect our development of these assets will yield rapid growth from here. Our plan estimates net production of as much as 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020. Anadarko Basin is the asset that will fuel our growth and transition us to living within cash flow from operations.","From a capital spending standpoint, we invested $345 million in the quarter which was in line with our first quarter expectations. In the Anadarko Basin, our investment levels were slightly higher than planned, related to higher than expected activity levels from outside operators, and higher working interest through some of our HBP drilling efforts.","Activity levels in the Anadarko are very high today, but we are laser-focused on our investment levels in generating our 2018 growth outlook for $1.3 billion. Recall that this plan was based on an average oil price of $55 per barrel and our cash flow will benefit from today's higher oil prices. The execution of our business plan has us generating free cash within our plan period. Newfield has worked to transition our company to one that delivers strong and consistent growth within cash flow from operations. We're on the cusp of this achievement today.","Let me cover a few of our recent highlights before moving to your questions. Domestic production was up 27% year-over-year and our domestic oil production was up 29% year-over-year. Anadarko Basin production was up 34% year-over-year and our realized oil price in STACK was 100% of NYMEX WTI. We continue to see strong demand for the STACK barrel as we sell directly into Cushing by pipeline.","During the quarter, we turned 43 wells to sales in the Anadarko Basin, in line with our planned completion cadence. In STACK, we continue to benefit from the early and aggressive investments we made in infill drilling. Our 88 infill wells including operated and non-operated pilots to-date have rapidly advanced our understanding of parent-child relationships and are shedding valuable light on how best to space and complete our pad developments to optimize future returns. We are leading in this regard.","In today's @NFX, we provided updated performance on four of our spacing test between 6 and 12 wells per DSU in the Meramec only. So, don't forget the other prolific horizons that will also get developed in the future. Our outlook for returns for each of these infill projects is very strong and highly encouraging. Of particular note is our Stark DSU, a 10-well development that has achieved payout in 12 months. The Williston Basin continues to perform extremely well. It's up nearly 10% year-over-year, as does the Uinta, which is up about 25% year over year. In the Williston, we are delivering some of industry's most productive and cost-effective wells in the play. This is an important program for us as we expect to deliver more than $100 million of free cash flow in 2018 at current oil prices.","Our offshore China production returned to sales, and we look to 261,000 barrels during the first quarter. Although our annual production in China is expected to average about 4,000 barrels of oil per day, our lifting schedule will vary each quarter. We expect to have three liftings in the second quarter or about 750,000 barrels. There's additional guidance in @NFX to help you with the remainder of the year.","Our unsecured credit facility was upsized by $200 million with the addition of some new banking relationships up to $2 billion in total and extended out to mid-2023. This facility remains undrawn. Again, we're off to a great start in 2018, and we're focused on delivering our three-year plan which we laid out to you in detail in February. Our plan is a careful balance of capital discipline, debt-adjusted growth and production and cash flow, and improving leverage metrics.","Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. As always, we sincerely appreciate your investment in our company.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Can you further parse the better performance that you're seeing on the gas and NGL side in the Anadarko Basin between the strong results from the HBP wells in the western portion of the acreage versus more of the areas that will probably be the source of ongoing capital spending? And is it fair to say and it may not, as we look at the outperformance versus your type curve from the Anadarko wells that outperformance is coming disproportionately from wet gas?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","So, there's a lot in there, Brian. I'm going to go and make a couple of comments and then I'll let Gary shed some light. So, if you look at the wells drilled in the release that are out in the far west area, you can see that we had a couple of gassy wells, very low condensate yields and a couple of higher condensate yield wells, all of which are very strong. As you move west through the acreage block that represents STACK and that STACK proper in terms of our footprint and those others that are investing, we've said consistently that you get gassier as you move out to the West. So, this is consistent with the phase envelope understanding. We certainly have production coming from those wells as well as OBO activity that's west of our primary position in STACK that also contributed to the gas in the first quarter.","We don't have any plans to do additional drilling out in the western portion of the acreage that was to secure HBP those wells. There may be some ongoing OBO activity from time to time, a need to HBP some of that acreage. But we're pleased with the results. Got solid returns there. Yields on NGLs out to the west are generally probably half of what we've seen in our primary SCOOP and STACK areas but with those rates, obviously, still significant in terms of the total economic proposition.","Processing as well in the first quarter has been favorable relative to the decision due (00:10:14) process and we've got those options embedded within our portfolio and agreements. So, we make the decision month-to-month and it's an economic decision, and we incorporated that into our forecast as well. So, all of that's been embedded in the update.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up relates to the three-year plan that was recently updated but just wanted to check in on really both the production side but also on the CapEx side especially with higher oil prices have certainly a benefit to revenues potentially here but also on potential cost pressures. Can you just talk to the pace of CapEx as we go forward? Do you expect to achieve not just the 2018 plan, but as you start to think about 2019?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I think that the release stated pretty clearly, and I think I made the comments as well in the prepared remarks that we're still focused on the $1.3 billion CapEx plan for 2018. We certainly recognize that the commodity has come up and that's certainly beneficial. Curve overall is still backward dated, and we've got a substantial hedge position in place for 2018. So, I think that we've got a solid plan around those assumptions. We'll continue to monitor price. And sometime in the future, if the market conditions dictate, then we could consider a change. At this point, we're focused on our three-year plan and delivering what we signed up for in February.","As far as pressures on the cost side, we continue to see minimal inflation pressures in the Anadarko Basin and CapEx spend has likewise been in line with expectations in that regard. Learning curve, assumptions are built into the three-year plan and we're on track with the learning curves as well. So, I think from an operating standpoint, the teams are executing extraordinarily well. I spent two days in the field a little over a week ago in Oklahoma. And I can tell you that everybody I met, every man, woman that's deployed to manage and execute these programs is focused on cost and efficiencies. And that tells us that the goals that we've said have been communicated down where the rubber hits the road. I'm proud of them. They're going to execute and make good things happen on the road ahead.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just starting off in the STACK, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you guys feel like you're going to end up in terms of wells per section there. Obviously, you have a peer who's sort of settled on eight but the Stark and the Velta June seem to have good results so far so any thoughts around that?","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. This is Gary. I think it's still far too early to really talk about this. As you already alluded to, Brad, we've seen some really good results to-date. At the end of the day, it's all going to be about maximizing our net present value which is going to be influenced by price, it's going to be influenced by our cost, and also the resource, and this is going to vary across the play.","As you've already alluded to, I think what we believe certainly, we have detected and we're on to some of the best techniques and designs to-date, and I can reference just the last four projects as you've seen. The Margies that we have online right now, it's 6 wells per DSU; the Rodenburg is at 8; and our most recent, the Starks and the Velta June is at 10 and 12 wells per DSU. These projects are delivering over 90% returns and these are some of the fullest, developed sections that we've seen to-date and the most tightest.","So, I think this is not luck. I think from what's been reported, this is truly differentiating about some of the techniques that we're using. And at the end of the day, it's really all coming down to some of the targeting techniques we've used. We're optimizing our chemical treatments. We look at how we're \u2013 our cluster spacing, how we're advancing some of the profit designs we have. It's pretty exciting, but I think it's still too early at this point to go ahead and identify what is the single spacing that we're onto.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Brad, I'll just add. We're focused on returns. The plays or the projects that Gary referenced are all delivering high returns, returns in excess of the average that we've got embedded in the three-year plan. Those are very, very encouraging results. I said earlier that this is part of what gives us the confidence in driving the future growth in the Anadarko Basin as a result. So, they're rolling off on these plays. And I can assure you they're definitely not luck and not an accident. It's the result of a lot of good work by our team. We've been planning for development since the day we started out here. We set it up for development. The team invested aggressively in multi-well DSUs last year. Those are the results of our framing, our decisions today and how to optimize this development and the road ahead. And some of those are contributing as well to the cost efficiencies that we're going to drive during the course of the three-year plan.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate the detailed answer. And then as my follow-up, Uinta volumes were up pretty substantially this quarter, I don't think they've been up quite this much in several years. So, can you talk about performance in that basin? And also, I was wondering if you guys are facing any issues because of the refining downtime that Holly's had?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Certainly, we had some inventory builds with the refining downtime that Holly had and I think we had communicated that previously. But it didn't impact our operations. We were able to put the barrels into inventory and then move the barrels out when the refinery got back online. So, I think that's going well. As far as the Uinta Basin, we've put a slide out in February. I think you can see that the team has been drawing some really strong wells. Our focus in 2018 is to HBP about 10,000 acres in the heart of that play, the well results that you're seeing and the production are a result of that drilling program, simply that.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from David Kistler with Piper Jaffray.","David Kistler - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Good morning, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning, Dave.","David Kistler - Simmons Piper Jaffray","So, I guess kind of real simplistically, I'm looking at the guide and production is higher, CapEx is unchanged, domestic oil growth also unchanged, but oil growth outperformed in 1Q. And I'm not trying to lead the witness, but are we being conservative while we wait to see how some of these wells continue to hang in? As you highlighted on the infill pilots and whatnot, they're performing above type curves. I'm just trying to get my head around that. And then maybe even more simplistically, with flat CapEx, higher production, capital efficiency should be improving. Am I missing something there?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","No. I don't think you're missing anything, Dave. I think the DSUs that I referenced earlier where we have substantial performance to-date are all performing extraordinarily well. The fact that you're running on those slightly above the 1.3 million barrel average that we embedded in the three-year plan, that should be encouraging to everybody. But I remind everyone that it's still early innings. You can see that in the @NFX publication, we've got additional pilots as we continue to spread out across the primary STACK footprint. My expectation is we'll continue to deliver strong results there and further de-risk the planned forecast.","Looking forward, I think all of that's positive. The fact that we're on track with regard to our efficiency gains coming into this year I think is positive as well. And the fact that we're not seeing the type of inflationary pressures that we suffered through last year is also positive.","At the end of the day, a lot of work went into that three-year plan. I think our team has been consistently right in terms of how it's forecast and how it's predicted the play was going to evolve. We did take a position in terms of not driving the type curve up when we're in HBP mode and counseling people that when you get into development mode and the wells have neighbors, you need to be thinking about that. I think these results demonstrate that our team is embedding that all the way along.","And I think most importantly, Dave, at the end of the day it comes down to this \u2013 good plays tend to get better over time, great teams tend to make great plays even better. And that's what our team has done. That's what we're going to do. I think I'll reference the Bakken as a most recent example but I think in each play that we've deployed capital and talent, our team has managed to exceed expectations.","David Kistler - Simmons Piper Jaffray","Okay. Appreciate that color. And maybe one for either you or Larry. Expansion of the bank facility, obviously, kind of highlights at least the lender's confidence in the underlying assets in operations, unsecured facility again reinforces that. Just trying to get my hands around why we'd want to expand the facility or grow the facility. Is it maybe for temporal use of retiring debt longer term, refinancing debt longer term? Just trying to understand, well, what's the benefit?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, Dave, since you gave me the option to slide it over to Larry, I'm going to flip that one over to Larry and let Larry give you some color on that.","Lawrence S. Massaro - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. Thanks, Lee. Hey, Dave. The facility, upsizing it to the $200 million, there's a couple factors that went into it. One, we brought in a few new banks and that creates some room for them. Two, it creates a little bit more optionality and flexibility for us in the future. You noted that we might want to take out some bonds going forward, depends on where we sit down the road but that certainly gives us a little bit more headroom in that.","And I think just upsizing the facility now, you have to kind of plan five years out and what the company is going to look like and when we look at our growth rate both in production and cash flow, we expect to have greater needs possibly. So, I think it was a really smart thing to do. We took advantage of a great market getting an unsecured facility and kind of renewing what we had and enlarging it was really smart and we're very happy with it.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","And, Dave, I'll add that I'm really proud of our team. I think they did good work here and it's well-planned and well-executed and a good piece of work in my mind.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning, guys. Lee, for you or Gary, just wondering on \u2013 you mentioned kind of the learning curve. Now, that you've gone down, you guys are in development mode. Can you talk about, with just the choke management where you guys sort of sit now. That, plus just the amount of proppant that you're using kind of \u2013 if you think you've kind of hit that sort of ultimate target on each?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. I'll give you a quick high level and then I'll pass it over to Gary and he can give you some of the color. I think one of the things that I've really been pleased with in terms of our team is as they've evaluated the data over the last couple of years, that's our data and all of the data operated by others, we've been working that into our game plan on these DSUs. So, when we drilled the multi-well DSUs, high-density DSUs that were executed last year, one of the flags that they had put out was that there seem to be detrimental effects in some of the big wells that were drilled in the HBP mode in and around some areas where we had drilled some pretty good wells. And you generally would think that that's phase-related. So, they came up with a strategy where they're managing chokes and pressures, but you can think about it as managing the pressure distribution in the reservoir system and appears to be paying really good dividends. We're seeing consistent, sustained performance there. So, I think that's a good product of technical team, asset team doing really, really good technical work.","We also, in that same vein, did a lot of testing on proppant and fluid loading. In HBP mode, clearly, it was demonstrated by ourselves and the industry that more fluid, more proppant, bigger well. I think we counseled consistently that that didn't mean that the most proppant and the most fluid was the best well to drill in development mode. So, we've taken a different tack there. And I'll flip it over to Gary, he can give you some color on the operations (00:24:22).","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. As far as the drawdown controlled flow-backs, it's a practice that we're employing on all of our DSUs consistently and we think that is leading to better performance. As Lee suggested, what we've learned in the Velta June where we've actually experimented with many different proppant fluid loadings. We've learned a lot from that. I would tell you we're testing some slightly less intense fracs out there today. And we're monitoring their performance and see if that's an opportunity to basically where we can continue to become more capitally efficient and drive F&D and not materially, if at all, even affect the type curve. So, we think there are some opportunities here, but it's really still early at this point to say that we've defined what the optimum is.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","No, makes sense, guys. And then \u2013 go ahead, Lee.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","I was going to add one other thing, as obviously credit to (00:25:20) the team, but I mean when you think about all the variables they're working with, that's a critical one that you flag. But they're managing through all kinds of other items. So, it takes kind of the multi-disciplinary approach, teamwork to get there, but frac order (00:25:34), well layout, optimal geological targets, smooth wellbores, parent well mitigation, flowback practices. We're talking about flowback practices but all of those other elements are important, too. So, when you look back at the DSUs that we've put out, pay close attention to the geometry. And when you guys start comparing DSUs when you're looking at data across multiple companies, keep in touch with the geometry. Geometry is going to be an important part of the mix in the end of the day.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Great point. And then, Lee, one other, just your opinion here. It seems to me there are still investors just misunderstanding. And again, I looked at just this last quarter, thought you guys now will hit it right down the middle. You hit it a hell of a long ways and yet investors don't seem to be agreeing. I'm just wondering from your side, I know there's theories out there, but I'm just wondering from your side if there's something that sticks out would you think as certainly misunderstood, is judged by, which I thought were exceptional results today?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thanks for the recognition of the results that the team delivered. We think they're strong results as well and I think it gives great confidence in executing the three-year plan that we signed up for in February. When it comes down to it, we've got to focus on execution. We've got to focus on delivering the results and the market will sort itself out over time. I think there's been a lot of noise and, I guess, you would say that some of the noise within the basin over the course of the last quarter created some headwinds. But yes, I can go back to the last quarter and say that we met or exceeded all of expectations in that quarter as well.","So, I think we're executing very well. I think we continue to execute our plan and my bet is that people will get comfortable as we continue to roll off successful multi-well DSUs and the growth that we've got programmed is delivered.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Cross with SouthernSun Asset Management.","Michael Scott Cross - SouthernSun Asset Management LLC","Good morning, Lee.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Scott Cross - SouthernSun Asset Management LLC","I was wondering if you could comment on the free cash flow comments that you made back in February where I think you said potentially $1 billion in free cash flow generated at $60 oil and $3 gas, and if you could provide any update there.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. So, I think to take us back to that time, we showed two cases in February, assumptions are well documented in the materials that were put out at that time. We run a $55 flat case and a $60 flat case so it wasn't a backward-dated look. But at $55, it's $300-million-plus free cash flow over the three-year plan period. And at $60 plus, it was $1 billion. So, those were the \u2013 the assumptions are embedded in the plan. Ultimately, the product of all the things that we've been talking about this morning including price, the actual final price path (00:28:48) will determine the final outcome.","But as far as the trajectory, I would say that from an operating standpoint, we're still strong. I think the challenge for us is to overcome the tax adjustment that was flagged here in February, and we think price is going a long ways towards helping that in that regard. So, I'd say taxes in the first quarter prospectively are a headwind relative to the planned and oil is a tailwind. As we think about it, we think everything's working to where we'll be able to offset that in the course of the three-year plan period.","Michael Scott Cross - SouthernSun Asset Management LLC","All right. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ron Mills with Johnson Rice.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning. Maybe for Gary, just as we look at the infill projects from the @NFX presentation, can you talk a little bit about the Jackson\/Florene results versus the Stark and Velta June and the vintage of those? Were you able to apply information from Jackson or in Florene into some of the other pilots that are clearly tracking well ahead of the 1.3 million barrel curve?","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Sure. The Jackson and the Florenes are a little further east. They're out into the area that there was a lot of discussion on last quarter's call. Really great results. These particular ones have four in the upper Meramec section, but the exciting thing about this particular one is that it was actually developed over top of two Woodford wells. So, it was one of our first really co-developed areas and ultimately we're sitting at an effective six wells per Meramec based on the spacing that was included. We applied old learnings that we had had from the Velta June, and this is, at the end of the day, what we got from the Jackson and Florenes were ultimately applied in the Margies where we're sitting at six wells and really like the results that we're seeing out of the Margies thus far. So, in essence, we're just building each one of DSUs as we build on the results from the prior one and apply the learnings, and I think we have different trajectory there right now.","Ronald E. Mills - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Great. And then as it relates to \u2013 you highlighted the \u2013 not just your oil pricing with the impact from Anadarko and Williston Basin but also on the gas side. What's driving that increased gas price realizations? Is it on the gathering side, is it with the takeaway with Enable and how much of that is that expected to continue, given the planned growth over the next two to three years?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. I'll let Larry give some color on that. He's been involved with helping us get the agreements in place that we've talked about over the course of last 1.5 years, and I think he can give some color there.","Lawrence S. Massaro - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. Thanks, Lee. As far as the natural gas takeaways, it's primarily driven by the Enable transportation agreement. When you look at that, we saw a couple of years ago the possibility that we'd see kind of basis issues forming, not only in Anadarko but in other basins. And so, we made moves ahead of that, get our gas out the basin price into the southeast. And when you look at that by the end of this year, in October we'll have another 160 million cubic feet a day (00:32:43), bringing us to 205 million cubic feet a day on Enable, that along with about 70 million cubic feet that's going to the Midwest, we'll take two-thirds of our gas out of the basin and we have both \u2013 those contracts in place. We have some physical hedges that's going to advantage us over the next few years. So, when you look at Newfield, we've had a great run this quarter, comparing our depth to that of our competitors. When you look out 2019 and 2020, we'll continue to have some advantage, although that will pull down a little bit as some of the physical hedges roll off.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. And I'll just add that again credit to our team. I think it was one of the greatest risks that we saw back in 2016-2017, looking out into the 2018-2019 time period. I think we moved early to limit that risk, and I think it proves today it serves the shareholder well. So, I think a good piece of work.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel Financial.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, all.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Hi, Derrick.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Lee, as a build on a previous question, I'd agree that you guys generally put in a strong quarter across the board. The only perceived weakness was you didn't raise the oil outlook in the Anadarko and that seems to be the area of contention this morning. We've extensively reviewed your STACK-type curves with a focus on oil volumes and generally come to the same conclusion you do on page 6. What more can you say to investors to provide them confidence in your Anadarko oil growth into 2019?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, I think that we signed up for the three-year plan that we put forth and we take our commitment in that regard serious. And we're not trying to be a used car salesman here. I think that we've taken a prudent approach. I think that, as I mentioned earlier, plan is constructed as careful balance of all of the things that we divine (00:34:58) from lots of meetings with better than 50% of our ownership during the course of the 12 months preceding the plan.","So in our view, we're focused on returns. It is a mix, so we think it's a thoughtful mix of understanding what the investors demand and want today. We want to demonstrate capital discipline, strong returns, debt-adjusted production and cash flow growth that I referenced. And I'll say again, I think I said it in February, it's the right plan for NFX and we're committed to delivering it. So, we've got a long track record in that regard. It's something we take seriously. We're going to work every day to give you some color. I guarantee you, every man and woman at Newfield listening to this call right now, they show up every day to beat the plan.","This magic that they create doesn't just happen, okay. They've got to do lots of little things, it's little wins that take place day by day, hour by hour. I'll never bet against them and I'm going advise everybody outside not to bet against them. We're going to deliver this plan and we'll find ways to optimize it over time, no doubt about that.","And I think the other thing I would say is keep your eye on the ball. 2020, we're signed up for 200,000 Boe per day of production coming out of the Anadarko Basin. So, really, really strong growth trajectory there and a lot of superlative (00:36:28) execution has to take place to deliver it.","Derrick Whitfield - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","As a follow-up on one of the last comments you made with regard to the three-year outlook, to what degree can you reallocate capital to all your STACK acreage in light of the current higher oil price environment you're in?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, you have to think about all of the other dynamics that take place in these plays. And I think I may have counseled that every play is going face of these things. So, there's lots of activity going on. If we were the only company playing in the STACK play and you have infinite approvals and you didn't have to do all the things you do to get regulatory approval to drill, you could turn on a dime. But the fact of the matter is the team has to stay in touch with offset operators, you've got to manage for frac bashing and things that occur in that regard.","I think that's worked extraordinarily well amongst the operators in the Anadarko, but every other play is going to face some of those same challenges kind of on the road ahead. I think the other item is that we're HBP. So, we're in a good place there. So, we're moving away from primarily in HBP mode through 2017 for the most part into pure development as you get to 2019 forward. And I think at that point, all of the data that we've gathered, all of the information that you've analyzed and put together all comes together to give you a high certainty, high confidence in that forward plan.","We are high grading. We're high grading to drill the best highest returns. We make adjustments real-time during the course of the year. So, to the extent that the team is able to take advantage of learnings and shift capital, they do it and they will continue to do that through the course of the plan period. Our focus today is continue to high grade, make sure we get the highest return opportunities at the front of the line, get the final HBP push behind us and keep our eye on the ball of getting to free cash flow generation as quickly as possible.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Hey, guys. I just wanted to shift gears a little bit to the Bakken, I guess, obviously an area that didn't get as much focus here in the slide deck. Just curious as to what you're seeing in well performance, if the wells are consistent, if you're continuing to see better results there. And then additionally, are you experiencing any issues out there in the basin? I know that there are some problems with gas processing and takeaway basin-wide. Just wanted to see if NFX is impacted.","Gary D. Packer - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes, Leo. Results in the Bakken continue to impress both on the Nesson anticline and off the anticline. Everything has responded very, very well to the increased proppant densities and fluid densities and I really like the results that we continue to achieve there. And a lot of them were being achieved not only in the drilling within the Bakken itself but the team's done a great job in threading additional Three Forks wells in both the first and second benches and they continue to impress.","What you asked about as far as there are constraints developing in the basin, I think they've been widely reported. It looks like we may have some relief on the flaring side. These are all things that we've got baked into our plans. Many of these things have already been anticipated. But the fact of the matter remains the Bakken remains some of the best returns, most productive wells that we have in just about anybody's portfolio, at 1 million barrel EURs and these wells are being drilled and often counts (00:40:31) less than $6 million, it has a great place in our portfolio and it continues to define greater confidence that we have in our plan coming out of the basin.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","And I think, Leo, I referenced earlier a focus on generating free cash flow composite of $100 million-plus in the current price environment for the Williston Basin this year, one-rig program. We've used this asset to kind of lead the way on some of the innovations that we're applying today in SCOOP and STACK. I think that's been a positive attribute as well. And clearly, where the bottleneck to develop, we can shift capital out of the Williston Basin into the SCOOP and STACK plays. That would be the response if it were to affect Newfield in terms of production.","Leo P. Mariani - NatAlliance Securities","Okay. That's helpful for sure. And then I guess just as a follow-up, you folks obviously highlighted four wells on the western side in the STACK play here in the first quarter and gave some detail around those. I guess you talked about 43 total completions, so obviously a ton of other wells out there. Just curious as to kind of where the activity has been focused. Are you kind of more focused in the central part of your acreage block or the east side or just kind of all over? Just trying to get a sense of if the activity is going to be shifting towards some oilier areas just later in the year, maybe just kind of talk about the development plan this year.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. So, I'll take the first part of that and then if I leave anything out, Gary can jump in and piggyback. So, the wells out to the west, the HBP wells, that's protecting acreage that came to us with the Chesapeake acquisition back in 2016. So, it's been a good acquisition for us. The lease term is such that it was time to drill an HBP, those leases. So, that's really what the focus was on the four wells that we put forth. There's been some other OBO activity out in that area and I suspect it's largely related to the same activity that people have HBPed acreage footprints such as preserving an option \u2013 value option for the future. And we don't plan to develop, follow up on any of these at this stage in development mode.","If you look at the slide that you referenced, the area just north of that which is kind of the area we call Northwest STACK, that's the one remaining area in the STACK play that we've got some HBP activity ongoing, results of the SCORE initiative that we had last year. So, Northwest STACK extension is turning out to be a really, really strong positive and we're drilling some exciting wells in there right now. So, we'll get that acreage HBPed. So, that's something that is a portion of the capital this year that's not committed directly to development. It's good economic decision and those wells are \u2013 those returns are competitive with the other investments we're making out there, so we feel really good about that.","Beyond that, you come back to STACK proper or eastern acreage footprint, and you can kind of see when you look at where we've spaced out the pilots that we get finished with the next three that we've got in line, we'll have drilled multi-well DSUs in the Meramec across the substantive footprint in that eastern STACK acreage block. That is what sets up the development drilling in the three-year plan. I think that's where most all of the activity is focused in STACK, and certainly that activity will grow in 2019 and 2020 as we go into full development mode.","And then of course, we do have some activity down in SCOOP play as well, and a portion of that is tied to north SCOOP where we've got one rig running and that's cleaning up on some HBP activity there, similar to what we've done out west. We'll get that largely behind us this year, and then that will become part of the development inventory for the future. And then down in SCOOP, that's development at this stage we're focused on developing Woodford. So, most of the capital go into development, but those two areas kind of give you some color of the pressures that the team face day to day. I think we're making good decisions. And again, when you're drilling strong economic results on HBP mode, it's never a bad thing, we'll take it.","Operator","We have time for one last question. And we'll take our last question from Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Good morning. You had big growth in the Uinta Basin, putting seven wells online. I was surprised at how much growth that generated. Just wanted to see if you were surprised too and if those results were in line with your expectations or better? And also, as a follow-on to that, your plan for the year, looks like you're planning on doing 10 to 15 wells and 7 of those were in 1Q. With those kinds of results would you be inclined to...","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","No surprises here.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","...okay, so no surprises. So, would you expect to...","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","No surprises here. We executed the JV program. We've led the way on horizontal drilling out there. We've got our acreage largely HBP. We talked about it in February. You guys could look at the results. The well results are strong. The cost of performance is outstanding. Returns are good. So, I would say what it gives you is it gives you a little bit of a look as to how that asset can be part of driving the future for the company. But the program this year is based on HBP. We're going to HBP about 10,000 acres in the central portion of that footprint and it's a good economic decision. That's it.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Heading forward from here, do you think with those additional wells, \u2013 I mean what would the production look like in that basin? Should that decline in 2Q because you got a bunch of wells on in 1Q or will the additional wells keep it flat or how should we think about that?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well, we've got one rig running throughout through November, I believe, is the time period. And so, you'll have a normal cadence of turnover on the production. So, at this point I'd just go ahead and say it's embedded in our plan. It's a great option for the future of our owners, and we're getting it held by production and we'll tell you more about it at the right place and time. But right now, we're focused on the three-year plan and executing against that and we've got strong performance there as well.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to your host for any additional or closing remarks.","Lee K.

Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We have a lot to cover this morning, and we'll reference the news we issued last night on our financial and operating results, year end proved reserves, and our 2017 to 2019 growth outlook.","2016 was a very solid performance year for our company, and we delivered on our expectations. Let me review some of the year's key highlights. We high graded our capital investments which totaled just under $750 million, and allocated more than 80% of the investment to SCOOP and STACK. Our 2016 investments closed out the year right in line with our projection.","Our STACK play got better as the year progressed as we saw a continued consistency in our well results, and we worked to complete our HBP phase. At the end of the year, more than 85% of our legacy acreage was held by production. We ended the year with 330 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves in the Anadarko Basin, which today represents about two-thirds of our total company proved reserves. This is a pretty remarkable growth coming from an asset that was just entering the portfolio five years ago.","As we exit the HBP phase in STACK, we can now look back at nearly 500 wells that have been drilled in the play by industry. Newfield has an interest in nearly half of these wells, and we're using this extensive database to optimize our development plans. We've increased the certainty in our outcomes, and most of our 2017 drilling program categorized as development wells will be drilled on multi-well pads. We're also seeing benefits from larger completions in the Anadarko Basin.","Last week, we released average results from nine recent wells and our first two infill development pads, all of which benefited from these larger designs. Our goal is to arrive at the most optimal design as we work to balance completion size with our ultimate well spacing for development.","We've worked hard to remove costs from the system. In fact, our 2017 domestic cost estimates on a BOE basis are down more than 25% from the 2014 levels. Although service costs have certainly played a role, we've also found ways to work smarter and accomplish more for less without compromising our high safety and environmental standards.","G&A expense will continue to benefit from the recent consolidations of our domestic workforce into the Woodlands. Now that we're all in one central location, we're seeing huge benefits in workflow collaboration, information sharing, and cost reductions. We continue to build a stronger and more refined portfolio of assets while working to improve our capital structure.","The second half of 2016, we closed on the sale of our Eagle Ford and South Texas assets for $380 million. Since 2011, we've divested about $3 billion in assets and used the proceeds to build our footprint in the Anadarko Basin. The result? We've shifted our production reserves to liquids, our margins have improved, and we exited 2016 with more than $500 million of cash on the balance sheet.","More important than what exited the portfolio during the year is what entered. We acquired nearly 40,000 net acres in STACK that both overlapped our existing acreage and provided us with a solid position to the west in Blaine County. Because we had cash on hand and a strong balance sheet, we were able to capture this acquisition at a time when many were unable to compete. In addition, we've been quietly adding new leases just north of STACK over the last two years. You'll see a map on slide 10 of @NFX that shows an extensional acreage that expands our STACK footprint to about 300,000 net acres, and our Anadarko Basin acreage to about 400,000 net acres.","So we enter 2017 with a deep high-quality inventory of drilling opportunities, an improved domestic cost structure, and a strong balance sheet which will be the foundation for our future growth. Last night, we issued a separate release on our capital spending plan for 2017 and a production outlook through 2019.","Before we cover our financial results, let me summarize our forward outlook and provide some thoughts on how we view the exciting road ahead. We're projecting strong oil growth in the road ahead. This forecast is driven by the Anadarko Basin. Although 2017 is our transition year to development in STACK, our future envisions a company that can sustainably post double-digit production growth within cash flow.","We plan to deliver a CAGR of 15% to 20% in our domestic oil volumes, and our total domestic oil mix will increase to about 45% in 2019. We set our capital budget for this year at approximately $1 billion. This will fund a 2017 rig program that varies from 8 to 10 rigs throughout the year. We'll use our $550 million of cash on hand to fund a very manageable delta in our estimated cash flows.","As we energize the flywheel on cash flow, the outspend is expected to shrink in the future as we move to a sustainable, growing enterprise with a deep and high-quality inventory to drill development wells in the Anadarko Basin. We essentially used strip prices for the midpoint of our outlook, and our plan has us delivering double-digit CAGRs in a $50 WTI environment.","Along with the strip oil prices, we've also assumed a relatively constant 10-rig program in the Anadarko Basin. Although 2017 is all about gathering the necessary science to properly space and complete our development wells, 2018 and 2019 could see significantly higher activity levels if warranted by higher commodity prices. We will certainly be looking for the opportunity to put more capital to work in our high-return SCOOP and STACK assets.","I know that our outlook for capital investments over the next the three years is $500 million to $600 million lower than Street consensus estimates over this three-year period. Please recognize that we have the asset base and inventory that could support these investment levels. However, at today's commodity prices those investment levels could create a significant deficit in the near-term and weaken our strong balance sheet. It was only a year ago that we went through one of the harshest oil price corrections in our collective careers. We certainly understand the importance of production growth, but we must maintain a strong balance sheet as well.","The plan that we issued last night provides for both. In our $1 billion investment plan for 2017, we're allocating about $750 million to development, drilling and completion activities. This means about a quarter of the budget is going to other. So let me clarify the $250 million classified as other. We will have a significant investment in exploration wells in the Anadarko Basin to test multiple prospective horizons on acreage we own today. It is important that we timely assess and understand these exciting opportunities so they can properly plan the development in the future.","The unrisked resource potential associated with this program in 2017 will test more than 1 billion barrels of incremental oil equivalent, huge opportunity already captured and owned in our portfolio. We continue to invest capital to hold our leases together and acquire new leases in the Anadarko Basin. We're investing in additional water recycling facilities that allow us to control both the source and use of our fluids. We would expect that the other category will diminish in 2018 and 2019, allowing for a larger and increasing percentage of overall investments to go toward development, drilling and completion activities in the future.","For 2017, we're assuming a well cost in STACK of about $7.7 million. This estimate includes the costs associated with today's larger stimulation jobs at 2,100 pounds of sand and 2,100 gallons per foot. We have modeled an uplift in production performance for these wells. You can see in the data we released last week that these new completions are outperforming our 1.1 million barrel of oil equivalent type curve by a significant margin. It is important for us to capture a larger subset of these wells before any making any adjustments to our estimated type curve. The 2017 program will provide this critical data.","Our domestic growth in 2017 is estimated at 3% to 5%. As you can infer from our year end 2017 Anadarko Basin exit rate of approximately 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, our growth is back end-weighted and reflects the timing of pad completions. In fact, as we speak, all of our Anadarko Basin rigs are being utilized on multi-well pads. Throughout much of last year, we referenced this transition period as lumpy, but the lumps will soon smooth and we expect to be on a course to deliver industry-leading oil growth on the road ahead.","As important as our growth forecast, we've also been moving our cost in the right direction. There's a slide on page 8 in @NFX that outlines the underlying improvements in our domestic per barrel of oil equivalent costs since the oil price correction in 2014. You can see significant improvements in our LOE and G&A on a per unit basis. We're also seeing improved oil price differentials as our revenues become more dominated by the more valuable STACK barrel. Recent marketing arrangements help to ensure the best price for our quality barrels. Growing production and improving margins are a powerful combination.","Looking forward, our plan is expected to take our net production from the Anadarko basin to around 150,000 to 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2019. This growth outlook employs an average Anadarko Basin rig count of about 10 rigs throughout the planned period or about the pace we're executing today. Remember, higher prices in 2018 and 2019 will translate to higher activity and higher growth rates. Oil as a percentage of Anadarko Basin production is expected to move higher as we drill in the oil window across our STACK acreage.","We also provided you with domestic guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017 through 2019, and domestic oil and domestic production CAGRs over the next three years of 15% to 20% and 10% to 15%, respectively. And remember, this is being delivered with WTI in the $50 to $60 per barrel range. Again, higher prices will translate to higher activities and higher growth rates.","We've got the option to accelerate our plan with higher activity, we've got the capacity to do so; it's important to do so at the right time. If the future oil prices strengthen, we'll pull the trigger and have full flexibility to move forward. Likewise, should prices soften we have the ability to slow investments as appropriate as well.","China production, which outperformed by more than 1 million barrels in 2016, is now on natural decline. We have no additional investments planned for China. You will see in yesterday's release that we recently reached an agreement to sell our non-operated interest in Bohai Bay, and expect to close this transaction around mid year 2017.","Let's move on to our brief discussion of our fourth quarter financial and operating results as well as our proved reserves report at year end. Our domestic production in the fourth quarter was 12.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, just above the upper end of our guidance. Although we experienced significant weather-related challenges in both North Dakota and Oklahoma, our field personnel did an excellent job in handling them. Our first quarter 2017 guidance reflects some additional weather-related downtime experienced quarter-to-date.","Total company production in the fourth quarter was 13.9 million barrels of oil equivalent, about 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent above the midpoint of our guidance. Of the total, 62% was liquids and 38% was natural gas.","For the fourth quarter, we had net income of $0.07 per diluted share. After adjusting for the effect of unrealized derivative losses, net income for the fourth quarter was $98 million or $0.49 per share, exceeding consensus estimates. Our revenues were $415 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $239 million, and discretionary cash flow from operations was $229 million. Our cash operating expenses for the fourth quarter stated on a unit of production basis were also below our guidance ranges. You can see the continued positive improvements we have made on cash operating expenses, and this should lead to improved profitability in the future.","Our proved reserves at year end 2016 were 513 million barrels of oil equivalent, or up 1% from year end 2015. Anadarko Basin reserves now account for about two-thirds of total net company proved reserves. Reserve adds through our STACK acquisition offset reserves sold during the year in the Eagle Ford and South Texas.","Let's talk in more detail now about the Anadarko Basin. Anadarko Basin is driving superlative corporate results for Newfield. Over the last year, both Newfield and industry activity observed to prove up strong and consistent well results across the entirety of the STACK footprint. The consistency of drilling results is ode to the world-class source rock we're exploiting. The Meramec is a unique play with geologic attributes that contribute to strong results that we're seeing. It's important to understand what sets Meramec apart from other resource plays.","First, the Woodford is a world-class source rock which has served as a major hydrocarbon charge for the Meramec shale. Meramec, however, is hydrocarbon-generating and has source rock interspersed within the silt package. Second, the Meramec has proven to be very homogenous to uniform with respect to its mineralogy and grain size. When compared to the Woodford, the Meramec has a magnitude better rock quality over the same porosity range. This leads to better permeability.","When porosity and permeability are coupled with the Meramec's high silica content, you create a rock that lends itself to very effective fracture stimulation and ultimate drainage of the oil in place. This is a brittle rock; the silica or coarse content is upwards of 60% with 20% carbonate fragments and cement. Clay content in the Meramec is extremely low as well.","Third, the Meramec benefits from a uniform hydrocarbon charge which is effectively sealed, allowing for nearly all of the oil and gas generated by the Woodford source rock below to remain in the system. We're fortunate that the Meramec has little or no formation of water which is a large cost advantage when compared to other players like those taking place today in the Permian.","Lastly, STACK sits along a hinge point in the Anadarko Basin that is set up by a rapidly subsiding deep base into the south and a stable shelf platform to the north. This provides the even and uniform natural fracture ideal for development. So the Meramec is the full package when it comes to describing attributes to a robust petroleum system. It has abundant sourcing, thick reservoir with stacked pays, the right mineralogy, and enhanced rock quality and natural fracturing all trapped by a very strong seal.","Let's talk about our upcoming plans in the Anadarko Basin. As we exit HBP mode in STACK, we can today begin high-grading our drilling locations as opposed to chasing lease expirations. Our teams have worked hard to get to this point, and we're excited about the tangible benefits that field development will provide for us and our shareholders in the very near future. We're planning to drill 85 to 90 wells on STACK and up to 50 wells on SCOOP in 2017. Substantially, all of these will be SXL wells. Although we've been actively drilling in STACK for more than four years, we continue to create meaningful efficiencies in our drilling operations.","On slide 13 in @NFX, we showcase the increased number of wells we have to drill \u2013 that we have to drill as an average each year with a single rig versus what rig today drilling common well pads could generate. Impressively, we've also drilled 10,000 feet of lateral or the SXL portion of the well in under six days recently.","Last week, we provided updates on our recent higher-intensity completions in STACK. In today's @NFX, you will find these results referenced on pages 11 and 12. This update included the longer-dated production results from our first two infill spacing pilots as well as nine additional wells that we're drilling throughout our acreage footprint. All of these wells have completion jobs consisting of 2,100 pounds of sand and 2,100 gallons of fluid per foot, our new standard. These new jobs are significantly larger than what we have pumped to date in the majority of our wells. Our initial average results from the Chlouber and Dorothy pilots as well as the average of our nine recent wells throughout our acreage are performing above our 1.1 million barrel STACK type curve.","Our 2017 drilling program in STACK will provide us with tremendous amount of data as the year progresses. We expect to drill nine infill development pads to test varying horizontal and vertical spacing configurations as well as individual horizontal targets. We're also scheduled to participate in additional four pilots operated by our peers.","Newfield and our STACK peers are all working to solve the same equation: how do we create the most value through optimal well spacing and completion designs at today's oil price and service cost outlooks. We're learning real-time and we'll incorporate the learnings into our future drilling and completion plans. With more than 8,000 gross locations and over 2.4 billion barrels of net resource in just the Meramec, Woodford, and Springer shales, we have decades of drilling in front of us and it's critical that we get it right.","So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Before I open it up to take your questions, let me summarize the key takeaways we hope you heard in today's call. Newfield is in a very good place today with a deep, quality, high return drilling inventory dominated by the SCOOP and STACK plays in the Anadarko Basin. We have improved our asset base and the proactive steps we've taken in recent years have helped to lower our cost structure, improve our margins and price realizations, and create a fortress balance sheet.","As we transition to development mode in STACK, we're confident in our ability to deliver additional efficiencies in our operations on the road ahead as well as strong oil-driven growth outlook that we put forth in the plan today. And lastly, our goal for the road ahead is to transition Newfield to a company that can sustainably deliver double-digit production growth while living within its means. We look forward to that future state.","Thanks again for your time today and your investment in our company. And, operator, we're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Josh Silverstein. Please go ahead.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Hi, Josh.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for putting a little clarification out there on the $250 million of spend. Just wanted to get a little sense of direction for the magnitude of the decline. I imagine there's some spend on infrastructure and exploration you guys are going to want to be doing over the next few years. So, just want to get a magnitude of the decline there.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","You mean the future state?","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's right.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. I would say that if you think about it on a percentage basis, obviously, $250 million is 25% of the $1.0 billion that we talked about as far as the plan. About $100 million or so of that is going into the exploratory assessment. We expect that the success there, that will translate to additional development opportunities on the road ahead. So follow-up drilling, post 2017 will be classified as development drilling. The balance of that is land and infrastructure, and over the course of the three-year plan we would expect that that total percentage would get down to inside of 10%.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. That's helpful. So it means that a lot more of the spending going forward would be going much more towards development versus exploration or other non-productive capital. Got it. Okay. And then, I guess, that the program this year has about a third of your wells in the Anadarko Basin and SCOOP, have you guys been seeing a lot of increased well productivity down there? Is this just activity you have to do hold leasehold? So just a broader sense of where the 2017 program is? Why the 50 wells and then maybe how that shifts over the 2019 program?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Volume. We're finishing up on the activity down there related to HBPing acreage, so we'll continue those efforts. I think what we've seen is the results down there have been strong. We've been focused on HBPing STACK, so we have some really attractive high rates of return, high yield wells that we can drill down there. And frankly, we think when we go back and use the larger-sized jobs down there that we'll be able to deliver some really, really exciting wells. So we're excited about SCOOP. It's been a big part of the transition, transformation for Newfield and it's going to be a big part of the future as well.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bob Morris. Please go ahead.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Lee.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You've had some great well results with the higher intensity completions both on the nine wells on the sections and then from the spacing pilots. At what point or how much data do you need and when do you think the time it would be to say, okay, we've got enough data to now move up our 1.1 million barrel type curve to then be able to use that on a go-forward basis? Because it appears beyond this year right now you're still assuming a higher well cost with the higher intensity completions but continuing to assume a 1.1 million barrel type curve in the guidance that you've given.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Bob, it's obvious. I've put in the notes that we're certainly investing with expectations of seeing continued uplift on the wells there. I think that we've been careful to caution everybody that we're going to go out and invest in learning as we're aggressively investing in learning this year, and part of learning is to find out where's the breakover point. So we're going reach...","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","...out there and test spacings that's maybe tighter than what we're going to actually use in ultimate development because we need to know and, frankly, industry needs to know. And the other aspect that I think we've been consistent on over the course of the last year talking about is \u2013 I love the results, it's great. We've released the Chlouber spacing pilot and put that information out. You can see they're tracking above the curve, the other pilot's tracking above the curve as well. We've talked about 60 to 90 days, so the trend line's really good, and we're excited about that. What are we doing? Well we're going to increase the density on the next couple of pilots that we're drilling and see \u2013 we see similar results. We need that information so we get the development right.","So the other aspect is time, and I think it's just imprudent to sit here and watch philosophically about our good early-term results because there's no surprise here for us at this stage. We're positive about what we're seeing, but we still have some things to learn, and that's true for the broader industry as well. So during the course of the year, as we have significant learnings, we'll keep you guys apprised and tell you what we think and, certainly, it's my hope that we'll be able to increase the type curve, but it's a game of vertical and horizontal offset and optimizing F&D. That's really what we're chasing because that's how you maximize return and value for the shareholders.","So we're going to be diligent in that. We think we'll get all the information we need in the course of 2017. We'll keep you guys updated as the year unfolds.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. I guess my follow-up then would be you said you're going to have some tighter spacing. Are you also doing any higher-intensity tests beyond the 2,100 pounds per foot and 2,100 gallons per foot? Are you testing any wells at a higher intensity?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes. I left that out on the comments, but we're also testing 3,000 pounds and 4,000 pounds presently. So we'll have some of that information here shortly as well. So it tells you that we're intrigued by the potential there and, hell, I look forward to telling you guys about exciting results in the road ahead. I want to spit it all out today.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So I look forward to hearing those. Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thanks, Bob. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Singer. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Can you talk to the backlog in cadence of Anadarko Basin wells and SCOOP\/STACK wells being placed on production this past quarter and then over the next few quarters? Really trying to juxtapose the strong well performance data with the trend in quarterly oil production both understanding the last quarter and then the next few.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. I think the easiest way to think about it, Brian, is that we've been transitioning out of the HBP mode where you have drill complete, produce single wells into pad drilling, and the two spacing pilots that we announced should be the first two that rolled off with that transition. So they were spud third quarter of last year, and we're seeing the production here regarding that first quarter 2017.","As we moved all of the rigs now to pad drilling, they're tied up until we complete the drilling operations on those DSUs, and we're able to move in and complete. So most of the production from the wells that are being drilled today, the DSUs that are being drilled today, won't show up until second, third quarter of 2017, and I think I referenced in the earlier comments that that's why you see the back end waiting on production growth, front-loaded on capital, back end-loaded on production. I talked about energizing the flywheel. That's why we get really excited about 2018 forward.","We've been consistent since the slide in prices. We're still very constructive in 2018 forward, and we love the assets and, frankly, we love where we're at. We'll see that rotation at the back half of 2017. It sets up a really, really, really exciting future state for the company.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then shifting to leverage. The comments in the discipline on staying within cash flow is definitely noted here. The 1.5 to 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, is that the hard and fast rule or is CapEx versus cash flow the hard and fast rule, and it goes to whether you like some management teams see some wiggle room to outspend cash flow if the fruits of those investments are not detrimental to leverage?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","I'm glad you asked that question, Brian. I'll try to come back to it. I want to start by making a couple of other comments. First of all, you can count on Newfield, our management team and our people, do the right thing at the right time; that's our commitment to you. And (30:12) funding into uncertainty is a fool's game. We will not repeat the mistakes of our industry's past. We worked hard to get to this place, and when you talk about sustainable double-digit growth inside of cash flow in a $50 to $60 world, we're pretty excited about that. And when you think about rotating that through in the cycle, we've also learned in spades the last couple of years that financial and capital discipline's pretty important. So we're going to maintain that.","I think we've tried to give you the color on how we're going to manage that. I think that's been pretty consistent. Many of you guys probably visited with Larry over time and I think he's been pretty consistent in the last couple of years in saying we're going to stay below 2.5 times. We like where we're at, and we're going to go fast when it makes sense to go fast, and we'll go slow when it makes sense to go slow because in a short cycle shale, you got to remain nimble. And if I knew absolutely what the product price was in the future, if you guys believe the $65 in 2018, you can easily adjust our numbers upwards. We've given you the visibility on the quality of our assets and what we can do in an oil price range that you actually see on the screen today. I think that's much more instructive.","The other thing we've done is we held rig counts flat instead of escalating rig counts. I mean, let's be honest, all of you guys are smart enough to know that if you increase activity, you increase growth rates and also increase capital spend and all things that we're talking about. So we gave you visibility of what we can do trading along in about 10 rigs; that's pretty cool. If I was running 20 rigs in 2018, I'd have a much higher growth rate. But you guys are smart enough to calculate that.","So we've given you what you need to know what we can do, and we're telling you what we will do, and that's the right thing at the right time every day. So we come to work, that's our mandate, and that's what we're going to do.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Tameron. Please go ahead.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Morning. A couple of questions.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning, David.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. If I look at slide 13, in net efficiencies, you talked about 21 to 24 wells per rig per year. Can you help me out reconcile on that worth versus the 85 \u2013 or 85 to 90, I guess, is the total number. If I just start thinking about 10 rigs running, what's \u2013 is there \u2013 am I missing something there on the math? As I think about the number of stacked rigs running, shouldn't it be higher than 85 to 90 spud?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well I think what it says is that there's a note down below, and I'll put my glasses on. It's three, David, assumes two to three well pads. All the other data is for single well pads, but you see that note.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Unknown Speaker","The other just difference, David, is that assumes all the wells are in pad and I think, as Lee included in his prepared remarks, we've about 30% or so of the wells that we will drill will still be on single pads as we finalize some of those additional DSUs getting tested. So it's not entirely a pad development, it's primarily a pad development.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And if I go out tomorrow and think about Lee make the decision, March 1 you're going to put a new pad in Section X and you drill a three-well pad. How long before you actually start to see that production? What's the current cycle time on that? Is it six months? Is it \u2013 what's the timeframe?","Unknown Speaker","It really depends on whether you're drilling XLs or SXLs.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Let's go SXLs.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah, the SXLs, that number is almost four and a half months by the time you actually get on that and actually start delivering production.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Unknown Speaker","It's approximately two and a half to three months if they were the shorter laterals.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","That was my comment on why it takes second, third, to see the results from the wells we're drilling today.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just let me squeeze in one follow-up. I just want to make sure I'm hearing the \u2013 hearing what you're saying about potential for acceleration. It sounds like it's just \u2013 it's more on cash flow than it is and I'm just thinking, let's say, returns get better, efficiencies continue, maybe they'll get the public service costs, and July rose around and you have more cash. Is that the determining factor or is it more of returns? And I know one leads the other, but...","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. We generate incremental cash through a supplement accelerator.","David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you, sir.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Biju Perincheril. Please go ahead.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Lee, you talked about the oil price being higher for ramping up activity. I was just wondering are there any other limitations in the near-term whether it's midstream or having more information on your sort of spacing patterns or just the organizational capacity that would prevent you from going much higher than 10 rigs in near-term?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","No. We maintained the organizational capacity, and I think the consolidation just makes us have \u2013 we can move faster and do more today than we could with the regional model, so we're in good shape on the manpower side. We built this plan cognizant of the oil price environment that we see in the road ahead, and we've given you some bandwidth around that. Clearly, no infrastructure holdups. We've got all of what we need there. We've been investing in infrastructure and got agreements in place for gathering transportation that gives us the ability to move product through the three-year time horizon that we're talking about here, so we don't have any holdups. We're just monitoring the market conditions, and we'll do the right thing at the right time.","And we're saying if you believe in higher pricing than what we're talking about then it's going to be pretty easy for you to see that under those scenarios we'll have higher activity levels than what we're giving you visibility today. But you can go to the screen and see the pricing today that we're using for our planning premise. I think that's a more prudent way of talking about what we're going to do and how we're thinking about the road ahead.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And a follow-up to that. Then if you think about CapEx next year, if you're keeping more or less a 10-rig program and if your sort of other CapEx is coming down, should we be modeling something less than $1 billion next year assuming service price is flat?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","No. What we said earlier or what I thought we said or what we tried to say is that the percentage of CapEx going into the other category will diminish through time. So we've got around $100 million or so of the $250 million that we're spending this year, which is 25% of the total $1 billion dollar-plan, going into exploration wells. So we're going to assess a lot of additional potential this year that we believe is going to add to our development drilling inventory in the road ahead. So that'll be behind us. And then the remaining infrastructure investments will diminish and we're thinking that somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% of the total budget.","So you pick your number. If it's $1 billion, you'd say it's $100 million; if it's $1.5 billion then it'd be $150 million, but somewhere in that range, about 10% of the total budget, will still be going into that other category, and that'll be land and infrastructure-related expansion, et cetera, that just comes with the normal development program.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yes.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Richard Tullis. Please go ahead.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Lee, looking at the recent leasing in the northern STACK area, Woodford in major counties, what's been the range of recent acquisition cost for this acreage?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well we were able to add those costs very competitively. I'll remind you our total cost for all of our Anadarko Basin position is less than $3,000 per acre. And this is all acreage in hand, and it's our policy not to talk about current activity on the ground.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","We had first-mover advantage here. You couldn't buy this acreage today.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And what's the 2017 activity plans for this acreage and how do the well costs compare to maybe Kingfisher County?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well I think the well cost probably be comparable in terms of target depths and what's going on there, so it's going to be very much similar. It's going to be targeting the same-age sediments, so that \u2013 you can kind of set that aside. And I think as far as activity, there's a lot of activity going on up there today by others. I kind of like having other people derisk acreage for us. And our team has ideas on wells that they might plan to test and evaluate that acreage, but part of our overall exploration program will be allocated in this direction, but probably not going to say anything more about that today.","Richard Merlin Tullis - Capital One Securities, Inc.","All right. Well that's all for me. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Sure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kyle Rhodes. Please go ahead.","Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. In your slides you mentioned that 90% of your legacy STACK acreage was HBPed. I'm just curious, outside the legacy area, what are the STACK expiries occurring over the next three years, and if we assume the static 10-rig Anadarko program, how many of those will be drilling outside the legacy area over the next three years?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well I don't have those numbers on top of my head, so I'd ask you to just follow up on Steve and Danny later. The rigs are going to move around. We'll not be adding a rig to drill these exploratory wells and dropping it, we'll be shifting the rig fleet around. So I think when \u2013 in the call script, we said the total rig count will probably bounce between 8 and 10. That accounts for the development drilling as well as exploratory drilling in the 2017 plan. The future will just depend on the results that we see from our 2017 program.","Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just to clarify, there's no production baked in for the 2017 exploration program. Correct?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","We will, generally, make appropriate allocations, and we expect that these are zones that'll produce. So there's some production baked in, but it's de minimis in total.","Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. And then just my follow-up, as we look at your hedge book into 2018, when are you guys thinking about layering in oil hedges? Is it \u2013 is there a target level you guys are looking to get to?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","I'll let Larry take that question.","Lawrence S. Massaro - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. The way we're looking at hedging right now, we've got the cash on the balance sheet which serves as the insurance policy against lower oil prices, so there's really no critical need to go out and hedge right now. Obviously, if we saw something \u2013 some prices rise materially different than our three-year outlook, we'd be optimistic and hedge into it. So just depends on what the macro environment is providing us, and we'll look to hedge. But as you can see, we're doing pretty well from a cash flow generation without the hedges in this plan.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. I think that that's kind of the statement of where we find ourselves today versus where we've been in times past when \u2013 where you can live comfortably in a $50 world. You don't have the pressures that you might have had previously to try to make sure that you lock in prices, progress it, and maintains exposure to the upside for the shareholders, which we presume most of you guys want. So we're constructive of \u2013 we'll do the right thing at the right time. We think that if there's a market move that makes sense then pull out hedges, but we haven't added for the reasons stated.","Kyle Rhodes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Makes sense, guys. Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kashy Harrison. Please go ahead.","Kashy Harrison - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Good morning.","Kashy Harrison - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yes. So most of mine have been asked, but just you look like you have some really strong NGL realizations during the fourth quarter of 2016. Was just wondering if you'll walk us through some of the drivers and share some color on where you think you're NGL realizations can go in 2017 and beyond.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Larry, color on the NGL side?","Lawrence S. Massaro - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. Well, look, we had \u2013 the NGL realizations came in higher than, I think, we've planned for the year. A lot of that is driven by the SCOOP. We're seeing really good realizations down there. We expect that to continue. No real changes, that we're forecasting we have, I think, it was \u2013 42% was the realizations for the year, so much higher than we thought. So strong market, it's built around our contracts and where we're priced on that NGL.","Kashy Harrison - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. In the press release, you all mentioned that well costs in the Uintah were significantly lower than where they've been historically. I was just wondering if you could share some additional color on any progress in that region.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well I think we've been clear that we've been working with a joint venture to continue to progress learning curve activities there, I think, that were indicating that we've seen good progress. We also have an additional work plan that \u2013 we'll give you guys an update at an appropriate time later this year.","Kashy Harrison - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. Sounds good. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one last question. We'll take our last question from Mike Kelly. Please go ahead.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Lee, you've mentioned a couple times that activity levels could ratchet higher with higher oil prices and, I guess, my question is why do you feel the need to see anything higher than $50 if you compare the asset base of the Permian, which I agree with, but your message is really kind of in stark contrast to the Permian guys who're excited about doubling the rig count in the face of $50 oil. Thanks.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Yeah. Well I think you look at the life cycle of a lot of the Permian companies that you're talking about, they probably haven't been around long enough to understand the commodity cycles and what's going on. You've got companies putting out forecasts of small staff; I'd be asking, how do you expect to execute multi-year if you want to take it there?","I think, Mike, when you really look at it, I could tell you about all the great and glorious things we can do at higher prices and our activity levels. We're seeing short-cycle shale, volatility that we think is going to be a continued part of the market up and down, and keeping your fingers crossed on how OPEC's going to behave are all reasons to be cautious and prudent as you navigate.","So we don't have pressures on HBP drilling, we don't have continuous drilling obligations on our acreage. There's a lot of other reasons that people have to engage in accelerated activity. We're in a position where we think we can just make good prudent decisions, and if going faster makes sense we'll go faster, but if the right answer is to go slower we're going to go slower. So we're just telling you exactly how we're going to behave.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Got it.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","I can generate gaudy production growth rates and cash flow growth rates with higher pricing. If higher pricing develops, that's where we're going to be; we'll have more activities. So that's what we're trying to communicate. We think this is a good plan, it shows the strength of the asset portfolio, and the fact that we considered and talked about an exciting forward plan at $50 is quite an accomplishment because two years ago I think we and all of industry were thinking that $50 and below is about survival. Today, $50 feels pretty good.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","A follow-up on that. What would get you to increase activity levels if we just assume $50 is the right number going forward?","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well I think the team continue to execute, deliver efficiencies, continuing to do the things that our team has demonstrated they can do year in and year out, improve profitability; all of that's going to translate to incremental cash. That incremental cash is going right into our high-return drilling portfolio, plain and simple. And I think the team has demonstrated that ability and we expect that they'll do it again.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah. Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Thank you.","Lee K. Boothby - Newfield Exploration Co.","Well I'd like to close by thanking everybody for dialing in.

For opening remarks and other housekeeping items, I will turn the call over to Steve Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Stephen C. Campbell - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this very early start today. By now, I hope you've had a chance to review our release from last evening at our @NFX, which had a lot of new details on our exciting STACK play in the Anadarko Basin. We plan to reference some of these slides in @NFX, so please have it ready during the discussion.","Speakers on our call today include Chairman Lee Boothby; our COO, Gary Packer; and our CFO, Larry Massaro, who will all be available at the end of the prepared remarks today to answer any of your questions. As always, please limit your time during Q&A to one question and one follow-up. This simply allows us to get to more of your questions.","Before handing the call over to Lee, let me remind you that today's call is being recorded and it will be available on our website along with today's earnings release, the accompanying financial tables and other non-GAAP reconciliations. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking estimates and assumptions that are based on our current views and our most reasonable expectations. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discussed this morning. A full disclaimer is provided in our earnings release and in our most recent filing to the SEC.","Thanks again for dialing in, and I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman, Lee Boothby.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and we appreciate your interest and investment in our company. Newfield is delivering strong results today across the company's portfolio. We will see in today's @NFX that we met or exceeded our expectations across all of our operating regions. Although the focus today is on the Anadarko Basin, team Newfield is (1:46) extremely well.","We had markedly lower well costs in the Anadarko and Williston Basins and we extended the track record of exceeding production expectations in the Eagle Ford, Williston, and Uinta Basins. Our teams are looking for innovative ways to lower operating expenses, enhance margins across the business, and their efforts are flowing through to our bottom line.","I'm confident we have the people and assets in place today to emerge stronger and more profitable once commodity prices stabilize. But make no doubt about it, these are challenging and volatile times in the E&P business. After about five years of oil prices in the $90s, we are today coming to grips with oil prices in the $50s and implications of a lower prolonged price scenario.","We are proactively making strategic decisions to manage our business through today's cycle. Our business plan differentiates Newfield today as we focus on two primary issues. First, ensuring that our balance sheet remains strong and that we have ample liquidity in place to build shareholder value during today's oil price environment, and to emerge stronger when prices recover. Our hedges provide certainty in our cash flows through early 2017.","Second, we are high-grading our investments. Today, nearly all of our activity is in the Anadarko Basin. There is a healthy tension between our desire to build inventory in the Anadarko Basin and accelerate STACK development and the need to protect liquidity.","Today, we increased our capital budget to $1.4 billion, up $200 million. The increase relates to adding about 20,000 net acres to extend our positions in the Anadarko Basin, our decision to accelerate drilling to hold our acreage and move into full-field development. Anadarko Basin is economically resilient and our returns are improving. By drilling an additional 15 wells in 2015, we will offset about $40 million of lease renewal expenses and ensure that 100% of our acreage is HBP by the end of next year.","We believe that our business plan carefully balances these important issues. The financial transactions we executed earlier this year strengthened our balance and ensured that we have ample liquidity to not only weather a prolonged period of lower oil prices but also to succeed and add value. We will maintain a strong balance sheet. We are focused on maintaining our leverage ratios at or near current levels, and we would look to sell other noncore assets as required to preserve our strong balance sheet and liquidity.","Exactly one year ago today, we were growing more concerned about the trajectory of oil prices and moved aggressively to strengthen our hedge position. Our fears were founded and our hedges have been instrumental in preserving our cash flow. In mark-to-market at the end of July, our hedge position would add about $490 million in revenue in 2015 and an additional $250 million in 2016. This gives us higher certainty in our future cash flow, and we view our hedges as a differentiator amongst our peers. Our corporate development team and strategic planning teams have done an excellent job of mitigating risk and putting our company in a position of relative strength and I applaud their efforts.","Over the last five years, we took dramatic steps to better focus our portfolio in capital investments. Before the oil price decline last year, we had executed about $2.5 billion in non-strategic asset sales, and used the large (5:11-5:13) the development of SCOOP and STACK, and this has paid off. We will continue to consider using sale of additional non-strategic assets to fund our future acceleration plans.","In early 2015, we quickly cut our capital expenditures and funneled more than 70% of our planned investments into the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have an asset today that warrants investment and provides strong returns at today's oil prices. You will clearly see today that our returns in the Anadarko Basin continue to improve.","Even with the backdrop of low oil prices, we believe it makes sense to further consolidate into one of the industry's best plays and use our competitive advantage in the Anadarko Basin. Competition for acreage in the STACK region has increased in the face of better drilling results. We are successfully adding late-stage leasehold and extensional acreage today. With the disconnect between buyer and seller expectations for acquisition opportunities in the region, we view acreage additions as a better value proposition to exploit our distinct operating advantage. Perhaps the drop in oil prices and the realization that oil prices could stay lower for longer will create more reasonable acquisition opportunities for us in the future.","Before we go on to the second quarter details, let me quickly summarize what I believe are the key takeaways in today's operations update. Number one, our well results in STACK are improving. In today's @NFX, we share with you results from an additional 17 STACK wells and continued strong performance from our SCOOP development drilling. To date, we have drilled and completed 46-operated SXL wells in STACK.","Number two, we are rapidly production-delineating our STACK acreage as we push to get it held by production. The wells we have drilled to date are geographically dispersed, and we continue to push rigs towards the edges as we align drilling plans with lease requirements. We are encouraged by the consistent and commercial results we are realizing across the acreage. The acceleration in STACK allows us to minimize lease renewal cost through higher value drilling investments. The rigs we've added are on a well-to-well basis and we have the ability to quickly slow investments if oil prices further deteriorate our cash flow outlook.","Number three, our STACK wells are oil wells. We built our position in STACK in the oil window and our wells are averaging about 80% black oil in the first 30 days production. To date, average black oil volumes from our 46 wells are outperforming our type-curve assumptions. Slide 11 in @NFX depicts this outperformance and supports why our confidence is continuing to grow.","Later in our remarks we'll better explain how the play transitions from wet gas to black oil across the play fairway. Before, we were testing multiple geologic horizons and this will be a STACKed development play. To date, we have successfully tested the Upper and Lower Meramec as well as the Woodford. There are other prospective zones that we plan to test in the coming months. To date, about 70% of our STACK wells have been drilled and completed in the Meramec shale.","We are rapidly lowering our well cost in the Anadarko Basin. This is particularly impressive in STACK where we are not yet in full-field development. Recent wells have been drilled in as few as 12 days, and our recent wells are averaging about $7.9 million, including facilities. We hope to keep a good portion of these savings even in a rising oil price environment. Our well costs today are down about $600,000 from our first quarter update and we know that in development mode we will easily shave another $1 million or more off the completed well cost. By analogy, simply look at what our team is delivering today in the Williston Basin.","And lastly, we're accelerating activity and the timing to full-field development. By year-end, about 60% of our acreage in STACK will be held by production and all of our acreage will be HBP by the end of next year. With this increased activity, we now expect that our fourth quarter production from the Anadarko Basin will average about 71,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net and we expect to deliver strong and economic growth from SCOOP and STACK in 2016.","You will hear more on these topics when Gary provides our operational update a little later. I'll now turn the call over to Larry Massaro to summarize our second quarter financial results. Larry?","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Lee, and good morning everyone. Financially the second quarter was very solid. We are seeing the combined benefits of lower service costs, learning curve improvements and efficiency gains and our own efforts to reduce expenses and improve margins across the business.","Year-to-date, we've invested about $730 million excluding capitalized interest and internal cost. We expect that our investments in the second half of the year will approximate the first half, including about $400 million in the third quarter and $275 million in the fourth quarter. Our capital investment budget for the year is $1.4 billion, up $200 million.","The increase is attributable to 20,000 new acres in the Anadarko Basin, increased drilling activity, and faster drilling times. In terms of production, we extended a healthy streak of beating our projections through solid execution of strong well performance. Our domestic production in the second quarter came in at the upper end of our guidance despite losing about 200,000 barrels equivalent related to weather and our midstream provider's curtailment in SCOOP.","Total production in the second quarter was 14.1 million barrels equivalent, of which 51% was oil and 65% was liquids. Our domestic production grew about 7% quarter-over-quarter to 12.4 million barrels equivalent. Adjusted for asset sales, this represents year-over-year growth of 13%. More importantly, our domestic liquids production was up 22% year-over-year.","The strength in our production year-to-date has allowed us to raise our full year guidance to 53.5 million to 55 million barrels equivalent with all the increase attributed to our domestic operations. Our domestic production is now expected to be 48.5 million to 50 million barrels equivalent.","Discretionary cash flow from operations was $347 million, or $2.14 per share, topping consensus estimates. Adjusted net income for the quarter, excluding several one-time items detailed in our earnings release, was $0.46 per share. The most significant item was a non-cash ceiling test write-down related to the significant drop in oil prices. (12:05-12:07) expected and was in line with our recent disclosures in our Form 10-Q. This is a non-cash charge. It has no impact on our credit facility or our debt covenants. These impairments are a function of full-cost accounting and significantly lower commodity price in the 12-month trailing average.","We have taken both prompt and significant steps to improve our cost structure across the company. In the second quarter, our reoccurring lease operating expenses was well below guidance at $4.60 per BOE. Second quarter LOE was lower than our full-year run rate due to the timing of expected expenditures. We, again, lowered our full-year LOE expectation to $5.20 per BOE.","As we noted last quarter, our recent restructuring and head count reductions will reduce future G&A expense by $40 million a year, and our annual interest expense will drop by about $10 million a year due to the lower interest rates associated with our debt refinancing earlier this year.","As Lee referenced, we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. As we seek to leverage our competitive advantage in the Anadarko Basin and our desire to transition to full field development in STACK later next year, we know we must tailor our investment levels to the oil price environment and our cash flow expectations.","If oil prices stay in a sub-$50 per barrel range, we would likely reduce our 2016 expenditures to maintenance mode levels. We estimate that we could maintain our domestic production levels for about $1 billion. Should prices strengthen to $55 to $60 per barrel, we are capable of strong domestic production growth supported by improving rates of return with a capital budget similar to 2015 investment levels.","Newfield clearly has high-quality options today. At the end of the second quarter, there was nothing drawn on our revolver and we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity. We are fortunate to be well ahead with cash flow significantly protected into 2017.","I'll turn the call over to Gary Packer for the operations update.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Larry. As you know, we are only allocating drilling capital to two areas today, the Anadarko and the Williston Basins. So let me give you an update on the Anadarko Basin and share some recent updates from our operations in STACK. In addition to STACK, we continue to see great results from our SCOOP and Springer plays and look forward to testing other potential geological horizons in the basin over time.","During the second quarter, we brought online 14 new SCOOP oil wells, including our first SXL well in the Springer shale. We continue to see good results in the development, where we are running five rigs today (15:03-15:05) more heavily to STACK and SCOOP oil, and the results are evident to our high oil cuts. We have eight rigs running in STACK today.","One of our most encouraging data points in today's update relates to our consistency in the STACK wells. On slide 7 in @NFX, we provide 30-day average production rates for 17 new wells stretched across the acreage, which covers more than 300 square miles. We now have 46 SXL wells, of which 32 have been completed in the Meramec shale.","We are confident that a significant portion of our acreage will be developed with STACK wells in both the Meramec and the Woodford. We have drilled five pseudo-pilots to date to test horizontal and vertical well spacing, some of which have been online for more than one year now. Although early, these pilots are providing encouraging results.","Please reference the geologic illustration on slide 12 in @NFX. To date, we have successfully tested multiple wells in Upper and Lower Meramec as well as the Woodford. We have more than 700 foot of saturated interval across the large portion of our acreage and we have taken whole cores throughout the acreage to better understand reservoir quality and reservoir thickness.","As expected, our STACK results continue to improve, reflecting the rapid advancements we are making in our drilling and completion operations. Our most recent wells have higher 30- and 60-day rates and not all the wells have 90-day production rates yet. On a well-head basis, the oil percentage from these wells averaged nearly 80% over the first 30 days.","We are not surprised by these high oil cuts. In fact, we intentionally captured the oil window with our initial leasing concept. Slide 9 is important to understand. As you move from the dry gas Cana Field to the north and east across our acreage, the play transitions from a wet gas to a black oil. Note that the 30-day average oil cuts across the acreage.","In addition to our first Meramec well drilled some four years ago now, we also had production data for more than 3,000 vertical wells drilled over the last 50 years. These wells commingled production from a multiple of zones all sourced by the Woodford. The GOR or gas\/oil ratios we are seeing today are very consistent with historical production data, our pre-drill reservoir modeling, and our type curves. Recent well results from our North STACK acreage helped validate our encouragement, and our GOR assumptions appear to be very sound.","In the first quarter, we introduced slide 11, which originally just showed our expected oil cumes over the first decade of production. Today, we enhance disclosure by providing you with the actual production from the 46 SXL wells we have drilled to date. You can see that the wells are highly correlative to our type curve. Furthermore, we today provided actual cumes on 21 Meramec wells with tighter frac cluster spacing. Some of these wells have now been online for nearly one year.","Tighter frac cluster spacing is generating significantly higher oil production and has now become our norm. We continue to optimize our completion design. You can see we are making great strides. Based on our 950,000 barrels of oil equivalent type curve and today's lower cost, our wells are expected to pay out in just two years. Our returns are being enhanced by higher oil production early and the significant reductions we are making in well costs. See slides 14 and 15 in @NFX.","It's important to understand that more than half of the cost savings we have seen to date are related to efficiencies as demonstrated by reductions in days versus depth and not simply lower service costs.","Our most recent drill and complete cost in STACK is $7.9 million, down $600,000 from our first quarter average. We frequently participate in wells operated by others. And from this data, (19:20-19:22) industry in drilling days and cost. Our days to depth on our most recent operated wells have been drilled in as few as 12 days.","The real prize lies in development mode, where we are certain that we will achieve at least another $1 million savings in our completed well cost. And our teams are pushing to get us there as soon as possible.","As for other active development plays, let me close with a quick update on the Williston Basin. Our team continues to find innovative ways to improve our margins through faster drilling times, improved efficiencies and optimized completions. Recent SXL wells in the Williston Basin have been drilled in about 14 days and for an all-in cost with facilities of about $5.5 million. Newfield has a long and proven history of driving learning curves and improving returns in full-field development.","The Williston is a great example. You can review recent history and see the same trends in the Eagle Ford, the Granite Wash, the Arkoma, and in SCOOP. The Williston is a great proxy for where we will ultimately be heading in our STACK development.","I'll now turn the call back to Lee for closing remarks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gary. Gary and his teams are delivering excellent results throughout our operating regions today (20:44-20:45) excel in today's environment. You can tell from the tone today that we are excited about our recent results in the Anadarko Basin. This is a large-scale resource play and we have the people and the operational expertise to continue improving results and enhancing margins.","We're focused on the right metrics today. We're executing across the company. We are high-grading our investments. We have effectively managed our risk. We are aggressively attacking costs and expenses and improving margins. We're exploiting our competitive advantage in the Anadarko Basin. And we are mindful of our balance sheet and we'll work to maintain a strong liquidity position.","I will close by simply saying Newfield has high quality options today. To date, we have delivered outstanding operating results and we intend to deliver on our full-year objectives. Yes, these are challenging times, but Newfield is well-positioned to continue delivering value to its stockholders today (21:40-21:43).","Thanks for your investment in our company and we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Dave Kistler with Simmons Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, guys.","Unknown Speaker","Morning, Dave.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Hey, thank you so much for all the additional disclosures. Really helpful and certainly showing a consistency that's appreciated. One thing when I was looking at the forward oil guidance, I was hoping maybe you could dive into this a little bit more. Obviously implies a trend upward still for the balance of the year. But that's primarily domestic-oriented with international coming down. Can you just talk about the nuances of those two things?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, as far as the relationship, clearly, domestically, we're driving the oil production out of the Anadarko Basin and you're going to see a significant ramp up as we look into the third and the fourth quarter. If you look at international, as far as the cash flow that's going to be coming off of that asset, it's rather flat in 2015 and 2016 and then will decline in the future years. As far as production goes, we'll see production down in China about 20% or 25% next year but we're going to preserve the cash flows just because we'll have a lack of capital spending. So everything is coming in exactly as we had anticipated both domestically and internationally.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Okay.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Dave, just to clarify if your question was in regards to this year, the China guidance is unchanged at 5 million barrels. The difference between the second quarter and the third quarter is simply timing of lifting. We had an extra lifting that moved into the second quarter. The daily rate is around 26,000 barrels a day, so that's our peak rate from the wells that are on.","David W. Kistler - Simmons & Company International","Well, I appreciate that clarification. That's exactly what I was looking for. And then, as we think (23:46-23:50) curve that you guys are climbing rapidly in the Anadarko Basin, can you talk a little bit about how you balance downspacing, interval testing and completion science in this low-cost environment?","Does it make more sense to find an area that holds all the production that you know you're generating strong returns and just pursuing that aggressively? Or does this more sort of balance the production testing, all of these things make more sense? Just if you give us some clarity around that.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll start, Dave. If you look at @NFX, we've got the dimensions on kind of the acreage footprint. You do a quick math on that, you're talking about an area that's in excess of 1,200 square miles. If you take a look at the phase envelope data, where we've got all of the oil yield data, the 80% liquid yield, and we've kind of highlighted where you moved from the dry gas into the wet gas condensate window into our oily acreage.","Right now with the drilling results that have been accumulated, driven by Newfield, the addition of some of the \u2013 our friends in the industry, offset operators if you will, you've got a box that's about 30 miles by 50 miles diagonally across that acreage position. So some 1,500 square miles that's been production delineated, and we're talking production delineated with (25:17-25:20) and it's a large resource.","Our focus, first and foremost: HBP the acreage. The acceleration program allows us to finish that process before year-end 2016. We will continue to test laterals on either side of lease lines, and the paired spacing information that we've put out to date just makes sense, but it doesn't make sense in our view to move away from the focus on HBP at this point to drill full spacing pilots.","Unknown Speaker","Just no need.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The well results have been so amazingly consistent, top to bottom through the 700-foot thick interval that I'm kind of excited about thinking we'll get into development mode, we'll have a fully HBP footprint, and we'll have a couple of miles between producing wells and we'll be able to let the team go in and develop it the right way right up front, so we're going to stick to our plan.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. My first question is about those eastern wells. There was, I guess, a different IP30 is how you're thinking of the economics of those wells versus those due west and if there's any changes there in terms of cost or decline curves. I know it's early but if there's any conclusions.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the conclusions are we're excited about those eastern tests. You'll recall that that was part of the plan. Actually in 2014 into 2015, we wanted to expand the footprint. You'll note that there are overlays structurally across that acreage footprint that kind of give you a picture that in the far eastern edge, northeastern portion of the acreage footprint, TVD depths are about 8,000 feet. The western edge, you approach 12,000 feet.","So clearly there is a 4,000-foot-or-so change in elevation from east to west. But as far as the well results, they are very much in line with our expectations; and since the ultimate targets are shallower on the eastern side, we would expect ultimately in development mode that those wells will be cheaper than the wells drilled on the western side of the acreage. But at this point I would say very excited and positive and results in line with expectations.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And my follow-up is in the average wells, a couple were not included in the list at sub-optimal completion, could you just then maybe talk about how you were completing the wells and how you are now completing the wells?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll let Gary give you some color on that.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Subash, there were only two wells that we had excluded from the data that we provided disclosure on. Those wells both tested larger stage spacing and cluster spacing, and as a result of that, they achieved rates that are really not representative of what we think our forward plan is. The number that we have in there, those wells produced a 60-day rate of about 625 barrels of oil equivalent a day or about 80% of the tighter spacing wells. So still very interesting wells but we just don't think represents what our forward plan is.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Subash, I know Gary talked about it in the call, but if we look at slide 11, the tighter frac clusters in the Meramec are yielding higher than accelerated oil recovery, hence the focus on the tighter cluster spacing now that we have proven that that's the way to go in this play.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jason Smith - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Jason.","Jason Smith - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","So we \u2013 you guys in the past have done a great job of monetizing your non-core assets over the past few years. With the clear focus on the Anadarko, can you just maybe give an update on where you stand on that process and kind of where all the moving pieces fit in?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the steps we took earlier this year, certainly the equity raise and the revolver extension and the debt offering that Larry talked about earlier leave us with $2 billion of liquidity there. So I'd say, first and foremost, we don't have any pressing needs to sell any assets today, but I think we've been crystal clear \u2013 at least, I hope we've been. I'll try to make it crystal clear in response to your question.","But the non-strategic assets, it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. And we know how hard it was to sell $2.5 billion of non-strategic assets in a $90 world. We have no pressing need to sell it, but certainly at the right place and time we would sell non-strategic assets to further accelerate activity in the Anadarko.","Just go on record for that statement, but all things being equal, since we don't need to sell, I'd probably prefer to sell in something other than a $50 oil price environment.","Jason Smith - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. I appreciate that. And also, I appreciate the commentary around 2016. So I want to make sure, first, that I understand that 55% to 60% is kind of the bogey right now for grow or don't grow. And then I think you guys were at 10 rigs in the Anadarko last quarter. Can you just give an update on where you are today and what lead time you need if you do decide to ramp further?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Larry give you some color. And if he forgets anything like he sometimes does, I'll jump in and cover him. How about that?","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Look, guys. I think at 55% to 60%, we're going to have a nice growth rate, so I'm not worried about our ability to grow differentially in the industry. When you get to the $50 in the current oil price environment, we're still going to be in more of a maintenance mode, but that still really gives us some modest growth, so don't look for us at $50 to go flat. We'll still have a little growth in the portfolio. The STACK and SCOOP plays are going to continue to drive that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Du Boff with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert E. Du Boff - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. I saw you added 20,000 acres in Anadarko Basin. Can you just talk about how costs are trending for picking up acreage and the potential to continue to add there and basically what is your, I guess, threshold in terms of looking at maybe the gassier side of the STACK?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, Robert, I appreciate your question. I think we've given all the color that I plan to give at this time. We'll keep you posted on our efforts there as the year unfolds, and at year-end we'll give you a full update on our acreage position, where we're at. Let's just say that we're very pleased with the additions and I think it makes good sense that we're able to execute on our clear competitive advantage in the basin.","Robert E. Du Boff - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Understood. And if I can get a follow-up then. Just hoping to get maybe a little more color on that $7 million level target for the STACK. Does that just purely represent savings in full-development mode? Or does that contemplate any further service cost cuts?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, yeah. What I said in the call was that hats off to Gary and our operating teams and our management. Between Gary and the operating teams, they've just done a fantastic job. I mean, the progress in the Williston Basin, the progress in the Anadarko Basin, both SCOOP and STACK, industry-leading results, today drilling STACK wells in as little as 12 days. You go back and look at the @NFX and see the progression year by year.","So these are the best kind of gains. Largely, there are gains from exceptional teamwork, exceptional talents driving down the learning curve. So when we talk about experiences in the second quarter, I'll tell you that today my expectation was 7.5-ish million dollars, probably (33:06) today. We're going to drive those towards $6.5 million and hopefully in the course of moving new development, as we indicated in the call, there's another $1 million or so to drive out of the equation.","You can look at the Williston Basin. You can see what we've done there. Gary referenced the Arkoma. If you want to go all the way back to Granite Wash, we've done it every place we choose to deploy. So these are normal, natural progressions that we expect to accrue and we're running ahead of schedule. So at that point I would tell you that very pleased. We've got $7 million in the sights, and we're not going to stop there.","Gary, you got any color you want to add?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I mean there's no further service cost reductions baked in to our forecast.","Operator","And our next question comes from Leo Mariani with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more detail on some of the spacing tests that you guys have in place at this point. And then, I guess, you guys feel confident at this point that the Upper and the Lower Meramec are distinct reservoirs and could you maybe talk about some of the different spacing numbers you guys are using for inter-well spacing between the Woodford, Lower and Upper Meramec?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","In terms of the spacing, remember that we haven't done any full pilots at this point, so the spacing that we've got we're giving you all that we have, which is, I think, it's a collection of five different, two-well pairs that are drilled on either side of lease lines. If you go back and you look at this @NFX and the last publication, all of those are diagrammed. So what we've done is we've located on either side of the lease line and we varied spacing down to as tight as 880 feet. 880 feet would be kind of six wells per horizon, and we've said consistently that we're very, very encouraged with the results that we've seen.","It's all we have at this point. We've tested multiple levels within the Upper Meramec, multiple levels within the Lower Meramec, and we've tested the Woodford. So we've got three horizons that are all working very, very nicely and, frankly, beyond that I'll stick to the story that we've told since we announced the play back in 2013. Ultimately, we expect that there'll probably be three to five horizons exploited in the STACK play across the acreage footprint. The other side (35:29) get at HBP and continue to improve the data and we'll keep you informed as things unfold.","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. I guess, just jumping over to your domestic oil production guidance in the third quarter. Just noticing that it's ticking down a little bit versus the second quarter numbers. Was just looking for some color beyond that, if it's just well timing at this point or maybe there's some conservatism there?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Primarily, what you're looking at is continued declines in those basins that we're no longer investing in, both Uinta Basin and Eagle Ford. And then it's just routine timing of pads and our developments in both SCOOP and STACK.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dan Guffey with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. Congrats on a really good quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks, Dan.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you, Dan.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","You guys have mentioned 70% of your STACK wells have targeted the Meramec. I guess, how should we think of that split going forward between the Meramec and the Woodford? And then I guess, can you discuss any performance differences between the two intervals?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that there's a slide, Dan \u2013 I don't know if you've had a chance to look at that, Dan, but you can see how we've kind of distributed the wells to date throughout the section, and 70% in the Meramec. The Meramec is the thicker of the two intervals when you think about Meramec, Woodford in terms of the pair. So, logically speaking, you could almost see a third, a third, a third-type distribution. Just happens to be that 70% of the wells to date have been drilled in the Meramec. And this is kind of by plan.","So we'll continue to work through that progression. I think when we get to the end of HBP-ing the operated footprint out here, we'll probably have some few hundred plus wells that we'll be able to look at as far as the data set. And once we see the finish line for HBP, then we'll be able to start laying out kind of the full development spacing pilots and get the data that we need to really optimize that development. But at this point, we'll continue to progress as we are.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Probably another one of the drivers that we have there is most of our historical performance, whether it's in the Arkoma or down in SCOOP, is on the Woodford, so we're preferentially investing in the Meramec because it's the newest of the plays and it's, quite honestly, has a considerable inventory and we're continuing to progress our learnings there and therefore focus on the early drilling.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Remember the original \u2013 Gary makes a good point \u2013 the original STACK discovery well was a Woodford test. That led to the recognition that the Meramec was a target. So really good point.","Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. I guess kind of ask a little bit differently, trying to look at your inventory. I guess, can you break out the percent of your total acreage that's prospective for the Woodford? And then how much do you think is prospective for both the Upper and the Lower? I know it changes as you go across the basin but just trying to think of how many \u2013 I know you mentioned three to five intervals, but how much of that is consistent across the entire acreage block?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think that's probably all the color we're going to give today. We update our inventory calc annually, so you can expect the next update on inventory potential to be early next year. We had 5,500 locations on the books in the Anadarko Basin starting this year and I can say the well results make us feel a little bullish with regard to the upside from there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning. Lee, on that inventory question or you mentioned three to five horizons. Just to clarify, is that just in the Meramec and Woodford or are you including some of the shallower horizons there like the (39:35)?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","When we're talking about STACK at this point, we're talking about the interval from the top of the Meramec to the base of the Woodford and anything in between.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And can you remind us again that 5,500 locations that was included at year-end future locations? What was the assumption in terms of new horizons?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We took the data that we had at year-end based on the tests and the information that had been accrued. I think if you did the simple math, you could probably come back and say that it was around two on average.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks. And then, on the completion improvements. We've talked about our perf clusters. Can you talk about what also are you planning to do rest of the year? For instance, is there any plans to test a slickwater completions versus the gel fracs that you're doing today?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. There's a number of things that we're going to be experimenting with, everything from gel loading, the amount of proppant we use to the type of proppant we use. We're spending a considerable amount of time looking at different diversion techniques, where we can actually go with broader stages, cut our costs, but nevertheless get the same amount of stimulated rock volume.","We're experimenting with the fluids. Historically, we've been pretty much using crosslink. Today, we're actually looking at not pure slickwater jobs, but something that would be viewed as more of a hybrid job. And then the other thing we're doing is we're looking at actually using field-produced waters to make up the completion fluid. So our teams are spending a considerable amount of time looking at all of those things.","Operator","And our next question comes from Josh Silverstein with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, good morning guys. I was hoping you guys could just touch a little bit on some of the midstream and the processing and the takeaway capacity out of the basin. I know it limited you guys by a little bit this quarter. So anything that you guys are working on with some of your providers to enhance those facilities?","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So we were limited a little bit by a turnaround on SCOOP. That was a little bit unexpected. That's since been corrected and we're at full capacity down there. We don't see any limitations in the STACK. We haven't had any limitations there on gas; that doesn't produce that much gas. What we're looking at there is creative ways to go gather the oil in lower cost. So our focus right now is on that. We don't see limitations coming out of the basin. There's a number of projects that are being discussed. We'll continue to expand that whole corridor for the STACK and SCOOP, so we're looking at participating in those studies and thinking about how we're going to grow our production there. We're obviously constrained at the moment.","Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. Great. And then I know you talked about high-grading to more of the oilier areas within the Anadarko Basin for next year's program. Is there a high-grading even within the Meramec play as of this point? And I wonder if you're thinking about the Springer opportunity. Is it going from maybe just a handful of wells to closer to 20 or 30 wells next year? Just to think about the direction there.","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","First of all within the Meramec, we haven't seen any opportunities to high grade. We're seeing pretty uniform performance like we talked about, so nothing within the Meramec. As we think about SCOOP in the Woodford, there will be a general trend for us to move east into the more oily Woodford versus the wet gas Woodford down in SCOOP, so certainly, there's going to be a move there. The plan in 2016 is really not set yet. I anticipate there'll be more Springer activity than what we experienced this year. But still it's more \u2013 still in a state of flux there to determine exactly what those numbers would be.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Remember the Springer, there's no real pressing need to install HBP by our Woodford activity to have to accelerate activity, so it's simply the high-grading optionality and we'll execute based on our plans and forward forecast.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ipsit Mohanty with GMP. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, guys.","Unknown Speaker","Morning.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Just looking at your slide 9. I appreciate the kind of details you've given. But as you go about HBP-ing the STACK, what's your plan to keeping the oily consistent, especially when you're going to the Southwestern part, you're getting into the dry gas window. Just curious to see whether you would go ahead and sort of actively drill that to hold it or would you just pass on that? Any color on that, please.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So the answer is we're going to HBP our entire STACK footprint. All the wells that we're drilling within the Newfield STACK position generate attractive economics in today's commodity price world. The dry gas, the reference is Cana proper. It's a historical play there in the Anadarko Basin, some big well-respected competitors in there, like Devon, Cimarex, and Continental. They own that; it's HBP. Frankly, if we'd had the opportunity to add that acreage into the portfolio when we were putting this position together, we'd have probably done it.","So when you think about Newfield, I think the acreage description that we've given you and kind of the yield map, if you will, tells you the story. You go back and drill inside of the delineated wells, you're going to see average liquid yields in line with what we've delivered today. We just don't see that there's going to be any variance going forward.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Okay. And if I heard you correctly, you're running eight rigs in the STACK now. Could you please give us the number of rigs you ran in the SCOOP and STACK in 2Q and currently?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","In 2Q, we would have had five rigs running in SCOOP and five rigs running in STACK.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","And right now?","Gary D. Packer - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Five rigs running in SCOOP and eight rigs running in STACK.","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, guys. Great quarter.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And it looks like we have time for one more question. And we'll take our final question from Dan Braziller. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Daniel C. Braziller - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just sorting through the CapEx guidance raise, trying to get an incremental net well cost. Do you know what the average working interest is expected to be for the 15 additional wells you'll be drilling? And then, also on CapEx, wondering the difference between the $730 million that you've spent so far in the first half compared to the $927 million on the cash flow statement, and if both numbers include the recent acreage acquisition or not. Thanks.","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, the working interest that we're in this kind of net series of wells are kind of in the 75% working interest range. As far as when you look at the capital that we spent in the first half of the year on an accrual basis, we spent a little over $700 million. We did, on a cash basis, spend about $900 million. There was \u2013 the difference was the carry-in from the prior year. And so that was what you saw, was the kind of big working capital come in in the first quarter and work that off and you can see that kind of go back to a steady state the rest of the year.","Daniel C. Braziller - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then the acquisition cost \u2013 is part of it in there or \u2013 and can you disclose how much of it is in the first half then?","Lawrence S. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. The acquisition was \u2013 as far as the acquisition (47:41), the majority of that's going to be in both the second and third quarter. You can see it smooth out into those three quarters. We've got some of that in the second quarter, but you also see some trickle into the third.","Daniel C. Braziller - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's it. Wait till later this year. We'll give you more color.","Operator","And that concludes our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks.","Lee K. Boothby - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, operator. Thank you all for your investment interest in Newfield. We appreciate your questions today. We look forward to updating you on our progress for the remainder of the year. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you and have a great day."],"15612":["Newfield Exploration Co. (NYSE:NFX) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call February 25, 2015 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Lee Boothby - Chairman, President & CEO","Gary Packer - EVP & COO","Analysts","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim","Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets","Michael Rowe - TPH","Dan Guffey - Stifel","Ipsit Mohanty - GMP Securities","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Dave Kistler - Simmons & Company","David Tameron - Wells Fargo","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research","David Deckelbaum - KeyBanc","Operator","Welcome to Newfield Exploration's fourth quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded and before we get started, one housekeeping matter. Our discussion with you today will contain forward-looking statements such as strategic initiatives and plans, estimated production and timing, drilling and development plans, expected cost reductions and planned capital expenditures.","Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, they are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors and risks, some of which may be unknown.","Please see Newfield's 2014 annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause actual results to vary. Forward-looking statements made during this call speak only as of today's date and unless legally required, Newfield undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.","In addition, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with Newfield's earnings release and any other applicable disclosures, are available on the Investor Relations page of Newfield's website at www.newfield.com.","Before turning the call over to Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lee Boothby, let me provide a housekeeping request. Please limit your questions to one question and one follow up. This will help Management get to more of your questions today.","Mr. Boothby, please go ahead, sir.","Lee Boothby","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks for joining our year-end 2014 conference call. We disclosed a great deal of news yesterday afternoon along with our 10-K. By now I hope you've read through the information, which included our fourth quarter earnings and operations results, our year-end 2014 proved reserves, our 2015 capital budget along with our production and cost guidance for the first quarter and full year and a detailed @NFX publication which includes lots of new information on our results to date and our strong rates of return in our plays in the Anadarko Basin.","Since late last year we have been laser-focused on preparing our 2015 game plan. We have proactively adjusted our business plan to align with the reality of low oil prices. And our priorities for 2015 are very clear. First, our plan preserves financial strength and liquidity. One could call it value over volumes. But we've reduced our capital investments by about 40% year-over-year and focused our dollars on our highest-return area, the Anadarko Basin.","Second, we want to ensure that our STACK play is HBP. We have worked to production-delineate more than 300 square miles and we are fortunate that we can couple the need to HBP with some of the best returns in the industry at today's prices. The recent results in our STACK play are excellent and we are delivering 30% to 40% returns at today's commodity prices and service cost. We believe our margins will continue to improve as the year progresses.","Third, we want to be opportunistic. We continue to add to our position in the Anadarko Basin, which today is approximately 300,000 net acres. We are hopeful that there will be opportunities for us to consolidate through bolt-on deals in the Anadarko Basin and we want the financial strength to do so. Newfield is a leader in the area and we are building scale in a region where we have a proven and distinct competitive advantage.","And lastly, we are preserving our options for the future. Although today's plan was prepared in response to the reality of today's market, the key ingredients of our long term plan are largely unchanged. At the right time, we will again focus on stronger levels of liquid production and cash flow growth. We have a deep portfolio of liquids-rich assets that are largely held by production.","Before I get into the specifics of our plan, let me quickly cover our 2014 highlights. In 2014 we demonstrated superlative performance across the company and delivered on our value creation targets for shareholders. We exited 2014 as a larger, more valuable and better focused company. Newfield was second-best-performing E&P stock in the S&P 500 index and we finished the year with a top quartile performance within our peer group.","The Anadarko Basin has earned its place at the top of our highlight list. The economics in our SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays are very resilient. Our returns continue to get better as rig basin service costs reset to align with a new and lower near-term oil price outlook. The SCOOP, Springer and STACK plays have added tremendous value. We have improved confidence in the consistency of our well results and the plays' potential to drive strong economic production and reserve growth for many years to come.","We push well costs lower, returns higher and production delineated more than 75% of our STACK acreage. In today's @NFX publication you will see that we are drilling our SCOOP and STACK wells on a per-foot basis for about half what we drilled and completed these wells for in 2012. In today's @NFX you will see that our recent well results are outstanding. We are seeing significantly lower well costs and we increased our STACK type curve by 20%, or about 150,000 barrels from the 800,000-barrel figure to a 950,000-barrel EUR today. This reflects results from a broad sample of wells across our acreage.","Our Anadarko Basin production more than doubled year-over-year and we added 65 million barrels of oil equivalent of new proved reserves. The basin now comprises nearly 30% of our company's reserves. This world-class resource provides us with shale scale with lots of running room and strong economics.","Across the company, our drilling campaigns last year led to a 14% increase in our year-end proved reserves, adjusted for asset sales. This translates to an R\/P of greater than 250%. And those reserves were added at a total cost of $14.50 per barrel and we now have a greater than 14-year proved reserve life index.","At year-end 2014, our proved reserves were 645 million barrels, of which 52% were proved developed and about 60% were liquids. Our SEC PV 10 grew 18% to $8.8 billion. And keep in mind that we sold more than $1.5 billion in non-strategic assets during the course of 2014 as well.","Our domestic production for 2014 was approximately 48 million barrels of oil equivalent, with volumes materially exceeding the high end of our original 2014 guidance when adjusted for the sale of our Granite Wash properties. Including China, we produced 49.2 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2014. Importantly, our cost and expenses showed continued improvements throughout the year.","We significantly strengthened our oil hedges in early 2014, protecting our cash flows from the oil price correction. And our China sales process, however, was impacted by the timing of the oil price collapse. We are retaining the assets and in late 2014 brought our Pearl Field online. At current oil prices, cash flow from China will be about $130 million in 2015. Pearl is now producing more than 13,000 barrels a day gross from three wells and is expected to ramp to a peak rate of about 30,000 barrels a day gross around midyear.","As mentioned earlier, we sold approximately $1.5 billion in assets during 2014 improving our balance sheet and lowering our debt to EBITDA ratio. Proceeds from the timely sale of the Granite Wash in late 2014 were used to redeem our 2018 senior sub-notes and reduce our leverage going into 2015.","And lastly, we advanced the [inaudible] of new liquids-rich resources throughout the company. In the Anadarko Basin, we added the Springer to our resource inventory. Among the many STACK plays in the Uinta Basin we saw some very encouraging flow rates from the Wasatch and Uteland Butte and today we disclosed our first well from a new play call the Upper Castle Peak. We have other exciting exploration concepts in the STACK geologic horizons in the Anadarko Basin and in the Uinta, but will be tested on the road ahead.","Before moving to 2015, I will quickly summarize our mostly recent quarterly results. Production in the fourth quarter was 12.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, about 400,000 barrels above our guidance range. All of the outperformance was from our domestic business. We lifted 300,000 barrels from China in the quarter. Excluding several items listed in our news release, our net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter would have been $53 million, or about $0.38 per share on revenues of $495 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $337 million.","So now to the 2015 outlook, although 2014 seems like a distant memory, we entered this year with a great operating momentum and optimism about our future. The outlook for our industry changed dramatically however, as we entered 2015 and the reality that oil prices could remain lower for longer mandated that we make timely adjustments to our plans. I'm confident that we will manage through this challenging time and position our company to once again focus on higher growth when the margins across our business return to more attractive levels.","The good news is Newfield has high-quality options. With the exception of SCOOP and STACK, our focus areas are all held by production and we can defer development without losing opportunities. The lion's share of our 2015 capital investments have been reallocated to the Anadarko Basin. We are fortunate to have a large, high quality asset that can deliver solid returns even at today's commodity prices.","We moved decisively in early 2014 and strengthened our oil hedges before the market deteriorated. Today our derivatives position sets us apart, with a current value of about $800 million. Our hedges were designed to give us a soft landing in the event that oil prices fell significantly. At today's strip, our hedges will add revenues of about $400 million in 2015 and around $350 million in 2016.","Our balance sheet, capital structure and derivatives position afford us both time and options. Our 2015 plan has been designed to substantially balance our cash flow with capital investments, preserve liquidity and maintain solid coverage ratios. We do not have any significant long term rig or service contracts outside of the Anadarko Basin. Today we are working with our service providers and leveraging our operating scale to align costs with commodity prices. We are seeing material service cost reductions today and we are focused on materially reducing these costs across our operating regions. Our capital budget for 2015 is $1.2 billion. We have high-graded our investments into the Anadarko Basin and we are taking significant actions to reduce our G&A and operating expenses.","Our plan incorporates the cost savings we have captured to date. We have seen drilling and completion's costs reduced by about 15% to 20% in our active areas and expect reductions of at least 25% in certain services by year-end. Our lease operating expenses are down about 10% to date and we expect reductions of at least 15% by year-end. We have reduced our G&A by 10% year to date and including other initiatives, we expect at least a 15% reduction in full-year G&A. We have vigorous new initiatives underway across the organization to lower cost structure, improve margins to compete and win in a lower oil price environment.","Despite our reduced investment levels, we intend to deliver solid growth. Our 2015 production is expected to be 52 million to 55 million barrels oil equivalent. This equates to a 15% to 20% growth level adjusted for asset sales in 2014. Year-over-year domestic production is estimated to increase 5% to 10% adjusted for asset sales last year. We expect our liquids growth will be up 32% including China and 18% domestically.","Our second half volumes are expected to be higher than our first half volumes domestically. And when you add China, our fourth quarter 2015 volumes are expected to be about 7% higher than our fourth quarter 2014 volumes. At the end of the 2015 reporting season, we think this will separate us from the pack and we are not deferring completions to inflate our late 2015 growth projections.","As we said earlier, approximately 70% of our investments this year will be allocated to the Anadarko Basin, where we plan to run 10 operated rigs and drill about 100 wells. Our industry peers will also be active in the basin and our non-operating drilling activity is expected to remain high during the course of the year.","Our confidence level in STACK continues to grow. Our most recent wells showed solid economic improvements at every stage. We are drilling faster. We expect our STACK SXL wells will be drilled in less than 25 days in 2015. That's a 40% improvement over our 2013 average and 25% over last year and we are not yet in development mode. We are drilling wells cheaper and we have quickly applied our learning curve from SCOOP to our operations in STACK. Our 2015 well costs for STACK are estimated at $8.5 million, down from our original forecast of $9 million to $12 million. Completed well costs have fallen faster than we anticipated through service cost reductions, drilling efficiencies and optimized completions. Once in development, we expect to see continued efficiency gains.","Drilling to-date has production-delineated about 75% of our acreage. This is up from about 33% this time last year. We have high confidence in our development projections. Again, our STACK program is delivering solid returns across an area of more than 300 square miles. We recently increased EURs for our STACK type curve by 20% to 950,000 barrels of oil equivalent. And our rates of return in STACK at today's commodity prices and costs average 30% to 40%. As service cost continue to drop, our returns should further improve. We show our expected returns at varying prices in today's @NFX publication.","In less than four years we've grown our net production from the Anadarko Basin to a fourth quarter 2014 average of 54,000 BOE per day. We expect that our Anadarko Basin program will grow more than 40% in 2015 and our year-end net exit rate will approach 70,000 BOE per day.","The high grading of our 2015 investments required near-term reductions in activity levels in our Williston, Eagle Ford and Uinta Basin programs. Our production in the Williston Basin was up 50% in 2014 and will remain relatively flat this year despite cutting our rig count from four rigs in 2014 to one rig in 2015.","Our drilling will primarily be focused on our core acreage along the Nesson Anticline. Our team continues to deliver best-in-class results with plans to drill and complete our 2015 SXL wells for about $6.5 million including facilities. Our acreage in the Williston is HBP and we will be poised to add activity as prices and service costs align. The most significant change in our investment plan is in the Uinta Basin, where we plan to temporarily cease all drilling activity.","Our Greater Monument Butte unit is a conventional water flood, characterized by higher lease operating expenses and sensitivity to dramatic oil price fluctuations. Our near-term focus is on reducing our field level operating costs and improving our margins. We remain encouraged with the results from our SXL drilling campaign in the central basin region of the Uinta and we summarized our 2014 drilling results in @NFX. You will see that these wells have high sustained production rates and strong ultimate recoveries. Our focus last year was on lowering well costs and we achieved some significant advancements in 2014.","Progress we made in the Uinta was reflected in our production growth, with the basin growing about 15% year-over-year compared to our beginning-of-year forecast of 5%. Our recent plan to reduce investments down to just $82 million in 2015 will obviously impact production. We expect our Uinta production will decline about 15% in 2015. The Uinta Basin assets are also held by production and we will be prepared to add activity when the market provides appropriate signals.","Salt Lake City area refiners have added new capacity on our behalf and we affirm capacity agreements in place. We do not expect any material shortfall fees associated with these agreements in the near term. The maximum exposure for 2015 and 2016 is about $10 million in total. Longer term, if we were to elect to a limit our future drilling, the annual shortfall fee could approach $40 million per year beginning in 2017. Today we don't view these penalties as significant enough to warrant drilling wells that would otherwise be uneconomic just to satisfy contracted volumes. Again, we plan to continue high grading our investments to ensure the best rates of return at the corporate level.","Uinta Basin is a very large oil resource with significant upside in our unconventional horizontal plays. We have more than 5,000 potential drilling locations and about 1 billion barrels of net oil resource to pursue in the basin. Improvements in future oil prices along with ongoing efforts to lower costs, improve margins and find new markets for our oil sales will work in tandem and we expect that the Uinta will again compete for capital within our portfolio in the near future.","As promised, we kept our remarks brief this morning. Newfield has high-quality options today and we are taking the right steps to ensure we successfully navigate today's business environment. Newfield delivered outstanding operating results in 2014 and we continued a streak of solid execution across our company.","Although today's market presents new challenges, I'm confident that our teams will deliver on our key objectives in 2015. These are; to deliver a superior execution under a reduced capital budget that aligns with cash flow; to deliver strong growth and to continue to improve returns in the Anadarko Basin plays; and to find innovative ways to improve margins across the remainder of our legacy portfolio.","Longer term, our portfolio of assets is capable of stronger levels of growth in both production and cash flow. The resource table in today's @NFX depicts a deep inventory locations that are held by production and will be ready to drive our growth when the margins in our business return to acceptable levels. Until then, our operating plan is sound and will ensure that we both create value today and preserve value for tomorrow.","Thanks for your investment in our company and we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim.","Subash Chandra","It was really quite an achievement when you add value like this in a down cycle. I know its hard work over the years, but this really is quite phenomenal. First question and a follow up, the first question is on infills and density pilots maybe. I note delineation is what you're doing, but as you get to 75%, is there a program in 2015 to test density?","Lee Boothby","So first, I'm going to take a moment because I think I spoke I want to thank you for your comments on behalf of our team. Our team has worked incredibly hard to reposition the company and this is not the result of waking up one morning and having good things happen. It's a lot of good hard work by a talented team that I'm fortunate to work with and lead. So thank you for your comments.","With regard to infills and density pilots, our team has continued to work focused on HBP to drill wells, straddling lease lines. We were drilling wells in multiple intervals within the STACK play and we continue to add other horizons into the test. So I will tell you we'll continue to do that activity. I don't believe that it would be appropriate for us to turn the ship away from the HBP focus and the results and the returns we're delivering today say that we can continue on the path that we're on.","I'm excited about getting to that development phase, but we've got plenty of experience in multiple plays today with regard to spacing. So I think we've got a pretty good idea what the plan will look like going forward. But we'll continue to work it in with regard to HBPing the acreage and over the course of this year and moving into next year, we'll keep you apprised of the results.","But I think you can look at that map on @NFX and you can see the distribution of wells, I think the team delivered exactly what we told we were going to do in 2014. And again our confidence level is very, very high in those plays today.","Subash Chandra","And my follow up is at this stage Meramec versus Woodford, could you talk to some of the differences between the two horizons practically and geologically?","Lee Boothby","Well, the Meramec sits on top of the Woodford, separated by carbonate interval gross age. We are testing intervals throughout the Meramec section. I think we've tested three different intervals within that 400 or 500 foot section and we've continued to test the Woodford across that acreage position as well as down in the SCOOP, where we've moved out of the wet gas condensate window up into the oil window. So we're very excited about the results that we're seeing.","Specific to STACK, we continue to see competitive results between the Meramec and the Woodford and it's not something that we've done at this point to go ahead and segregate. I think that we tested three horizons, they all work. We tested the Woodford in multiple locations. It's all working.","I think we told you originally that we thought there would be three to five horizons to exploit and I would say we're well on our course. The results we're delivering are in accordance with our plan.","Operator","Thank you. And we will go next to Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.","Leo Mariani","Obviously I appreciate the fact you're taking a conservative tact to start the year. Just wanted to get a sense if we continue to see the cost reductions that you're expecting over the next several months. What relative type of pricing might we see for you to accelerate and spend a little bit more? Do we need to get back up to say $70 or something before you would decide to spend a little bit more money, can you just talk through that process?","Lee Boothby","Well I think the key words in the call in my mind are that we've designed a balanced play. And we've got a balanced program for 2015 appropriate for the $55ish world that we see today.","Clearly, as we continue to generate results and hopefully prices improve, we'll get to a point where we generate incremental cash flow. But we're not going to move away from that balance. We've been chasing balance now for the last three years. The market conditions have forced balance. We'll work our way forward in a very prudent manner.","Higher prices, higher cash flow. We've got plenty of high return opportunities to invest it, will transit to more activity. Conversely, if we settled into a lower price environment for longer, I think I said earlier that we can navigate several years into the future and await that day when better returns come. Now I'm hoping for the earlier return to a more buoyant oil price but we're covering the bases and doing the right thing today for tomorrow.","Leo Mariani","And in your prepared comments you certainly spoke about trying to be opportunistic for potential acquisition opportunities here, is that largely in Anadarko Basin where you're focused and do you think there is significant more acreage to pick up over there?","Lee Boothby","Well I think the - what we believe is having lived through multiple cycles, our leadership team, that environments like this lead to opportunities and you've got to be in a strong position to capitalize on those opportunities. Clearly, there are other areas in the Anadarko Basin that we have an interest in. And I guess we're politely letting everybody out there know that we're in the game. So if opportunities show up there, I promise you Newfield will be in that game.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Michael Rowe with TPH.","Michael Rowe","Obviously, you have a lot of growth year-over-year and exit to exit out of the Anadarko Basin in 2015 with the majority of the capital going there. So my question is, you had a nice Q4 of 2014 with a lot of wealth coming online probably sooner than you expected. So can you may be give us a sense for your anticipated PDP decline for the Anadarko exit to exit and maybe just your level of confidence in that declined number given the flush rate of production you had exiting 2014?","Lee Boothby","Well I don't have - so I'll protect myself, I don't have an absolute number in place for the rate of decline on the base production. I will tell you that our base production outperformed in 2014. Our base production is constructed off the type curves that we publish. I think our team does an extraordinarily good job in terms of managing. In fact we have a group of people that are in place just to manage base production, so we did everything we can every day.","Performance against type curves has been strong so our confidence in the production forecast and the growth rates is very, very high. So I'm not concerned about there being any decline rates or anything like that in the base production in Anadarko that aren't fully and completely accounted for in our forecast.","Michael Rowe","And then just one follow-up would be I guess there's not a lot of added detail about the Springer Shale in the presentation, which makes sense given limited operating history. But was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about how much capital that asset could attract in 2015 and maybe how it compares to the existing targets that you all are investing capital into in the Woodford and Meramec sections?","Lee Boothby","Well I would tell you that the Springer play, the results we posted as well as some of our friends in the industry, if you will, Continental notably where we've been in a number of their wells and they've been in a number of our wells have been very, very strong. I think that translates to really high-quality target. Good hydrocarbon rich, good permeability, all the things you like to see.","What I was really excited about with the results posted in 2014 is all of those high return, high rate wells were 5000 footers. So we do plan to allocate CapEx to the Springer as part of our SCOOP development activity in 2015 and we will be testing both 5000 and 10,000 foot laterals. So I'll keep you apprised as the year unfolds, but we see it as a strong economic target as part of the good news story in Anadarko Basin.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Dan Guffey from Stifel.","Dan Guffey","In the STACK, wondering how much production history and how much delineation will you need to see before segmenting the Meramec and Woodford intervals? And then also can you remind us how much of your 210,000 net acres in the STACK are prospective for each formation?","Lee Boothby","All right, let me make sure I think I might have missed the back part of your question, so you can bring me back there. First part, as far as how much do we need to see to have confidence in the forecast. I'll remind you and I think it's in the @NFX, the first year of drilling out here was late 2011. So we've got developing multi-year production forecasts.","We've had really, really strong performance across that period, in terms of the actual results versus modeled performance. That would be reservoir simulated model performance. We're upgrading the type curve in today's release or yesterday's release and today's call, by about 20%.","That's a combination of targeting, locating within the section. It's a 700 foot thick overall section and STACK. Top is about 400 or 500 feet to Meramec and the bottom portion is Woodford. We now have wells throughout that interval and when you look at the map that's in @NFX, I think you'll be able to conclude that we're delivering good strong results across the horizon and in both intervals.","So frankly as long as the statistical data says that the wells drilled in the play are more alike than different, we'll probably keep it that way. Because doesn't make any sense for us to have 15 different plays to try to talk to you about. We're giving you a type curve that we think represents the play and I think the results delivered demonstrate that we're doing a good job predicting performance. I expect it'll only get better from here.","Dan Guffey","And on the back end of the 210,000 net acres, do you think the Woodford and the Meramec are both prospective across all of the acreage? Is that what the data has shown, or is it segmented?","Lee Boothby","Well if you look closely at the map and the @NFX, we actually have outlines and that we've had those outlines of the domain for - since we announced the play back in August of 2013. So there's a Woodford outline and there's a Meramec outline.","I'll caution you to say that the edges are not absolute. But you'll see that we have drilled wells where they overlay one another and we've drilled wells that are outside of the Woodford and only in the Meramec. So you can get some feel for that looking at the distribution of wells that have been drilled.","And if you put a tape down and say what's 300 square miles look like, it'll cover most of that area up there and I think the split out on the wells to date. Just to give you a feel so it's not skewed, we've got about 40% of the wells that have been drilled. I think total you can go back and check this tally or get with Steve, I think it's 40% of the wells have been in the Woodford and somewhere around the 60%ish have been in the Meramec to date.","Dan Guffey","And then on my second question, in the @NFX update you provided well economics for each of your core areas. And in the SCOOP wet gas window, you're modeling a 5900 foot lateral verse the extended laterals for every other area. In that wet gas window, are there lease geometry issues or reservoir limitations or will you work toward that closer to 9000 foot lateral in the wet gas?","Lee Boothby","Well it's - as you move into the wet gas window, you're getting deeper. You've reached limitations in terms of rig capacity. We've settled in in that 6000, 6500, 5500 foot is what we've been delivering all the way along the play there. So it's a combination of factors, but I think it's mostly mechanical. Gary you have anything you want to add there?","Gary Packer","Yes I think there is some geology involved, but most of its the limitation due to depth.","Lee Boothby","Everywhere we can drill the longer laterals, we're drilling the longer laterals.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Ipsit Mohanty with GMP Securities.","Ipsit Mohanty","Your 1Q guidance suggests that it's probably flat or a little incremental over 4Q, yet your 4Q 2015 over 2014 shows a healthy growth of 7%, 8%. I think in your comments you mentioned that you're not grow depth of completions towards the back end of the year. So I'm curious how you're seeing - what is the quarter-over-quarter cadence, production cadence look like in 2015?","Lee Boothby","So what you'll need to do and I think the data is pretty well laid out the team has pulled together, is you contract the domestic U.S. Those are all of our resource plays and you can get a good stable view of what's going on there in terms of activity and it all fits together. The only noise in the U.S. portfolio would be the timing of pads and things that are normal to resource play development. So we'll work through those issues and that's all incorporated in our forecast.","The other piece that we touched on is the timing of China. So you get the second half of the year you got the full impact of China approaching the peak rate of around 30,000 barrels a day around midyear. I think those would be the two primary things that you would want to look at. Gary, you have anything you want to add?","Gary Packer","Yes, we're down in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and a lot of that was just timing of completions in the Anadarko Basin. And as you said, we're already - we're going to be up in the second half over the first half of the year.","Ipsit Mohanty","And then could you - you're not drilling in Uinta and Eagle Ford yet you see - I see on your some pin slices on your CapEx by in your presentation, would you care to comment on the capital spend in Uinta and other?","Gary Packer","Yes, there is capital in those areas. And it's really just the wind down of activity. We've been dropping rigs steadily in the first quarter. We have now totally exited the Uinta basin from activity and we are about to exit the Eagle Ford.","Ipsit Mohanty","Okay, but then you're not deferring those completions that you've drilled other wells that you've drilled in Uinta and Eagle Ford, your other? It's going to be a part of the production in 1Q 2015?","Gary Packer","Yes, all those wells will be completed immediately following the drilling.","Lee Boothby","We've done the analysis internally and the best - the thing that makes sense in our portfolio is drill, complete and produce, not delay the production.","Ipsit Mohanty","And then my final one, if you could give us some color on how your China production profile looks like for mid-2015, or rather beyond 2015. Does it flat line along with the exit rate, or does it grow, if you could talk on that please?","Lee Boothby","We reach peak rate in mid-year 2015. You'll have a plateau period, I don't know how many months that'll last and you'll go on a normal decline. It's a conventional field, horizontal developments and conventional reservoirs. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","I wanted to follow-up on a couple of your earlier points. You talked about the opportunity to add to your Anadarko position to further build scale. How much quality acreage in SCOOP and STACK and Springer do you see is out there and fragmented beyond yourselves and two other large players? Or is your focus, as you seem to reference in one of the early questions, building a position in more exploratory, or step that acreage in other parts of the basin?","Lee Boothby","I would say, Brian, about all we're going to say today is that we're going to be opportunistic. I can promise you we aren't going to chase ran pasture acreage to pad counts. But there is attractive acreage out there and there are people that control acreage that we view as attractive. And the market conditions and the timing is right, we'd like to add them to the portfolio. But it'll be within the context of the core plays.","Brian Singer","And then we saw obviously another very strong quarter in the Anadarko Basin, looking at your guidance it would appear to imply some slowdown in sequential growth versus your recent quarter trends. Is this Newfield being conservative or are you referenced backlog building here in the first quarter? Can you provide a little more specifics on the timing of completions versus perhaps the level of conservatism or your decline rates?","Lee Boothby","Yes, I think I touched on it in one of the earlier answers, but most of the variability quarter to quarter we've had, it's just a timing of pads. Because we've been doing a lot of pad drilling and that certainly is still going to impact us in terms of timing in the Anadarko Basin notably in SCOOP where we've been in development for most of the last 1.5 years or so.","I would tell you that beyond that take 40% out of the capital budget, there is a general overall slowdown. But I think Gary and the team have been managing that very well and we've been dropping rigs over the last several weeks of the timing of China and all this comes together to leave us in real good shape, $1 billion, $1.2 billion, we can tread sideways in the market. So I think that's kind of the way to think that we're sort of at maintenance level, but in the core plays we're growing at a healthy rate. Gary?","Gary Packer","Yes, the only thing specific to SCOOP and STACK, Brian, I would add is that in the SCOOP play that's historically been just one or two wells per pad and we're going to do more pad drilling in STACK. And what you're going to see this year is we're going to make a more - we'll have a more balanced program between SCOOP and STACK. So the pad drilling and as we move to STACK, will have a higher oil cut which will make the apparent production growth look slower.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.","Dave Kistler","With respect to your comments of pushing drilling in the SCOOP up into the oil window, is that related to in any way shape or form making sure that you have sufficient take away capacity or processing capacity? And I would guess is also related to the weekend GL presses.","Lee Boothby","No, it's just related to attractive economics as we develop the wet gas condensate window we're moving into the acreage up dip. It's about getting it HBP and securing the acreage for the future.","Dave Kistler","And then thinking about idling activity in the Uinta and the Eagle Ford and obviously liquidity isn't an issue, but do those potentially become divestiture assets or targeted for divestiture with the amount of running room you have in the Anadarko Basin?","Lee Boothby","Well I think we've demonstrated over the last several years that we've been able to sell assets. I think we've had asset sales at appropriate times in the market. What we have in those other areas are solid core asset positions. I think Uinta Basin just the horizontal piece of that, so 1 billion barrels of potential.","So I'm not going to tell you that things aren't for sale, but we have no plans to sell any of these assets and I think we've seen and demonstrated the benefits of being able to operate across multiple areas. I think you look closely at the @NFX publication, I'm really impressed with what the team has delivered in STACK and at SCOOP and the Williston Basin. And if you look at the percentage gains over time, you'll see an amazing level of consistency there.","That tells you that the organization is a learning organization. It's working as a team and frankly first opportunity to go back to work and have those competing in the return space with our other plays we're going to go back to work in those basins.","Operator","We will go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.","David Tameron","Lee, if we think about a bounce back, a potential bounce back in prices, where does that - you get an extra $500 million tomorrow, where does that go to work as far as reallocation? Do you start to put stuff back in the Bakken, a little more in Uinta? Or can you give us some color on that?","Lee Boothby","I'll let Gary and Larry give you some color since they've been in the middle of --involved with the planning.","Gary Packer","I think first place we'd take a look at his balance sheet and make sure the balance sheet remains strong. It would really determine probably most by the volatility that we would see. It would be easy to put incremental activity to work in the SCOOP and STACK plays. That's the first place we would make incremental investments. But as we saw more long term rally and if they were moving into the $75 to $80 range and it looked like we had stability there, clearly the plays in the Uinta, Williston would get incremental activity.","David Tameron","Okay Gary, not to read too much into what you said, but - so $75 is that - $70, $75, is that the way you're thinking about the Williston, Uinta as far as where it makes more sense?","Gary Packer","Sure, that makes sense as far as having incremental cash flow to think about investing in areas outside of the Anadarko. We're investing in the Williston in 2015.","David Tameron","Okay and then final question there on - or second question, the Williston. You drilled - it looks like you drilled 50 plus wells there in 2014. Yet it says you can keep production flat with one rig? Can you help me out there with that logistically how that's happening? Is it backlog or how does that work?","Gary Packer","Yes, that's a big part of it, David. We entered the year with four rigs running and hence the capital you see in there in our allocation $135 million, $150 million or so is just completing that program and getting those wells completed. As we sit here today, we're down to two rigs. We'll run two rigs through I think it's about May and then we'll drop back to the single rig that's referenced in the script.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Jeffrey Campbell","I just wanted to ask a couple of questions, a little bit of detail with the Anadarko. The first is with regard to the Springer in 2015; is this being drilled primarily as a standalone zone or is it being drilled on existing pads or is it going to be drilled in tandem on multi zone pads are all of the above?","Gary Packer","I think it's pretty much all of the above, Jeffrey. And we are strictly targeting the Springer in the individual wells, but there may be some areas where we're targeting Woodford, as well.","Jeffrey Campbell","And as a follow-up, can you provide us with any updates on Anadarko multi zone STACK tests planned for 2015 or even potentially 2016?","Lee Boothby","As far as multi zone tests, we don't have any specific plans to do any multi zone or STACK completions, if you're thinking about multi laterals in particular. Everything that we drill is mono bore. We believe in the long lateral SXL. So each one of those laterals will be targeted in a specific horizon and if there are any other activities related to that, Gary can give you some color.","Gary Packer","Yes, we drilled three that attacked multiple zones in parallel with one another in 2014. They were anywhere between 880 and 1000 feet apart and we saw no destructive interference between those. So we got really good early information - yes up in the STACK area.","Lee Boothby","I think that information was posted earlier or last quarter, if I'm not mistaken if you want to go back and look.","Jeffrey Campbell","Right, that was really what I was referencing the question--","Lee Boothby","Yes, that sort of activity will continue to feather in. But I thought you were asking about multi laterals, so my apology.","Operator","Thank you. And management has time for one final question from David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc.","David Deckelbaum","I'm curious if you could provide more color on the midstream agreement with MarkWest that was announced today on building out the Anadarko position there?","Gary Packer","It's strictly a gas deal. It's confined to the STACK area. As you recall we did a deal with DCP down in the SCOOP area and it includes both gathering and processing.","David Deckelbaum","And how many years in your current program do you feel it'll take you until you're in development mode in SCOOP, STACK areas?","Lee Boothby","Well we're in development mode in SCOOP today. The STACK area we've talked about earlier in the call that it would take the next three years to get all of that HBP. You will see us shift towards development activity there and once the finish line on HBP is clearly in sight. So I would say probably we will continue to be dominated by HBP activity for the next couple years and in year three you'll start to see development activity would be my guess.","David Deckelbaum","And the last one if I might, are there other opportunities to expand in China beyond the three well program and if so when is the decision date on that?","Lee Boothby","There are Newfield - there probably are but they'll have somebody else's name attached to it than Newfield. We're going to stay focused on our Bohai Bay and Pearl assets and we have no intention of expanding in China. Operator?","Operator","And I'll turn it back over to you for any final remarks.","Lee Boothby","Okay, thank you. Well I would like to thank everybody again for your investment in Newfield and your interest in Newfield and your time today. I want to thank you for recognizing the great results that the teams delivered and we're looking forward to delivering more great results in 2015. So we'll keep you posted. Hope you have a good rest of the day and we'll talk to you again soon on the road.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."]}}
