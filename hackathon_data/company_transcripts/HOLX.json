Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amber, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Deborah R. Gordon","Thank you, Amber. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call will consist of opening remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Wednesday, November 26 and a copy of our fourth quarter release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Also in that section is a supplemental financial presentation related to the comments that will be made during today's opening remarks.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during the call may be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can also be found in our fourth quarter earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Thank you, Deb, and thank you for joining us today. It has now been almost 11 months since I joined Hologic. Before diving into the specific results, I'd like to give a little context to where we've been and where we're headed. Quite simply, while our business lines have not changed significantly, Hologic today is a dramatically different company than 12 months ago and will be even stronger in the coming year. To reset the clock, a year ago, our sales were in decline across the board. Our debt load was prohibited. Many of our businesses, such as blood screening, cytology, skeletal and surgical, all appeared to be in long-term decline and we had weak credibility with many of you in the investment community. We had activist entering the stock and good employees exiting the company, as bonuses have been slashed for the rank and file in order to prevent even sharper earnings misses. As I joined the company in December and we subsequently reported another quarter of sharp sales and earnings declines, huge questions existed, including our future direction, capital allocation, reimbursement for 3D mammography and a host of other questions. And as you might expect, employee morale was low.","What has followed has been a dramatic refocusing of our business on growth, our customers and our people, which hopefully becomes even clearer with this quarter's results. Those of you who know me well know that we are far from celebrating. And let me be perfectly clear here. We have opportunities to continue improving essentially every aspect of this company. But we do feel good that we're achieving things that few would have thought possible just 9 months ago, providing nice momentum to continue our progress in the quarters and years ahead.","Three quick examples are: one, after long-term declines in our surgical business, which continued through the first 2 quarters of this fiscal year, this business has rebounded in the last few quarters and even posted ever so modest growth for the full year, a very nice turnaround; two, our blood screening business, which has been challenged and declining for many quarters, is now growing, boosted by the Japan Red Cross win earlier this year. This will provide a boost for the next few quarters, while we work with our partner, Grifols, to explore additional opportunities to grow this business; three, our international business, also underperforming and declining for many quarters, began to rebound this quarter. While our blood screening business clearly contributed to this growth, it is important to note that all of our franchises actually posted growth outside the U.S. in the latest quarter. It's a good start and indicative of the big opportunity which exists for us outside the U.S. In fact, 3 of our 4 franchises ended up growing, albeit modestly for the year, a major turnaround from previous results and a nice accomplishment considering where we stood after the first quarter. And even better, all franchises grew in the fourth quarter for the first time.","What is behind these results? The simplest answer is a completely new and very accomplished leadership team, combined with some strong performance from our sales leaders and sales teams during a period of great change.","I'd like to touch a little more on the depth, breadth and speed of the leadership transitions. By the end of May, we had completely replaced the top line leaders of the company, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Head of International. But within the next few months, we've also put new presidents into our 2 largest businesses, Breast & Skeletal Health and, most recently, Diagnostics. We've also revamped the number of leadership positions on their teams as well. Thus, the magnitude of the change has been far greater than maybe obvious. We realized that those of you who knew that many layers of changes were in store have been concerned about the execution risk and the timing required for these additional changes. So we have moved very quickly and we're beginning to see results. I am proud that our team did not just write off the year, but in fact, we began to put points on the board early while driving major changes to strengthen us for the future. This all leads to where we are today, on a clear path to sustainable and accelerated organic growth. We finished the fourth quarter with all 4 franchises posting year-over-year growth and posted growth domestically and internationally. We are ending fiscal 2014 with much healthier businesses and on a growth trajectory moving into fiscal 2015, a very different story than a year ago.","Now let's briefly review our fiscal fourth quarter results to provide a bit more color about the progress we are making. Our underlying revenues were $640 million, up a healthy 3% from last year and represented the third consecutive quarter of growth. Additionally, we recorded a $20 million onetime revenue benefit we received in the fourth quarter, which Bob will discuss separately. Importantly, the strength emerging in this quarter is broader and deeper than anything we've generated in quite some time. A few simple details: all 4 franchises posted global growth, a first; 3 of our 4 franchises grew in the U.S.; and all 4 franchises posted healthy growth outside the U.S; and our total international business grew for the first time in many quarters. The exciting part here is how the momentum is built throughout the year. In our fiscal first quarter, 1 franchise grew while the other 3 were down; in the second quarter, we had 2 up, 2 down; third quarter, 3 up, 1 down; and now in the fourth quarter, all 4 are up on a global basis. And while we even have a new and formidable competitor in the mammo business and revenues only looked okay, let's just say we finished the year with exceptional growth in orders, which bodes very well for the coming year.","Now let me touch on 2 recent developments. The first is Tom West, our new President of the Diagnostics division. Tom has a proven track record of success with global experience at increasing levels of responsibility throughout his career, most recently, during his 20-plus years at Johnson & Johnson. He has already hit the ground running and we are confident that given Tom's expertise and track record for driving results, he will capitalize on the many opportunities we have within this franchise.","The second is the recent announcement by CMS of reimbursement rates for 3D mammography screening and diagnostic services. Not only did CMS set an incremental, add-on reimbursement rate for both screening and diagnostic, but they also set a rate that speaks to the importance of Hologic's game-changing technology.","Let me summarize this for you. In short, there is now formal incremental reimbursement in place at approximately $57 for both 3D mammography screening and diagnostic exams. This rate is in addition to the existing 2D mammography screening and diagnostic rates, all of which were maintained at the same level as in 2014. So together with the extensive body of published data, including the landmark JAMA study, we believe this is a win not only for Hologic, but most importantly, for women whom we hope will have greater access to this incredible technology.","Before turning the call over to Bob for a more detailed financial discussion, I would like to share with you our high-level fiscal 2015 objectives and outlook. We expect to report low single-digit top line that is 2% to 3.5% sales growth operationally, high single-digit net income and mid-single-digit EPS growth due to dilution. And I'd like to mention right here that our true growth rate will be almost 1 point higher when adjusting for the MRI divestiture we just completed and which Bob will speak more about in a few minutes. While there are many factors which go into the full plan, the key elements to achieve this growth are simply: one, accelerating growth in our U.S. Breast Health business; and two, significantly accelerating our international business. We feel very good about our ability to achieve this step change in annual growth and strong cost controls will yield leverage earnings growth. We've set the stage in fiscal 2014 and we will continue to execute and build on the strong momentum. So overall, while we're not yet where we want to be, we have delivered on our promise not only to improve, but to grow each franchise. We said we would focus on accelerating growth, paying down debt and improving our return on invested capital and we are doing all 3. The fourth quarter marked the milestone with each franchise returning to growth and we expect this momentum to accelerate in fiscal 2015.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob.","Robert W. McMahon","Thank you, Steve. I am pleased to speak to our fourth quarter financial results and then I will provide more detail on our guidance for the full year and first quarter of fiscal '15. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year non-GAAP basis.","Before getting into the divisional results, I'll first remind investors that during our fourth quarter, we entered into an amended license agreement with Roka Bioscience and we received $20 million in cash and stock. This was recorded as revenue within our Diagnostics segment and it resulted in an incremental $0.05 in EPS in the quarter. All of my commentary on the fourth quarter will be based on our underlying business results and then, therefore, will be net of this onetime benefit.","Fourth quarter revenues were $640 million, up 3% on a reported basis and up 2.8% operationally or on a constant currency basis as compared to $622 million in the prior year. These results were at the high end of our guidance range of $630 million to $640 million. Again, this excludes the onetime $20 million revenue contribution. As Steve mentioned, we are pleased to report that all 4 divisions reported growth in the quarter. And looking at the divisional results. Excluding the onetime $20 million revenue benefit, our Diagnostics business posted revenues of $297 million, up a reported 2.4% and up 2.3% operationally versus the prior year. Cytology and perinatal revenues declined 3% on a reported basis to $121 million. U.S. and international revenues declined 4% and 1%, respectively. We continue to see domestic ThinPrep volume being pressured by interval expansion, but we are encouraged to see the improvements internationally as we began to refocus our sales efforts on key markets and improve our execution. Our molecular diagnostics business increased 3% to $117 million driven by the U.S. results. Our core Aptima franchise experienced healthy growth primarily due to the continued uptake at Quest, the broader adoption of Aptima HPV, as well as gains in the CT\/GC and Trichomonas. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in instrument sales as we sold $9 million worth of TIGRIS systems to Quest in the fourth quarter of last year. Our blood screening business had revenues of $59 million and increased 14% driven by international growth, primarily due to the Japanese Red Cross deal, partially offsetting by the declines in the U.S. From an instrument standpoint, we had another strong quarter with Panther as customers continue to see the benefits of our superior automation. Our installed base increased approximately 80% in fiscal '14 and we are on track to place 1,000 instruments globally by the end of fiscal '15.","Now moving on to Breast Health. Revenues in this division were $241 million, up a reported 3.1% and up 3% operationally. This was driven primarily by strong global 3D mammography system sales and service revenue. Partially offsetting this increase was the anticipated decline of 2D system sales as customers shift to 3D. In addition, as Steve mentioned, we ended the quarter with a strong order backlog and feel very good about the continued growth in this division, especially with the reimbursement news.","Turning to GYN Surgical franchise. Revenues were $78 million, up a reported 2.3% and up 2.1% operationally. This was the second consecutive quarter of growth, a trend we expect to continue. This performance was led by double-digit MyoSure and single-digit international NovaSure growth, offset by a mid-single digit decline in U.S. NovaSure sales.","And finally, our Skeletal Health revenues were $23 million, up a reported 10.4% and up 10.3% operationally. We are seeing nice traction in sales of our new Horizon platform.","Now moving on to our fourth quarter performance for the rest of the P&L. Gross margins were 63.6%, up 210 basis points from last year, slightly higher than our implied guidance for the quarter, driven primarily by favorable product revenue mix. Operating expenses were $199 million, representing a 14% increase and in line with our guidance. We finished the quarter with EPS of $0.38, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.01.","Before turning to the balance sheet, I would like to share that we successfully closed the sale of our MRI breast coils product line to Philips at the end of fourth quarter. While I'm not going to provide the details on the transaction, the product line did generate revenues of approximately $20 million on an annualized basis. This is an example of a product line divestiture that will help us focus resources on more strategic and core areas of the company. This divestiture did not impact our fourth quarter non-GAAP results.","Now turning to the balance sheet. We continue to generate strong cash flows as operating cash flow was $132 million for the quarter and $508 million for the year. In addition, we made $595 million worth of principal payments in fiscal '14 and ended the year with $742 million in cash. This resulted in $3.5 billion of net debt, down from $4 billion in net debt at the beginning of the year. We improved our return on invested capital and ended the year at 9.3% versus 8.3% last year. And finally, we did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter.","I will now discuss our non-GAAP guidance which, as a reminder, is detailed in our supplementary PowerPoint presentation. Fiscal '15 growth rates are on a year-over-year basis and do not include the onetime revenue benefit of $20 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. I also encourage you to model to the midpoint of the guidance ranges, which is how we think about the outlook. Our guidance will first be based on an operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency. We believe this provides better insight into the performance of the business. We will also provide estimates of our revenue and EPS with the impact that current exchange rates are expected to have on the translation of those results.","For fiscal '15, we expect revenues to increase approximately 2% to 3.5% on an operational or constant currency basis. To put that in perspective, when adjusting for the MRI breast coils divestiture, the growth rate would be approximately 3% to 4.5%, clearly, accelerated organic growth versus our performance in 2014. To help frame in the impact of currency, if full year fiscal '15 exchange rates were similar -- were to remain similar to the current exchange rates as of last week, our growth rate would decrease approximately 100 basis points. This would result in reported revenue growth of approximately 1% to 2.5% or revenues between $2.54 billion and $2.57 billion, which is what we suggest you use in your models. We expect continuing momentum coming out of fiscal '14 and our guidance assumes that all 4 segments will grow operationally in fiscal '15, led by mid-single-digit growth in our Breast Health franchise. This is despite the approximately 2-point headwind associated with the MRI divestiture. We also expect slightly positive growth in our Diagnostics business, low single-digit growth in surgical and mid-single digit growth in our skeletal franchise.","To further help you with your modeling, we expect gross margins to remain relatively consistent with full year fiscal '14 actuals, leverage in operating expenses as a percent of sales, net interest expense of $175 million, 286 million diluted shares and a 34.75% tax rate. As a result, for fiscal '15, we expect EPS to increase to a range of $1.50 to $1.54, representing approximately 3% to 5.5% growth on a reported basis. We expect to achieve this growth despite the expectation of a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $0.03 as our manufacturing footprint is predominantly U.S.-based. Our EPS guidance translates to reported net income growth of 5% to 8% after stripping out the impact of share dilution. Lastly, we expect to generate operating cash flows in the range of $510 million to $525 million and capital expenditures to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million. I hope you find this additional color helpful and again, I encourage you to focus your modeling on the midpoint of our ranges.","Now moving on to guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '15. We expect revenues to increase between 3% and 4.5% on an operational and constant currency basis. We estimate that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 100 basis points resulting in reported revenue growth of 2% to 3.5%. We are, therefore, introducing guidance of $625 million to $635 million. We also expect EPS of $0.35 to $0.36, representing growth of 3% to 6% on a reported basis.","Finally, I would like to wrap up by reiterating that deleveraging remains one of our top priorities and return on invested capital remains an important performance metrics for driving shareholder value and as such, this continues to be a significant component of executive compensation. While our performance is improving, we believe we can do better and we will be -- remain focused on helping the organization improve ROIC over time.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Steve.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Great. Before we take questions, I'd like to summarize by reiterating that while we are encouraged by the improved results we saw in fiscal 2014, we still have a lot of work to do. To that end, we would like to remind every one of our commitments going into fiscal 2015. One, we expect to drive accelerated annual revenue income growth across all of our franchisees. Two, we will continue to invest in our global infrastructure with the main focus on our customer-facing teams, getting the right people in the right roles and improving our R&D productivity. And three, we are committed to paying down debt and generating strong cash flows.","In closing, we feel good about the progress to date, feel even better about our future and you can count on us to deliver on our commitments.","With that, operator, please open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So just quickly, I guess, on the guidance. I just want to make sure that the guidance excludes the $20 million of divestitures. And how do you sort of handicap the recent CMS reimbursement on 3D tomo? And I guess, I'm trying to get down from the top line to the bottom line, the EPS guide looks a little weak, so any color would be helpful.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. Vijay, why don't I start it and Bob can jump in. So just to clarify, the divestitures are gone. So we took -- basically, the Roka stuff was a 2014 event. So we haven't counted that in either. On 2015, we had about $20 million of MRI business. That's normally part of Breast Health that would've been in there, that we haven't pulled it out as a separate item. But so we're basically just going to be going against that. So it depresses a little bit of that growth rate and probably looks a little funny to the models because, trust me, we feel really good about where the Breast Health business is going, particularly to your point on the reimbursement. And I think the way we look at the reimbursement right now is it's a little early to get too far ahead of ourselves. And I'll give a macro comment. Right now, at this point in time, is we're making great progress. It'd be really easy to be celebrating and getting a little bit ahead of ourselves. And I think from a guidance standpoint, we want to continue to be sensible and let each quarter continue to play out and let us put the points on the board. But don\u2019t mistake that for lack of confidence in terms of where we're headed. Particularly with the reimbursement part, it gives us a lot of excitement for where that business ought to be going in the coming year. Bob, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything?","Robert W. McMahon","No, I think just quickly regarding the guidance. As we were looking through our numbers in the models, because our manufacturing footprint is predominantly U.S.-based, the exchange rate and the translation of those exchanges hit the top line, but they don\u2019t hit our cost base. And so what you see is that $0.03, which is probably a little greater than what you would look at as our average overall company when you're trying to do the margin. So that's where we get there -- why we got to the numbers that we have. What I would say is when we're looking at our operating margins from a gross margin perspective, we're looking at those relatively consistently flat, so we're going to look at levers to offset those downsides and then also looking at operating expenses and leveraging those, not at the expense of future growth. So we continue to build or forecasting continued investments in our R&D areas and, to a certain extent, our sales and marketing organizations. It's primarily around the back office functions where we're looking to streamline.","Operator","We will go next to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And maybe just kind of a follow-on on that last topic. Can you maybe, Steve, just touch on some of the operational priorities for '15? You talked about some of management changes you made this past year, but maybe just talk about where you are in the process of evaluating manufacturing footprint? When could we start to see some tax rate leverages? Is that more of a '16 event? And just maybe some of the other operational initiatives that are going to be unfolding over the coming year?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, Tycho. The simple things in terms of focal points for 2015 are driving the heck out of our U.S. mammo business. And we feel really good about both the way orders finished up for the year and where we ought to be going on that business this year. Really getting our international business, turning that from promise and hope into the early stages of very clear reality. So I think you'll that. And the third one that really goes across all of our businesses, is really just improving our -- I hate to use the term commercial excellence, but it did -- does come down to that in terms of our selling, our marketing, our customer service through the whole gamut. And I think that level of operational excellence is going to be driving that improved growth rate as we go into 2015. In terms of both manufacturing strategy and tax, I think there, you've got to assume that's going to be more a '16 event. We clearly are -- to Bob's point, we're getting hit bigger as on the FX piece, with the dollar strengthening and virtually all of our manufacturing in the U.S. at this stage, it underscores that need to be looking at a more global manufacturing footprint over time. But we're being -- we've had a lot on our plate in the early stages here just to get sales and the basics going again. That will be the area that manufacturing and tax, that will really start to drive in the future years. So I kind of keep thinking about it. Current, call it, '15, '16, as far about short-term execution with what we have and call it, somewhere in the '16 and really '17 and beyond, is realizing more of those longer-term benefits.","Operator","And we will go next to Rich Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Steve, I just -- I'm jumping between calls. I apologize if this is a repeat, but what -- can you just remind us in the Breast Health, what is baked in with respect to the MRI divestiture? You said that your guidance -- it takes out the $20 million, correct? So it would be $20 million higher. And then also what about with respect to the exceptionally strong order growth that you referenced on the call? How much of that is factored into the 2015 growth outlook?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes, let's take the first part. So the -- basically, this year, we did $20 million of revenue on MRI coils. That's in our base for '14 that will evaporate in '15. So effectively, what you're looking at is the growth rate for next year is depressed by not having that $20 million in the numbers. So said differently, mid-single digit. We're basically -- we're giving up 2 points of growth in the comparison. The additional part in terms of the exceptional orders growth, just, say, they were very, very good when -- certainly, in our 10-K, they'll be out there, but we saw real strong growth, much of which was in the Breast Health area. So it gives us great confidence coming into 2015.","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, just to add on to that, Steve. If you looked at our performance on a year-to-date basis in '14 versus where we're projecting '15, it's clearly an acceleration on our Breast Health business. So year-to-date, on an operational basis, approximately 4% we're saying mid-single digits for '15, that included -- that incorporates this $20 million headwind associated with the MRI divestiture. So if we didn't have that, that mid-single digits would be up by another 2 points.","Operator","We'll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Shu Wang - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually Scott Wang in for David. Steve, can you discuss your outlook on the 3D tomography business and what it contributed to growth this quarter, what you expect for the trajectory going forward? And whether the acceleration in tomo adoption and conversion will be a little different from the adoption curve for 2D, given the existing installed base out there?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes, I think we feel great about where it's going to go. And in '15, it will clearly be accelerating versus the full year of '14. So in '14, as Bob just mentioned, we posted 4% growth. We clearly see that accelerating even with a couple of points of headwind from the divestiture to the MRI coil. So we see it definitely accelerating. Relative to your question about 2D versus the original 2D adoption, probably not quite the same curve. It's a different marketplace today. Capital constraints are different. So you've got -- basically, you've got a stronger installed base and you also have still much greater scrutiny on capital purchases within the hospital environment. So we continue to see this playing out over quarters and quarters. And dare I say, over the coming quarters, really, over the next couple of years, it's part of what makes us feel great about where we're headed here, not just for a 1- or 2-quarter pop, but really a much more sustainable driver over a bunch of quarters coming forward.","Operator","And we will go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask question on Diagnostics. You've obviously done well there at the past year, winning some major contracts in molecular and -- as well as screening -- blood screening, rather. But one thing I did notice is that the competitive landscape in HPV is changing pretty quickly here and some of your competitors are going after screening labels. Either they have them already or they're going after them for the future. So number one, do you think you guys need to get a screening label to kind of keep the momentum you have? And if so, how should we think about the OpEx impact there, which is on the R&D line?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. I'd say, more than anything, we feel really good about how our HPV business is performing. And I think it's pretty clear that we're growing significantly faster than the market. It's a key franchise for us and we're very focused. Whether we exactly need that label, we're always looking at what is the right labeling and what we need to go forth, but we think between both our existing franchise, we feel like we're in very good shape.","Operator","We will go next to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A question for me. Very limited sequential slippage in the cytology and perinatal business. So how close do we think we are to kind of seeing the end of the impact of the screening interval extension? And then on blood screening, just curious, you highlighted that as a potential growth avenue down the road. Just curious how much potentially you see here in the hepatitis E asset that Grifols has in Europe right now?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. Let me start with the cytology piece. We want to be very careful not to be out in front of declaring a bottom on the interval expansion. I'd say we're getting cautiously optimistic in terms of some of the slowdown in the growth rate. But until we've proven it, if you know anything about kind of myself and Bob's style, it's going to be let us prove things instead of going out and proclaiming them and we'd rather let the aftereffects really speak for themselves. So I think we feel good about that. And on the blood screening business, I think we feel really good about being partnered with Grifols outside the U.S. and certainly, what they're working on as well.","Operator","And we will go next to Mike Matson with Needham & Company.","Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess, I just wanted to ask about the GE system, their 3D system. What are you seeing, from a competitive standpoint, pricing-wise? And just how are they positioning against your system?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. We, frankly, really like the competitive advantage we still feel we have. So at the end of the day, they got -- as you know, they got a noninferiority claim. Theirs takes longer to administer. And the way they're obviously going to try to play to this, they're a great marketing force, you know that well. They're certainly going to try to bundle and get their GE houses. I think we feel really good about our installed base. We feel good that we're still, certainly in the recent quarter, still getting a number of competitive wins coming over and I think where it goes first is largely to their installed base and that will be still a formidable force for us. But I think we feel really good about the differentiation that we have.","Operator","And we will go next to Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Bob, maybe just a quick housekeeping one. On the EPS impact from the MRI divestiture and then a quick follow-up, for 2015 guidance.","Robert W. McMahon","Yes. So the EPS impact from the MRI divestiture is de minimis. It's really on the top line, where the biggest impact is. So it doesn't affect our guidance one way or another.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Great. And then the follow-up?","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","The region assay revenue stream on that system in particular, the menu is equivalent to a TIGRIS, so just kind of I would like to get an update on where that annual annuity stream is today and where maybe that can go by the end of '15?","Stephen P. MacMillan","What was that? I'm sorry, there was a question that got partially cut off. We didn't hear all of that question.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Is that better now?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. Just a quick question on Panther, an update there. If you can give us an update on where the annual revenue stream is in terms of reagents. The menu has expanded and is equivalent to TIGRIS at this point. Just wondering where that stands today and maybe where it can go by the end of '15?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. We're more focused in terms of disclosing on Panther placements, which as Bob mentioned, very good, where basically we increased our Panther placements by about 80% in the year. So exiting the year very strong. We're not giving per revenue numbers for the actual instrument.","Operator","And we will go next to Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So the first one is on 3D, just a quick one, balancing incremental reimbursement with incremental competition. What assumption for 3D pricing is embedded into guidance? And then the second question is on Panther. Any chance you would provide an update on the outlook for the virology program? If I remember correctly, I think the plan was to roll out some menu internationally in calendar '15 and that in the U.S. about a year later, these products are priced at pretty nice levels, but trials can be pretty expensive. So any details you could provide on plans and timelines would be appreciated, especially given that I think this could have some initial margin pressure, but then again depending on how you're thinking about pricing and keeping in mind some of the pressures on the STD menu from a pricing standpoint, this could actually benefit you as we think about it a year or 2 out.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, Doug. On the -- first, on the 3D mammo pricing, we want to be pretty disciplined and feel like we've got the best product on the market. And therefore, don't want to compete on price. So we're not assuming much erosion on the ASP at this point in time. On the virology piece. You're dead right, which is the R&D programs to get these things approved are a lot of money and that's a lot of what we're spending right now without the benefits of what will come. We do hope by the end of calendar year '15, which really gets into our fiscal '16, to be able to have the beginning of launches in Europe. And then to your point, probably at least a year behind that as it relates to the U.S. So right now, we're making the investments in the virology program. The paybacks, which really are at least 12 months out at this point or the beginnings of those paybacks at least.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes, just to follow up on that. Some of the guidance that we talked about for the first quarter incorporates some heavier R&D spend because of the timing of those development programs in the viral load area.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Can you talk specifically around that target that you had for 500 incremental placements for 3D? I didn't catch if you guys had commented specifically on that. And then with respect to divestitures, you made a small one, obviously, with the breast coils. Should we look for potentially other things that you're considering small product line that might be sold over the next 12 months?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes. So for the placement goal in the U.S. of 500 placements, we did exceed that. In fact, we placed 588 units for the year on 3D. So we feel very good about that and obviously, feel better about the future. Regarding the MRI business, can you repeat the question?","Robert W. McMahon","Do we have more plan like that? I think, at this point, we've largely done a lot of a cleanup. And we do realize, it kind of makes the models and it makes things look a little muckier than, particularly, as you look at our true growth rate next year and we haven't wanted to restate everything just given the magnitude of it, but we ask you to be mindful of it.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe the first one, just specific to the P&L. The gross margin, I think you said expect sort of flattish year-over-year. And you had pretty good expansion this year, I think to the tune of roughly 100 basis points. Notably, you had a lot of momentum in the back part of the year. Can you just talk to the dynamics of why that will be flat year-over-year and you wouldn't see any further expansion? And then I've just got a follow-up.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes, in simple terms, why don't I start it and then Bob can add. The simplest way to think about gross margin in 2015 is we have a heavy U.S. manufacturing base in the decline of the dollar. Clear -- or the strengthening of the dollar clearly puts more pressure on our gross margin piece. The other piece is as we grow our business outside the U.S., we're often doing that through dealers that are in a lower gross margin piece. So we effectively we're going to offset those pressures by really improved manufacturing efficiencies. Bob, did you want to add...","Robert W. McMahon","No, that's exactly right.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Very helpful. And then, Steve, I feel a little bit silly asking you for additional color or guidance on the data you gave 2015. But you've done a great job, you turned the corner, you're sort of growing in and around mid-single digit when you normalize for MRI, netbacks, et cetera. Just when you look out a little bit longer term, do you have the current portfolio to drive a further acceleration to high single digit? Or do you think you would need to go out and just have a few tuck-ins in order to accelerate them even further?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Thanks, Jon. Probably to get to high single digits, I would say probably a few tuck-ins along the way. I do think we're making great progress. We said at the start of the year, the first thing we need to do is slow down the declines of our declining franchises and accelerate growth of those that will grow. And I think we're making good progress there. Ultimately, if we can flatline a few of the declining ones and keep accelerating, can we get into at least mid -- at the high end of mid-single digits? I think organically, probably. To truly turn it into the high single digits may require a few tuck-ins along the way. And again, make no mistake about it, we're not going to go back to the big acquisition stuff, but we will look for prudent acquisitions. The great flip side of the organization right now is, everybody feels, every sales member, feels we've got a great bag to sell right now and that is encouraging.","Operator","We'll go next to John Zecy with MorningStar.","John Zecy - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Obviously, you've done really well with all the Panther placements and overall, molecular diagnostics performance. I was hoping you could just maybe talk a bit about what you're hearing on the ground from the low to mid-volume labs? Maybe sort of how their longer-term economics are looking as we maybe progress toward maybe like a more of a bundled payment environment? Just trying to get a sense of how competitive they'll be towards some of their larger reference lab competitors?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. Right now, I'd say, we're probably overdeveloped in the larger labs and we're starting to look -- frankly, we see those as an opportunity. And probably I think they'll -- there will be some shakeouts, certainly, in that part of the lab space. But it's still a very fragmented universe and we actually still see -- regardless of the pressures they feel, we see some opportunities for us, particularly with the Panther system.","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, I think to build on that point, Steve, as we think about molecular diagnostics going forward, we foresee continued volume increases, which will sit in the sweet spot of our Panther system. What those labs will have is the same pressures that some of the larger labs have that really our Panther and the benefits of our automation really play into. So we think that over time, we'll be able to take that Panther and go downstream and we think that, that has -- we have a long runway there.","Operator","And we will go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just had one question on mammography. I guess, as I was thinking of modeling, right, why would any customers buy, I guess, 2D dimensional, right? You just have reimbursement for 3D tomo, that's up 57. So I guess, as we're modeling, I mean, for those of us who have product models, like, how should we assume the 2D dimensional versus 3D dimensional?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes, I think in the U.S, you ought to assume just about everybody would be going to 3D. We do see significant opportunities with our new Head of International, actually for 2D outside the U.S. We still have a lot of hospitals around the world that are still in the analog world and have not converted over to full-field digital mammography. And in a lot of cases, I will tell you, a part of what we're trying to do is sell them 3D tomo and they're still in an analog world. So I think our team is realizing there's probably a great opportunity to stepwise them in and get demand on the 2D side. And then, by the way, have the annuity down the road, we can upgrade them to 3D in the future. So I think the U.S. will be virtually, mostly 3D, but outside the U.S., there will probably some opportunities for 2D.","Operator","We have time for only one more question. We will go to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just thinking ahead to RSNA, any color on what you might be highlighting? I think, last year, one of the things that you talked a little bit about was contrast mammography potentially replacing breast MRI. And I'm wondering, thinking about the divestiture, if contrast mammography potentially helps you overcome some of the shortfall from the divestiture?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes. I think the base focal point, candidly, is going to be on our Genius 3D Mammography. We've got such opportunity and such a differentiated product that I don't think we need to reach for other things. And frankly, don't have to do a lot of real marketing or dancing around the edges. I think it's hit them very straight with what we have, Tycho.","Operator","Thank you.

I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call.","Mike Watts","Thank you, Vicky. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, Company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer.","Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today. They we'll have a question-and-answer session.","If you did not already see our first quarter press release, a copy is available in the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a supplemental financial presentation for today's call.","We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally a replay of this call will be archived on our website through February 28.","Before we begin, I need to inform you that certain statements we make during this call may be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our fourth quarter earnings release or the supplemental presentation.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Steve MacMillan","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of our fiscal 2015. In short we had a very good quarter and our results reflect the positive strides our team is making.","The first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth and our highest organic growth rate in a number of years compared to the prior year period, which admittedly was an easy comp. Revenues of $653 million grew 6.6% on a reported basis and 7.7% on a constant currency basis.","Importantly, our growth was broad-based in the quarter as all four of our business segments grew between 6% and 8% on a constant currency basis. At the same time, we demonstrated strong earnings leverage in the first quarter.","Our goal is to grow profits faster than sales and we accomplished this in the first quarter. While revenues grew 6.6% on a reported basis, non-GAAP net income increased by 18.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 15.4%. ","Based on our results in the first quarter and our improving outlook, we are raising our financial guidance for the year. We also were able to voluntarily pay down some of our debt in the quarter, which remains a key priority for us. Bob will give you the details on both of items in a minute.","But first, let me just say that we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far in transforming Hologic into a company focused on sustainable organic growth. This transformation is occurring because great products, great people and new leadership are coming together in a powerful way.","In terms of products, we maintain market leading shares in several clinically important economically attractive markets which differ about Hologic today is out ability to grow sales in these categories.","In some cases, growth is coming from accelerating the adoption of our newest technologies. In digital mammography for example, we were very pleased with the uptake of our Genius 3D tomosynthesis system in the first quarter, as overall breast imaging sales grew at a low double-digit rate.","As some of you saw at the RSNA meeting in Chicago interest in our product is strengthening. This is based on a wealth of clinical publications, including the JAMA study, effective marketing by our team, and higher reimbursement levels that recently went into effect for Medicare patients.","In other markets, like blood screening, we are growing from market share gains. For example, the new business that our partner Grifols won with the Japanese Red Cross was a significant source of upside in the first quarter.","Similarly, although our liquid cytology business continues to decline in the United States based on longer screening intervals, we believe our rate of sales decline has slowed due to market share gains, as well as better focus and execution in the field.","The same is true in our surgical business, where slower rates of decline for our NovaSure franchise and even a little growth this quarter have allowed MyoSure growth to shine through.","Finally, in the market for sexually transmitted disease testing, growth is coming as we add test volume and menu to our fully automated Panther system. We are rapidly approaching our goal of placing 1,000 Panther systems in clinical diagnostics and blood screening, and revenue per system is growing steadily.","The success of our strategy can be seen from the fact that sales of our molecular diagnostic products grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the first quarter, including strong sales growth in the important domestic market.","Our product success would not be possible without our people, so I want to give a shout out to any employees listening to this call. From the first day I joined Hologic a little more than a year ago, I\u2019ve been struck by the talent of our employees, and their passionate dedication to our mission.","I\u2019m especially grateful to our sales and service teams. They are well-respected by their customers, and their tireless efforts have enabled us to slow sales declines first, and now return to growth. To me, they define commercial excellence.","To help our employees achieve their full potential, we have put in place a completely new and highly accomplished leadership team over the last few quarters new COO, new CFO, new Head of International, and new divisional presidents.","These executives have made a significant impact already, and really are just now beginning to settle into their roles. They are helping change the mindset of the organization by raising expectations and promoting accountability. Maybe most importantly, they are competitors who know how to win.","To round out the senior team, we recently hired John Griffin from Covidien to be our general counsel, and Ali Bebo from Ann Inc to become our Senior Vice President of Human Resources.","John and Ali, who will start next week, are both very special leaders who surely will help make our leadership team and our company even stronger.","We also hired back Mike Watts last quarter to lead our investor relations efforts. Many of you may know Mike from his years at Gen-Probe, and I know the rest of you will enjoy interacting with him in the future.","So in summary, as we look back at my first year at Hologic, I\u2019m proud of the progress we have made, and thrilled to have a team that can lead us to much greater successes.","We are clearly ahead of where we expected to be at this point, but it\u2019s still worth noting that we remain in the early innings of our corporate transformation. We realize that we can continue to improve just about everything we do as a company.","Building a track record of financial execution is obviously high on our list, with consistent growth in sales and faster growth on the bottom line. In the near-term, the primary drivers to accomplish this are clear, gaining more than our fair share of the breast mammography market, increasing our Panther menu and pull-through, and expanding globally.","But in the quarters ahead, we also will focus on revitalizing our R&D pipelines, and continuing to improve our operational efficiency. Over the longer term, as we have discussed before, we believe improving our capital structure and reducing our tax rate can drive additional value for shareholders.","It\u2019s an exciting journey that we\u2019re on, and I believe we\u2019re taking steps in the right direction.","Now I will hand the call over to Bob to discuss the financials in more detail.","Bob McMahon","Thank you Steve. I\u2019m going to discuss our first quarter results and then talk about our updated guidance. Unless otherwise noted, all my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, and %age changes will be on a year-over-year basis.","Steve already discussed total revenue, so I won\u2019t repeat that now, except to reiterate my enthusiasm for the broad-based progress our sales and marketing teams have made.","I do want to point out that in response to analyst and investor requests, we have provided some additional product sales detail in the presentation that is posted on our website.","This detail follows the format that we laid out in our JPMorgan presentation earlier this month, and we intend to provide the same data each quarter going forward. We hope you find it useful to better understand our business, and for modeling purposes.","Now on to divisional revenue. In diagnostics, sales were $304.1 million in the first quarter, up 6.4% % as reported, or 7.4% on a constant currency basis.","This increase was driven by a 26.3% increase in global blood screening revenue from our partner Grifols, mainly from new business with the Japanese Red Cross, as well as additional ordering by Grifols to normalize their inventory levels.","In the United States, revenue continued to decline at a mid-single-digit rate, primarily based on lower blood donation levels and ongoing efforts to manage blood usage.","The improvements in our diagnostics business extended well beyond blood screening in the quarter. For example, our molecular diagnostic business was up a reported 5.6% and 6.2% in constant currency, mainly from increased usage of Aptima women\u2019s health assays on our fully automated Panther instrument system.","Another important contributor to our quarterly performance in diagnostics was an improvement in our ThinPrep liquid cytology franchise. Specifically, revenue from cytology and perinatal products declined by only 1.2% on a reported basis, and were actually up 0.5% in constant currency.","We attribute this to better sales execution and focus, market share gains, and perhaps some improvement in the macro environment. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that we are not calling a bottom to this market, and we expect sales to continue falling, although at a slower rate of decline than in previous quarters.","Moving over to our Breast Health division, sales were $242 million, up 6.9% as reported, or 8.2% on a constant currency basis. This was primarily driven by an increase in breast imaging revenue, which was up a reported 10.9%, and 12.3% in constant currency, as customers continued to adopt Hologic 3D mammography. This was partially offset by breast intervention revenue, which declined a reported 2.3%, or 1.6% in constant currency.","Overall, we are excited about the progress we are making with our Genius 3D product, and we have only just begun to penetrate the addressable market. We are often asked about the effect that a new competitor is having in the U.S. breast tomosynthesis market.","While it's still early days, I can tell you that we are winning more than our fair share so far, and expect that to continue over time. We believe our success is based on a better product profile; that is, a superior FDA-approved indication, an impressive array of data on improved clinical outcomes, and product advantages such as faster scan times.","Shifting to the GYN surgical division, sales were $84.4 million, up 7% as reported or 7.9% on a constant currency basis. This was driven by MyoSure, as revenue increased a reported 27.4 %, or 27.9% in constant currency.","Quarterly sales of NovaSure systems also increased 0.1%, or 1.2% in constant currency, the first time this business has grown in a number of years, and a significant improvement compared to the declines seen in recent quarters.","To round out the revenue discussion, let me mention that in skeletal health, sales were $22.3 million, up 4.5% as reported or 6.1% on a constant currency basis. Growth in the quarter was driven in part by our new Horizon bone densitometry scanner.","Now let me turn to expenses and profitability. As Steve said, and as our guidance implies, our goal is to grow earnings faster than revenues. Although this won\u2019t happen every quarter due to the timing of expenses and various other puts and takes, we did demonstrate good leverage in the first quarter.","More specifically, non-GAAP earnings per share of 39 cents grew 15.4%, more than double our reported revenue growth even though the stronger dollar reduced our reported EPS by about a penny. Nonetheless, we exceeded the guidance we provided in November.","Non-GAAP gross margin was basically flat in the first quarter at 63.3%, as improvements in product mix and operational efficiencies offset the stronger dollar and continued pressure on price.","Non-GAAP total operating expenses of $198.5 million increased by only 1.2 %, a significantly lower rate of increase than revenues. Non-GAAP research and development expenses increased, mainly due to a ramp up in diagnostics product development. As we have said before, revitalizing the Company\u2019s R&D pipelines will be an important strategy to generate sustainable, organic growth.","Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses also increased, mainly due to increased promotional activities in Breast Health around 3D mammography.","But in non-GAAP general and administrative expenses declined, mainly due to lower external advisory fees, and we will continue to look to this line of the income statement for operating leverage.","This all led to non-GAAP net income of $111.6 million, an increase of 18.6%. Net income benefited from our continued efforts to pay down debt. 7.","Now I\u2019d like to turn to our updated financial guidance for the full fiscal year and next quarter. Based on our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance. Please note that this guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, with the understanding that currency has become a significant headwind for us and other multinational companies.","I\u2019m going to cover a lot of numbers in this discussion, so I\u2019d encourage you to refer to our press release for clarity. For the 2015 fiscal year, and on a reported basis, we now expect total revenues of $2.57 to $2.60 billion.","Compared to the prior year, this equates to reported revenue growth between 2.4% and 3.6 %, and constant currency growth between 4.4% and 5.6%. Still on the full year, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per share of between $1.54 and $1.57. This translates to reported earnings growth of between 5.5% and 7.5%, or 9% to 11 % on a constant currency basis.","Let me emphasize that even in the short time since we gave our initial 2015 guidance in November, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly. So compared to three months ago, the full-year guidance we are providing today incorporates an incremental revenue headwind of roughly $25 million due to foreign exchange, and an EPS headwind of roughly $0.02 over and above our initial guidance.","Said another way, if foreign exchange rates had not moved since early November, the updated guidance we\u2019re providing today would have been $25 million higher in revenue, and $0.02 higher in EPS.","Now let\u2019s turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We now expect total revenues of $640 million to $650 million for the quarter. Compared to the prior year period, this guidance reflects reported revenue growth of 2.4% to 4.0 %, and constant currency growth of 4.5% to 6.1%.","We also anticipate diluted, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.39 in the second quarter. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 2.7% to 5.4% on a reported basis, or roughly 5.5% to 8% on a constant currency basis.","Finally, I would like to conclude my remarks by reiterating that reducing debt remains one of the company\u2019s top priorities. In the first quarter, we voluntarily prepaid $300 million of our Term Loan B facility.","Our leverage ratio is now down to 3.8, based on net debt of approximately $3.5 billion and trailing 12 months EBITDA of $924 million. Our goal remains to reduce this ratio to 2.5 times by the end of fiscal 2017.","In addition, return on invested capital remains an important performance metric for driving shareholder value, and it therefore weighs heavily on executive compensation. Adjusted ROIC for the 12 months ended in December was 9.7%, up from 8.2% a year ago.","All in all, we are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, but still see many opportunities for continued improvement as we continue down the path of building a company that can be counted on for sustainable organic growth.","With that, I will ask the operator to open the call up for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Hi Isaac.","Isaac Ro","I just want to start with ThinPrep, it was certainly encouraging to hear the improvement there sequentially in absolute. Maybe if you could talk a little bit more about how you achieved that and the specifics around how you plan to sustain that improvement going forward?","Steve MacMillan","Sure Isaac, I think to a large degree our team has refocused the sales team are not just giving up and just accepting the declines and I think this is one of those classic scenarios of putting some more energy behind it.","I will say Eric Compton, our COO has started a \u201cWe love ThinPrep\u201d speech within the company and things like that are getting everybody reengaged in what is still a tremendously great product.","So I think we're slowing it in the U.S. and we're seeing opportunities outside the U.S. and I think we're certainly more confident that the steepest declines are behind us. We don't want to get out in front of ourselves in terms of being too far ahead on the market, but I think we're feeling certainly the most definitive that that rate of decline is halting.","Isaac Ro","Got it. That's helpful and then on Breast Health, you mentioned the market share opportunity for tomo being attractive here. Just talk a little bit about how that compares U.S. versus international?","I tend to think of the international market as being a little tougher just given the nature of the competition, but curious how you're thinking about the competitive landscape in tomo U.S. versus ex-U.S.? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. Thank you. We're actually encouraged on both fronts. Clearly a lot of momentum in the U.S. right now with the JAMA study, the incremental reimbursement and just our overall position.","But I would even tell you the JAMA study I think has given new life to our teams outside the United States and it's gotten a lot of pick up on a global basis and we did see a pickup and a meaningful pickup internationally in the quarter.","And I think as our new leader Claus Egstrand internationally is reengaging a lot of the folks there. I think we're actually probably more encouraged about the opportunities outside the U.S. than I would have been three or six months ago.","Bob McMahon","Yes, hey. Isaac, this is Bob, just to add on to that. I think one of the things that I think really encourages us about the O.U.S. is not only just tomosynthesis, but also our 2D opportunity and that's one thing where I think there is a whole untapped opportunity of actually converting analogue 2D and that ultimately form 2D to 3D.","There are many more analogue systems outside the U.S. and rather than trying to convince them to convert right to 3D, we're also looking at taking our leading technologies in 2D and converting their as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Hey thanks. Just looking at some of the businesses that have turned here, particular NovaSure and Skeletal Health, can you just maybe comment on how much of that growth was a function of new products versus maybe just revitalizing the sales force and changing combination with them?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Combinations Tycho, first we would be remiss if we didn't remind people those certainly were the easiest comps. Having said that, I think what you see in both businesses is revitalize sales force is really stable sales force.","If you go back to we've told a few people that we had tremendous turnover in that surgical sales force really in 2013 and 2014. They've been settling down in a customer facing business very important. We're getting a little bit of new news coming through on the products, but it's really I would say a very strong sales execution story and the sales force is settling down being reengaged.","Bob McMahon","Yes, I think just to build on that, we did launch the 6 millimeter that had an immaterial impact in the first quarter. we feel really good about that business going forward on the NovaSure but to build on Steve's point it was really about execution.","In the Skeletal business, it is being driven by the horizon, which is a relatively new product.","Tycho Peterson","And then just follow up, can you talk about expectations for Gen-Probe's molecular business? Part of your strategy is obviously to revitalize some of the growth and you have had some early success with viral load with HIV in Europe.","Can you maybe just talk about where you are from an investment standpoint and how much you need to reinvest in Gen-Probe to get the molecular business growing again?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Certainly we're feeling good, by the way we're not yet seeing commercial impact from the HIV in Europe. I think that give us hope for the future in terms of what will be coming.","I think the interesting part on that business has probably been missed is the growing panther placements that were occurring through last year, while everybody was focused on Quest and ultimately that Quest was going to anniversary, we're now beyond the Quest contract anniversary, but we're starting to see that growing freight train of strength from the Panthers.","Now that -- to continue that, A, there is certainly some mileage ahead of us here, but to the second part of your question in terms of investment, we are revamping investment to really build out a stronger pipeline over time and that will be more years out, other than the viral load stuff that we have coming in the next few years first outside the U.S. and then still a couple of years away in terms of the U.S.","But we feel right now again it's an execution story as we then start to put more on and then you will see additional investment in R&D here going forward. So we're both delivering, but also investing for the future.","Operator","We'll go next to Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Hi thanks and good afternoon and thanks for all the additional detail on the presentation too. I just want to start with the updated guidance for 2015 making sure I have all the puts and takes rate, just trying to bridge the guidance.","I would guess the term loan and the better first quarter performance reached $0.03 good guys and FX was a $0.02 headwind. Is there anything else in the remainder of the year that we need to keep an eye on just given the strength in the quarter. I might have thought that the full year guide might have come up a little bit higher?","Steve MacMillan","I think in this environment with the dollar changing and everything else right now and keep in mind, we still had a softer comp. we feel very good about the direction of the business, but frankly to take the low end, the needed low end of our guidance was at the top end of the old.","We think it's a very prudent way to go forward. Bob you want to add?","Bob McMahon","Yes, I think just the other -- just for modeling purposes, $0.03 is too high on the interest rate. We actually prepaid that at the end of the quarter. So think about that more appropriately a little over -- or a little less than $0.02. So not the full $0.03 that you're talking about because we have three quarters of the year benefit there.","Jack Meehan","Got it, that makes sense and is there any way to size the -- I guess just trying to figure out the strength and the blood screening business, what's the Japanese red cross versus the inventory level change was for Grifols'?","Steve MacMillan","Yes, for one, that's kind of a hard number to come up to actually detail out what I would say a lot of product associated with the inventory levels is associated with the Japanese Red Cross.","So, rather than looking at it as to specific entities what I would say is that growth is demand driven by the Japanese Red Cross and also increase in their inventories. We expect most of the inventory increase to be behind us now and no going forward will be primarily on the back of the Japanese Red Cross.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Steve MacMillan","Sure Doug.","Doug Schenkel","Actually, maybe just I guess another currency question, and actually wondering given you guys have talked for good reason about the opportunity that exists to get a bigger footprint internationally, just the strengthening of the dollar recognizing the balance sheet is getting a lot better but you are still a little bit stretched.","Does the strengthening of the dollar at all give you any opportunity to get a little bit more optimistic in investing O U.S. to maybe accelerate some of the aspirations internationally?","Steve MacMillan","Doug, we're not thinking about it quite that way. I think we're looking at the opportunity certainly as a longer-term and we are making the investments we need to. I don\u2019t think we're, frankly we don\u2019t want to throw bad money or good money after incomplete plans.","And I would say the team is still in the early stages of putting together the best plans and maybe if we were at a different stage in our managerial cycle, we had a really experienced team that's been in place for five years, you might look a little more opportunistically, but I think given right now we're really looking at it strategically.","Doug Schenkel","Okay that's helpful. And then going back to breast health, you began I think what you call the Genius consumer marketing campaign back in October. I'm just wondering if it's too early to tell how successful was that spend and if that is starting to play a role in helping uptake of 3D and maybe even at some level kind of fortifying the argument that hospital is going to get onboard with 3D otherwise you are going to risk losing volumes to other centers?","Steve MacMillan","Yes, without directly quantifying it we've heard from a number of customers that probably said they had helped push them over the edge and I know we've got a number of hospitals now starting to actually use it and marketing it, you know marketing our product in their own efforts.","So I think we're definitely feeling like it is not a catalyst. I think the simplest way to think about where we going on breast health right now is a bunch of things coming together.","The JAMA study came out right, if you got back to the fall, JAMA comes out, we start marketing more, the positive reimbursement, frankly a competitor on the market were we think we've got and it is very clear we've got a superior label and we've got the clinical data and a team that feels very good and these things are really working together to generate certainly the double digit growth we had this quarter in the breast imaging and we feel very good about where that business is going.","Operator","We'll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","I have two questions, maybe Steve I'll start off with you and Bob I'll give you a change to tag team one. So, if you think about the balance sheet for a second, I guess, for Bob what are probabilities near term in terms of extinguishing some of this debt, where do you go first and why?","And then Steve I wonder just give n the improving operating performance and obviously considering you've only been a little over a year but it's been a good year, what's the earliest timeframe in which you start considering M&A? And then I had a quick follow up.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, well Bob starts\u2026","Bob McMahon","Yeah sure, so thanks David and obviously we just prepaid the $300 million on our term loan B. That was the most expeditious way to do it without any prepayments of penalties and so forth.","So, we're looking at it across the spectrum overtime are looking at start picking off the various segments or sub-segments of our debt. What I would say is, we're looking at as you know, we have a fairly complex capital structure, debt structure with some converts and so forth some of those are in the money.","Those are certainly some candidates that we would be looking to, to evaluate early extinguishment as well our or extinguishment when call date comes as well as some of the other activities around our 6.25 interest rate debt.","So I would say we're going to be opportunistic, but do it in an economically NPV positive way.","Steve MacMillan","And David, I'll pick up on the second part. As you think about the ability to start doing what we call some M&A and I would categorize it that the first steps will probably likely be tuck-in and I think about it in terms of capability, both financial capability as well as managerial capability.","And I think we're still going to be a slight, call it, I wouldn't expect anything still in the next couple of quarters, but later in the year, next year, can we start to get to that position. I think what we wanted to do is financially we're getting stronger certainly, but the primary use is still going to be to pay down debt.","Meanwhile getting the management team fully in place where we're smart enough to make the right bets when we do make them. And if you think back to some of our experiences at other companies, you want to be in the role long enough that you know you're making the best judgment, not just the first thing that comes along.","And I think one of the real positives that's coming out of our improved performance is a company is suddenly just the amount of ideas coming to us in what I'd say the last 30, 60 days relative to ideas that came to us previously we now becoming much more viable partner for smaller companies that maybe looking to commercialize based on the success and frankly the quality of the team that we have over here now.","So, I think yeah, we're starting to screen a lot more, but we'll probably still be a little ways away.","David Lewis","Okay Steve, very helpful, thank you. Then Bob just a quick question, grow rate is obviously moving in the right direction. This notion that there is not significant margin opportunity in the business is a significant lesson debate. So I want to come back to the quarter here, very significant margin expansion in the quarter, so I want to kind of try to break it down into components.","Does this reflect frankly just a stronger quarter than expected and you had greater drop through is because the issue is the quarterly margin performance is not really trending into the balance of the full year.","So this is a better quarter than expected, was there some sense of conservatism as we're thinking about the guidance or Frankly there is just opportunities for new reinvestment that perhaps you weren\u2019t thinking about in November. So what were some of the factors for why that margin expansion in the quarter doesn't kind of pull forward to the year?","Bob McMahon","Yeah, well, it is a combination of all, a little combination of all those factors David. So you know, obviously we were pleasantly surprised by the strength of the business in the first quarter that drove some of the margin expansion. We also had year-on-year improvement in our G&A areas associated with those onetime advisory costs that didn\u2019t materialize in this quarter.","And then I think as we think about it going forward, there's two components, one is we are looking at opportunities for, to a certain extent some reinvestment work which is prudent and makes sense, but then also we're facing increasing headwinds around FX which will put pressure on our margins to a certain extent primarily around our gross margin and the predominance of our manufacturing is in the U.S.","And so we're in total about0.05 is what we're estimating for the full year and incremental to since the last time we gave guidance. Only about a penny of that hit in the first quarter. So we still had about $0.04 of that incremental headwind to go.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Steve, maybe I could start out on the OUS kind of transformation I know that you have been talking about since you've taken over. That's something that you identified right from the get-go as an area for significant improvement across all businesses.","Maybe you could just provide a quick update on kind of what you've done so far, where you still have room to go through initiatives, how much is there internally left to do, and maybe piggybacking off of prior question, what could you do externally?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, clearly all of our focus is on internal, let me take it in buckets. We started to see some upturn better performance certainly in our fourth fiscal quarter and that continued into this quarter. Now some of it is the Japan Red Cross.","So I want to make sure we don't take full credit for what's happening there, but we are seeing the new leader Claus Egstrand has really taken a much more focused approach to the business paring back instead what we call the peanut butter analogy of going after all the countries.","He's really focusing in the key franchises in the countries and reengaging our dealer network on the breast health side and has brought in some very good executives from the diagnostics world to really focus on diagnostics.","He also has identified properly big opportunity for us and really getting the teams working and reengaged opportunity for us and really getting the teams working and reengage and it's really a lot of blocking and tackling, but given the enormous underdevelopment, shall we say in terms of where we are, his whole team has been we have the products and we just need to execute better, whereas I would say when I first arrived there was a lot of whining that we didn\u2019t have the right products.","And you know we needed for example low-cost tomo and as Bob articulated earlier, one of the things Claus figured out is we don\u2019t necessarily need low cost tomo, we can still sell 2D in a lot of markets that still haven't moved from film. So, it's looking market by market at the opportunities. There is nothing sexy about it, but it's good hard work blocking and tackling, re-engaging.","In terms of the second part of your question around deploying M&A, we will be looking, but it's not at all the primary driver. We think we've got so much runway with the products that we have, that probably not likely to be a huge near-term focus for us.","Richard Newitter","That's very helpful and then just a quick one on the breast imaging side, you know maybe you could tell us now that GE is on the market, to the extent that you maybe teams and pitches were reengaged with GE heavy accounts, but now that they have something that the customers are starting to compare it to because there is a GE product, are you actually able to convert some of the GE accounts to Hologic to tomo or is most of the stress you are having within the existing Hologic accounts? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","I want to be very careful around how I say this, because you know me to be conservative. But I think the approval has probably been a much bigger net positive to us given the label that they got approved and the product they got approved considering they came three years late.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","David Clair","Hi good afternoon everybody. It is actually Dave Clair in for Bill. So the first question from me, I was hoping to get an update on the state of the Chinese adoption of any T-testing? And then is this going to be a national rollout in China or is it province by province?","Steve MacMillan","We are very little into Asia. Our understanding is province by province and I think they are in very, very early stages. And it is definitely not going to be a national, it is not like the Japan Red Cross, you push a button and go.","David Clair","Okay, and then you mentioned increasing Panther menu as a priority, so can you give us any color on potential pipeline assays there and any updates on viral load?","Steve MacMillan","Yeah at this point we have publicly talked about viral load. We've got that coming first in Europe. Call it really next year for intents and purposes and then a year behind that to the U.S. and then the additional menu we've really been revamping and not prepared to talk about that at this point.","Operator","We'll go next to Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe just a follow up there on clinical diagnostics in terms of the HIV viral load, do you have a plan to maybe launch that on Tigris as well and then may be just a high level comment on pricing and margin of that essay versus the existing portfolio? And then I have a follow on3D.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, the HIV, we do not have plans to commercialize that on Tigris at this point. Panther is really the way of the future and that's where we're focused. We're not getting into specific pricing discussions on that.","Anthony Petrone","Understood, and then just on 3D, maybe just an update on how you see the product cycle progressing from here and you have JAMA and the CPT code in place.","Steve you gave some good statistics at J.P. Morgan about 1400 systems have been converted at the installed base. If you do the math it's been around 300 to 600 per year. Should we be forecasting sort of an acceleration in placements from that range? And then what is the opportunity just in terms of going after completing targets where all the comments from the GE launch here? Thanks again.","Steve MacMillan","Sure Anthony. I think we continue to describe the 3D tomo adoption as a freight train more than a rocketship. I think that momentum building and you probably would expect to see an acceleration of the adoption from the last few years and that really should carry us here for at least a number of years based on where we stand right now in terms of a total of call it 12,000 or 13,000 installed opportunities in the United States and still where we are less than 15% of the market, so big opportunity here over the coming years.","Now again, it's not all going to come in one year or two because of when people have installed and capital cycles and everything else. And, you know, frankly that gives us more confidence about the longer-term sustainability of our growth trajectory, but meanwhile we are certainly approaching it with a great sense of urgency.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Matson with Needham & Company.","Michael Matson","Thanks for taking my question.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, hey Mike.","Michael Matson","Hey, so just to take you back to your Stryker days Steve, I was going to ask a question about the capital spending environment. So, we've seen some signs of the capital spending at the healthcare facilities and hospitals is picking up and I was wondering if that was factoring into the strong growth you were seeing with your mammography business as well?","Steve MacMillan","We think it's probably contributing Mike. You know that we'll credit the external environment for some of our growth as opposed to taking full credit for it. So certainly I think it has been modestly helpful to us and I also just think that in general the way that the clinical data the additional, I think what has really happened in the last three months probably more than anything is hospitals are recognizing 3D truly is the future. And that's probably driving it more than even the capital cycle, but the capital is certainly helping us a bit.","Michael Matson","Okay thanks, and then just a follow up on the questions about the international business, just wondering if you could give us your view on how you sort of balance your progress in the developed markets like Europe and Japan versus the emerging markets, how big of an opportunity is there in the emerging markets and is that something we could see a benefit from in the near-term or is that going to be a longer-term story?","Steve MacMillan","I call it a qualified balance approach. The interesting part is we do still have so much opportunity as you point out in the developed markets. We have gaping opportunities still in Europe, in Japan and China depending on which market you put that in. But we also are seeing some opportunities in Latin America and certainly some of the other Asian countries.","So I think on an absolute dollar basis, we'll probably see a little bit more out of the developed markets, but certainly growth out of both and I think we're earlier stages in the emerging markets and we're still early stages on some of these pieces all over, but it should be coming over time here.","I guess one of the benefits to kind of the strategy that we have and given the fact that we are so underdeveloped outside the U.S. in some of the developed markets as well is just that the margin pressure that you see in the emerging markets and that growth isn't near the same as in the developed markets.","And so when we think about the difference in the U.S. and no OUS markets we still have some pressure there in terms of market, but not the effect that some companies that are going strictly after growth in emerging markets only. And so that's helping us in terms of the amount of investment and operating income growth as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and then maybe I'll just start off with one housekeeping question on the guidance rates. So if you're looking sort of the implied growth rates for the back half you just printed 8% Q1 sort of pointing out maybe midpoint or slightly above the mid singles the second quarter. So that implies sort of low singles for the back half and I was wondering was this sort of what caused the variance. I understand some of it is comp is this any particular segments I'm just curious what the assumptions were?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, I think at a high level if you look at our guidance for the year now it is, call it mid single digit growth 4.5% to 5.5%. We think in this environment this year that will be pretty good performance. We obviously got a huge head start.","We do start in the second half of the year starting to go up against a little bit better performance and that's why we keep, we want to point out that this first quarter was clearly against a very soft comp. But we don\u2019t want to be signaling a huge deceleration. What we're really saying is we feel good about the business, but it is not growing at the rate yet that we just posted this quarter.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks Steve and maybe one for Bob. You know something that you mentioned caught my attention. Lower advisory fees and that sounds sort of its repetitive in nature, is that the way to read it or I am not sure how to read the comment?","Bob McMahon","Yes, so there were some one-time cost associated with -- in our Q1 of '14 that wouldn't be replicated going forward. I think that helped us in our managing our G&A areas or actually G&A decline as I spoke about Vijay. I would expect to continue to have strong cost controls there, but not at the rate of decline that we saw in the first quarter?","Steve MacMillan","Yes, Vijay just a little additional color. Recall we had a lot of activism in the stock and proxy, thoughts in everything else going on in the year ago quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum.","Bill Bonello","Hey, thanks a lot for taking my call. I wanted to revisit the notion of the so called investor debate over earnings power and just curious Bob now that you've been there for a while when you look across in the income statement, would love to get your thoughts.","I know you're clear that you should be able to grow earnings faster than revenue, but I am wondering if you can give a little bit more color on some of the things that you've been able to identify as opportunities in particular.","I know you guys just hired a new head of global supply chain and it sounds like maybe there are low hanging fruits there, but if you want to elaborate on that or other opportunities?","Bob McMahon","Yes, I'll start at maybe the highest level and give you maybe some examples. So if we think about our gross margin, as I think about that going forward, what I think is we're going to generate operational efficiencies, but that's going to offset continued pressure and price some of the growth outside the U.S.","And so you should think about that more as flattish. An example that some of those operational efficiencies would be things like sourcing or procurement. So one of the area that we've identified now bringing on our supply chain head is looking at across our entire network and footprint, how do we leverage the spend that we have more efficiently and so that would be a way of looking at our quite honestly the largest P&L line item that we have and driving a lot more savings out of the materials that go into our products. That's the way that we will be able to drive some efficiencies.","In addition as we drive revenue, that's going to help with efficiencies in our existing footprint through just more throughput into the manufacturing facilities. So those are two big components of how we will continue to drive affiance there.","I would expect it to have some modest operational leverage in the OpEx side. I would expect us to have R&D investments continuing to grow albeit not at a rate necessarily accelerate faster than sales, but certainly at the level of sales.","Same with sales and marketing and then what I would look at is the G&A area is funding that growth and over time you would see some modest leverage in the operating. Where we will get the most leverage from a net income standpoint is through two elements.","One is by paying down debt, re-interest rate, our interest expense will do down and certainly we believe that we have opportunities and our tax albeit longer term to drive that down and drive operating -- net income growth.","Bill Bonello","Okay. That is very helpful and I have no related follow-up question.","Steve MacMillan","All right. Thanks Bill.","Operator","We will go next to Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","All right. Thanks for taking the questions. I know you talked about the Chinese once market, but in general are there any new budgets screening tenders out there that we should be thinking about and also can you just refresh us on the timeline for your contract with the American Red Cross. How long does that go?","Steve MacMillan","Sure Brian. We obviously never want to comment on specific contracts or contractual timing for any single customer, especially by the way when that contract is between Grifols and as specifically we talk about the American Red Cross.","We will tell you we had a long-term multifaceted collaboration with the American Red Cross and it does have many years left to run. So we feel very good about that.","In terms of the first part of your question. The other tenders around the world, they come up all the time but nothing of this significance certainly of the JRC of the American Red Cross. So they are certainly the two biggies.","Brian Weinstein","Got it and then with respect to the molecular diagnostics growth in the quarter, which was good, can you comment at all about specific assays that were driving that. Obviously Qiagen was out again today talking down some of their HPV growth. Are you seeing a pickup in HPV? Is it CT\/NG, Trich? Is it across the Board? Where are you guys seeing the strength? ","Steve MacMillan","Yes certainly we would say HOV has been a big strength of ours also Trich. So we're seeing it across the Board. Effectively our portfolio there of women's health products, but HPV has been a tremendous driver for us.","Bob McMahon","Yes, we believe that HPV we're gaining share significant gain share at the expense of them. So we feel good about all of our assays. All of our assays grew in the quarter.","Mike Watts","Operator, I think we might have time for maybe two more questions.","Operator","We'll go next to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson Bedford","Good afternoon, and thanks for squeezing me in.","Steve MacMillan","Sure Jayson.","Jayson Bedford","I had just a couple questions. Just on the 2Q guidance, historically this is a business that would have kind of a big fourth quarter, softer first quarter, and then increased sequentially throughout the year.","I would argue last year the fourth quarter wasn't quite as big, but certainly the first quarter was much stronger. Yet your second quarter guidance implies a sequential decline. And so, I guess I realize that surgical is always down sequentially in this quarter, but I'm wondering why would revenue be down quarter on quarter? It seems like it's a little more than just FX.","Bob McMahon","Well that actually is the biggest issue. I think what we feel good about is especially as you pointed out that fourth quarter to first quarter we think we're getting a much more established cadence here and I think frankly if it wasn\u2019t for FX, keep in mind it's moved fairly significantly here quarter -- last year to now and even last quarter to this quarter, we would probably be on the border of sequential growth continuing.","Jayson Bedford","Okay.","Bob McMahon","Okay. Just to give you a flavor we're expecting FX to double -- the impact to double in the second quarter versus the first quarter. You saw the dramatic strengthening of the dollar really in January of this year and so that's by far in a way the largest piece of that and we expect that to continue throughout the year.","Steve MacMillan","And Jayson the one other piece we were slightly stronger as we pointed out just from some of the inventory stuff. So if that was normalized, I think what we were really seeing is an underlying trend of continuing to grow sequentially.","Jayson Bedford","Okay. And as a quick follow-up, international growth was a lot faster than U.S. growth in the quarter. When you look at the geographical mix of the business for the rest of the year, is double-digit international growth sustainable on a constant currency basis for the year?","Bob McMahon","Certainly the Japan Red Cross piece is helping us a lot there, that's our goal, we're not quite ready to declare the work at that level.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block","Great, and thank you for squeezing me in. I'll try to be brief, two quick ones. Steve, maybe the first one. If you could just talk the lay of the land, U.S. tomo several months post the reimbursement news what are you seeing in the field?","In other words are you seeing maybe the sales cycle shortening with some of the additional visibility, and then also you cited a strong backlog at the end of September in U.S. Breast Health. What are you seeing at the end of the calendar year?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. I think the -- I think we feel better from the field and I will tell you that we probably -- my own read was we took a slight step back when our friends got approved and then we showed up at RSNA and then we started to realize the full labeling in the offering and the team is I think feeling better than ever about what we can do in this marketplace with the product we have.","So right now I think we're feeling far better, backlog we don't report on it quarterly, but continuing to be very good.","Jon Block","Okay. And then I may have missed this earlier, but on the blood screening side you put up some big, big numbers and you referenced JRC, and I always realize there's going to be sort of ebbs and flows with big deals.","But is there a way to think about normalized growth ex that impact, so in our models when we start thinking out when you lapped that deal, how the underlying growth may look more in that division? Thanks, guys.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. I think we articulated it that on an annualized basis, the first year it was $20-ish million. So call it $20 million to $25 million. It was going to give us about a one percentage point boost for the total corporation for the year and then it anniversaries.","And I think just the way we think about that, it's a little bit like the Quest deal and the molecular business in the U.S. where you can get a little bit of a boost, but then it's our jeep spilling that that and growing in the after math of that with anniversaries.","So we're busy working with our partners Grifols right now to think about what's next.","Operator","Thank you. And that is all the time we have question today. This now concludes Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Have a good evening."],"10449":["Hologic, Inc.

My name is Denise, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today; then we'll have a question and answer session. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through August 25.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release. Finally, unless otherwise noted, all percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We posted solid results overall and delivered on our near-term financial commitments. Revenue exceeded our guidance, and non-GAAP earnings per share finished at the high end of our forecast. Our molecular diagnostics and international businesses continue to emerge as strong growth drivers. And our recently acquired Cynosure business performed in line with our quarterly expectations.","From a longer-term perspective, our quarterly results reflect positively on our efforts to revitalize and reshape our business portfolio. If you could have listened to our strategic planning discussions back in 2015, when our domestic Breast Health business was driving tremendous growth, we knew that we needed molecular and international to accelerate when breast inevitably slowed. And that is exactly what has happened, as we upgraded leadership and made the necessary investments. This quarter, in fact, both business, international and molecular, posted double-digit growth, results that would've seemed unlike even a year ago.","But while we were working to establish new growth drivers in molecular and international, we were also ramping up R&D in all our divisions to ensure that we could generate sustainable organic growth for years to come. Several of the new products that resulted, like the Affirm prone biopsy system and MyoSure REACH, are making increasing contributions to growth. This quarter, for example, sales of new products exceeded $40 million globally, although obviously this is not all incremental. And other new products are emerging, some of which we'll discuss today.","But, before doing that, let's provide a brief overview of our third quarter results. Reported revenue of $806.1 million grew 12.4% on a reported basis or 13.1% in constant currency. Margins were solid based on continued price discipline and solid expense control, which led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50. EPS declined by 2.0% compared to the prior-year period, a small amount considering the comp included a full quarter's contribution from our divested blood screening business. So we are doing an effective job of filling that earnings hole with gains in our base business, as well as Cynosure. If you were to back out blood screening and Cynosure, core revenues grew 2.4% on a reported basis or 3.1% in constant currency. Similarly, core EPS would've increased 11.9% if you excluded blood and Cynosure. So we continue to show good leverage up and down the income statement.","So while it was a solid quarter overall, we plan to do better. At Cynosure, our efforts to stabilize and strengthen the domestic sales force are underway under new leadership, and our R&D remains highly productive. And in Breast Health, we are excited about new claims for our Genius 3D mammograms, new insurance coverage, and new products that we're launching now, which we will discuss for the first time today.","With that introduction, now we'd like to discuss some third quarter revenue highlights, focusing on molecular diagnostics, international, Cynosure, and Breast Health. Then I'll hand the call over to Bob to cover other revenues, expenses, and our updated guidance.","First, growth in the quarter was led by molecular diagnostics, where global sales of $144.1 million increased a very healthy 10.3%. The story here is very similar to prior quarters. In the United States, where sales grew at a high-single-digit rate, our commercial team is doing an excellent job of cross-selling our full product portfolio, increasing market share and utilization of our fully automated Panther system, and expanding the market by driving compliance with testing guidelines. In addition, this quarter we gained FDA clearance for our Aptima assay to detect herpes simplex virus 1 and 2. While the molecular herpes market is not huge, our new test is an important addition to the Panther women's health menu and a nice incentive for new customers to try out the system.","Outside the U.S., where molecular sales grew more than 20% for the fourth time in five quarters, we continue to see the benefits of new leadership, healthy Panther placements, and multiple new-product introductions, including our viral load assays. And we recently received a CE Mark for our new Panther Fusion system, which provides lab customers new capabilities and enables them to further consolidate testing on our platform. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are on our way to building an international molecular business that rivals the leadership position we've established domestically.","Beyond molecular diagnostics, we are very pleased with the continued growth and positive evolution of our international business as a whole. More than a year ago, we said this business felt like a start-up and told you that building the foundations for sustainable growth would take some time. But we laid that groundwork in a very deliberate way, starting with new leadership. Now, for the second consecutive quarter, international sales grew low double digits, excluding blood screening and Cynosure. While we are still early in the game, we are clearly putting points on the board and are encouraged by our progress.","One reason we are feeling good about international is the breadth of our performance. In recent quarters, molecular diagnostics and surgical led the charge, but this quarter, every business except Skeletal posted solid growth. In particular, I want to highlight the progress made in international Breast Health. As a reminder, in all four quarters of our fiscal 2016, that business declined. In the first quarter of this year, it was flat; then it grew at a mid-single digit rate in Q2. This quarter, international Breast Health grew in the low teens, reflecting our efforts to optimize channel strategies and strengthen our commercial capabilities.","The third area I'd like to discuss is Cynosure. Our view of Cynosure continues to be very optimistic over the long term, though still cautious in the near term. Cynosure posted revenue of $110 million in its first full quarter as part of Hologic. This was much higher than in the second quarter sequentially, and in line with our quarterly guidance. There was a lot to like about Cynosure's performance in the quarter. First, we are pleased with sales of skin-related products, especially PicoSure. Second, overall international sales grew significantly compared to the prior year. Third, sales of consumables increased at a low-teens rate, driven by dramatic growth in SculpSure PAC keys, which illustrates the value that our product is providing in the field. And, fourth, we made important progress in new product development.","But at the same time, it's clear that we can improve Cynosure's commercial execution in the United States, just as we did at the larger Hologic three years ago. As we discussed last quarter, there's been a considerable amount of disruption in the U.S. sales force, and newly hired reps are still getting up to speed.","To tackle this challenge, we have named Kevin Thornal as Division President of Cynosure. I've personally known Kevin, who engineered the remarkable turnaround in our European Breast Health business over the last year or so, since our years together at Stryker. He is a strong, commercially focused leader who we're confident will have Cynosure growing again in 2018. Kevin replaces Michael Davin, who will be retiring on September 1. Michael built Cynosure into the world's leading medical aesthetics company, and we thank him for remaining with Hologic during the integration process to share his expertise and knowledge.","Longer term, we remain enthusiastic about the value of the aesthetics market, as well as Cynosure's ability to lead it. Nothing has changed in terms of the positive market backdrop. With the changes we are making, we are now in an excellent position to capitalize on these tailwinds, with a broad portfolio of differentiated products, the commercial expertise and backing of Hologic in areas like direct-to-consumer advertising, and a robust R&D pipeline.","As evidence of this last point, we received FDA clearance ahead of schedule this quarter to use SculpSure, our non-invasive body contouring product, to treat the back and thighs. In addition, we have filed for regulatory clearance to use SculpSure in what's called the submental area, under the chin. This is a significant market opportunity that should boost growth in 2018, as we believe our laser technology provides an advantage over the competition. And, finally, we have filed for clearance of an innovative new radiofrequency platform, which over time will have applications in aesthetic, women's health, and surgical markets.","Now we'd like to turn to our fourth subject, Breast Health. In the third quarter, global Breast Health sales of $283.7 million increased a modest 0.9% in constant currency. The U.S. business declined 1.7%, while international sales increased 13%. In the United States, incremental placements of 3D gantries declined, like in recent quarters, as the time required to close deals has increased due to market and competitive dynamics. But at the same time 3D units increased sequentially, booking trends remain solid, our backlog is healthy, we still have roughly half our installed base to upgrade, and we remain a net market share gainer.","In addition, other drivers of growth continue to emerge within Breast Health. For example, service revenue again benefited from an expanding installed base in the United States, delivering more than $100 million in sales. Revenue from our interventional products also increased nicely, as we are doing a better job of selling our full portfolio. Finally, sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system continued to build.","In addition to these positive trends, several other factors give us confidence that our domestic Breast Health business will grow in 2018. First, this quarter we earned important new labeling indications that will broaden our competitive advantage. Our sales representatives can now say that Genius mammograms are the only mammograms clinically proven to detect 20% to 65% more invasive cancers than 2D alone, with an average increase of 41%. In addition, only Genius mammograms are FDA-approved as superior to 2D mammography for routine screening of the nearly 50% of women who have dense breasts. This is meaningful because more than 30 states now have laws requiring women to be notified of their breast density.","Second, we made significant progress on reimbursement during the third quarter. Approximately 85% of American women in our target patient population now have incremental insurance coverage for 3D, which we believe will solidify even broader market adoption over time.","And third, we expect sales of new products to continue to build as we move into 2018. Revenue from our Affirm prone biopsy system is healthy, and we expect to launch Brevera, our innovative new biopsy system, around the end of our fiscal year, so our interventional portfolio is well-positioned for long-term growth.","Finally, we wanted to share for the first time that we are in the process of launching our first two new mammography systems since 2011. These new products will enable us to further segment the market and extend our competitive leadership position.","Our new 3D Performance system, which has been launched globally, provides the superb image quality that customers have come to expect from Hologic, but with workflow capabilities and throughput that are geared toward smaller, lower-volume customers.","In addition, at the high end of the market, the best just got better. Our new 3Dimensions system delivers the industry's fastest, highest-resolution breast tomosynthesis exam, plus a wealth of additional improvements. These include a better patient experience using the SmartCurve breast stabilization system; superior image clarity from our fastest and highest-resolution detector; and faster, better 2D images from improved software and machine learning algorithms. The 3Dimensions system has been launched overseas, where customers are giving it positive reviews, and we expect to introduce it domestically in the coming quarters. So, behind the scenes, our R&D team in Breast Health has been highly productive, and we look forward to these products adding to growth in coming quarters.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that we are pleased to have met our financial obligations in the quarter. We expect molecular diagnostics and international to be increasingly important growth drivers in our portfolio and have lots of new product innovation on the way to improve growth at both Cynosure and in Breast Health. So we believe we are well-positioned for the future. Now I will turn the call over to Bob.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to highlight some of our other divisional sales drivers, walk through our third quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis.","As Steve mentioned, we posted solid results in our third quarter. Molecular diagnostics and international performed well and are emerging as new growth drivers within our portfolio, consistent with our strategic plan. This is an important development, as our domestic molecular business and our international franchises combined to represent nearly 40% of revenue this quarter. And we have initiatives in place to improve growth at Cynosure and in Breast Health, based on both better commercial execution and productive R&D.","With that introduction, I'll begin with Diagnostics, our largest division, where revenue of $284.1 million decreased 7.4% due to the divestiture of our blood screening business. Although we closed this transaction last quarter, we do have an ongoing agreement with Grifols for raw material and instrument supply, which yielded $19 million of very low margin revenue in the quarter. This was higher than expected, and much more than we anticipate in the fourth quarter as well. Excluding blood screening, Diagnostics revenue grew a solid 5.4% in the quarter.","Since Steve already covered molecular, I'll mention that cytology and perinatal sales of $121 million were essentially flat in the quarter versus a tough comp from last year.","In our GYN Surg business, revenues of $106.5 million grew a solid 5.2%. MyoSure continues to lead the charge, with global sales growth of 20.8% in the quarter. NovaSure sales declined 5% as we've lapped the benefit of a competitive withdrawal. Specifically, it's worth noting that the third quarter a year ago was a huge one for NovaSure, as sales grew by nearly 15%, making for the toughest comp of the year for the division as a whole.","To wrap up the revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $21.8 million declined 5%, although we are encouraged by interest in our bone density products, especially for body composition testing in the U.S., and expect this business to improve in the fourth quarter.","Now, moving down the P&L, gross margins of 63.1% decreased 260 basis points compared to the prior year. This was mainly due to product and geographic sales mix, the divestiture of our blood screening business, and a full quarter of sales from Cynosure products, which carry a lower gross margin.","Total operating expenses of $274.9 million increased 19.9%, primarily due to the inclusion of Cynosure expenses for the full quarter. But if you back these out, we demonstrated good operating leverage, with total expenses declining by 4.2%.","As a result, operating margin was 29% in the quarter. This was 480 basis points lower than a year ago due to product and geography sales mix and the blood screening divestiture. However, our profit profile remains among the best in the medical technology industry, and we have nice opportunities to boost operating leverage going forward.","To round out the discussion on the income statement, net margins of 18% decreased 220 basis points compared to a year ago, as negative mix was partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.","All this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50, at the high end of our guidance range. Despite the divestiture of the very profitable blood screening business, EPS declined by only $0.01, so we are doing a good job of filling the earnings hole with growth in our base business and Cynosure. Specifically, Cynosure contributed $0.02 to EPS this quarter, so we have already achieved the accretion goal we had established when we announced the deal. If you back this out, along with the $0.01 from blood, non-GAAP EPS in our base business grew 11.9%, much faster than sales.","Now, before we talk about our updated guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics, beginning with the balance sheet. Total debt decreased $201 million compared to the prior year. Of note, we repurchased $200 million in principal of our convertible notes for $269.1 million, reducing their future dilutive impact. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently stands at 2.6 times, and we remain comfortable around this level.","One reason we are comfortable with our debt load is that we continue to generate strong cash flow. This quarter, free cash flow was $180.1 million on a normalized basis, excluding the large tax payment we made related to the gain on the sale of the blood screening business. So combined with our revolver, we have plenty of capacity to continue to pursue small, tuck-in acquisitions and eliminate our remaining convertible debt when the notes become callable in fiscal 2018. Now, finally, adjusted EBITDA of $260.7 million decreased slightly compared to the prior year, as improvements in our base business were offset by the divestiture of blood screening business.","Now let's turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter, beginning with our full-year revenue guidance. We are reducing our full-year guidance, mainly due to expectations for lower Cynosure sales in the fiscal fourth quarter. While we have made good progress in stabilizing and strengthening the U.S. sales force, we know it will take these reps some time to get up to speed and for our other commercial initiatives to kick in. In addition, the overall medical aesthetics market experiences a seasonal slowdown over the summer months. So our guidance implies a significant decrease in Cynosure revenues compared to the prior year, when sales were roughly $106 million.","All in, we now expect reported revenue of $3.04 to $3.055 billion in fiscal 2017, representing reported growth of 7.3% to 7.8%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to high single digit constant-currency growth of between 7.9% and 8.4%. If you were to back out Cynosure and blood screening, we continue to expect solid, mid-single digit growth in our core franchises.","With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenues of $785 million to $800 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior-year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 8.0% to 10.1% on a reported basis, or 8.3% to 10.3% in constant-currency terms.","For modeling purposes, let me remind you of two things that'll affect our fourth quarter results. First, as we discussed when we initially gave guidance for the year, we have one less selling day in the quarter versus the prior year. We estimate this will depress our growth rates by 70 to 80 basis points or so. But, at the same time, we are due a multimillion-dollar royalty payment from one of our diagnostics partners, which will boost our molecular line.","Now let's move on to our revised EPS forecast. We are slightly raising the midpoint of our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year to a range of $2.00 to $2.02, which implies reported growth between 2% and 3.1%, and constant currency growth of between 3.0% and 4.1%. So we are growing non-GAAP earnings for the year despite losing a net $0.22 per share from blood screening. Please note that while we will continue to see blood screening revenue throughout the year as we fulfill our contractual obligations to Grifols, these sales will be much smaller than recent quarters, and essentially have zero impact on EPS.","This earnings guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, a full-year tax rate of 30.5%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 288 million for the full year. This full-year guidance translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 to $0.50 in the fourth quarter. This represents a decrease of 3.8% to 7.7% on a reported basis, and 3.4% to 7.2% in constant currency, primarily due to the divestiture of our blood screening business, partially offset by the acquisition of Cynosure. Now, as you update your forecasts, we would again encourage you to model around the midpoint of our guidance ranges, as we've incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecasts.","Now, before opening the call for questions, let me summarize by saying that we delivered on our revenue and EPS commitments in the third quarter. Our results highlight the progress we have made in building a vibrant molecular diagnostic and international businesses over the last couple of years. And at the same time, we re-energized our R&D efforts in Breast Health and are strengthening our commercial capabilities in Medical Aesthetics. We remain bullish that these efforts will pay off as we move into 2018.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Our first question today comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So for starters I could use a little help reconciling the performance in Cynosure. So you performed in line with your guidance in the third quarter, yet you're lowering expectations for that business in the fourth quarter. What are the dynamics in play there? And any more color you could offer would be helpful.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah Dan, in simple terms, it probably is a little head-scratcher. At the end of the day, international came in a lot stronger than we expected, and the U.S. was frankly disappointing. And it says we've got more work to do. And I'll give it to you this way: Obviously when we did the acquisition, we knew there'd been a lot of sales force disruption in the quarter right before we bought it. That leadership team at Cynosure had a long track record, and they said at the start of the quarter they thought things were settling down, and they gave us a number that they thought they would deliver for the quarter.","At the end of the day, we came up short in the quarter. I wanted to give them one quarter to let them prove that they were back on track, and at the end of the day, they fell short. So we're making changes. We've just installed a new President, and I think \u2013 so what we will see here in the third quarter is, because international has gotten stronger and there's a normal seasonal slowdown, I think what you're going to see is that seasonal slowdown in July and August internationally is particularly soft in Medical Aesthetics. So I think we see it being a step back before we really start to step forward again, as we go.","And I will tell you, I feel really, really good about the commercial leader we've put in to run that business now. But also want to give him a little air cover while he gets his feet on the ground, because there's always a little disruption in that change. So it's really a \u2013 call it a one quarter step back. I think we showed we at least know what we're doing by delivering on the \u2013 frankly at the low end of what we had hoped for in the quarter, but feeling great about international, great about the pipeline, and we do have some work to do in the U.S.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And, Steve, for my follow-up, were there any timing aspects or any abnormal discounting or anything to be aware of to get you to the $110 million in that third quarter, or was the activity more run rate, if you will?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","No, it was run rate. There was no end-of-quarter discounting. If anything I would tell you, frankly, the end of the quarter was probably a little disappointing, which \u2013 in its own way. We might have thought we would have done even a little bit better than where we came in there. So that's what precipitated the change. But I think \u2013 suffice it to say orders \u2013 it's not like we've carried in a bunch of orders either or anything into this quarter. In an ideal world, they would've been running hot, and we might have even been able to carry some or whatever into this quarter. We aren't able to do that.","So it is a complete U.S. sales execution issue. We don't break out the U.S.\/international piece. I would tell you, we are much more excited about the performance internationally than we imagined, and it really is a very isolated issue that we know how to fix.","As a reminder, by the way, Kevin Thornal, who we've just put in as Division President \u2013 he's the guy we sent over to Europe 18 months ago, when, many of you remember, our European and especially our global Breast Health business was a disaster. And that business within 18 months of him arriving is now growing at double-digit rates. He's completely put that business back together again. Kevin and I have a long history together at Stryker. He came over to Hologic about three years ago, first into the U.S. Breast Health business, has gone over there. And I would tell you, I'm incredibly excited about what he's going to bring to the business. But he's not going to work magic this quarter.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. I think just to build on that, Steve. I think if you look at it, obviously we felt very good about the performance that we had in international, but also if you look at the non-laser, the PAC key utilization, that also improved across the globe. Most of that here is in the U.S., so it is really about getting that sales organization up and trained and clean it up. And then moving into 2018, we have new products that will help drive that additional growth as well. We talked about submental and then the RF platform as well, so feel good about the future.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, Dan. I'd add one last piece. A year ago everybody thought international was a mess. Now it's a double-digit grower. We look at this and say, you know what? Been there, done that. We'll absolutely be back to great growth rates in this business.","Operator","Moving right along, our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Jack.","Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, thanks. This is actually Mitchell Petersen on for Jack this afternoon. Appreciate all the updates on Cynosure, especially on the new leadership and long-term view there. As of now, is there any reason why in fiscal 2018 this business won't be able to grow in the double digits? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","We're not going to give exact guidance for 2018 yet on this call. Cynosure will grow in 2018. There is no doubt.","Mitchell Petersen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, could you just comment on how long do you think it's going to take the Cynosure sales force to get fully ramped up, and are there any productivity improvement metrics you can share with us? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. You know what? We typically are going to assume a six- to nine-month ramp for new reps and new businesses, and I think that would be an appropriate piece here. So I think \u2013 my hunch is this coming quarter is probably the bottom and we start to rebuild even by the end of this quarter. So as we go into calendar year 2018, ought to be looking pretty good. We obviously track internal performance metrics, nothing we're going to share externally.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Steve, I'll hop over and hit on Breast Health. You threw out a couple things here. You've got the two new systems, new label indications, and then you flagged the increased competitive dynamics. Maybe can you touch on the latter point a little bit? Is it more pricing pressure in the market with GE, and what kind of growth trajectory do you think Breast Health can get back to with the label indications and ultimately the two new systems?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. I think less \u2013 there's always been the price competition. We're still maintaining pricing and not going down that rabbit hole. I think GE has gotten a little more aggressive with their new system just in terms of marketing and activity, but we still feel very good about the ongoing trajectory. I think this is probably a low single digit grower for us as we go into 2018. And we'll certainly aspire to more. But I think just given where we are in the market life cycle as we go into that kind of second 50% of our installed base and further down to the market, that it's just smaller customers, smaller orders.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","I think on that, Tycho \u2013 this is Bob. As part of that, with the launch of the 3D Performance product, that allows us I think to compete more effectively in the smaller volume hospitals and so forth. And we're not going to play the price game, but that provides us with \u2013 our customers with good value and allows us to have a portfolio of products that suit the various needs of our customers more effectively.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then for the follow-up, I want to make sure I understand the dynamics on Cynosure, because it has gone from a double-digit grower to a flat and declining business. And I know there's a sales force churn dynamic, and it seems like you've got a handle on that. But how much of it is also just a timing issue in terms of \u2013 you're repositioning PicoSure for a broader audience, you're leveraging MonaLisa into the OB\/GYN channel. Obviously you've got the new product cycles you talked about. So how much of it do you think is sales force related and trying to get them optimized versus just maybe the timing on some of these other initiatives?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","It's probably a bit of both, Tycho. I think they certainly had the tremendous run with the initial launch of SculpSure. So we are going against comps when they were growing at the 20%-plus level. We still think this is a high-growth market over time. But going against those particularly high comps when it was all the capital going in, you're probably dealing with a little bit of that. But overall we continue to feel great about the market dynamics and know that we can have a better commercial execution as we go forward. Frankly, on both sales, but also marketing. I mentioned in the script direct-to-consumer marketing, we're actually just beginning some direct-to-patient marketing programs that they've lacked as a company to date.","Operator","Moving right along, we'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe I'll start one on the guidance front. Bob, I think you mentioned the guidance reduction was mostly related to Cynosure. I just want to understand, getting off (37:45) the numbers, so the revenues were lowered, I think, by $10 million to $25 million, right, versus the prior guidance for the overall company of revenues. Now I know that the last guidance was \u2013 you had blood at $115 million to $125 million, and you had Cyno at $235 million to $245 million. Can you just maybe walk us through what changed? Was it all Cyno, or was this a little bit in blood or the base business?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. So the vast majority of the change, Vijay, is due to Cynosure. There's always some moving parts, but the vast majority of it is due to Cynosure. And so I think that that is the area of focus. It wasn't blood. We actually had more blood in the third quarter. We expect a sequential decline but in line with our expectations there. And our base business is roughly in line as well. So obviously, we've got a lot of focus on that part of the business in Cynosure, bringing in new leadership and so forth. But if you look at it, sequential change from where we are in Q3 to Q4, another way to kind of look at it, all of that change is related to Cynosure.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Got you. Basically it implies that the organic for the base business was unchanged. Steve, maybe one on Cynosure. I know you're getting a bunch of questions on this. I just want to understand, on the sales force raise, are you still hiring sales force for the Cynosure? Do we need to hire more people? Is that what the delta is? Or are we done with the hiring and this is just now a question of getting the sales force ramped up?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Oh, no. There'll be more hiring. There'll be more hiring. We still have some opportunities. And just managing them \u2013 the other piece I'd give you is, we've all seen companies kind of go from that 0 to 400, 500 range, and then you kind of start to \u2013 can stumble a little bit as you go to that next level, and sometimes you need some new leadership to take it to that level. And I think it's exactly what we need on the commercial side. So there will be still a few more changes as we go forth and bringing in more people.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks much, guys. I have to ask another question on Cynosure. Given what we've seen here with the turnover in the sales force and your earlier comments here and that last question, I'd be interested in sort of if you'd illustrate a couple of the first items of business for Kevin as he takes over. I know you mentioned it's going to take more than one quarter. But I'd love to know a little bit about his program, first couple of specific steps when he takes the job.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, it's really for Kevin to get into. Kevin is one of the greatest sales and commercial leaders you'll find, just as he went over to Europe, and it starts by getting to know the key people and the key opportunities and then repositioning and making sure we get the right people against the right opportunities. It's going to be blocking and tackling and nothing \u2013 no whiz-bang stuff, but a lot of basics. Frankly we're seeing that sales training is a huge opportunity. There's a lot of just basic things where they'd hired a bunch of people that don't even necessarily \u2013 haven't been trained on the full line of products. It's a lot of stuff that's not pretty, but it collectively creates great performance. And that's the kind of stuff I'm sure Kevin's going to get into.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And a follow-up on Diagnostics. You guys have done a great job, I think, not only with new products but also market share. So I'd be interested in knowing just how much more headroom do you see in terms of share gains, or is it really going to be more about the pipeline? I think you alluded that it's pipeline, but just want to clarify.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","In the U.S., there's probably not a lot of share to keep gaining. We do think there's still some market expansion opportunities. One of the things we haven't talked as much about probably, Isaac, is trying to get more testing done to guideline, where frankly there are more tests that can be prescribed in various situations, and we're trying to get more of that done. The huge certainly market share gains are outside the U.S. When you look at our molecular business, it's still over 80% in the U.S., and I think what we're really excited about is we're really starting to get some traction internationally. Four out of the last five quarters at growth over 20%, admittedly off small bases, but the numbers \u2013 you keep doing that, the numbers start to get much more meaningful. So I think the market share will probably be more outside the U.S.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Isaac, one of the things \u2013 just to kind of build on that, one of the things that we're really pleased with is not only that we continue to place very healthy levels of Panther systems. Actually had a very good quarter both domestically and internationally this quarter again. The revenue per Panther continues to increase, both in the U.S., as well as domestically quite nicely. So it speaks to the power of the Panther system, not only with the existing products but also as we add additional pipeline. And I think the team, as Steve mentioned in the script, has done a great job of cross-selling. But there still is some opportunity there on the sexually transmitted disease menu. And then that that bodes well for the viral loads here in the U.S., which we've got the two HIV and HCV, HPV coming in 2018, and so we feel very good about that business.","Operator","We'll take our next question today from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Alex Nowak on for Bill today. Just any initial feedback on Panther Fusion in the international markets, and will the system be FDA approved in time for this year's flu season?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Very positive feedback from Europe, and not likely for this year. We figure that's a 2018-ish approval in the clearance in the U.S.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And then at what point do you start training your existing OB\/GYN sales force with the Cynosure products? Are you going to wait until Cynosure stabilizes here before introducing these products to your existing teams?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, we're going to basically use referrals, but frankly we want our existing GYN Surgical sales force to be selling a little more NovaSure, frankly, right now. And there continues to be a tremendous opportunity on MyoSure. We're not sure we've figured out yet how big the full market potential for MyoSure is, so they've got a lot of good things they can still be doing while they make references, but we don't want to distract them and get them trying to sell the full Cynosure bag.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. And, Alex, on the incentive program that was just launched this last quarter, it's still early days, but I think very promising in terms of the number of leads that have been qualified through our OB\/GYN sales organization into the Cynosure group. And so I think we'll see that continue to be a positive harbinger for future, primarily on the Cynosure side, but that's \u2013 in the near term, that's the leverage that we're looking at, and early results promising.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Steve, I was just -","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Rich.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. How you doing, Steve? I was wondering if you could, on the new RF product that you just filed with the FDA, two questions on that. One, is there a particular order that the surgical indication, aesthetic indication, and I can't remember what the third \u2013 women's health indication are going to come out in, or is this going to get approval for all of them at once?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Well, it will not be all at once. What we're doing is, we're building a great box that will have opportunities to add products to it over time. The initial indications will be aesthetic.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And can you give us a sense as to like how long in between applications, do you think it'll take to get this \u2013 so that's multiplatform functional? And then the second part would just be is this going to be a worldwide launch, or are you kind of going to wait for the U.S. launch first and then extend it OUS?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","It'll likely be a U.S. launch. Just the way they've typically filed stuff has been \u2013 and we're in the process of changing that \u2013 but largely U.S. first and then internationally. I think in the future they could be more global launches. So we'll be excited about the opportunity.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, and I think \u2013 Rich, this is Bob. I think as you look at the indications, think about it over a course of a year.","Operator","Moving right along. We'll take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, a couple questions. First, Steve, last quarter you talked about Cynosure's core competency being identifying customer needs and finding products to meet them either organically or through external business. And you've talked about some of the organic stuff here. But should we expect you guys to do anything in terms of external or inorganic additions to that business to help maybe drive incremental revenue there?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I think \u2013 by the way, congratulations on Bartman getting his Cubs ring to you, Brian. So -","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","I need to get one now. Yeah.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","So, yeah, that's right, exactly. I think as it does relate to adding products, we always figured Cynosure will be an opportunity for us to have some inorganic tuck-ins along the way. I would tell you in the nearer term, we see such an opportunity between the product pipeline and also our own need to focus on just getting the U.S. selling organization right up to where we want it to be. Again, not dissimilar to what we encountered here a few years ago when this management team came into this company. So I think that'll be our focus nearer term, and then tuck-in kind of stuff maybe down the road. But I think it'll certainly be a place for tuck-ins. It's a great market, and we continue to love being in the medical aesthetics market, think it's going to be one of the highest growth markets to be in. And out of that will certainly spawn additional opportunities for products or small company things.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, as it relates to Breast Health, as you move to some of the smaller opportunities, you did talk about incremental time to close, tougher competition, but is there any reason to suspect that in the smaller hospitals or smaller imaging clinics that your share should be any different in terms of the net gains that you saw when you were going after the larger accounts?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","No, there's no good reason to expect that our share should be any different. We've got superior products. Some of those have one-source contracts and some of those kinds of things, but frankly so did a lot of the big institutions where there was even more money on the line. And it comes down to, again, blocking and tackling and great salespeople selling a superior product. It just really is \u2013 as we've been saying for a long, long time, we predicted there was not going to be a cliff when everybody thought there was going to be a cliff. But we said it was going to slow down and be much more flat for a much longer period of time, and that's really how the market's playing out as you go into this segment of the customers. But we are not relaxing our share expectations one bit.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","And I think, Brian, to add to that, as of the end of this last quarter, we still estimate that roughly half of our own installed base is available to be upgraded to 3D, and now with the new products that we will be launching over the next couple quarters, it continues to give us a lot of confidence that they will in fact upgrade. And we think that we will be a net share gainer continued going forward regardless of the type of hospital.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Just a couple on U.S. Breast Health and Cynosure, and maybe just to clarify and pick up on that last question. So is the retention of your own sockets in the quarter, did that change? So you're still \u2013 when your own sockets come up for renewal, is the win rate for Hologic still the same, or did that shift in the quarter? And then on Cynosure, just to clarify, is there a new range from $235 million to $245 million? And then the follow-up there would just be legacy Cynosure sort of categories \u2013 let's say skin, hair, and tattoo removal, for instance \u2013 versus body contouring. Is there some color you can provide on how legacy Cynosure is doing versus some of the new areas they entered into? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","On the share piece, I think we continue to feel very good that as our sockets, as our gantries come up for renewal, we are doing a very good job on those. We don't win all of them, but we win consistently most, and I would say very close to all of them. And we continue to win competitive users, so that's why I think we continue to be a net share gainer.","On Cynosure, I think as we mentioned, we felt very good about the performance in the skin business in the last quarter and feel good about that. And we think there's still opportunities as we get ramped up to help on the women's health side. And the body piece, we saw very good improvement in the consumables, but down on the capital sales.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Although \u2013 down on the capital sales versus prior year -","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Versus prior year.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","But up sequentially versus the prior quarter.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, (52:14).","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","So we're on the right trajectory, but still work to do there.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question today comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Just have a couple questions from me.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, David.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Steve, how are you? So one for Steve, and the more important one. Bob, I do want to clarify some things on guidance that I'm kind of unclear on. For the fourth quarter, I'm sort of assuming you have kind of $30 million organic guidance reset; that kind of feels like that's about $20 million of Breast. So Breast would be sort of flattish into the fourth quarter, and $10 million of Cynosure, so Cynosure sort of flattish into the fourth quarter. Is those kind of in the right ballpark? And that gets to the kind of 1.5% \u2013 1% to 2% organic growth for the fourth quarter. I'm just trying to level-set those expectations.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, those numbers are off. The Cynosure number is not flat sequentially. We mentioned that it would be down materially versus last year, which was at the $106 million. So \u2013 and to be clear, we're not expecting Breast to be down that much. So our expectation is that our core business growth is not in that low single digits, the 1% to 2% that you quoted. It's higher than that.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, the other way to think about it, David, just from the way we articulated in the script, effectively the guide-down \u2013 the midpoint of the guide-down is effectively all Cynosure, from what they just delivered this quarter to what we expect them to deliver this next quarter.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","But I guess \u2013 I'm sorry I'm being dense here, but you gave a number for Cynosure guidance. Maybe just give us that number again. The $235 million to $245 million, what is the new Cynosure guidance number?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","We haven't given a new number, but it's lower than that, right? So what we're saying is last year it was $106 million in the fourth quarter, and it's materially lower than that for this year's fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Chris Lin on for Doug today. I just want to follow up with a Cynosure question. What was the domestic Cynosure, or really the domestic SculpSure consumable revenue growth in Q3? Was this as expected for the established installed base and in line with recent trends? I just wanted to get a sense of the existing domestic customer utilization and ensure nothing has changed with the fundamental market growth rate.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. This is Bob. What I would say is, first of all, that number is off a small base, but the growth rate year over year is very, very high in what I'll call the renewal rate for the PAC utilization in the U.S. So it grew significantly. We don't feel that there's any issue with the market. And ultimately we still believe that we're in the early innings of this market. And there is still lots of room to grow not only in utilization but continued placement of SculpSure products in our current customer base.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Is it right to think that domestic 3D unit sales can at least remain steady for the foreseeable future? And to be clear, was 3D sales in line with your internal expectations for Q3? Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. They can totally, I mean, be stable, and they were roughly in line.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. They were up sequentially quarter on quarter.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","And I think we see them roughly flattish for Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anne Edelstein with Bank of America.","Anne Edelstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. So the first one is on the international Breast Health business. Now that that's contributing meaningfully, can you just give us a better sense of what your OUS digital install base is and where your market share stands currently? And sort of what is driving the reacceleration in that business? Is it primarily 2D or 3D?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Anne, we continue to sell both 2D and 3D outside the U.S., and we would expect to continue to do that. Over the last several quarters, it's roughly been about 50-50 in terms of the number of placements of 2D and 3D. The number of units in the U.S. is much higher than it is outside the U.S. It's roughly 2,000 units outside the U.S., 3D units. Our share outside the U.S., it's really market dependent, but we still have plenty of opportunity. It's roughly half of what it is in the U.S. on the digital side.","So I think what it speaks to is the new leadership in place working for the dealers in Europe and then around the world just having an increasing focus on better performance, not only with our dealers but bringing in the right leaders and working in partnership with them on tenders, bringing in some additional capabilities like market access and so forth, that are really helping drive screening protocols across the various countries. That's going to take some time, but those are the types of initiatives that we've been investing in over the last 18 months, and it's starting to bear fruit.","Anne Edelstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just a quick one. I don't know how much you can say about this, but do you expect any impact from the injunction that you filed against Fuji in the U.S.?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, obviously with ongoing litigation, we can't comment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity.","Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for the question. Steve, you mentioned that there will still be some hiring in the sales force. Obviously the prior quarter there was some attrition in the sales force for reasons that you've outlined. But can you just speak to perhaps the number of sales reps that you may have lost in the prior quarter and how many folks you think you need to hire?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. When I said there's going to be continued hiring, by the way, there's going to be continued hiring in every business that we ever have. It's part of being a growth company. So it's in my DNA that we will be always hiring and expanding our sales organizations. I think a little bit bigger opportunity here in the Cynosure piece as we replace people that had left, but feeling very good about the leadership we're putting in place.","Mark A. Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. And I guess, just for clarification, was there sales rep attrition that may have impacted the prior quarter?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Oh, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the changing growth profile in the Surgical business, and I realize that you lapped the ThermaChoice boost from last year, but growth in MyoSure, albeit quite strong, wasn't as strong as in past quarters. So can you talk about some of the dynamics in the market? Has competition picked up, or is this just a function of law of large numbers finally catching up to this business?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","You got a piece of both. You know what, I think on MyoSure it is the law of large numbers, as that business has generated \u2013 frankly, it had a lot more 30% and high 20% growth quarters than we ever imagined. Still a 20% number, very healthy and excited. I think on the NovaSure piece, we obviously are going against very tough comps as we had the competitive withdrawal. Having said that, you know what? We'd like to be doing better and think we haven't necessarily maintained as much share as we should have.","Operator","Our final question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley, and it's a follow-up.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Steve, just last one. I would just say, I think shareholders really want the Cynosure guidance number, and they're a little confused they don't have it. But we can take that offline.","But, Steve, I want to come back to where you started the call this afternoon. I think investors, what they want at Hologic was this notion that the new tomosynthesis was going to decelerate, they knew you were going to fix the core, and we still get back to sort of that mid-single digit growth profile, even in a world where tomosynthesis is slowing. If you think about the third quarter here, and 2% to 3% growth, it sounds like the fourth quarter is maybe sort of the same 2% to 3% growth, hard for us to get there without the Cyno number. But how do you think about 2018 and the future? Do you still believe that even with tomosynthesis decelerating that this is still a mid-single digit growth business, or is there some transitional period here where it's not mid-single digit growth, it's more like low single digit growth? Thanks so much.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Great question, David. I think as we look to 2018, we feel really good. We're not giving guidance, obviously, but feel really good about mid-single digit. I would absolutely say that. We're going to reaccelerate from, frankly, what is this low third and fourth quarter growth rates. We just reported 3.1% organic growth. Fourth quarter is, if you really play out how that will shake out, I think fourth quarter's probably going to be a little bit better than that, is if you really parse out our guidance and this and that. But we don't like being down in that level, and as we go into 2018 between the pipelines, getting the Cynosure stuff behind us, getting some of the pipeline stuff out of Breast Health, international kicking in, molecular being good, feel very good that we will be a reaccelerating story in 2018.","Operator","And with no further questions in the queue, that does conclude today's conference.

All lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Mike Watts","Thank you, Isaac. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks, then we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session.","Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our newly redesigned website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived for 30 days.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known as well as unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO.","Steve MacMillan","Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re pleased to discuss Hologic\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We posted solid results overall, and are off to a good start for the year. As we pre-announced at the J.P. Morgan conference, revenue of $791.1 million finished just above our guidance range. And earnings per share of $0.55 also exceeded our expectations based on the benefit from U.S. tax reform.","We enjoy unique leadership positions in a range of women\u2019s health markets, and our two largest divisions, Breast Health and Diagnostics, are performing well based on these differentiated products. And we believe Cynosure, our medical aesthetics business, is turning the corner toward a future of consistent growth. Our solid performance in the first quarter demonstrates the two important elements of our strategic plan are paying off.","First, our international business, which we described as a start-up and was an area of great concern for investors as recently as 2016, is now thriving. Specifically, core international revenue, excluding the acquired Cynosure and divested blood screening franchises, again delivered double-digit growth in the first quarter.","Second, a research and development pipeline that was barren four years ago has now generated new products that are contributing more than 10% of quarterly sales. And as we look to the future, we are particularly encouraged because our international businesses and our R&D pipelines both have the potential to contribute to sustainable growth for a very long time.","With that introduction, let\u2019s review our divisional revenue results for the first quarter. As a reminder, growth rates compared to the prior year period were artificially depressed by the fact that we had four extra selling days in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We estimate that these extra days added more than $20 million to sales in the prior year period, with the greatest benefit to our recurring revenue lines in the United States.","In the first quarter, revenue of $791.1 million grew 7.7% on a reported basis or 6.7% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the Cynosure acquisition and the blood screening divestiture, first-quarter revenue increased 2.7% or 1.5% in constant currency. But accounting for the extra days in the prior year period, revenue growth would have been about 6.2% on a reported basis or 4.9% in constant currency, slightly better than the 4.4% organic growth we posted in the fourth quarter.","In terms of geography, international was the standout in the first quarter, as we alluded to earlier. International revenue of $193.9 million increased 15.8%, helped by the contribution of Cynosure. Even excluding Cynosure and blood, international sales increased a robust 11.6%, as a result of very focused and deliberate efforts that began with new leadership less than two years ago.","In the United States, revenue of $597.2 million increased 4.1%, again primarily due to the acquisition of Cynosure. Excluding Cynosure and blood, U.S. revenue declined by 0.8%, but remember the impact of extra days in the prior year period was concentrated in the United States.","In terms of divisional performance in the first quarter, our two largest businesses, Breast Health and Diagnostics, which represent nearly three-quarters of sales, are performing well. Let\u2019s start with Breast Health, where results have clearly improved over the last couple of quarters. We remain the undisputed leader in this market, based first and foremost on the established clinical superiority of our products.","No other mammogram has been proven to detect 20% to 65% more invasive breast cancers compared to 2D alone, and no other mammogram has also been proven superior for women with dense breasts. In addition, no other manufacturer has partnered with customers as extensively or as effectively as we have.","We help breast centers prosper by referring patients through our direct-to-consumer initiatives, and by fighting for insurance coverage. As a result, we continue to add to our overall market share. Based on all these factors, global Breast Health sales totaled $288 million in the first quarter, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year period, and another sequential acceleration compared to the 2.4% growth we saw in the fourth quarter. The U.S. business declined 1% versus the tough comp in the prior year period, which benefited from extra selling days.","International sales, however, grew a robust 29.2%, marking our second consecutive quarter with growth over 20%. This performance reflects the tremendous progress we have made in building a sustainable growth engine through both organic and inorganic means, including the recent purchase of our Spanish distributor.","In addition, we are seeing good adoption of our new mammography systems, which are called 3Dimensions and 3D Performance. These new products further strengthen our market-leading Genius brand, better segment the market, and encourage customers to upgrade the thousands of 2D systems that remain in the field today. At the same time, we are building a broader portfolio of Breast Health products and services around the core of our Genius systems so that we can play a more significant role in the Breast Health continuum of care.","The success of these strategies was apparent in our first quarter results. Our new mammography systems represented almost a third of the systems we sold. And sales of interventional breast products mainly biopsy systems and disposables increased by 16.1% on a global basis. This strong performance resulted from an increased focus on portfolio selling, and an excellent start from our revolutionary new Brevera real-time biopsy system, which we just launched. In addition, sales of our Affirm prone biopsy system, which we introduced a little more than a year ago, continue to build nicely.","Now let\u2019s turn to Diagnostics, which remains on a solid growth path. Excluding the divested blood screening franchise, we posted sales of $272.0 million in the first quarter, an increase of 3.3% despite the headwind from additional selling days in the prior year period. Including residual blood screening sales of $12.6 million, which was in line with our expectations, Diagnostics revenue was $284.6 million.","Fueling this growth again was molecular diagnostics, where sales of $148.6 million increased 5.3%. The U.S. business remained healthy, growing at a mid-single-digit rate despite the days headwind, while international sales increased high-single-digits versus a difficult prior-year comp.","As in recent quarters, global growth was driven by the Panther system, our fully automated molecular diagnostics instrument, and increasing utilization of our Aptima women\u2019s health assays, which have long been leaders in testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV, and trichomonas. We continue to work with our customers to expand the market for sexually transmitted disease testing, providing better healthcare through earlier detection.","At the same time, sales of our new molecular diagnostics tests are steadily increasing, although their overall impact remains small. We\u2019re exceptionally proud that over the last six quarters, our Diagnostics business has earned regulatory clearance for seven new products in the United States. These include the first three respiratory assays on our new Fusion platform, and three viral load tests for HIV, hepatitis C, and most recently, hepatitis B. This steady cadence of domestic assay innovation positions us well to consolidate molecular testing on the Panther system.","And at the same time, our ability to commercialize new products in various global markets continues to strengthen as well, fueling our geographic expansion. Before we leave Diagnostics, we want to mention that sales of cytology and perinatal products were $123.4 million in the first quarter. This represented a slight increase of 0.9%, as higher sales of perinatal products offset the headwind from more selling days in the prior year period.","In cytology, where our ThinPrep liquid Pap test is the clear leader, market dynamics are unchanged despite noise surrounding the draft USPSTF guidelines for cervical cancer screening. While the domestic cytology market is not a growth driver for us, we continue to believe that co-testing will remain the standard of care for women and physicians who want to continue the tremendous progress that we have made against cervical cancer over the last several decades.","Now let\u2019s turn to Surgical, which had a disappointing quarter with sales of $107.5 million, down 7.1%. Surgical is primarily a consumables business, so the four extra selling days in the prior year period had a significant negative effect on the year-over-year comparison. In addition, the first quarter a year ago was the single biggest quarter Surgical has ever posted, as we benefited materially from the recall of a competitive product.","Nonetheless, we do have some work to do to return Surgical back to a growth trajectory. MyoSure continues to grow nicely, but NovaSure has struggled in the face of increasing competition and a stagnant market for endometrial ablation. We are pursuing a number of strategies to boost growth in Surgical. We put in place new leadership about six months ago, and now that team is upgrading sales talent, structure and incentives.","We are fighting back against competition more directly with new products like NovaSure Advanced and MyoSure MANUAL. And we are expanding our efforts to grow the ablation market through increased patient awareness, just as we have expanded other key categories where we are the market leader.","Now let me discuss our new medical aesthetics division. Cynosure sales were $91.3 million in the quarter. While this was down significantly versus the prior year period, when Cynosure was an independent company, it was up 12.2% sequentially versus the $81.4 million we posted in the fourth quarter, as we predicted. So we view this quarter\u2019s Cynosure result as a step in the right direction, while recognizing that we still have a lot of work to do to fully capitalize on the potential of the medical aesthetics market, which remains robust.","In addition to the in-line quarterly sales number, we are encouraged that our new leadership team has made good progress in filling open sales positions and upgrading our commercial talent. We expect to be largely done with that process this quarter. While it will take time for newly hired reps to complete our re-vamped training program and become fully productive, we are confident that we are moving forward with a highly motivated, talented commercial team that is committed to winning the right way, in long-term partnership with our customers.","We also continue to be impressed with the productivity and innovation emerging from Cynosure\u2019s R&D pipeline. As an example of this, we are now launching TempSure Envi, our new radio-frequency platform that minimizes facial fine lines and wrinkles, tightens skin through soft tissue coagulation, and improves the appearance of cellulite. Early feedback from customers has been positive, and over time, we look forward to expanding the TempSure platform into the women\u2019s health and surgical fields.","With new products like TempSure, and many more to come, we are expanding what is already the broadest portfolio of energy-based treatments in the medical aesthetics industry. And as we continue to enhance our commercial capabilities in parallel, we are confident that we will demonstrate the scale, stability and strength needed to be the partner of choice for our customers.","To wrap up the divisional revenue discussion, Skeletal revenue totaled $19.7 million in the first quarter, a decrease of 7.3%, mainly due to lower Fluoroscan sales. We do, however, expect quarterly sales to improve over the course of the year, driven by better portfolio selling, increasing interest in our Horizon bone densitometry system for body composition testing, and our new mini C-arm product.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that our two largest divisions, Breast Health and Diagnostics, are performing well, while Cynosure is on the rebound. Our international business is thriving, and our R&D organization is continuing to churn out new products. These dynamics have us off to a good start in fiscal 2018, and more importantly, they give us great confidence for the future.","Now I will hand the call over to Bob.","Bob McMahon","Thank you Steve, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial topics including U.S. tax reform, then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2018. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percent changes will be on a year-over-year basis.","As Steve described, we are pleased with our first quarter results, as revenue slightly exceeded our guidance. In addition, a lower effective tax rate due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform helped us outperform significantly on the EPS line, and will boost our already healthy net margin going forward.","We also continued to strengthen our balance sheet, in line with our long-term goals. We essentially retired all our 2013 convertible notes, leaving only one remaining tranche that we plan to call in March, and we are refinancing $1 billion of debt on very attractive terms.","With that, let\u2019s jump right into the P&L. In the first quarter, gross margins of 63.8% declined 140 basis points compared to the prior year, due primarily to sales mix associated with the divestiture of the blood screening business and sales of lower margin Cynosure products.","Total operating expenses of $271.8 million, increased 17.6% in the first quarter, mainly due to the inclusion of Cynosure costs. Normalizing for the impact of Cynosure, operating expenses in our base business declined at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting very deliberate efforts to control costs and drive operating leverage.","Our operating margin of 29.4% declined 430 basis points due to product and geographic mix, as well as the divestiture of our blood screening business. However, on a sequential basis, our first quarter operating margin improved after normalizing for the benefit of non-recurring royalty payments in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $36.4 million in the quarter, an increase of 3.4% compared to the prior year period, reflecting the changes we have made to our debt structure in recent quarters.","Now let\u2019s spend a moment on tax. In late December, new U.S. tax legislation was enacted into law. Due to our fiscal year end, two provisions of the law immediately affected us. First, the U.S. federal corporate rate was lowered from 35% to 21%, and we are able to apply a blended rate to our U.S. income for fiscal 2018.","As a result, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23% in fiscal 2018, which is significantly lower than the approximately 31% that we previously anticipated. In addition, we performed preliminary calculations and recorded a discrete net tax benefit of $355.2 million on a GAAP basis in the first quarter. This benefit resulted primarily from the re-measurement of U.S. net deferred tax liabilities at a lower corporate tax rate.","The second component of tax reform that immediately affected us was the set of changes to the treatment of our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings, and the related tax imposed on the deemed repatriation of historic foreign earnings. We estimate our transition tax to be approximately $26 million.","Please note that because of the significant changes to the law, the overall impact of U.S. tax reform is subject to further analysis as the legislation is interpreted and clarified. Finally, net margins of 19.4%, decreased 80 basis points, as the negative mix factors discussed previously were partially offset by improvements in our non-GAAP effective tax rate.","All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55, an increase of 5.8% compared to the prior year, and exceeding our guidance range due to the benefits of tax reform. If you were to exclude the impact of our divested blood screening business, non-GAAP EPS would have increased in the high-20% range.","Before we move on to guidance, I\u2019ll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics. In recent months, we have continued to make good progress on our long-term goal to strengthen our balance sheet. In the first quarter, we further reduced our convertible debt by eliminating $241 million in principal, and in January we also announced that we would call the slightly more than $200 million that\u2019s remaining.","So by the time we have our next quarterly call, we will have eliminated more than $1.3 billion in convertible debt from our balance sheet over the past few years. Pretty impressive accomplishment, and a testament to our underlying financial strength.","At the same time, we have made other positive changes to our debt structure to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Specifically in mid-January, we announced a private offering of $1 billion in senior notes. $600 million of these notes bear interest at 4.38% and mature in 2025, while $400 million of the notes bear interest at 4.58% and mature in 2028.","These proceeds will be used in mid-February to refinance our $1 billion, 5.25% senior notes due in 2022. So based on our strong financial position, we are able to both reduce interest expense and extend our debt maturities.","At the end of first quarter, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, stood at 2.6 times, within a comfortable range for us. The net debt calculation includes cash and equivalents of $664.4 million. This is higher than in recent quarters as we prepare to retire our remaining convertible notes.","Finally, adjusted EBITDA of $258 million in the first quarter declined 4.1% compared to the prior year, as improvements in our base business were offset by the divestiture of blood screening.","Now I\u2019d like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our guidance based on our solid first quarter results and the beneficial impact of U.S. tax reform. At a high level, we are reiterating our full year revenue guidance and increasing our EPS forecast.","Let\u2019s start with revenue. Based on our solid first quarter results, we are maintaining our original revenue guidance of $3.20 billion to $3.28 billion, with reported growth rates between 4.6% and 7.2%. Based on recent exchange rates, this translates to constant currency growth of 3.9% to 6.5%, and organic growth in the mid single-digit range.","As a reminder, we are defining organic revenue as total revenue less blood screening and Medical Aesthetics for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018. And as discussed last quarter, organic revenue growth also adjusts for fewer selling days in 2018, and the non-recurring royalty revenue.","Now let\u2019s turn to the impact of U.S. tax reform for fiscal 2018. We are updating our full year non-GAAP tax rate guidance to approximately 23%, down significantly from an initial forecast of approximately 31%. As we discussed early in January, we do plan to reinvest a portion of the benefits from tax reform to future growth initiatives. These initiatives are likely to include discrete marketing campaigns in areas like Medical Aesthetics and Surgical, as well as investments to speed up or initiate R&D projects.","Even with that reinvestment, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance substantially, to a range of $2.22 to $2.27, up from a prior estimate of $2.10 to $2.15. Our updated EPS guidance adds $0.12, or roughly half the savings from our updated effective tax rate, to our previous earnings estimate for the year, and results in reported EPS growth of between 9.4% and 11.8%. This updated full year guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of roughly 283 million for the full year.","Tax reform also should be beneficial to our cash flows overall. For this fiscal year, we now expect free cash flow in the mid $600 million range, not including the one-time tax recapture associated with retiring our convertible notes.","Now let\u2019s turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue of between $770 million and $785 million, which reflects growth of 6.5% to 8.6% on a constant currency basis, and reported revenue growth of 7.6% to 9.7%.","We expect quarterly revenue to be down slightly versus the $791 million we posted in the first quarter for a few reasons. First, we expect revenue from our divested blood screening business to decline sequentially, probably to around half the first quarter level.","Second, as a reminder, the March quarter is seasonally weaker than the December period for both our Surgical and Medical Aesthetics businesses. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.53 to $0.54 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This forecast implies reported EPS growth rates of between 6.0% and 8.0%.","As you update your estimates, we would again encourage you to model around the middle of our guidance ranges, as we have incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecast. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019d like to conclude by saying that we are pleased with our start to fiscal 2018.","We began our fiscal year with quarterly revenues that slightly exceeded our guidance. In addition, recent U.S. tax reform has provided us with an opportunity to both bolster our earnings and opportunistically reinvest in the business to drive growth.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our first question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. A question for you on market share in both Breast Health as well as Diagnostics. I\u2019m curious, you have a major competitor on the Breast Health side that\u2019s going through some changes. Curious if you thought you gained any share in that business this quarter, and you had said you think you might perpetuate that for the rest of the fiscal year, I\u2019m curious. And then as an addendum to that, I\u2019m curious in Diagnostics if there\u2019s anything meaningful on the share side for cytology in FE. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Thanks, Isaac. I think in Breast Health, yes, I think we just continue to feel that we\u2019re doing very well on an overall share basis. I think we \u2013 one of our key competitors, I think it looked like they might have had a half decent quarter earlier in the year and gained a little momentum. I think we\u2019ve pushed that back and just continued to gain a hugely disproportionate share in 3D relative to our overall market share. So I think we just continued to feel great.","Nothing obvious from any of the disruption over there. I think on the cytology front, again as well, we just continued to strengthen our shares. We\u2019re so strong there. I don\u2019t think much additional movement up, but feeling really good about where we are in both of those areas. And as you know, obviously, in Breast Health, we like that strong position and feel like it\u2019s going to continue to help us leap forward.","Bob McMahon","Hey, Isaac, this is Bob. I think in addition to that, in addition to the U.S., obviously with the strength that we\u2019re seeing in our international business, that\u2019s being driven by our Breast Health business. So we also believe that we\u2019re gaining share internationally there as well. And that we believe that, that will continue to be a strong growth driver for us, not only through the rest of this year, but beyond.","Isaac Ro","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the Aesthetics business. Obviously, that\u2019s an area that people remain very focused on. And you called out the seasonality year-on-year despite the easy comp as a sequential decline there. But I\u2019m just curious, kind of we put in the numbers aside for a minute, can you just give us an operational update? There\u2019s been some leadership change. I\u2019d be interested in sort of what\u2019s going on behind the scenes to kind of, over the long term, drive better performance. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Isaac. You know what, I feel so great about the leadership in place. And we just had our global leadership team together for the last couple of days for all of our businesses. And I think if you look at the presidents we have sitting around that table, everybody has so much confidence in the team, particularly, that we\u2019ve put in place in Cynosure. And again, you look at the international Breast Health numbers that we\u2019re posting right now, and you are with us on the journey, you know where we stood six, seven, five, eight ago in international Breast Health.","That was Kevin Thornal. Kevin went in the first few quarters of Europe. We\u2019re still weak when he went over there in Breast Health. And today, it\u2019s thriving. And Kevin is doing the same magic with the Cynosure business. We\u2019ve got a great VP of Sales. He\u2019s rebuilding the team. We\u2019ve got all the strength of the folks that have stayed with us. And I think it\u2019s really going to be a more magical team as we go forth.","We\u2019re in that classic scenario, and you\u2019ve heard me say it before, where sometimes, the numbers are better than an organization; sometimes, the organization is getting better than the numbers. And I think we feel really good that, that organization right now is getting better than the numbers and starting to see that, certainly some progress here in the last quarter. I think it\u2019s just going to play out over the course of this year. But I think we just feel so much better. We\u2019ve got TempSure coming out the door. The folks we\u2019ve got in that organization today, really excited and building for the future.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move to our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jack Meehan","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to start in the molecular side. So I was hoping you can give an update on the Fusion system in terms of placement adoption and just thoughts on how customer utilization has changed, either with the LDT as a respiratory there.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Jack. We are in that very, very early stages of actually placing Fusion. We\u2019re in the de minimis numbers at this point, just starting to get it out there. So I think \u2013 and even with the flu and respiratory stuff, obviously no impact yet this year. We got it out too late. So as we go into next year, I think that will start to be in effect. Now having said that, respiratory in molecular in the big labs is still a fairly small business. But we really like what Fusion is going to do, less over the coming quarters and more over the coming years.","Bob McMahon","Yes, and I think, Jack, while the end is small, certainly, customer feedback has been incredibly positive. And so we\u2019re actually very excited about that for the long term. And again, it\u2019s probably less a growth driver for 2018, but it sets us up very nicely for 2019 and beyond.","Steve MacMillan","Yes, very much.","Jack Meehan","Great. And just in terms of the full year guidance, last quarter, you gave segment-level thoughts. Do you think those ranges still hold today? Or are there any pluses and minuses in your mind?","Bob McMahon","Yes, I think we\u2019re not going to get into the habit of giving that every quarter. I think given our first quarter, maybe I feel a little less good about the Surgical business, maybe a little better about Breast Health. I think everything else is probably in line.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move to our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. Bob, having said that, I\u2019m going to ask about segment guidance. Just on Cynosure, I mean, you previously talked about double-digit pro forma growth for the year. I just want to make sure that, that is still on track. And can you maybe talk, I guess, on pacing, given the seasonably soft second quarter, I mean, what we should expect in the back half of the year and contributions from the new product as well, from TempSure?","Bob McMahon","Yes, we\u2019re probably not going to give product-level detail there. I mean, we feel really good about TempSure. As we\u2019ve said before, we expect strength growing throughout the course of the year with Cynosure, and the second half of the year, we would expect to be stronger than the first half of the year. We are fighting against a seasonality in the first quarter \u2013 in the second fiscal quarter, where, typically, that is lighter. And so the positives are our sales organization is getting stronger as well. And so the question \u2013 and as well as launching the new product. So the question is how much of that is going to be able to overcome that, but certainly feel good about the progress that we\u2019re making.","Tycho Peterson","All right. And then, Steve, on NovaSure, you\u2019ve talked about new leadership, new sales force comp, restructuring that a bit. And that was just some of the new products. I guess where are you in the turnaround of that business? How much of it is operational and organizational versus just a function of getting these new products out to try to turn the growth around there?","Steve MacMillan","Yes, great, Tycho. I\u2019d say we\u2019re in the late early innings in the turnaround. I think we\u2019ve got a couple of more quarters, candidly, probably of some Surgical softness as that team really rebuilds it. But I think we exit this fiscal year in a good trajectory for that business. We\u2019ve been making key leadership changes within that organization and have actually moved pretty quickly. I think we got a little fat, dumb and happy when we had the competitive withdrawal. It\u2019s the reverse of what I said earlier. Sometimes the numbers look better than the organization, and sometimes the organization looks better than the numbers.","I think our Surgical business looked \u2013 the numbers were better than the organization a year ago. And now we\u2019re reversing that, much as we\u2019re doing with Cynosure, to build for the future. But I think a couple of more quarters before we\u2019re really back where we want to be.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move to our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Steve MacMillan","Vijay.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe I\u2019ll start off one high level, Steve, on the geographic, U.S. versus OUS. So in the quarter, U.S. GYN, Breast, they were down. Diagnostics was little singles, right? So as you think about U.S. versus OUS, what could turn around some of these, I guess, growth rates in the U.S., right? Because GYN, I think on the converter front, maybe there\u2019s a little bit of headwind, and Breast, just given where we are in the penetration level and the converter dynamics, I\u2019m just trying to understand what changes that view of dynamics.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Remember, Vijay, that most of the impact on the U.S. numbers this quarter was the four fewer selling days versus last year. That was clearly accentuated in the U.S. and especially in those disposable businesses. I think, on the core, we feel good about what our molecular business is doing. If you days-adjusted that in the United States, I think you\u2019d have \u2013 it would have been very much high singles, possibly borderline double digit. So some very good underlying performances there.","I think Surgical was clearly weaker, and that was going against both the big comp and fewer selling days. But as we said, we got some work to do there to strengthen that. So I think the good news, as we look at it, is Breast Health, Diagnostics, our two largest businesses, both in the U.S. and globally, performing well. And we really do think we\u2019ve got international on a sustainable growth rate that really is pushing that double-digit number that we\u2019ve been aspiring to, as you know, for a while, and we\u2019ve now delivered it a number of quarters in a row and expect to continue that.","Bob McMahon","Yes. Hey, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to put some numbers to it. As we said in our prepared remarks, the extra days were slightly more than $20 million in Q1 of last year, and the significant majority of that was in the U.S.","Vijay Kumar","That\u2019s helpful Bob. And maybe, Bob, one on the guidance for second quarter. It looks like it was $6 million to $15 million below where the Street was. Is that all coming from a delta versus how the Street had modeled Cynosure? Or was this maybe a little bit of softness on GYN? Any comments, I think, would be helpful.","Bob McMahon","Yes, I think, as we said in our prepared remarks, the kind of sequential decreases is really probably a couple of things. The first and foremost is the blood screening business and how that was \u2013 how we\u2019re looking at that. And there is some seasonality in Surgical and in Medical Aesthetics. We have seen early in January, some combination of kind of the bad weather and the flu, somewhat impacted, and you\u2019ve heard that from some of our customers. But primarily, if you look at quarter-over-quarter over the last several years, our second quarters been in line roughly with the first quarter.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. I\u2019ll start with a question on Cynosure. Can you give us some color and context around your positioning and competitive environment with SculpSure? And I ask because it looks like you were sequentially up in Cynosure in every business but body, which I assume is mostly SculpSure.","Steve MacMillan","Dan, I think that\u2019s our bigger challenge that we\u2019re in the midst of, I think, taking some very good actions to fix. But I think, last year at this time, they certainly sold a whole bunch in, frankly sold some to some customers that probably didn\u2019t really know how to use the product as effectively, and we\u2019ve been unwinding that and really focusing now on how we build it for the right path. I think the positive is, I think we\u2019ve really gotten our hands around that. At this point, our understanding of our organization is totally on top of it.","And in the meantime, I think the real nuggets that show we\u2019ve got some good things going are the growth in both women\u2019s health as well as skin. And I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting to see some real traction that the new organization knows what\u2019s it\u2019s doing and frankly, quietly, very bullish about what we may be able to do with MonaLisa Touch, which is \u2013 could be a key leverage point for us as we also rebuild and restore SculpSure to its rightful place.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. And then for my follow-up. Possible if you could elaborate a bit on the reinvestment in R&D of U.S. tax reform dollars. Are we talking about acceleration of menu expansion on Panther? Or are there projects within Cynosure you\u2019re going to accelerate? Any further color will be helpful.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, we\u2019re really looking at it both R&D and marketing and really across division. So what we\u2019ve done is each division has put forth a list of some things. And I would say, it really is fairly, I wouldn\u2019t say balanced, but fairly spread across the various businesses. And it\u2019s a project tier there that we might be accelerating by 6 months or something else we might get started on a little bit earlier as well as some additional marketing activities to help drive the overall category demand for a number of these categories where we\u2019re the market leaders. So nothing that\u2019s going to dramatically affect revenue in 2018 but I think the kind of stuff that will probably start to show up in 2019 and beyond.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Bill Quirk","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everybody.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Bill.","Bill Quirk","All right. So first off, I was hoping if you could just help us think a little bit about the sales cycle for Brevera and Affirm. And then I certainly appreciate that we\u2019re still pretty early here, particularly around Brevera, but how high or maybe help us think about kind of where we could get in terms of penetration within some of your existing accounts? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. First off, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t say that I\u2019m very pleased how my Eagles performed in your hometown during the Super Bowl. And I think Brevera is off to a good start. And Mike Watts is shaking his head. But I think it\u2019s really interesting. If we\u2019re brutally honest with you, Affirm, that we launched, call it, a year, 1.5 years ago, got off to a slightly slower start than we would have hoped. And yet Affirm is doing very well now.","And I will tell you, people NT who runs that business for us, and we really dug in. What we realized is we hadn\u2019t really launched any non-mammography products in a long time in Breast Health. And this is back to a cultural piece as you start to see where we are in our organizational maturity. While Affirm didn\u2019t get off to a great start, but is thriving today, we learned a lot about that and applied it to the Brevera launch, which is just getting more familiar with, getting it in front of the Capital Committee sooner, and Brevera really has come out of the gates humming.","And the great part about Brevera, unlike Affirm, is Brevera brings a very strong disposable stream. So the more we get these Breveras placed today, it\u2019s going to create that ongoing revenue stream that we feel really good about. In terms of full penetration levels, I mean, some of that, probably I\u2019m not ready to fully figure that out, but it\u2019s a game-changing technology that, frankly, I think every hospital should end up certainly with a Brevera in their suite.","Bob McMahon","Yes, what I would say to add to that, Bill, just to give maybe a little bit more flavor, the life cycle of an Affirm Prone Biopsy table is longer than a life cycle of a Brevera.","Steve MacMillan","Yes, and the bigger strategic piece is, this gets back to as we\u2019ve been saying, we\u2019ve got this great installed base in mammography. How can we build around that and create, a, more revenue and more recurring revenue, and Brevera is sort of one of the perfect examples of the kinds of things we want to be doing here. I think it\u2019s going to really help us. It goes back to breaking that huge cliff that everybody was so worried about a couple of years ago.","Bill Quirk","That\u2019s great. And of course, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t congratulate you on the Super Bowl. So congrats on that, Steve. Glad hear that you guys enjoyed the tropical weather that we brought in for the game. This is just a quick follow-up. Just thinking about PAMA and potential bleed-through in terms of hospital pricing pressure on the manufacturers. My understanding of the economics in chlamydia and gonorrhea suggest you probably are not going to see much pressure, but I\u2019d be curious about your thoughts there. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. We always worry about the pressures, and PAMA is another one of those many things we deal with. I think the biggest piece of it that we feel good about is we\u2019ve been partnering increasingly, especially with our largest customers, in helping to drive the categories and expanding the categories and getting more testing. And through a combination of both, our OB\/GYN sales force is detailing as well as increasing outreach to \u2013 through some direct-to-patient, really, education around things like, \u201cyes means test,\u201d and a lot of the things we have going on and co-testing and things like that.","So I think our major lab partners are seeing that we\u2019re not just a vendor. We\u2019re more than that. And we\u2019re really helping to grow the overall categories and drive their business as well as our business and frankly, improving public health. So I think we\u2019re in a pretty good spot there, not to say there\u2019s always going to be pressures, but I think we can \u2013 our efforts will help us fight through those.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Chris Lin","Good afternoon. This is actually Chris Lin on for Doug today. I just want to start with a question on Surgical. So days clearly had a pronounced impact on Surgical sales, adjusted for days and recognizing that there was a difficult comparison. How did MyoSure perform relative to your expectations in the quarter? And just building off that, for the full year, do you still expect MyoSure to grow at a double-digit rate?","Steve MacMillan","Yes, I think MyoSure was in line, and we would certainly hope and expect it to still be a double-digit grower for the course of the year. Generally, we want to be careful not to give too much product line detail, but we feel pretty good about that product continuing to thrive.","Bob McMahon","Yes, Chris, as we said, Surgical was one of the ones that was probably most impacted by the days as well given it\u2019s the consumable side of the business. But I agree with you, Steve.","Chris Lin","Okay. And then maybe could you just also give us a sense of how interest has trended for the viral load assays from your existing customers in the U.S. And then just how much of a focus is there from the sales force to go after that opportunity now, and could you accelerate the efforts with the tax savings?","Steve MacMillan","Yes, I\u2019d say the first piece is we\u2019re in such the early days. The hep B was just approved. So we\u2019re literally just training up the sales force and getting that rolling. And I think this is one that we think, just given the way contracts expire and allow lockups and everything else, it\u2019s going to be a slow build. But we\u2019ve always thought about the virals as really being \u2013 increasing drivers in 2019 and even more in 2020 as they build up. So I think, in a lot of ways, just we feel great about what those will bring for the future. So sales force, early on, wouldn\u2019t expect any tax reform piece to be affecting those at all right now.","Bob McMahon","Yes, I agree. And in addition to that, Chris, just as a another side, the utilization of our Panther systems continues to grow on a global basis. And I think the benefits of the Panther system will really help drive the adoption of the viral loads over time.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, one for you, and then a quick follow-up for Bob. Steve, it feels like \u2013 I appreciate the targeted initiatives to improve the relative growth rate in Surgical, but it sort of feels like the sales force needs maybe another product to sell. So to what extent can that product be MonaLisa, and how much of it is the priority to potentially add that third product through M&A? And then a quick follow-up for Bob.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, David. They certainly would benefit and can benefit from a third product. The flip side is we think they can be doing a better job with the two that they have right now, and it always becomes the easy answer from an underperforming salesperson to say they need more. And yet, our top people, frankly, still are finding more opportunity. So there are opportunities. I do think, to your point with MonaLisa Touch, I think there will be some opportunities more for, frankly, cross-referrals than necessarily having them sell it directly, but I think working in a little closer partnership with the Cynosure sales to open some more doors, and we\u2019re just starting to see some of the early successes there. Having said all that, to your big point, Surgical is absolutely an area that we could use another product and is on the lookout for tuck-in acquisitions. So I would hope, over the coming years, we will be able to broaden that product line to your exact point.","David Lewis","Okay. Thanks Steven. And Bob, just a quick kind of clarification or question on tax. So number one, the 23%, 24%, I mean, is that a fleck where you see the new kind of statutory rate for the business? Or do you think that\u2019s conservative in light of some of the complexities that you sort of called out around the reform at this early stage? And then also, if I think about your implied reinvestments, I think it\u2019s $30 million to $35 million. Is it really realistic that you could put that money to work in the back half of the year?","Bob McMahon","Yes. Hey, David, yes, on the first question regarding the 23%. We feel pretty good about that, and that\u2019s our best guess right now. So I don\u2019t envision it changing too much throughout the course of the year. And regarding the investment, yes, you\u2019re roughly in the ballpark, and I think given some of the opportunities that we have, obviously, we\u2019re going to be disciplined. But we do think that we can use that money to invest, particularly in things like marketing efforts and so forth, to strengthen the business for the long haul.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks. One on Cynosure and one on Panther. On Cynosure, maybe just a recap of where the sales force build is at this point, where you expect it to sort of peek out at. And how many of those reps right now are in training, and when will that be complete? And then I\u2019ll have a follow-up on Panther. Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. As it relates to Cynosure, I\u2019d say in the hiring process, we\u2019re easily into the sixth, seventh inning and feeling really good about numerically. And a number of them have been going through training. Most of the hires actually have recently been trained. And I think it\u2019s where we feel really good about where we\u2019ll be in the coming quarters. But they don\u2019t go out and hit the street day one and immediately be productive. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying here, we figure we\u2019d exit this year, our fiscal year, which is the July to September quarter. I think we ought to be in great shape by that point and again, building nicely between now and then. The team getting much, much stronger.","Anthony Petrone","A follow-up on Panther. Just curious to \u2013 you have the full viral load out there, and it looks like the portfolio is really extending. You\u2019re looking more toward 2019 for a benefit. Just curious on the competitive front, I mean, does that bake in some conservatism for, let\u2019s say, Abbott, Alinity in particular? Anything of note from that competitive launch?","Steve MacMillan","We\u2019re always going to be probably a little conservative as we think about the ramp ups to some of these things. And most of the Diagnostics products really do take time. Having said that, I think we feel great about Panther and the opportunities to put more on Panther\u2019s, including the virals, should be very beneficial for us here over time.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Brian Weinstein","Hey, guys. Can you hear me?","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Brian.","Brian Weinstein","Hi, Steve, I thought you might have cancel to attend the parade today, but I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re still doing the call. So thanks for that.","Steve MacMillan","It was actually on the TV and Mike Watch\u2019s office, because it was better for him to watch that because it was worse to watch CNBC at this point.","Brian Weinstein","I get that. Hey, so a couple of questions first. Recent MQSA looks like it\u2019s down over the last couple of months. So can you just talk about the difficulty potentially in sort of pushing through this middle point of the adoption cycle here? And anything else that you guys think you need to do? Obviously, you have new products going in there. But is it just more difficult to push through this, and is that where we\u2019re starting to see a little bit through some of these MQSA data?","Steve MacMillan","I think it is much as some seasonality here more than anything, Brian, over the last quarter-ish on the MQSA stuff. The MQSA stuff also, there\u2019s some swirly stuff in some of those numbers. So as we try to reconcile them, I\u2019d put it as directional at best. But I think fundamentally, between our 3Dimensions, our 3D Performance, we\u2019re feeling pretty good, and I think especially the 3D Performance, as an ability to kind of continue to help push through this cycle. So we\u2019re not detecting any material downturn in the market as we hit the state. Is it getting harder to \u2013 and requiring more work as you get further out in this \u2013 in the curve? Absolutely. But I think, frankly, it may even benefit us given our strength and our commitment and our resolve in this category as well as the benefits we\u2019re bringing. So I probably feel, as Bob said, incrementally even better today about our Breast Health business than we did six months ago, both \u2013 and really both domestically and internationally.","Bob McMahon","Yes, I think to build on what you\u2019re saying, Steve, I think one of the things that the team has done is really just portfolio sell. So it\u2019s not just about converting a gantry or a mammography machine. It\u2019s the Affirm Prone Biopsy System, it\u2019s the Brevera system there. And we believe that all of those are best-in-class. And so that really helps that portfolio sell throughout the course of the sales replacement cycle.","Brian Weinstein","Okay. Great. And then I don\u2019t know if you guys hit this or not, so I apologize if you did. But did you kind of give any idea on rough breakout for Cyno between U.S., OUS and what those different geographies are growing at, at this point? Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Great. We\u2019re not going down at that level of detail. But I think we continue to feel \u2013 international has been relatively strong, and it\u2019s been the U.S., it\u2019s been the larger rebuild.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Richard Newitter","Thanks for taking the questions. I had a couple on TempSure, Steve. With this product, could you just give us a sense of who you\u2019re targeting? Is this more of a core focus product, especially with the initial indication seemingly more on kind of the face and the reduction in the appearance of cellulite? When can we expect the new indications for Surgical and women\u2019s health? And then, historically, with Cynosure, in the first year of a launch of a new product, non-invasive set notwithstanding, they had generated anywhere from $20 million to $30 million in their first year of sales for a new product. Once you\u2019re kind of a up-and-running with your sales force kind of exiting the next quarter, is that something that we should kind of expect for this product? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, I think the \u2013 clearly, the initial customer base for TempSure as its launching now is definitely much more the core cosmetic and derm audience, where we\u2019ve always had a lot of strength as well. In terms of specific product-level guidance, I\u2019m probably not going to go there. But I don\u2019t think those numbers are wildly out of range, but we don\u2019t want to get down to quite that level. As you can see, we\u2019re trying to provide more detail than certainly what Cynosure used to provide as an independent company. Well, we\u2019re not going to go down to individual product stuff.","Bob McMahon","Yes, Rich. And in regards to the additional indication, those will come over time throughout the course of this year and the first half of next year.","Richard Newitter","Okay. And maybe just one follow-up. Any statistics or metrics you can give us on the utilization of the SculpSure systems, how that\u2019s been trending?","Steve MacMillan","It \u2013 truthfully, it\u2019s varied by customer. We have some that are doing really well and others, candidly, that I think where we sold it in and didn\u2019t have the follow-up, and those are the ones we\u2019re going back and working to improve now.","Bob McMahon","Yes, and what I would say, Rich, is that the PAC key revenue continues to grow year-over-year, but still a lot of long way to go.","Operator","And thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. Have a good evening."],"10795":["Hologic, Inc.

My name is Cassandra and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Mike Watts","Thank you, Cassandra. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks; then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our Web site, we also will post our prepared remarks to our Web site shortly after we deliver them this afternoon. Finally, a replay of the call will be archived on our Web site through February 26.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known as well as unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's in our press release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation from GAAP can be found in our earnings release.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Steve MacMillan","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone.","We are very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In short, the company is off to a good start to the year. We are executing on our key top-line growth drivers and exceeding expectations on the bottom-line based on the tremendous earnings power of the company, which has become even stronger over time than I initially thought possible.","In the first quarter, total revenue grew 8.1% in constant currency terms driven by double-digit growth in the United States, our largest and most profitable market. Our U.S. businesses have turned around more rapidly than anyone anticipated based on better commercial execution and the quality of our products. And over the last few quarters, our domestic sales and marketing teams have kicked it up a notch generating robust growth from our key brands. This commercial improvement has led to significant benefits up and down our income statement.","For example, in the first quarter, we posted non-GAAP gross and operating margins that were significantly higher than in the prior year period. We are clearly demonstrating that despite our already sector leading profitability, we can generate additional operating leverage by driving the growth of our most profitable products.","Working down the income statement, earnings per share were $0.46 in the first quarter beating our expectations again. In addition, we increased EPS at a pace that was nearly 3x the rate of revenue growth.","With that introduction, let me discuss the details of our first quarter revenue performance. Then Bob will take you through the rest of the income statement, the balance sheet and our updated guidance.","Total revenues were $695.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 6.5% on a reported basis and 8.1% in constant currency terms. Geographically, our U.S. businesses performed exceptionally well in the quarter. We posted 12.8% revenue growth domestically, a slight acceleration over the fourth quarter despite a more difficult comp. The strong U.S. performance outweighed what was a mixed bag internationally in the first quarter. We showed good continued progress in cytology, molecular diagnostics and surgical outside the United States.","In constant currency terms, cytology grew high single-digit, molecular posted modest growth for the second consecutive quarter. And surgical grew in the mid-teens albeit from a small base. In contrast, we saw weakness in our international blood screening business which was largely expected and which resulted mainly from fluctuations in ordering patterns by our commercial partner Grifols.","In addition, our international breast health results confirmed as we've highlighted before that we are a long way from optimizing our relationships with our dealers and distributors. Lower breast health and blood screening sales OUS contributed to total international sales declining a 11.5% in the quarter or 5.4% in constant currency terms.","We are moving decisively to strengthen the international breast business drawing on the same tool kit that we employed to turnaround our domestic franchises. We are unifying leadership of all global commercial activities under our COO, Eric Compton. So that we may share some of our U.S. best practices internationally. As part of this process, our head of international has left the company along with our head of European breast health sales. In their place, Eric is diving deep to optimize our go-to-market strategy in key markets around the globe. We are highly focused on identifying the right commercial model for each country in each we operate, while there maybe some short-term volatility, we remain bullish on our international opportunities in breast health and we look forward to sharing more details about our plans as they come together.","Now, let's provide some more color on our divisional revenue performance in the first quarter. Our biggest division Diagnostics, posted sales of $310.7 million in the quarter, a growth rate of 3.7% in constant currency terms. But the three franchises within diagnostics demonstrated very different results. In molecular diagnostics and cytology, where we controlled the commercial channel, our results were very good. But blood screening sales declined.","Let's discuss each piece in turn. In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $129.6 million increased 9.9% in constant currency, our best growth rate since the Gen-Probe acquisition. Domestic revenues increased a stellar 11.5% and the formula was similar to recent quarters, strong placements of our fully automated Panther instrument, a healthy number of competitive wins and growing utilization of our women's health assays.","We said at a recent healthcare conference that the average Panther system globally now generates more than a $170,000 in annual assay revenue despite being less than 30% utilized, this demonstrates both the current value of the system and it's future potential for customers and Hologic as we add new test for viral load and other targets in the years ahead.","Outside the United States, sales of our molecular diagnostics products grew nominally on a constant currency basis for the second consecutive quarter as the business stabilizes after an extended period of decline.","We are also pleased with the performance of ThinPrep, one of our largest and most profitable franchises. Global sales of cytology and perinatal products totaled a $120.4 million in the first quarter. U.S. sales actually increased by a modest 0.5% as market share gains more than offset headwinds from longer screening intervals. And internationally, we are encouraged that revenue grew 8.7% in constant currency. This drove global growth of 3.1%, our second consecutive quarter of decent constant currency growth. Our commercial team deserves much credit for transforming a business that was declining at a high single digit rate as recently as 2014 into a modest grower globally.","In blood screening, worldwide sales were $60.7 million in the first quarter. This was roughly flat sequentially as sales have normalized without the benefit of growth from the Japanese Red Cross contract. Compared to the prior year, however, blood screening sales declined 6.5% on a constant currency basis. This reflects heavier ordering by our partner Grifols a year ago and general declines in blood usage that we are seeing in the United States and other markets.","Now, let's turn to Breast Health where we continue to see strong adoption of our Genius 3D mammography exams in the United States. Domestic sales of breast imaging product including our Genius systems increased 18.7% compared to the 8.9% constant currency decline we saw internationally. Global sales of interventional breast products increased slightly on a constant currency basis and we are optimistic that new products will help stimulate growth in this category over the next couple of years. All of this added up to total breast health sales of $262.2 million in the quarter up 9.9% in constant currency terms.","We also remain enthusiastic about our future prospects in the mammography market. We continue to gain share in the United States based on a superior product profile and excellent customer service. Our prices are stable despite increasing competition, which indicates that our marketing programs are working and that our systems are providing value to customers. And congressional action is prohibited any near term insurance changes arising from the controversial screening recommendations by the USPSTF. All-in-all, we've a lengthy runway ahead of us to continue upgrading older less effective technologies to our Genius 3D exams.","To round out the revenue discussion, we are thrilled with the progress being made by our surgical team. Although the December quarter is typically a seasonally strong one, we certainly did not predict sales of $98.8 million or a constant currency growth rate of 18.8%. These are truly outstanding results, our best overall performance in the last several years. So congratulations to the commercial teams and new leaders who are making it happen.","It's worth mentioning that surgical is Hologic's most profitable division on a gross and operating margin basis. So the magnitude of the top-line growth we're now seeing is having a nice positive impact on the company's gross and operating margins as well as earnings per share. Specifically, our MyoSure product for hysteroscopic tissue removal posted total revenue of $36.9 million in the first quarter with accelerating growth of 46.1% in constant currency terms. Equally impressive, global NovaSure sales of $61.7 million increased by 7.5% on a constant currency basis. We do believe NovaSure sales benefited from the recall of a competitive product but estimate that this benefit was relatively small in the context of overall quarterly sales.","Finally, worldwide Skeletal sales were $23.5 million in the quarter, an increase of 7.7% on a constant currency basis driven by continued growth of our new horizon bone density scanner a very solid performance.","Before, I turn the call over to Bob; let me conclude by saying that this quarter illustrates the value that our portfolio of products can provide to shareholders. Although breast health and blood screening declined outside the United States, we more than compensated by posting strong growth in mammography, molecular diagnostics and surgical. The net effect was top-line performance slightly ahead of expectations and a significant increase in profitability.","All-in-all, we are off to a good start in 2016 and remain excited about the future.","Now, I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Bob McMahon","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.","I'm going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, the balance sheet, and our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis.","As Steve mentioned, we delivered another solid quarter on the top-line with 12.8% sales growth in the U.S. more than offsetting the international choppiness we saw in breast health and blood screening.","Strength in domestic revenue combined with the early returns of our productivity efforts help drive margin improvement at the gross and operating levels contributing to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.46, a 17.9% increase over the prior year period. Even with headwinds from share count and currency EPS grew at a rate nearly 3x faster than sales.","Moving down the income statement, our first quarter gross margin of 65.2% increased a 190 basis points compared to the prior year period. Gross margin benefited from mix both geographic and product and from our cost reduction initiatives. Not only did revenue grow at a double-digit rate in the U.S., some of our highest margin products also performed well including our ThinPrep, NovaSure and Aptima franchise.","And I should point out that pricing remains stable across our product lines as our commercial team is focused on selling the clinical and economic value that our products provide. In addition, our operations and procurement teams are executing well driving efficiencies and reducing the cost to make our products.","Total operating expenses of $221 million increased by 11.3% in the first quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense which increased 15.6%. We continued to invest to extend our leadership in the mammography market and to explain why co-testing the best way to protect women from cervical cancer.","Despite these investments better growth margins drove profitability improvement down to the operating line. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Although our operating margin has already among the highest in our sector, the last several quarters have clearly demonstrated that they can expand further even as we fund key growth drivers.","Moving further down the income statement, we are beginning to reap the benefits of our efforts to reduce and refinance debt. In the first quarter, interest expense was $32.8 million a reduction of 25% versus the prior year period. In addition, we are pleased that a lot of hard work to reduce our tax rate has begun to payoff earlier than expected. We now estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 33% in fiscal 2016 lower than our initial guidance and this added about a $0.01 to EPS in the first quarter. Although, this is just a first step in our multiyear tax improvement strategy, we are encouraged by the progress we've made so far.","Finally, diluted shares outstanding were $292 million in the first quarter. As you know, we are focused on minimizing share count dilution by eliminating the convertible notes from our capital structure. In the fourth quarter for example, we repurchased $300 million in principle of our most dilutive convertible notes. And this had a beneficial effect on share count in the first quarter.","In addition, the recent decline in our share price had the rather perverse effect of further reducing dilution from the converts. The combined effect boosted EPS by almost a $0.01 in the quarter.","Now, let's talk about cash flows and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was strong again in the first quarter at a $164.3 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year period. We spent $19.7 million on capital in the quarter leading the free cash flow of $144.6 million.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the first fiscal quarter with $650 million in cash, 19.5% improvement over the prior year period. This strong cash position provides us with dry powder for potential tuck-in acquisitions even as we continue to pay down debt.","At the end of the first quarter, we had total debt outstanding of $3.6 billion, a decrease of $322 million compared to a year ago and net debt of $2.98 billion. Our leverage ratio net debt over EBITDA now stands at 3.1x and we are on track to achieve our goal of lowering our leverage ratio to 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2017.","To wrap up the historical discussion, adjusted EBITDA was $252 million in the first quarter up 8.1% compared to the prior year period. And we are tracking to generate EBITDA of more than $1 billion for the full year. Our consistency in delivering strong profit growth and lowering debt as allowed us to steadily improve our return on invested capital.","As of our first fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, 160 basis point increase over the prior year.","Now, let's shift gears and turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our guidance based on our solid performance in the first quarter, a stronger U.S. dollar and greater than expected earnings power. As always, this guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates. As you know, the dollar has strengthened since we provided our initial 2016 guidance, compared to last year; we now expect currency to represent a $25 million top-line headwind in 2016. This equates to roughly $0.03 in earnings per share. And importantly, compared to when we initially guided in November, the stronger dollar is subtracting an incremental $11 million from our top-line.","So for the 2016 fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance for constant currency growth of between 4.4% and 5.5%. But on a reported basis, we are updating our guidance to reflect the additional currency headwind. So based solely on the stronger dollar, we now expect reported revenues of $2.8 billion to $2.83 billion representing reported growth of 3.5% to 4.6%.","As Steve said earlier, we continue to forecast improvements on both the gross and operating margin lines based on favorable geographic and product mix as well as early returns from our productivity efforts.","In addition, as you probably read, the omnibus budget bill that was passed by congress in December included a 2-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax among other key provisions. We are thrilled that congress has recognized the negative effects of this tax on domestic innovation and job growth.","In fiscal 2015, we paid $23.6 million under this tax which was reported under general and administrative expenses. It's important to note 2 points however. First, since the moratorium took effect on January 1, we only recognized three quarters of this benefit in our 2016 fiscal year. In addition, we plan to reinvest most of the benefit in some of our more attractive R&D and commercial programs.","Continuing with our full year guidance, we now expect our effective tax rate to improve to approximately 33% for the year and believed diluted shares outstanding will total between $296 million and $298 million for the full year.","Given these updates and our strong first quarter results, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. For the full year, we now expect EPS of $1.86 to $1.90. This translates to growth of 13.1% to 15.5% in constant currency terms or reported growth between 11.4% and 13.8%.","So despite the currency and share count headwinds, we anticipate growing EPS more than double the rate of sales demonstrating bottom-line growth and operating leverage that seemed unlikely at best just a few quarters ago.","Turning to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues of $680 million to $690 million. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 4.5% to 6% on a constant currency basis and reported revenue growth of 3.7% to 5.3%.","We expect a sequential decline in revenue for two main reasons. First, our surgical business is seasonally weakest in the March quarter, especially in comparison to the strength we saw on the December period. Second, we are allowing for some potential choppiness in our international business.","In terms of the bottom-line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.46 in the second quarter. This represents growth of 11.2% to 13.6% in constant currency terms or 9.8% to 12.2% on a reported basis. It's worth mentioning that we anticipate a substantial R&D increase in spending in the second fiscal quarter based mainly on the timing of projects.","Before opening the call for questions, I would like to reiterate that Hologic is off to a good start in 2016. In the first quarter, our momentum continued with Genius 3D mammography in our surgical and molecular diagnostic businesses priced to the upside. As a whole, our domestic business has performed great. These positives outweighed weaker than expected results in our international mammography business which we are dealing with aggressively.","In the middle of the income statement, we are demonstrating the tremendous earnings power of the company by improving gross and operating margins and below the line, we are beginning to see the benefits from our efforts to reduce debt as well as our effective tax rate.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to our first question from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. Steve, I guess I want to start on the international breast health where we have been getting a lot of questions on the decline. Can you maybe just walk through the extent of the dealer issues, how contained this is, how quickly you can work through it and what kind of cushion you are baking in for the remainder of the year?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. On the wall of worry, Tycho, it's something we think about, I wouldn't be overly freaked out by it. I think the way we are thinking about it is, we got just about every business performing better than we expected. But I think the deeper we dug in the second half of the year and you continue to hear us say really going back a few quarters. Hey, we are probably closer to a start-up than a real turnaround here. And we have a lot of work to do even building our relationships with the dealers.","And I think what -- as we go back and look at it, clearly, our fourth fiscal quarter was really strong and followed up a weaker quarter. And that's not what we want to be delivering and don't have that sustained relationship. So we are making some changes internally and we are not going to blame the dealers. We are going to always look at ourselves. And I will say that we need to be a little closer to it. But it's the only little piece of the puzzle, I think right now for us to continue to work on.","And I will also say, I think we are all accustomed to not every business is always firing on every cylinder the day it does, we are probably in trouble. This is kind of one of our areas of opportunity. I think the next couple of quarters; we will probably be a little bit softer. We are going to plan for that while we get to the right longer term place. But as Eric -- as Eric Compton after his first reviews of it said it's -- obviously reminds him of a little bit of when he walked in the door of Hologic two years ago and some of the same rebuilding needs to occur. And things like pricing discipline and marketing, market access, just a lot of the fundamentals that we have never put in place.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And just a follow-up, the management changes you alluded to, are the changes done, do you have team in place now you need for Europe?","Steve MacMillan","No. We are putting those in place. So we've exited a couple of people and we are in the process of putting new ones in. So that's why I think over the next quarter or two, price doubles, softness and that's basically what we've baked into our guidance.","Operator","And we will go next to Jonathan Groberg of UBS.","Jonathan Groberg","Great, thanks and congratulations on incredibly solid quarter. Obviously, a lot of questions on international breast health but you just answered some of those. So can you maybe talk a little bit about your -- looks like you know for the quarter, at least to start the year, your operating expenses grew quite a bit more than sales, kind of what's your expectation for OpEx growth for the year versus kind of gross margin for the year?","Bob McMahon","Hi, Jon. This is Bob. So as we mentioned in our prepared remarks what we are looking at is actually is very strong performance on our gross margin basis combination of product and geography mix as well as some of the productivity efforts that we are doing. And we are looking to reinvest a portion of those. Our gross margin is probably operating a little better than what we had anticipated and we are looking to reinvest that in those growth drivers and places like our marketing and to a certain extent some of the R&D investments to drive that growth rate on the top-line.","That being said, we are still expecting operating margin expansion consistent with that we had guided to in November and we believe that we are able to do that and we have demonstrated that certainly in the first quarter continued to have operating margin leverage and we expect that throughout the course of the rest of the year.","Jonathan Groberg","So just a follow-up on that kind of tie it into the first part of the conversation around international, is it more about getting the right people, I know you thought you had the right person in your first hire, but is it more about getting the right people or is it more about throwing more money at the issue? And have you contemplated how -- is that kind of in your guidance now the outlook for -- how much you might need to spend in order to -- to get the start up going internationally?","Steve MacMillan","It's all about the right people. It's not about spending Jonathan. So we will have it nailed.","Operator","And we will go next to Jack Meehan of Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Thanks and good afternoon. So just want to ask about the U.S. mammography business and just curious on your view for the landscape this year whether its hospital CapEx trends or the competitive dynamic just your view on the rate of placements from here?","Steve MacMillan","Jack, we still feel really good. The U.S. says -- we said the U.S. breast imaging business was up 18.7% in the quarter. That's coming off of some pretty good comps and everything we are seeing and hearing. As we continue to feel we are making very good progress both with our own customers as well as competitive in-roads. And I think we feel as good if not better about that business and the fact that we are going to end up by the end of the 3D curve. I said early on we think we will end up with a little bit higher share than we started. And I think if we anything we feel better and better about that prediction and more and more confident everyday that goes by. We continue to hear great stories from our teams.","Jack Meehan","Got it. And then just curious as you see hospitals taking on the new 3D units, do you still see them adding new capacity or you are seeing some replacements of 2D units as well?","Steve MacMillan","It's largely replacement is the way to think about it. I don't think we see the number of gantries being significantly different at the end of the 3D curve versus where we are today.","Operator","And we will go next to Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good afternoon guys and thank you for taking my questions.","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Doug.","Doug Schenkel","I just want to cover really two topics. One is really just a math on guidance and then really the other topic is just on pricing in certain product categories. So first on, guidance, just to try to run through the waterfall, you beat earnings guidance at the high-end by $0.04 this quarter. You increased EPS guidance for the year at the mid-point by $0.06. We estimate lower share count gets you $0.03 to $0.05 and lower tax rate gets $0.03 to $0.04, so it seems like we might be missing something here. Is there a change in mix that you expect to occur or are there areas that maybe you're investing a little bit more in either in sales or R&D relative to your last guidance. Why don't I pause there and I will come back with the pricing question?","Bob McMahon","Hey, Doug. This is Bob. You're generally on top of it for both the share count and the tax benefit. I think what the other piece that we alluded to -- the incremental headwind associated with FX. So if you think about the very -- at a very high level the tax and -- tax benefit and share count roughly we think about $0.06 offset by about $0.02 of FX and then we -- the operational beat in the Q1 like you said about $0.06 growth.","Doug Schenkel","Gets you in the neighborhood. Okay.","Bob McMahon","Yes.","Doug Schenkel","And then on pricing really quickly, some of our recent checks suggest that there may have been a pick up with more aggressive pricing from competitors particularly in chlamydia and gonorrhea, CT\/NG. Can you talk about if you are seeing anything that's really different from kind of the normal pricing pressures you see in the market and if there is -- basically what's baked into your guidance outlook for pricing changes in molecular? Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I will tell you. I think we feel as good as we felt since we have been here about pricing. And I think, we have got so much more discipline. I will tell you, we are hearing more and more competitive attempt frankly in both the molecular side as well as on the mammography side where there is some pretty big disparities and with Bob McMahon and Eric Compton's leadership in the divisional presidents, we have been doing a much better job of fighting on price -- not fighting on price, fighting on the features and benefits and not going down there. And it's part of the hidden piece and I think that we are seeing in our gross margin expansion. As we talk about the gross margin piece, it's clearly it's a -- the incredible progress we are making on the operational side. It's a mix benefit. But also frankly I think much better pricing discipline and we're holding pricing far better and in some cases getting a little bit of up ticks even in and what is a much more competitive environment.","Operator","And we will go next to Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Isaac.","Isaac Ro","Hi. How are you?","Steve MacMillan","Good.","Isaac Ro","Wanted to just maybe come back to the breast imaging comments that you guys touched on earlier. And wondering if you could put those in context with that we are seeing from the other major equipment player this quarter. And I'm specifically curious, if you are seeing any more signs of aggressive bundling or pricing practices from those players and whether or not that's a factor we should be considering in the market?","Steve MacMillan","We are seeing it. And Isaac, I would tell you what I'm really, really proud of our team fighting it off. I think we are actually winning more based on the overall success of our business. The combination of our product, our label, the ease of use and our Genius marketing campaigns which frankly has probably been the single biggest differentiator of hospitals understanding. They are better aligned with us in the mammography space than with anybody else because we are driving patients to the hospitals that have our systems and I think it's been a dramatic step change in our own organizations ability to ward-off going down the pricing games. And I've heard more and more anecdotes of much bigger pricing discounts from competitors on accounts that we have not lost and in fact we have won.","Bob McMahon","Yes. Just to build on that, Steve. I mean over the last 18 months we had two competitors come into a market where we were the sole competitor. We've not only maintained stable pricing but we gained share. I mean that\u2019s a huge credit to the -- our domestic breast health team led by Pete Valenti and that team, just tremendous job.","Isaac Ro","Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just several question on the balance sheet and M&A didn't come up so far this quarter, I'm curious if it's possible whether we might see you guys get in the marketplace this year where the tuck-in deal or two to augment the business. And if so kind of what -- how is the shopping list look, how would you characterize evaluations in deal funnel? Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Isaac, I think we are still in the earlier stages probably than I preferred to be on the true business development side. We have rebuild the capabilities aligned them with the divisions, I think the divisions are starting to look and starting to get the shopping list. But I put it really in, probably the first inning. And we started to look at a few things we said no to. I do think valuations are going to be our friend as we go forward and obviously, with the tremendous cash generation and getting our balance sheet cleaned up. We are going to be ready.","I think our teams have been so focused on great commercial execution and getting the R&D pipelines back in shape that sort of the next piece that will start to play out. But we are probably still a little slower, so I wouldn't anticipate anything super quick on that front.","Operator","And we will go next Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray.","Bill Quirk","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everybody.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Bill.","Bill Quirk","Hi, there. First question, Bob, you mentioned that obviously there is a number of factors that help drive the gross margin improvement year-over-year and you alluded to the fact they were in kind of the early days from a supply chain standpoint. So I guess, two part question here, one, can you help break this down a little bit further in terms of what the contribution was from lining your supply chain? And then, again, I don't want to put words in your mouth, it sounds kind of really early days for this initiative?","Steve MacMillan","Yes, we are. I'm not going to give you the level of specificity that you probably would like to have there. I would say it is a -- the productivity enhancements that we were talking about are -- through our sourcing organization as well as looking at running our factories more efficiently and I think -- our operations team has done a great job of driving that. Obviously, we started that last year and we are seeing one of full year benefit. We are starting to see the full annualized effect of that this year. And it felt really good about that.","I would say it was a fairly meaningful component of the gross margin expansion, obviously, with our U.S. business driving significant growth that also had a big impact as well. And as we are thinking about the -- way that the U.S. business grew with the higher margin products in our surgical businesses, so that actually helped us -- overall as well. So it was a nice balance between the kind of the three of those things. But I think we are in the early innings of sustained kind of improvement on the gross margin basis.","Bob McMahon","Hey, Bill. I would add to that. You heard me say certainly a year ago, I didn't think as a company, we would probably see much gross margin expansion. And if I say things that have changed over the last year in my own outlook that's one that -- I think we are seeing much better opportunity than I ever imagine possible. So it's back to that -- it's always puts and takes. That's one of the really good guys coming our way.","Bill Quirk","Good to hear. Second, I guess just kind of a bigger picture question on blood screening and blood utilization in general. I mean, certainly, we have had the trend of the lower hemoglobin transfusion triggers in the U.S. for a while. You alluded to that we may be starting to see this internationally as well. So I guess similar question here, guys, kind of how much through the process are we, both in the U.S. and OUS? I would just be curious what your partner, Grifols, has been telling you on that.","Steve MacMillan","I think we see -- in the U.S. I think we see continued low single digit declines probably in the blood screening business. Internationally probably more flattish as more countries adopt our nat testing but some more advanced ones start to cut back a little bit. So I think we see the international business more flattish. Having said that we got a couple of quarters right now that were absorbing the inventory fluctuations particularly from the year ago with the JRC where frankly we were both doing consumption plus inventory build. And now as the inventory is contracting back, we just got a couple of rougher comps that we are getting through. The underlying business slightly down but still a very good business for us but certainly it's not going to be accretive to our top-line growth rate over time. They would be dilutive to that.","Operator","And we will go next to Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thanks for taking the question.","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Rich.","Richard Newitter","I was hoping just to start off on the investments that you guys are making and one of the more frequent questions we get are about your pipeline and when we will get greater visibility into what you guys have in store as you eventually come out on the other side of the tomo ramp. So first, just can you give us any sense as to whether organic or external -- where the priority is? You alluded to some of that, Steve, earlier. And then, two, any color on when we will learn about the pipeline in greater detail and what can you give us today? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Sure, Rich. Clearly, the primary focus has been on rebuilding the organic growth pipeline and I think the simplest way to think about that is probably also why we are not further along on the business development front. We feel pretty good what we are putting in place. The other piece that I start to give you a little bit of a tidbit is, a lot of what we are working on or what I call singles and doubles. And the company was built historically on every eight years we launch a mega product like 2D and then 3D Tomo. And a lot of what we are looking at is how do we cushion the blow in between and looking at some smaller things that we can be doing to bring in between those big cycles. And the diagnostics business, it's about building out menu and in the breast health business it's not just what's the replacement for 3D tomo, it says there is a lot of other stuff that we can bring out in IBS and other stuff along the way.","So I think what you will start to see and as you know with me stylistically, I like to get a few points on the board before we start talking about them. And given an organization we inherited that had a few launches on the table that we had to scrap when I got here because they weren't really ready for primetime. I want to make sure, we really have our ducks in a row before we, a) start talking a lot more but I would tell you we are -- we feel better and better but it's going to be more singles and doubles than probably triples and home runs. So we will continue to update it as we go but that may give you a little more flavor from what you had historically.","Richard Newitter","That's helpful, Steve. Thanks. And then just maybe one more on the surgical business.","Steve MacMillan","Hey.","Richard Newitter","Yes. There you go. Nice growth acceleration there and I am just trying to get a sense for how sustainable this is. Should we be thinking of this business on a kind of a newer double-digit trajectory going forward and then do you have the portfolio you need to achieve that? Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. Thanks Rich. I wouldn't go there yet to the sustainable double-digit. Having said that, they posted several quarters in a row. The 18.8% clearly shocked us. We quietly put a new leader in that business late last summer. And we don't talk about all the changes we make. But that business is actually just in the last six months, we have a new VP of Marketing, a new President and new Head of Business Development, a new Head of R&D. And are more bullish and excited the team that Eric has put in place there is really, really good. And they are doing that with just two products today. We stopped the declines on NovaSure. You know it better than most that hey, just two years ago, NovaSure was a high-single digit decliner. We stopped that one and actually turned it into a positive.","And the -- and MyoSure, I know when I first came here, it was growing 20% people figured we are about maxed out, last year went to 30% and we just had a 46% growth quarter. And that's even when the people asked just the market size a year or two ago and I couldn't quite answer it. And I think we are seeing -- there maybe more potential there. And then, it's a great sales team that clearly could take on another product. So I think that's an area where we are very willing and stepping up our activities and looking at bolt-on acquisitions. It's an area we're in the nascent stages frankly we're starting to expand internationally. And it's a business, it can do a lot for the profit margin and profitability profile of the company.","So it's one -- we are more and more excited about. I just still model single-digit growth. But like everything we are -- we're certainly aspiring to continue the great trend. But, clearly, we did mention there was a competitive recall we think helped us in that last quarter. And so that we certainly don't see the 18.8% growth as sustainable. Aspirational, yes. And we will take it back to the division head and set that as a new goal. But pragmatically speaking we are not that good yet.","Bob McMahon","And Rich, I guess the only thing I would add to that on surgical is, is the quarter that we are in now which is our second fiscal quarter does tend to be seasonally weakest quarter for us. And typically the first quarter of our fiscal year is the strongest one.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. This quarter is typically a 7% to 10% decline just because of the reset of insurance plans and all that stuff from a sequential basis.","Operator","And we will go next to Brian Weinstein of William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Brian.","Brian Weinstein","How are you doing? Just wanted to ask a little bit about breast imaging again. You commented last quarter that quarters in-house had never been higher. I'm curious kind of what your backlog looks like right now and if you have seen any impact at all in terms of time to close from any discussion around the task force or any of these insurance companies that have been kind of reiterating non-payment for tomo. Is there anything in the field that you are picking up on that?","Bob McMahon","Hey, Brian. This is Bob. What I would say is our -- our backlog continue to be very robust. And we have not seen any extension or time to close or anything like that. I think that's a lot of noise that people may fear about kind of in the press but when it actually comes to -- actually making purchase decisions and so forth that hasn't affected us one bit.","Brian Weinstein","Great. And then if I -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Steve MacMillan","Go ahead.","Brian Weinstein","I was going to say, on cytology, you continue to reference share gains. Can you kind of talk about what inning you are in on those share gains, where you think you are in terms of market share at this point?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. We are not quite sure on market share but we feel very good. We are obviously a very strong leading thing probably in the three quarters of the market share range. So up in that 70-plus percent, certainly in the U.S., we think we're much lower outside and I think part of where we are really encouraged and where I think we have made great progress internationally over the last year, year-and-a-half, is starting to get the belief and the conviction of what we need to do to grow the cytology business outside.","You remember we said, one of the first things we can do to return this company to growth would stop the sharp declines on the ThinPrep business. And I think we feel pretty good about what we are doing there actually feel great.","Operator","And we go next to Raj Denhoy of Jefferies.","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Raj.","Raj Denhoy","Good afternoon. Hey, how are you doing Steve?","Steve MacMillan","Good Raj.","Raj Denhoy","Wondered if I could ask -- maybe start with Panther. You have given this metric now of $170,000 per machine. Is there any updates you can give us in terms of timing on when you can get the menu expanded and when you expect viral load in the United States and then subsequent tests beyond that?","Steve MacMillan","We are just rolling out viral load outside the U.S., we got the CE Marking and so we are rolling that out off of and I think that will help our molecular business. We are obviously coming off of a pretty weak base candidly internationally. It's nothing like what we have here. And really it's going to be a fiscal 2018\/2019 event in terms of the true viral load impact for us in the U.S. We'll get HIV approved sooner but frankly we ultimately want to have the full range of HIV, HBV, HCV, which we won't have really until later on in 2018. So the way we think about that is, it's probably going to end up hitting at a beautiful time for us as some of the mammography business maybe slowing a bit in the U.S. and that one kicks in and provides another leg up for us.","Raj Denhoy","Okay. That is helpful. And maybe just another question, too, on R&D spending was actually down this quarter relative to last year. And although you did make a comment that you expected to step up pretty dramatically, as you move through the back half of the year, is there anything you can give us in terms of what dramatically stepping up means and why it has been somewhat low up to this point?","Bob McMahon","Hey, Raj, this is Bob, simply timing when we look at the clinical programs that we are having. We expect to ramp up in Q2. So don't read anything into that other than just timing.","Operator","And we will go next to Jon Block of Stifel.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. Maybe just the first one, Bob, for you. Constant currency growth was left unchanged for 2016, but how do we think about the changes to the components of the guidance that you broke out last quarter? Again, GYN was so big. International breast health was maybe a little shy. Should we just flow that through the best we can or any official changes, again, to the components of the top-line?","Bob McMahon","No, specifics, I mean. I think you would flow those in obviously we were pleasantly surprised to the upside on the surgical business and then the U.S. I think our U.S. business is doing a little better than what we anticipated in our international business a little more choppy and so forth. So outside of that we are not going to give specific guidance to the individual components other than to say that any softness that we maybe seeing in the near term or the short-term internationally is going to be offset, we expect by the strength in the U.S. business.","Jon Block","Okay. Got it. And then, Steve, my apologies if I missed this on some of your call there, but we have seen the international breast health business bounce around a good about before, but when you talk about what is currently going on and we have the headline risk of international and what we deal with every day from where we sit, can you just give a little bit more detail? In other words, is it the way that you are working with dealers, the relationships that you think you guys can strengthen in the coming quarters, or has there been any change to, call it, end-user demand out in the field in certain countries? Thanks, guys.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Jon. I think this is more an internal execution issue of us dealing with our dealers versus the market per se. Having said that we were hopeful to get some bigger orders in some of the emerging markets this year and we will probably just backing off that we are making some progress in Brazil and places like that. We are probably being a little more cautious about as we go in but it's much more our own execution. And frankly, again, it's a small part of our business that we know as great potential. And we will realize it. But it's more than I think than anything external or macro that we would really point to. It could be macro but we are not going to look to say it's that. I think the opportunity is still there.","Operator","And we will go next to Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So maybe one on --","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Vijay.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, Steve. One on breast imaging and I'm sorry to sort of pick on this, but the dealer issues that you are having in international sort of what gives us the confidence or visibility that this is a short-term issue? And it looks like the U.S. growth slowed down sequentially. So I'm just wondering if you can give us some color on what happened U.S. versus OUS.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. Two pieces. I think first off the U.S., we continued to feel really, really good. I mean, obviously, the growth rate Vijay what you pointed out will be slowing down as we were going against some monster comps especially when we come into the second half of this year, but really already from here on. We are now going in against much tougher comps from here guys. We are still growing the business but we are not going to be putting 20% growth rates up on top off strong growth rates from year ago. The outside of the U.S., I look at this folks, it just like every other issue we faced since we came to the company. We are not the perfectly well-oiled machine. I think we are making a little bit of progress, having made the progress that I would like to see. And it's just a matter of better execution which is something we know how to do. And it just requires a little greater focus than probably what I was providing.","Vijay Kumar","Great. And then, one follow-up on diagnostics. I mean clearly, this was a monster diagnostic quarter. And it is U.S. business, you grew high singles. It feels like you are clearly gaining share. Can you provide some color on what is going on and how sustainable is the share gain, right? Because when you look at sort of the Aptima franchise, I mean those are some pretty big product lines and pretty mature. So I am just wondering why this business is so strong and what is going on. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. Vijay, I think it's been the hidden piece and back to a focus on execution where we've clearly been a little more focused in the U.S. But our team has been continuing to place Panthers, continuing to speak to the benefits that our products bring and obviously, you know us well enough to know we are not one of these out there trumpeting, gee, we are number one. We beat this person. We got this competitive win. But quietly we are really proud of what we've done on the HPV franchise in the U.S. and combined with cytology, combined with the co-testing message, combined with Panther placements. They are all -- no one thing is magic. But when you systematically pile them up it provides a very nice outlook and has us feel pretty good, this is -- this strength is going to continue.","Operator","And we will go next to Derik de Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good afternoon.","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Derik.","Derik de Bruin","A lot of the questions have been asked, but let me just do a couple here. So can you talk a little bit about the contribution to services for the breast health business? I know it is going to be more of an impact on the business going forward as some of those systems sort of that you placed earlier now start -- people have to start paying for service contracts. Can we think about instrument placements versus services and how it goes in the mix?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think we feel pretty obviously the service revenue in the quarter was not as strong as the overall product revenue. But that will be a great kicker as basically every system for the most part in the second year is when those will kick in. And we will say this. We are seeing a higher attach rate on the 3D service revenue contracts than we did on 2D. So a) it's a little bit higher. So I think it's sort of one of those pieces that will kick in and we feel very good about for the future. And the team is doing a better job of actually selling service contracts today probably in a tougher environment than we ever have.","Bob McMahon","Yes. Just one other thing Derik just to kind of give you a little more color on that. While on total service when we looked at it for the total company only grew roughly kind of 2%, when you actually peel the onion back and look at the biggest component of that, which is our domestic U.S. mammography business that grew in the mid single digits which is consistent with what we have been talking about as that business with that high attach rate, higher ASP relative to the service contracts on the lower ASP 2D. So we continue to feel good about that business.","Derik de Bruin","Just a little clarification for me on this. So why was the 2D attachment rate on services so low historically?","Steve MacMillan","Well, it wasn't -- well -- it was extremely high and we are going from an extremely high level to actually any -- even extremely higher level. It was well into the 80% and we are doing even better than --","Bob McMahon","Yes, 85-plus percent.","Steve MacMillan","Yes.","Operator","And we will go next to Mark Massaro of Canaccord Genuity.","Mark Massaro","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the good quarter.","Steve MacMillan","Thanks Mark.","Mark Massaro","I wanted to ask, you acknowledge that you have seen some bundling from some of the competition in breast health and meanwhile you've also stated that you gained share. I was wondering if you could just talk about the dynamics internationally. Is the bundling occurring more frequently internationally than it is in the U.S., and can you just help us understand some of the pressures you saw internationally in context of gaining market share?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. I think it's less bundling internationally than it still the stage of development internationally. We've not done nearly as good a job of selling the benefits of 3D. Just on government affair standpoint from a marketing standpoint, a lot of what we've going in the U.S., we were doing a great job of internationally because where through dealers. We have not worked with them closely enough to really segment the market. We started it, obviously, there is a lot of opportunities for 2D. We need to do that but we had so much focus on 3D and I don't think we've just done as good job of fully marketing it through. So that's a part of the whole issue of consolidating the international business under Eric. We kind of I set it up, when I first got here to have Eric really focus on the U.S., Claus focus internationally. It probably led to two silos more than sharing the learning across the geographies and frankly I feel like it's done a great job overall. But, it -- we probably left a little bit on the table related to our international development. So now, Eric is on the case and here we go.","Mark Massaro","Maybe a little outside the box here, but would you consider identifying countries in Europe where you could go direct in the breast health side in particular?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. We are looking at it everywhere as to what's really the best model. And that will be something I think you can expect us to report back on over time. I would tell you there is a lot more complexity to it all in that candidly in a number of geographies, we had given the marketing authorizations to the dealers. So the dealers actually own the marketing authorizations, which is not something you would typically expect of a company this size. But a) it's one of these, you go into the onion and peel it back a little more, more work to be done, which is why, we just think it's going to take us a little bit longer. I kind of viewed it as, it would be a great thing to have in the out years when things slow down in the U.S., we probably aren't getting there as fast as I would like to but we will probably end up getting there at a time that would be ultimately actually pretty well timed for the total company.","Operator","And we only have time for one more question. And we will take our final question from Jason Bedford of Raymond James.","Jason Bedford","Thanks for squeezing me in. I will ask two questions that require one word answers, so we can keep it within an hour here.","Steve MacMillan","Right Jason.","Jason Bedford","So what was the installed base of Genius at the end of the quarter? And then, what are the -- what's your latest thoughts on gross margin expectations for 2016? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Higher and higher. Yes. We're not getting --","Jason Bedford","Any better words than that, Steve?","Steve MacMillan","You asked for one word answer Jason. As a reminder, we're only going to give the placement numbers on an annual basis rather than getting into quarterly pieces but we were very pleased with the additional placements of certainly the Genius systems, frankly, Panthers as well looking into our diagnostics business.","And then, gross margin I think, we are basically guiding to, we think there was a 100 basis points of improvement year-over-year. And feeling very encouraged by that opportunity.","Jason Bedford","Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Great. Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today.

My name is [Rene] and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Mike Watts","Thank you, Rene. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks; then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website, we also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of the call will be archived on our website through May 27.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known as well as unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation from GAAP can be found in our earnings release.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Steve MacMillan","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We posted very good results overall, highlighted by 14.6% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. The strength of our business model was evident on three levels in the quarter. First, our U.S. businesses grew revenue at a low double digit rate continuing a recent pattern of outstanding commercial execution.","Second, we again improved both gross and operating margins while making significant investments in our future and third we entered a new phase of our capital allocation strategy by repurchasing our common stock while continuing to pay down our convertible notes. Together, these strategic actions drove EPS growth more than double the rate of sales.","More specifically, domestic revenue increased 10.6% in the quarter, led by strong performances by our breast health and surgical businesses. International sales were lower mainly due to expected declines in blood screening and the discontinued products we discussed in our initial guidance.","But international breast health showed signs of stabilization which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment. Globally, total revenues grew 5.8% on a reported basis or 6.3% in constant currency terms and if we would exclude the headwind from discontinued products second quarter revenue would have increased more than 7% in constant currency.","Non-GAAP gross margin was 65.8% in the quarter, a significant improvement of 240 basis points compared to the prior year period. We reinvested much of this incremental profitability for future growth and will continue to do so in the future. But still increased non-GAAP operating margin to 33.9% in the quarter, 40 basis points higher than last year.","At the same time our strong cash flows enabled us to be opportunistic in buying back our common as well as our convertible debt to continue improving our capital structure into enhanced future earnings power. Bob will cover the details in a moment, but net income represented a very robust 19.6% of sales and grew 14.1% while non-GAAP EPS totaled $0.47 up 14.6% compared to the prior year.","With that introduction and overview out of the way, I\u2019d like to cover five subjects in my comments today. The first two have been topical over the last quarter, our domestic and international breast health businesses and obviously these franchisees will continue to be important to our future as well. But as we write new chapters in the Hologic story, but this course is broadening as we build on our successes and add new strategic tools. With that in mind, today I\u2019d like to highlight our surgical business, gross margin improvement opportunities and the research and development pipeline. Hopefully this discussion will provide a little incremental color into the multiple levers we can pull to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth overtime.","Let\u2019s start with our domestic breast health business which grew a very solid 11.2% based on continued adoption of our Genius 3D mammography. Genius placements were strong, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year and we saw a good increase in service revenue as well. We continue to gain market share and our investments in customer marketing are enabling us to do that while maintaining stable price amidst fierce competition. As a result, domestic imaging sales grew at a healthy mid teens rate.","We believe we still have runway ahead of us as our 3D Systems are only about a third penetrated into our own installed base, and roughly 20% into the market as a whole. We remain confident in the long term opportunity as customer interest and orders inhouse remain high and as clinical evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologics exams for patients and physicians, specifically a longitudinal study published in February in the peer-reviewed JAMA Oncology showed that the benefits of our Genius exams [Indiscernible] and improved cancer detection can be sustained and even improved overtime with consecutive years.","In addition, a separate study published just yesterday in JAMA showed that these benefits hold true for women with both Dense and Nondense Breasts. Further bolstering the case for widespread adoption.","Now let\u2019s turn to our international breast health business which generated a lot of attention last quarter. While we still have a significant amount of work to do here, we did signs of stabilization in the second quarter and are optimistic that we will see further signs of progress and predictability in the quarters ahead.","While revenue declined by low single digits on a constant currency basis in the second quarter, it\u2019s important to note that last year\u2019s results benefitted from sales of products that he had since discontinued. If we back out this headwind international breast health sales would have increased at a mid single digit rate in constant currency, a materially better performance than a decline we saw last quarter.","As always, business improvement starts with people and our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton has made several important organizational changes internationally in recent months. We moved one of our key U.S. breast health leaders to Europe and he is now in charge of building stronger, mutually productive relationships with our dealer network. Towards that end we had signed several new, performance based contracts with our top dealers. In addition, we have hired a new European Head of Service, which we have identified as a critical role to support our dealers and direct customers. We also have brought our new leaders of marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory, so the team is coming together nicely.","Now let me turn to those three new topics surgical, gross margins and R&D. Lets cover surgical first. Global sales were $90.9 million in the quarter and grew 15.9% in constant currency. Surgical has exemplified the tremendous commercial turnaround that has occurred at Hologic with the second quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in the United States.","It wasn\u2019t too long ago that Surgical was viewed as a non-strategic asset that should be divested. Today, however, surgical is a vibrant business with strong profitability and cash flow plus good growth potential and I couldn\u2019t be proud of the team who has made it happen. Their formula for success has been straightforward. Stabilization of our NovaSure franchise which was declining at a high single digit rate only a couple of years ago, combined with excellent growth from our MyoSure products for [Uterine] and fibroid removal.","We remain enthusiastic about the potential for MyoSure as we seek to expand the addressable market and replace older treatments. And now with the market withdrawal of our competitor to NovaSure we have an opportunity to drive material growth for that product as well. We believe that NovaSure sales benefitted from the competitive recall by a few million dollars in the quarter and we are investing in marketing and physician outreach programs to ensure this continues for the balance of the year.","The second topic I want to cover is our ability to improve gross margins. A year ago, we weren\u2019t overly bullish in this regard, but our operations team deserves a tremendous amount of credit for improving upon already strong profitability. To highlight what we\u2019ve been able to achieve in the second quarter, non-GAAP cost of goods sold for our products was lower, in absolute terms than it was in the prior year period, despite an increase in sales. This is far bigger than a mix shift story. It is reflecting tremendous work by our teams. To make this possible, new leadership is instituted productivity improvement targets for each of our plants and local managers have responded with scores of specific projects. We are closing our Bedford facility, our former corporate headquarters and moving the skeletal manufacturing that was done there to a contract manufacturer. And as we have discussed previously we are doing a much better job of leveraging our corporate purchasing power across the business.","The third area I want to discuss is our research and development pipeline and it\u2019s important to begin with a bit of context. The unfortunate truth is that our R&D pipeline was weak, reflecting years of a growth by acquisition mindset. Too often R&D spending was viewed as a plug in the income statement. The amount that was left over while attempting to meet short term financial goals.","To reverse this mentality we have been adding talent and rebuilding processes across the company to make R&D a driver of sustainable growth again. Although this process is far from complete, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. In diagnostics for example, we now have a robust menu of molecular assays available on Panther in Europe spanning women\u2019s health as well as virology.","Recently we have secured CE-marks for new tests for HIV-1, Hepatitis-C, Hepatitis-B and a sexually transmitted disease called Mycoplasma genitalium. In the United States we are already the leader in women\u2019s health. We have filed the pre market approval application for our HIV viral load asset. And the PMA for our hepatitis C Assay is scheduled to be submitted late this calendar year.","Finally, our Panther fusion platform which will provide customers the flexibility to perform PCR testing in a single unit dose format is on track to be introduced internationally next year. In surgical we are now in the process of launching a line extension called MyoSure, Reach.","MyoSure, Reach increases clinical utility by providing surgeons the access to polyps and fibroids in more areas of the uterus. And we believe that will play an important role in extending our leadership position in the field.","Finally in breast health we are excited about two new biopsy products that will further build on our positions as the innovative leader in the market. Our new 3D enabled Affirm prone biopsy system was introduced in Europe in March and is being launched domestically now. Affirm represents the first real innovation in the biopsy space in roughly 20 years and leverages our growing installed base of Genius systems by enabling physicians to perform a more accurate biopsy using 3D technology.","To further enhance our biopsy business, we expect to launch an entirely new biopsy tool in Brevera next year. Brevera has break through potential as it allows real time analysis of the biopsy sample, thereby vastly improving the patient experience. Stay tuned for more information on this.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with our second quarter financial results which in some ways opened a new chapter in the Hologic story. As in recent quarters, our commercial teams generated robust growth in the United States. At the same time, we generated operating leverage through productivity improvements while simultaneously investing for the future. And we boosted our bottom line performance by opportunistically deploying capital. All-in-all a solid well rounded performance.","Now I will hand the call over to Bob.","Bob McMahon","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I am going to highlight our other divisional sales drivers and some key financial metrics and then wrap up with our updated financial guidance for 2016.","Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Overall, we had a strong second quarter, with double digit growth in the U.S. in addition three of our four businesses demonstrated global growth in the quarter.","Steve already discussed breast health and surgical, so I will focus on diagnostics and skeletal. Diagnostics our largest business reported sales of $304.4 million in the second quarter, growing 3.2% in constant currency terms. We are pleased to report another positive quarter in our cytology and perinatal business which generated $116.1 million in sales growing 3.5% in constant currency.","U.S. sales grew mid single digits which was by far our highest growth in several years, even with lingering headwinds from path interval expansions.","Turning to molecular diagnostics we posted sales of $126.1 million up 5.8% in constant currency. Domestic sales increased at a faster rate as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins.","In addition, utilization in sales of our assays for Trichomonas, HPV chlamydia, gonorrhoea continue to grow. Internationally, we had another solid quarter of Panther placements. This keeps us optimistic about our future growth potential in Europe, where we now have a full menu of women\u2019s health and viral load assays as Steve mentioned.","In blood screening, worldwide revenue of $62.2 million decreased 2.4% in constant currency as expected. While there were some geography shifts as our partner Grifols balanced inventory, the overall decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior year period to support the rollout of our business with the Japanese Red Cross.","We do continue to see however trends towards lower blood utilization worldwide and therefore anticipate that quarterly blood screening sales will settle in the mid $50 million range as the market and customer usage patterns mature.","In skeletal health, we had $22.2 million in global sales, a decline of 8.2% in constant currency. Domestically, sales increased at a low single digit rate, but international sales were negatively affected by distributor ordering patterns. Because this business is so small, it is not uncommon to see these kinds of fluctuations and we do expect that skeletal will be a solid contributor to growth overtime.","Now let me switch gears and discuss operating expenses in the second quarter. Total expenses of $221.2 million increased 12.9% mainly as a result of our continued investment in breast health and diagnostic marketing programs along with the timing of R&D program which we foreshadowed last quarter.","This increase in spending which will continue into the second half of the year is planned and deliberate, and the key component of our strategy to generate long term sustainable growth. Two factors contribute to our willingness to support these incremental investments, first and most importantly we see good returns on the specific projects we are pursuing. For example, our investments in consumer marketing for Genius are enabling us to gain market share while maintaining stable price in the face of new competition.","Second, we already have an industry leading operating margin and have shown that we can and will increase this margin overtime, but our goal is not to drive operating margin to unprecedented levels for our industry, instead we want to steadily improve them while also investing in appropriately in DCF positive projects for long term growth.","At the same time, our goal is to allocate capital to enhance shareholder returns and during the second quarter, we accelerated our efforts in this regard. For the last few years our primary use of excess cash has been to pay down debt and our long standing goal of reduction net debt to 2.5 times EBITDA by the end of 2017 remains in effect.","As evidence of this, we spent $311.4 million in the second quarter to repurchase convertible notes with the principle value of $226.6 million. While our convertible debt totaled over $1.3 billion in principal less than 12 months ago, it is now down to $793.3 million a reduction of more than $0.5 billion. And given the continuing strength of our cash flows we are in a position to supplement debt reduction with opportunistic repurchases of our common stock.","Specifically in the second quarter, we brought back 4.3 million shares of our stock for $148.8 million. While stock buy backs have always been part of our long term plan, market weakness in the second quarter enabled us to pounce a little earlier than expected.","These strategic actions enabled us to sequentially reduce our share count in the second quarter, the first time in a long while that our diluted share count declined. In fact, diluted shares outstanding or 288 million were basically flat compared to the prior year period no longer diluting EPS growth, specially non-GAAP EPS increased 14.6% about 2.5 times the rate of sales.","Let me just emphasize that our debt reduction and buy back activities will not prohibit us from seeking other opportunities for tuck in acquisitions. Our business development teams are settling in and while no transactions are eminent, we are actively evaluating opportunities across our businesses.","Before I move on to guidance, let me cover a few other financial metrics from the second quarter. Improvements made to our balance sheet contributed to a total debt outstanding of $3.4 billion a decrease of 534.1 million compared to a year ago and net debt of 3.1 billion.","Our leverage ratio net debt over EBITDA now stands at 3.1 times. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $253.8 million up 6.4% compared to the prior year period. In addition, our trailing 12-month EBTIDA surpassed $1 billion this quarter, a nice milestone for the company.","Our ability to generate strong profits while lowering debt has again allowed us to increase return on invested capital. As our second fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 170 basis point improvement over the prior year.","Finally let\u2019s turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and third quarter. Starting with the full year, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance by $10 million to reflect the solid performance in the first half of the year. We now expect reported revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.83 billion in fiscal 2016 representing reported growth of 3.9% to 4.6%.","Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to constant currency growth of between 4.6% and 5.4%. Compared to our last guidance, there are a few puts and takes related to revenue. On the positive side, the market withdrawal of a competing surgical product should provide a tailwind to NovaSure and the dollar has weakened slightly.","The currency benefit for us is less than you might expect however since much of the dollar weakening has been relative to Japanese Yen and other currencies where we have minimal exposure. In terms of headwinds we are more cautious on near term blood screening revenue given macro trends in the market and we do risk our international forecast slight","I should also mention we have made the voluntary decision to stop selling CF InPlex our test for cystic fibrosis due to manufacturing quality issues at a key component supplier that recently resulted in a recall. This will represent a headwind of several million dollars to our U.S. molecular diagnostics revenue in the second half of the year but shouldn\u2019t have much effect on margins.","In terms of earnings for the full year we now expect EPS of between $1.89 and $1.91 which translates to reported growth between 13.2% and 14.4% or constant currency growth of 14.6% to 15.8% this is based on the effective tax rate of approximately 33% and diluted shares outstanding of roughly $292 million for the full year.","As we work through your models you will see that our increased EPS guidance implies a healthy expansion of already industry leading operating margins while accommodating increased investment, specifically we intend to continue investing behind our Genius campaign in breast health and cervical cancer co-testing and diagnostics.","We will aggressively fund the commercial activities to launch important new products such as our Affirm prone biopsy system and capitalize on the competitive investment environment surrounding NovaSure.","We also expect to make some key hirers in our international business which typically comes in with initial sign in cost for relocation and the like. And we are pursuing some entirely new R&D initiatives such as developing a blood screening test for the Zika virus while also seeking out opportunities to accelerate R&D timelines for existing initiatives for example by increasing the breadth of outside support.","Not all of these investments are permanent in nature, but we do expect them to push operating expenses upward in the second half of the year. At the same time however, our capital deployment activities are effectively offsetting the impact of the strategic investments on the bottom line.","Now turning to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues of $695 million to $705 million. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects a reported growth of 0.2% to 1.6% or 0.6% to 2% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, these lower growth rates are due to a much tougher comparable in the prior year period when revenue jumped almost $40 million on a sequential basis.","In terms of the bottom line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 to $0.48 in the third quarter. This represent continued strong growth of 9.3% to 11.6% on a reported basis was 10.1 to 12.4 in constant currency terms.","Our full year guidance obviously implies the sequential step up in the fourth quarter revenue. This is due to normal sequential business momentum that we expect contributions from new product launches and the timing of some royalty revenue that is expected later this year.","Before opening up the call for questions, I would like to reiterate that our view on the second quarter is one of a good multi level execution. Revenue grew at a solid rate based on continued outperformance domestically and stabilization outside the United States. We improved already strong operating margins while accommodating increased investment in key growth drivers.","In our capital deployment activities helped to pay for these investments at the EPS line while setting the stage for leveraged growth over the long term. Now that we are half way through our fiscal year we are optimistic about our full year forecast. We are anticipating solid, mid single digit revenue growth in line with our original expectations as strength in the U.S. offsets the weakness we have seen internationally.","We forecast solid expansion of operating margins while simultaneously investing for the future. And we expect the acceleration of our capital redeployment activities to allow us to leverage operating gains all the way down to EPS which should grow at a mid teens rate.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus or related follow up and return to the queue. Operator we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Isaac.","Isaac Ro","Hey, Steve. I wanted to start with the outlook in the ex-U.S. business and specifically understand kind of what's embedded in your outlook for this quarter. You obviously made some changes to the team there as you pointed out. I'm curious if you talk a little about how the changes in the team will justifies with just the operating environment and just that we understand the guidance little better?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I would say, still very conservative near term, because we started the signal about this time last year. The deeper we dug into international, international for context is really much more of a start-up than a turnaround. We've got our three franchises across the geographies and so what Eric is really doing in part of what specific data, the changes we need to really build out a team not just get a team that was in place operating differently, and so Eric is really going out.","We're already recruiting and bringing in different people, different leaders, but it\u2019s going to take that \u2013 that's going to more a 2017, 2018 event, I think, and really we're thinking about international as drivers in especially frankly 2018, 2019, 2020 and not as focused on the near term. So I think the near term is pretty cautious and conservative. But it will be coming through right when we need it.","Isaac Ro","Got it. That's helpful. May be second question would be on [Indiscernible], just curious if you could update us on what you've learned about the nature of the products like here in terms of the pace and magnitude of adoption. You've given us some color for last couple of quarter, but curious on update there, especially if you put in context with the [Indiscernible] study earlier this week and then just what you're seeing in terms of how effectively your customers are able to get reinvestment and all that. Just an update on how that's going.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. I think if you go back two years and I described at the time we probably saw a building a freight train, clearly I think the combination of better reimbursement and especially our consumer marketing efforts and our sales efforts really dramatically accelerated that. And instead of a freight train, it definitely look for like an aeroplane I think taking off.","And you saw that especially as you know in our third quarter last year when you starting really positing this 20% growth numbers. I think what we see is we still feel very good about the order trends and about frankly the biggest piece I think we're incredibly excited about is the way we're holding pricing. And the demand still looks very good, having said that we're going against obviously now as we go into this third quarter, we're going against the huge comps and therefore again as we try to signal of last year that the absolute growth rate will probably be slower here for the U.S. breast health business, as certainly as we into the coming quarters, but I think still feeling really good, that there is a lot of runway ahead and I think when we talk to investors I think people often think there's going to be a peak in that huge trough. I think we're seeing it is probably would be much more of a Plato, whereas we hit a peak, but there is still a lot of runway that should have us last for quite a while here.","Bob McMahon","Hey, Isaac, this is Bob. Just a follow-up on what Steve is saying. The numbers where we expected them to be and what I would say is also in terms of the placements where we're not going to get specific number, it was up sequentially as we expected and also up versus prior year. So we feel continued good about our continued adoption in driving that business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Groberg with UBS.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, John.","Jonathan Groberg","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on a solid quarter and hitting on all these important themes. I guess there is two questions from me both on the molecular diagnostics front. One, can you maybe talk about [Indiscernible] kind of what you're seeing and some of the key test there both in the U.S. and internationally, I think you specifically mentioned you'd had some pretty uptake on the menu and panther in Europe.","And then two, if you just clarify Bob on the cystic fibrosis test that you're exiting, are you exiting or is it just a recaller, because of the recaller you are now exiting that business and was that a few million dollars on an annual basis, was that kind of be the headwind? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. Actually it\u2019s going to be a few, we are exiting it. I'll take your second question first [gap audio] we are exiting it permanently and it will be a few million just in the second half of the year, so it would be larger than that on an annual basis. It\u2019s roughly a $10 million annual number, annual product. So we'll absorb that.","And then in terms of the test, I think we feel really good about the continued uptake of both the full menu in the U.S. and starting to see some encouraging signs on the update of the menu in Europe, but again we wanted to be very careful, making sure we're not declaring victory until we start to string together a number of quarters. But I think we're starting to see some better panther placement. We have a new leader of molecular business in Europe who actually came later last year and so he starting to get his traction and driving its. So I think feeling pretty good about where that business should be going. ","Bob McMahon","And I think we continue feel good about gaining share here in U.S. as well and across the major assets that we have. We start breaking up and track all the things. We're seeing growth, nice growth really across each of the asset.","Jonathan Groberg","Could you just maybe comment on annual consumable run rate, is it increasing in panther, where we are in terms of the annual utilization?","Steve MacMillan","We spoke Jonathan, we mentioned 170,000 on a worldwide basis last quarter and its actually increased from there, this year. And the U.S. being higher than that in terms of the average sell for panther. And I think I give you the highest level how we're feeling about the diagnostics business right now.","We're incredibly [Indiscernible] with what's [Indiscernible] is going, remember that was a really ugly situation just couple of years ago that business is now clearly flattens to modest growth, molecular is looking good and blood screening is probably a little bit behind, you know blood screening and that's the one we don't control the commercial channel on. We're seeing probably greater inventory reductions, certainly than what we expect in start of the year and we're absorbing it based on the strength in the parts of the business. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Hey. Bob wondering if you can maybe comment on gross margins, you guys were about 150 basis points of what we've been modeling. Just wondering how much of this is function of mix versus maybe some of the operational improvements and what should we expect for our gross margins going forward?","Bob McMahon","Yes. So we're not going to give a specific target on gross margin going forward, Tycho, but what I would say is, it is an element of geography mix, product mix and productivity. Actually geography mix is the smallest component of that, roughly about 25% of that improvement was due to geography. And the rest being the product and productivity and what I would say it is probably equally split between those two.","And we feel good about our continued improvement there with the initiatives that Steve talked about across all of the functions of our business, our operations team are really executing well and identifying opportunities to continue to improve efficiencies and obviously as our sales growth drives more units to the factory that also helps us well.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Then question for Steve. I know you get a lot of questions on managing kind of the tomo cliff. And just wondering with the pipeline components you've laid out today plus the service business, which you guys continue to highlight do you feel like you've got enough of a line of sight that that's going to be kind of a smooth transition. And if not can you maybe just touch on capital deployment. I mean you talked more about buybacks today, but how do you view the opportunity set? And then do you need to rely on tuck-ins to effectively manage the tomo cliff when that comes?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Tycho. First I'm going to try to dissuade you from using the cliff because we've been working very hard to make sure that it won't be a cliff, and I'd say that in all seriousness. We've been very focused on what happened with the 2D curve and everything else and by thinking about how we extend out and do some line extensions and other things that's been a huge part of our focus to be able to have more of a plateau or very soft decline in that segment of the business at some point in time as suppose to real cliff. I think it\u2019s part of what we have coming things in biopsy and frankly people [entities] running that business for us. It\u2019s a longer track record being about to put even some singles and double on the board in addition to just the every home or every five or eight year home run that we've tended to have in this business.","So I would tell you I'm feeling incrementally better every time Bob and I and Eric Compton are down meeting with that business on what's happening in their pipeline and we'll talk more and more about that certainly in the coming quarters and years. But I think we're feeling better about being able to mitigate that.","To the other piece, I just want to jump even though your question on margin to Bob, because I was very adamant early on when I came was probably not expecting much margin expansion. This has been one of the very positive surprises to me. And I think the big piece that I want to be clear on is, we're going to use a lot of this gross margin expansion to continue to invest into the business which leads to the second part of your follow-up question there, which is as we go forth we are certainly spending more on R&D, more in marketing and it will allow to do tuck-in acquisitions based on the cash generation.","And so I think we're really opening up a new leg in the store, where we got more levers available to us than we did two years ago. Two years ago we were so hamstrung with the debt and the converts and everything else. We didn't have really an ability to potentially manage, because as we all know we're going to see some ups and downs in the rate of sales growth. We're going to continue to grow. We're going to have some periods that will be a little bit slower while we wait for the next new products to come through. I think we're feeling better and better that we're going to be able to deliver very strong earnings growth consistently and in the periods when we are growing faster we\u2019ll probably reinvest a little bit more in the periods that are slower, we may not have quite the accelerated investments in that type. So hopefully that starts to give a little more of a longer term view of what we are thinking about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays","Jack Meehan","Hi, thanks good afternoon. I just wanted to ask kind of little bit more granularity on the blood screening business and what you are seeing the market today and I think I caught a mid $50 million number you referenced. Just, what is the trajectory of that business look like over the next maybe three to six quarters?","Steve MacMillan","I think it\u2019s going to be slightly down. I think if we look Jack at the global market, let\u2019s take it by U.S. The U.S. clearly hospitals are getting better and better at managing their inventory at minimally invasive surgery at being able to limit their use of blood. So I think we are forecasting that the U.S. is a slight decliner. This quarter, our U.S. business was actually up fairly significantly in blood that was more an inventory correction, but I think the way we are thinking about it is this is a low single digit decliner. Internationally, I think we see the business very slight grower, but globally I think because of the declines in the U.S. we think about blood screening as a flattish to slightly down business. And that\u2019s -- you go back to the headwinds we had as a company facing us a years ago it was blood, it was NovaSure, it is MyoSure. I\u2019m sorry; it was blood, NovaSure and ThinPrep. The two that we control the commercial channel feel great about changing the long term trajectory. I don\u2019t think we are quite as ready to declare a change in the trajectory of blood screening.","Then I think the other thing that\u2019s important to note Jack there is this is a macro trend, we are not [losing gap] contracts, we have not lost any contracts. We are the market leader so as the market goes, so goes our business and I think that\u2019s important to say that we continue to feel good about continuing to secure the contracts that we have and this is more a utilization factor as opposed to loosing contracts to competitors.","Jack Meehan","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one on Panther, the incremental Panthers that you are placing in the field now, I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s the mix of the customers look like, is it existing customers adding capacity, is it new customers, how much of a driver has been year up, any additional detail will be great. Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Yes it\u2019s a bit of both in terms of existing and newer and to some degree it\u2019s starting to go [Indiscernible] slightly smaller accounts. We\u2019ve penetrated most of the large ones and part of this is we look at our menu of the future and what we have coming we realize if we can get a few more Panthers placed even in midsize accounts, hospital labs other reference labs that\u2019s going to benefit us as well. And frankly, Panther has got a pretty good footprint for OUS, but we\u2019re never really put the resources behind it and so we are starting to place a few more internationally especially in Europe right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Chris Lin","Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking the question.","Bob McMahon","Sure.","Chris Lin","Bob, can you help us walk through the bridge for the EPS guidance. Our math suggests that just the share count reduction relative to the prior guidance should get you about $0.03 of benefit increase EPS by $0.02 at the midpoint. And this was despite AP this quarter. I guess the question is, are you changing any other operating investment or assumptions that would impact EPS growth?","Bob McMahon","So your math is very similar to our math. We calculate that the change in share count calculates about $0.03. We\u2019ve raised the midpoint $0.02 and we talked about the increased investment that we plan to make and are going to be delivered about making in both R&D and marketing in the second half of the year. And that\u2019s essentially the math that you should be able to walk through. We are expecting higher operating expenses in the second half as a result of the benefits that we are seeing in those to generate long term sustainable growth both in R&D and marketing. And so we are taking some of that benefit and reinvesting into the business.","Steve MacMillan","Yes Chris to add to that is if you think about it we grew EPS about 14ish percent last year at the high end of the range this year it\u2019s going to be another 14 on top of 14. There\u2019s a point at which you don\u2019t want to go too far because we are thinking about this over the long haul.","Chris Lin","Great. That's helpful. And hopefully I'm right on this but can you talk about the OUS cytology perinatal growth. It appears OUS growth for that business slowed on a sequential basis. Is this right, and what was the cause of this?","Steve MacMillan","Hey you are exactly right. I think we saw a little bit of inventory correction in China, primarily and I think we probably with some distributor changes and everything else there is a little more inventory probably in the channel there than what we had fully grasped. So I think it\u2019s a underlying consumption. It looks good, and I think we may have another quarter or so with a little bit of adjustment here and then probably be as Eric has dug in deeper and deeper we are getting better granularity, better visibility and I think it\u2019s more of a an inventory contraction issue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray","Bill Quirk","Great. Thanks. First question is timing around the Zika virus assay. I know you guys have one in development. I know one of your competitors has introduced it in the southern part of the country, but just kind of thinking about timing around that rollout and then I guess a second part of that question is, is the testing strategy here has been a little different than what we've seen historically, where it looks like we are doing region-by-region testing rather than the whole country. So I would love to hear your comments on those two? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Bill. On the first part, we\u2019ve been working very aggressively with both CDC and FDA on the topic and we should have a blood screening product via IND for use here in the coming months by early summer certainly by the peak mosquito, in time for mosquito season. We don\u2019t yet know exactly how the market is going to play out. We\u2019ve been through this script before with dengue and West Nile and not being quite sure clearly it does look like there is rationality to this and we are prepared with the various centers to be ready and responsive to what is needed to be done. And our primary focus initially is on blood screening. We are also and as part of the additional investment in the second half also looking on the diagnostic side of it as well that would be further out time wise.","Bill Quirk","Got it. And then just a real quick follow up. The PMA that was filed on HIV viral load, I'm assuming that happened during the quarter, can you give us any incremental color there?","Steve MacMillan","It will be; excuse me\u2026","Bill Quirk","And then about -- just about a 12 month turnaround time on that, guys?","Steve MacMillan","Yes -- so HIV has been filed in recent months and for a PMA we typically assume about a year.","Bill Quirk","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Steve MacMillan","Hey Vijay.","Vijay Kumar","Hi guys.","Steve MacMillan","Why don\u2019t [Indiscernible] Boston Scientific headline today by the way.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you, Steve. I'll make sure I have a better one for you guys. Just maybe turning to -- this is the guidance. And when you look at the 3Q to 4Q sort of ramp, can you just explain to me, Steve or Bob your comfort on sort of the -- it just seems to be 3Q to 4Q it seems to be slightly higher than sort of the QoQ ramp?","Bob McMahon","Yes hi Vijay, this is Bob. Obviously the sequential spike is greater when you are modeling at the top of the guidance range, so I would suggest that you model kind of to the midpoint. But it\u2019s driven by our confidence in sequential growth of 3D, that\u2019s a big piece of it as well as the other businesses. So the impact of our new product launch is such as the Affirm biopsy which had been built into our plan. The -- some of the growth in the NovaSure business as you recall that would be strong there and then we also have some royalty revenue that shows up in our molecular diagnostics business in the fourth quarter again which we had anticipated this year.","Vijay Kumar","Great. And maybe one last big picture question for Steve on cap deployment. I saw that you guys took out the convert in the queue. I'm just curious at what point do you feel, Steve, comfortable on maybe deploying capital for M&A versus lowering the debt load?","Steve MacMillan","Yes we are ready and willing to spend there on M&A and actually we did make an acquisition of our own stock in the quarter. That was actually a pretty good acquisition that we made and we are feeling pretty good about that. The teams are definitely looking and where Bob and Eric and I are now reviewing on a more regular basis ideas. We also just looked and so we will not let it get in the way. Ultimately I look forward to the day that we have no converts left on the balance sheet, but I would suspect we will be doing some acquisitions along the way while we continue to clean those up. So, still in the way at this point in time still focusing the division on what we call bite size, things that supplement the existing businesses and we are very willing and ready to go, but I would say as Bob said in his script nothing eminent wouldn\u2019t even necessarily expect any, anything much in this fiscal year necessarily. So we thought mop up some share as well that the market gave us a nice opportunity.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Hey guys thanks for taking the question. Seeing, if we can get maybe a little bit more granular on Genius. If we use the airplane analogy, when do you guys think that you will level off at 35,000 feet in other words, I mean is it -- do you think you have -- through sometime through 2017. Do you think it's a longer ramp than that, anything that you can help us triangulate on, on when you hit that plateau?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. It probably is 17 at some point in 17 and we have thought originally it would have been 18 or beyond I think the success and the faster climb. We are getting to 35,000 feet faster probably a good year faster than I would have imagined, but I think we\u2019ll definitely be able to stay up there for a while.","Brian Weinstein","Okay, and then\u2026","Steve MacMillan","I think we are starting to think 17 is probably it.","Brian Weinstein","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you and then on the repurchases, can you remind me do you have anything in your covenants that restrict the repurchase amounts that you have. And what your current authorization is for share repurchases? Thanks.","Bob McMahon","Yes hey Brian this is Bob. We have currently an authorization for 250 so we roughly have about 100 million at the end of the quarter. There is nothing significant in our covenants that would prohibit anything of that size and nature.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies Investments.","Raj Denhoy","Hi, good afternoon.","Steve MacMillan","Hey Raj.","Raj Denhoy","I wonder if I could explore this idea of you guys plateauing a bit in tomo. The guidance you gave for the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter sort of implies that that's happening, right? And when we think about 2017 though, is the growth that you've implied for the back half of the year which is something in the 2% to 3% range really what we should think about for the business until you get to this next product cycle whether it's in diagnostic or otherwise. Is that how we should think about the business over the next 12 to 18 months or so?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Ray. I think first up we are not quite plateaud yet. We are still implying some growth in the final couple of quarters but definitely much slower growth. And I do think we are preparing for 2017 it\u2019s going to be slower top line growth than where we\u2019ve been over the last four or five six quarters. I think just being pragmatic about it. And as part of the investments we are making today so that we know we can set ourselves up to continue to deliver frankly very healthy EPS growth even in what might be a slightly lower top line growth environment.","Raj Denhoy","But is something in that sort of 3ish percent range the way we should think about 2017 for you guys from a revenue growth standpoint?","Steve MacMillan","We are just not ready to get into pre announcing 2017 guidance at this point, but it certainly going to be lower than where it was, probably not a horrible number to use at this point in time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from [David Luis] with Morgan Stanley.","Scott Wang","Hi guys it\u2019s actually Scott in for David. Steve and Bob, I think guidance for this year implies comp adjusted stability into third quarter versus second quarter, and then kind of a sharp acceleration into the fourth quarter. Can you just give us an idea of what's driving that effect?","Steve MacMillan","Yes hey Scott, we -- in the fourth quarter we talked about continued growth in 3D sequentially. We also have the benefit, the continued benefit of some tailwinds around our NovaSure business with the competitive market withdrawal. And we have some royalty income that shows up in the fourth quarter as well as the new products, products like the Affirm prone biopsy cable that show up more in the fourth quarter than they do in the third quarter.","Scott Wang","Understood. And just a follow up I guess on the GYN surgical part on NovaSure, can you -- I think you so mentioned in your commentary earlier that the impact from the competitive recall was about $1 million to $2 million. Can you seize the opportunity from here? And do you expect kind of pro rata share going forward or a higher share going forward? Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","We will always expect a higher share. We don\u2019t have a completely great handle on exactly what that number would be going forward, but I can tell you we are just with our surgical team this week and they are having a lot of success, doing tremendous job on both NovaSure and MyoSure. It\u2019s clearly been one of the more positive upsides to the business. Again, if you look over the last two years where surgical was and where it\u2019s going we are feeling really good about the trajectory.","But that is -- that is one of the areas we are making incremental operating investments in to capture that, and so that\u2019s part of the second half in investments as well as the 3D Genius campaign and they are contesting in the marketing side on the diagnostics business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.","Steve MacMillan","Hey Derik.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good afternoon, how are you?","Steve MacMillan","All right.","Derik de Bruin","So in HPV, one of your competitors mentioned they've seen some share gains in the U.S. on their primary testing assay. Can you sort of comment on that. I mean, I obviously, your gains in cytology would suggest that your co-testing isn't suffering from this. So could you just talk about -- first of all I guess certainly share gains in the cytology market. And then just on the primary testing situation.","Steve MacMillan","Yes I think we are feeling pretty good about I mean ultimately the science on -- the science as well as many, probably some of the best. I think the science is very much on our side on co-testing and we feel very good about what we are seeing both on the cytology side and frankly on our HPV side. So, I don\u2019t -- we certainly don\u2019t see us loosing share on HPV.","Bob McMahon","No I would say both on HPV and ThinPrep Derik in the quarter grew above market.","Derik de Bruin","Great, that's helpful. And just one quick follow-up. I guess when you look at where you are in Panther placements versus the total addressable market, I mean how far would you say has Panther penetrated?","Steve MacMillan","Fifth or sixth [indiscernible] Derik in the U.S.","Derik de Bruin","In U.S. Great.","Steve MacMillan","In our earlier inning in U.S. And then [Indiscernible] we got to build the capabilities outside the U.S.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Newitter with Leerink Partners","Rich Newitter","Hi, thanks for taking the questions.","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Rich.","Rich Newitter","Hi, how are you? Just wanted to make sure that I had the buckets right for the moving parts on your constant currency guidance, and what went up and what's kind of good and what's bad -- or incrementally good and incrementally bad. So it sounds like the blood screen reduced outlook is call it, maybe $10 million in the back half. It's a bad guy. You didn't have FX, which is a good guy. If you could quantify that on some level or quantify each of these buckets that would be great.","It sounds like you have a little bit better of an outlook in GYN with a competitor off the market. So maybe incrementally better there. And then you also have the new MyoSure product, so that's the third bucket. That's a good guy. And then you said that you had a slightly weaker or more conservative OUS outlook, and I'd love to know just kind of where that factors in -- in magnitude relative to the blood screening which my math is getting to about $10 million incremental weakness.","Bob McMahon","Yes Rich, we are probably not going to give all that level of detailed \u2026","Steve MacMillan","Cause no matter what we do will be wrong, but\u2026","Bob McMahon","[Indiscernible] I think your numbers are not that far off. I would say the FX is probably a little smaller than you may estimate for others, because we do have about a little over a third of our international business is actually based in U.S. dollars. The other piece is the CF recall and market withdrawal that we mentioned before which is roughly we mentioned that that\u2019s a $10 million annual business, so think about that as roughly a $5 million headwind in the back half of the year.","Rich Newitter","Okay. And just the weaker OUS kind of -- or more conservative OUS outlook, is that separate from blood screening, or is that part of that?","Bob McMahon","Yes, it\u2019s a little different, but it\u2019s not that -- it\u2019s small. You captured the other big pieces.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block","Great, thanks and good afternoon. Steve, maybe the first one for you, and I get all the airplane analogies but at the end of the day, we are still in a tomo product cycle that's arguably 20% penetrated for the industry. If I look back, that's were sort of film to 2D at this massive inflation, and so I get the tough comps and maybe one in the plateau than the cliff word, but can you just talk to why the 2017 growth plateau in tomo? When again, arguably, when I look back, at least at the last product cycle that's really where you saw the incremental penetration start to take off?","Steve MacMillan","I think if you really look, we had such a positive inflection point in the third quarter last year, we're in that run up for right now. I think we would always rather be a little conservative on potentially preannounce the fundamental realities we're not totally sure. The dynamics are different than they were at that point in time from both competitive set as well as where hospital stand, everything else.","We do think there are probably some upside in private sector insurance that will continue to kick in as it plays out. And I think it\u2019s why we still feel really good about where it\u2019s going. But I think pragmatically we are picturing it as less of this incredible spike and probably just reaching kind of a new level where its continuing to increase slightly for a while and but not the 20% growth rates that we were getting for few quarters in a row.","Jon Block","Got it. Perfect. Then just one more. It\u2019s a little bit more granular, but international molecular, I know it's small, but were the revenues up year over year like the prior two quarters? And then just at a higher level, can you talk about what you are seeing with international molecular? You've got the viral load assays over there. Are you seeing that help sort of gain market share on the heels of some of those approvals? Thanks, guys.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. As a backdrop remember our international molecular business is still frankly weigh too small, so it was roughly flattish in the quarter. We're seeing some growth in Europe and I think that's where we really want to see the growth and probably its taking a little more of an opportunity. Still some fluctuations in some of the other smaller markets around the world, but I think what we expect over time is we're placing \u2013 we actually have started to really place some Panthers in Europe. I think we'll see that as Europe probably being the beachhead for building out that international molecular business, that also should start to provide some steadier growth and steadier foundation to the business to build out.","Fundamentally what we lacked in the company as a true foundational business for really any of our franchise that's outside the U.S. We had sales here and there from certain tenders but we haven't had the fundamental strength what you starting each quarter knowing you got a nice book of business that's automatically coming in. Even in the old days, we used to sell the Panthers instead of reagent rentals and things like that. So we are just trying to get a lot more disciplined to get a much healthier business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bedford with Raymond James.","Jason Bedford","Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to follow-up on the 3D discussion, do you think the lack of widespread private payer coverage is impacting the uptake of 3D? I've noticed that you guys have become more aggressive on the marketing side there.","Steve MacMillan","We don\u2019t think it\u2019s -- we feel pretty good about the uptake. And I think it\u2019s an incremental opportunity. I don\u2019t see we see it, we don\u2019t see it as a real barrier, we see it probably as additional upside.","Jason Bedford","Okay. And then just to follow up on the international build out, I realized that it's a long term initiative. But when do think, Steve you will have the team in place internationally?","Steve MacMillan","We\u2019ll have most of the team in place by the end of this fiscal year and we\u2019ve got a lot of the key team. We had quietly started to rebuild the team particularly in Europe late last year, that\u2019s when we brought the new molecular diagnostics leader in, the new service leader was hired in the last quarter. Our new breast health person over, so I think we feel pretty good about the team coming together by the end of this fiscal year and some of them are already hitting the ground and getting it. But it\u2019s definitely more of a 17,18,19 as we really get into the longer term planning. And we are really upsizing that team. We don\u2019t want just some quick wins for the sake of wins; we want it to be the enduring business because part of what we got in the last couple of years was the occasional big win but it didn\u2019t necessarily translated the ongoing business.","Mike Watts","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity","Mark Massaro","Hey guys thank you. So you noted that you are closing the Bedford, Mass, facility. Can you comment on timing and cost savings? And related to that, have you been able to realize any benefits related to optimizing your supply chain?","Steve MacMillan","Yes I think starting on the second part, optimizing the supply chain you are clearly seeing it in our gross margin. I think the part that might have gotten missed in my script and it was the part that probably shocked me the most when I was going through the financial for the quarter. Our absolute cost of goods is lower this year than last. So we are producing more product at less absolute money than last and that\u2019s clearly a result of some of the procurement and productivity initiatives that Mike Kelly, our supply chain leaders put in place under Bob McMahon\u2019s guidance and a lot of help from Eric Compton as well. The Bedford facility will be closing later this later, candidly it\u2019s going to have a fairly minimal impact on the true P&L because it\u2019s the least facility and we are stuck with a bunch of lease costs and other stuff in there. But it\u2019s -- we are still just doing a lot of cleaning up through the company and we\u2019ve consistently said we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the last couple of years and there is still a lot of opportunity ahead to be better on so many fronts.","Mark Massaro","Thank you. Nice quarter.","Steve MacMillan","Hey well thank you. Thanks a lot, Mark. And I think that wraps it up.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today.

My name is Justin, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. ","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Michael Watts","Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through February 21.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those that are referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. One of these non-GAAP measures is organic revenue, which we are defining as constant currency revenue less the divested Blood Screening and Cynosure businesses as well as the acquired SuperSonic Imagine business. We hope that our discussion of organic revenue in this call will simplify a complex quarter and help you focus on the parts of our business that matter most.","Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Stephen MacMillan","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our strong financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. But before we get into those details, let me start by saying that it's an exciting time for the company and for our shareholders. Now that the divestiture of Cynosure is behind us, we're able to double down on what we do best: helping women and their families live healthier lives through early detection and treatment of disease.","Along those lines, at the recent JPMorgan conference, it was exciting to reintroduce ourselves to investors as a unique asset in women's health. Now with a simpler story, minus the overhang of Medical Aesthetics, shareholders can focus on the significant positive changes that have occurred in each of our businesses over the last couple of years. When you do, we think you'll find a company with a broad portfolio of market-leading products for women's health; a company that, over the last 6 years, has grown the top line at mid- single-digit rate and leveraged that into low double-digit growth on the bottom line; a company where each business has strengthened significantly since the first half of 2018, positioning us to drive faster organic revenue growth and better margins in 2020; and a company that is focused on redeploying its strong cash flow more aggressively into growth-accretive tuck-in acquisitions as well as returning cash to our shareholders via stock buybacks.","I'm proud to say that for the first time since I joined Hologic, all our domestic divisions as well as our international regions are performing well at the same time, and behind the scenes, that's because our corporate and divisional leadership teams have never been stronger than they are today.","With that introduction, let me turn to our first quarter results, which represent our seventh consecutive quarter of solid, consistent performance. Total revenue finished slightly above the high end of our guidance at $850.5 million. This was only 2.8% growth, but it's important to break down the components, as Mike said. He defined organic revenue, which excludes the divested Blood Screening and Medical Aesthetics businesses as well as some earlier-than-expected revenue from SuperSonic Imagine this quarter. So organically, we significantly outperformed expectations, growing 4.6% against our toughest comparable of the year. And this 4.6% compares favorably to our last quarterly guidance, which called for growth of 1.2% to 3%.","In terms of the bottom line, we were pleased to hit the high end of our guidance range with EPS of $0.61 in the first quarter, even while absorbing a much worse-than-expected loss from Cynosure. So we are off to a good start in fiscal 2020, with all our divisions and regions showing solid performance. We are particularly excited about our Surgical division, which led the way with 10.2% growth in the quarter; and our Diagnostics business, which outperformed with 6.5% growth, excluding Blood.","In terms of geography, domestic sales of $632.7 million increased 1.8% in the first quarter but 3.2% on an organic basis. Outside the United States, sales of $217.8 million increased 6%. But excluding acquisitions and divestitures again, revenue increased 9.2% organically, reflecting the strong foundations we have built for sustainable international growth. Core U.S. sales have grown at a low double-digit rate in each of the last 3 years, and we're well positioned to maintain that pace in the balance of 2020.","Now let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. In our biggest division, Breast Health, our core 3D mammography business remains rock solid, and we are building on it with an increasingly diversified product portfolio that spans the continuum of breast health care. As we said at JPMorgan, we have overhauled our sales talent, structure and process to help key account managers sell a growing product portfolio more strategically. And this has led to a more diverse, consistent revenue growth.","In the first quarter, underlying trends in Breast Health remained solid. Though consistent with our guidance, growth was slower due to a very difficult prior year comparable when worldwide sales grew more than 13%. Against this, global Breast Health sales totaled $331.1 million this quarter and increased 2.4%. Excluding $6.1 million of sales from SuperSonic Imagine, which was not included in our last guidance, global growth was 0.5%.","In terms of geography, domestic Breast Health revenue finished in line with our expectations, with growth of 1.5%. OUS sales increased 5.5% in total but decreased 1.4% without SSI against a very challenging 16.1% comparable in the prior year period. We do expect OUS growth rates to rebound strongly in the balance of the year as the business grows and the comps ease.","In terms of the breast subsegments, imaging sales grew 2.4%, benefiting from the SSI revenue I mentioned earlier, while interventional sales increased 2.6%. In imaging, sales of our Genius 3D Mammography systems remain steady driven by our new 3Dimensions and 3D Performance gantries. As we said in San Francisco, we have sold more than 1,000 gantries a year in the United States for each of the last 5 years, a remarkably durable performance that has defied expectations of a rapid drop-off in sales. Not only have we been converting our own 2D units to 3D, we have been gaining a much higher share of competitive conversions than anticipated. This market leadership position provides a solid foundation for divisional growth and a platform onto which we can add new products and strengthen our strategic advantages.","In interventional, our first quarter results benefited from strong growth in biopsy disposables as our account managers focus on selling our entire portfolio. However, this was largely offset by a headwind from lower Brevera capital sales, which peaked in the first quarter of 2019 before we began limiting supply. We expect the Brevera headwind to be less onerous in the second and third quarters then flip to a tailwind in the fourth quarter when we begin selling capital again.","Our new breast surgery franchise, which consists of the acquired Faxitron and Focal brands plus some legacy Hologic products, also continues to perform very well, with growth in the low teens in the quarter. We're pleased to see our strategic rationale for these division-led tuck-in acquisitions playing out as we accelerate growth by coupling clinically differentiated products with Hologic's commercial infrastructure.","And we are equally excited about our acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine, or SSI, during the first quarter. As a reminder, SSI is a French innovator in cart-based ultrasound technology, which is used across the continuum of breast health care. Integration is off to a good start, and we continue to believe that the business will be accretive to our revenue growth rate, albeit with some slight dilution to EPS in the near term. We are especially excited about the opportunity in the United States, where SSI had a very limited sales presence, but will now be able to benefit from our commercial infrastructure and relationships with key customers.","Now let's turn to Diagnostics, where we have upgraded our talent and aligned our commercial structure to help lab customers of all sizes grow their business. In the first quarter, total revenue of $311.5 million increased 5.5%. Excluding sales from the divested Blood Screening business, Diagnostics revenue grew 6.5%, an even stronger performance. The growth driver here remains Molecular, where we're placing more Panthers with more assay menu in more countries. This has led to strong increases in consumable sales and consistent revenue growth. In the first quarter, for example, worldwide Molecular sales of $178.5 million grew a robust 9% against a challenging prior year comparable.","International Molecular continues to be a standout in both the speed and consistency of growth. OUS Molecular sales increased 22.2%, well into the double digits for the 14th time in 15 quarters. Growth was led by our core women's health tests, our viral load assays, with a growing contribution from HIV in Africa and Panther Fusion. ","And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories, Molecular sales still grew 6%. This reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers to drive volumes and better patient care in established markets.","Domestic growth was again broad-based as customers consolidated testing on our large installed base of Panther instruments. As we showed at JPMorgan, we have shipped more than 200 Panthers globally in each of the last 5 years, fueling a very consistent, profitable razor-blade business model.","In the first quarter, our legacy women's health assays for chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV and Trichomonas drove the growth, with our new vaginosis test, Panther Fusion, and our viral load assays contributing as well.","Moving on, we were also pleased that Cytology & Perinatal sales of $121 million grew by 3.1% in the quarter, admittedly versus a soft prior year comp. Perinatal sales were flat, so the growth came from our Thinprep cytology franchise. Domestic sales were down slightly, consistent with recent trends, but OUS sales grew solidly, in part, reflecting the early phase of Germany's decision to adopt co-testing screening for HPV and PAP as the standard of care to minimize cervical cancer risk.","To wrap up Diagnostics, revenue related to our divested Blood Screening business was slightly higher than expected at $12 million but declined by 15.5%. As a reminder, this revenue reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements with Grifols and is excluded from our organic results.","Now let's turn to GYN Surgical, our most profitable division on a percentage basis, where best-in-class products, new leadership, new commercial models and new product launches have been consistently accelerating growth for 2-plus years. In the first quarter specifically, sales of $119.1 million increased 10.2%, our fastest growth in 11 quarters.","Surgical growth was driven by 3 main factors. First, core MyoSure continues to perform well, with mid-teens growth in the quarter as we expand the market for fibroid removal while gaining share.","Second, although the domestic endometrial ablation market continues to contract, NovaSure is stabilizing thanks to renewed focus by our commercial teams. NovaSure was down low single digits in the quarter, an improvement compared to recent periods. We are pleased with the number of competitive wins we are seeing for NovaSure and ended the first quarter with more NovaSure customers in the United States than we started with.","Third, new products are growing rapidly, although they still represent less than 10% of divisional revenue. Our Fluent Fluid Management System is our best-selling new Surgical product thus far, with more innovations emerging from our development efforts.","And fourth, although international represents less than 20% of Surgical sales, it is growing rapidly, 19.6% in the first quarter. And we've only scratched the surface of this opportunity.","To round out the revenue discussion, Skeletal sales of $23.5 million grew 11.4%, our best performance since the fourth quarter of 2017, based on strong growth of our DEXA systems. We're pleased to see the top college and professional sports teams are adopting DEXA technology for body composition testing and that our products will once again be used to assess football players participating in the NFL draft combine.","Before we turn the call over to Karleen, let me just close our Medical Aesthetics chapter by saying that we are pleased to have completed the divestiture at the end of December. Cynosure sales in the first quarter were clearly much weaker than expected across the board. And as I mentioned earlier, the business was a significant drag on profitability as well.","In terms of our business development strategy moving ahead, we look forward to pursuing more of the smaller division-led deals that have been working well for us. Net, we feel really good about the businesses we're currently in and don't see a need to add a fourth leg to our strategy given the many opportunities for tuck-ins that leverage our existing commercial channels.","So in conclusion, it's an exciting time for the company and our shareholders. We are pleased to report our seventh consecutive quarter of strong execution, with 4.6% organic growth against our toughest comparable of the year. Our Surgical and Molecular Diagnostics businesses stood out this quarter, aided by strong international growth. But Breast Health is also performing well, with a multitude of opportunities still ahead. The efforts we have made over the last few years to strengthen capabilities and accelerate growth are paying off across the company, and we are supplementing these efforts with smart capital deployment that is focused on tuck-in acquisitions and share buybacks.","Now let me turn the call over to Karleen.","Karleen Oberton","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through the rest of our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2020 as well as for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency.","As Steve described, we are pleased with our first quarter results as organic revenue growth of 4.6% drove sales of $850.5 million, which slightly exceeded our guidance range. In addition, EPS of $0.61 finished at the top end of our guidance despite significant underperformance from the divested Medical Aesthetics business.","We also executed on a $205 million accelerated share repurchase program following the Cynosure announcement and bought back an additional $81 million worth of shares on the open market. And our Board has authorized an additional $500 million repurchase program beginning in the third quarter.","For all these reasons, fiscal 2020 is off to a great start, and we are raising our guidance for organic revenue growth and EPS accordingly. I'll discuss that more in a minute. But before I do, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the first quarter. Gross margins of 61.6% decreased 60 basis points compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the disappointing sales in the divested Cynosure business, product and geographic sales mix and the stronger U.S. dollar.","Total operating expenses of $289.3 million increased 5.3% in the first quarter or 4.1% if you exclude SSI's expenses. This increase was driven mainly by higher G&A costs associated with our deferred compensation plan, in which the associated liability is mark-to-market, resulting in higher expense. It's important to note, however, that we hedge this exposure. So most of this expense is offset by a benefit below the line in other income. In addition, research and development expenses increased as we continue to balance growth investments with our goal to drive operating leverage.","Based on these increases in operating expenses, operating margin of 27.5% decreased 170 basis points. However, given the deferred compensation dynamic that I just discussed and the benefit in other income, it's probably more appropriate to focus on net margins of 19.3%, which increased 40 basis points despite the Cynosure headwind. Overall, our profitability remains very healthy.","All of this led to non-GAAP net income of $164.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61, at the top end of our guidance range, despite absorbing the Cynosure loss. Cynosure ended up costing us more than $0.02 in the quarter, net of the fixed overhead cost that, that division absorbed.","Before we cover our revised 2020 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. Our leverage ratio stood at 2.5x at the end of the first quarter as we used cash to acquire SuperSonic Imagine and buy back shares. We remain comfortable with a leverage ratio between 2.5 and 3x, recognizing that this could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity.","Moving on, ROIC was 12.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 10 basis points over the prior year. Finally, adjusted EBITDA of $261.9 million increased slightly compared to the prior year.","Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our full year guidance based on our good first quarter results and to account for the divestiture of Cynosure. At the high -- at a high level, we are raising our organic constant currency revenue guidance as well as our EPS forecast.","Let's start with revenue. As a reminder, we previously guided to reported sales of $3.45 billion to $3.5 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 3% and 4.5%. This original guidance contemplated an equivalent organic growth rate of 3% to 4.5% since the forecast from the acquired SSI business and the divested Blood Screening business basically offset each other.","Based on our strong first quarter results in our core businesses, the divestiture of Cynosure and an updated currency headwind of $10 million, we are increasing our organic revenue growth guidance to a range of 4% to 5%. If we meet or exceed the middle of this range, organic revenue growth would accelerate compared to 2019, as Steve said in his introduction.","Now let me transition to reported growth guidance for the full year. We now expect revenue of $30 million to $35 million from SSI and $35 million to $40 million from Blood Screening. This helps us build up to a total reported revenue range of $3.238 billion to $3.268 billion. This range equates to constant currency decline of 3.5% to 2.6% or a reported decline of 3.8% to 2.9%. These declines are driven by the absence of Cynosure revenue in the balance of the year.","Based on the improved revenue performance in our core businesses, we expect to invest additional resources in future growth. But at the same time, our buyback activities enable us to offset these additional investments while still driving leverage bottom line growth. So despite absorbing the $0.02 Cynosure loss in the first quarter, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance to a range of $2.63 to $2.67 a share, which represents growth between 8.2% and 9.9%. This full updated -- full year updated guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of 268 million to 269 million for the full year, which reflects progress on our buyback program and an effective tax rate of approximately 21.75%, the same as our original guidance.","Now let's turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect organic revenue growth of 3.4% to 4.8%. This organic growth, combined with the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, leads to a total revenue range of $770 million to $780 million for the quarter. This equates to constant currency decline of 5.4% to 4.2% and a reported decline of between 5.9% and 4.7%. Again, these declines are due to the absence of Cynosure revenue compared to the prior year period.","On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.61 to $0.63 in the second quarter. This implies growth rates of between 5.2% and 8.6% continuing to outpace revenue. Let me point out that this EPS range incorporates improved gross margins of 62% to 63% in the second quarter, mainly reflecting benefits from the Cynosure divestiture.","I'd also like to point out that while other expenses net were $24.8 million in the first quarter, we expect these expenses to increase by more than $5 million sequentially in the second quarter as we don't forecast the benefits we saw in the first quarter to recur.","As you update your forecast, let me remind you that we're raising our guidance materially this quarter, so we would encourage you to model to the middle of our guidance range. It's still early in the year, and we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides.","Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying we are pleased with how we started 2020. We feel great about our core businesses and now raising our organic growth rate guidance accordingly. We are encouraged by continued strong commercial execution, the progress in our international franchises, the productivity of our R&D pipeline and the deals we have completed. And we are excited about the opportunity to strategically redeploy capital going forward through division-led business development and share buybacks. Overall, we believe we have multiple levers to deliver healthy organic growth -- revenue growth and EPS growth in 2020.","With that, I will ask you to operator to open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll go ahead and take the first question from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.","Patrick Donnelly","Maybe just on Cynosure in the wake of the divestiture. Obviously, this was a big focus or distraction, whatever you want to call it, for the investor base. But how much in the divestiture allow for an increased focus internally? Given things are segmented out, did it not consume too much mind share? Or do you feel like there's not going to be a renewed focus on the core business, particularly in areas like internationally, your businesses seem to be run a little closer to each other? Did Cyno get kind of a disproportionate amount of attention there? Or do you feel like there's going to be an increase especially even outside of the removal on the overall growth number?","Stephen MacMillan","Yes. Patrick, your -- the last part of your question is extra insightful, that in the U.S., there was -- really, the core businesses were not as distracted, but clearly, Karleen, me and Mike, the whole senior management team was. Internationally, to your point, I think what we're really excited about is the international folks being able to really double down on the 3 core businesses because like anything, they were probably spending a disproportionate amount of time and energy dealing with customer issues, service issues, whatever it might be on the Cynosure business.","And I will tell you, if you talk to our head of Asia Pac, our head of the European area and then you get into the country leaders and everything else, they, I think, are very excited about the opportunities ahead. And I think we've been making very nice progress in the last few years internationally, but this is probably the best news they can get out of it. And it makes us more excited about the opportunities ahead.","Karleen Oberton","And Patrick, this is Karleen. The only thing I would also add is that it kind of shows such a back-end-loaded revenue in the quarter. Really, this divesture also gives us increased confidence in our forecasting ability and ability to reinvest when we see upside. So I think it's a benefit there though as well.","Operator","And our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Chris Lin","This is Chris on for Doug today. Maybe just to follow up on the Cynosure question a bit.","Michael Watts","Hey, Chris, before you get started, just for the -- this is Mike. Just for the operator, it's fine to let folks ask a second follow-up question, just to be clear. So I just wanted to make that point that you're welcome to ask a follow-up. Sorry about that.","Chris Lin","Go ahead. Okay. So could you just help us bridge the organic revenue growth guidance as it relates to Cynosure in the core business? I guess, said differently, to what extent was organic revenue growth guidance increased due to the removal of Cynosure from results?","Stephen MacMillan","There was a bit of both. I think at the -- truthfully, at the start of the year, Cynosure, we thought, was going to grow roughly in line with the rest of the businesses. Now clearly, that did not happen in the first quarter because of the divestiture and the announcement. So it was a pretty ugly quarter.","But I think if you really look at it, at the end of the day, the revised guidance upward is also more conviction and confidence in our core businesses. So it's really more about the additional confidence we have in our core businesses. We didn't really see Cyno being a drag. Now probably, it would have been, but it's -- clearly, we feel better and better about each of the 3 other businesses.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. And I think to the point that Steve made earlier, internationally, is it's a significant piece of the upward take in that guidance.","Chris Lin","Okay. And then for a follow-up question, has the severe flu season benefited your Panther Fusion respiratory assays? And could you just ballpark how big that business is now?","Stephen MacMillan","Yes. We wish it was, but we're still so small in the flu business. If anything, we always -- we're probably still at that stage where it could possibly hurt us a touch as people may give up other visits to their doctors. But I think, overall, awash, but we don't see it being a big benefit to us yet just because we're not as big yet in that space.","Michael Watts","Yes. Chris, just -- this is Mike. Just to give a little more color on that. I think we've said, last year, our Fusion respiratory assay revenue was around $10 million, a little bit less. So that will give you a sense. I mean certainly, we were up in the quarter as you would expect, and we would expect to be up in the year. But as Steve said, not a huge deal.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Just looking at guidance, the midpoint and higher end obviously implies an acceleration, ex Cyno. Can you just talk about, by segment, where you're seeing the acceleration for 2020? Is it mostly on the GYN Surg side? And if so, how sustainable is that? You hit over 10% there this quarter, so just curious about where you see the acceleration this year.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. Clearly, we're really pleased with the Surgical performance and the continued improved performance we've seen over the -- several quarters now. But yes, I would say acceleration is clearly from Surgical and probably Diagnostic as well.","Tycho Peterson","And then you're bumping up the SSI guide from $25 million to $30 million to $30 million to $35 million. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're bundling that with the rest of the offering? Anything to note on the integration front and how you see that ramp going?","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So I would just say that the increase really has to do with the timing of obtaining the controlling interest. So when we originally guided in Q4, we assumed we would not have a controlling interest and therefore, no revenue in the first quarter. So the uptake is really the timing of that controlling interest. And I think it's early days, but the integration is off to a start. And I think, as we've said before, SSI had minimal presence in the U.S., only, I think, 5 reps -- sales reps in the U.S. And so our teams are excited to drop that product into their -- our sophisticated commercial infrastructure here in the U.S.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","I wanted to go back to the Molecular growth in the quarter and maybe just focus on what's going on in the U.S. I think you mentioned in the script that the core women's health was still growing well. But I'm just curious because we've seen, in just the past couple of quarters, I think last quarter, U.S. Molecular grew 9%. Just what was the -- maybe just why did that slow down a little bit in the quarter? Was there anything from a comp perspective? Or what's going on, on the women's health side?","Michael Watts","Yes. Jack, it's Mike. I think we were pretty happy with the Molecular number in the quarter, both U.S. as well as OUS. As we've talked about in that business, it's not really any one thing that drives growth. Certainly, the core women's health assay, specifically chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV and Trich, are the biggest tests. So they have to grow for the business to kind of show the performance that you've seen, but they were up very solidly in the quarter in mature markets. Viral load was a nice contributor as well. I think we highlighted some growth in Africa, in particular, from viral load. And I would say some of the new products, particularly the vaginosis panel, the BV\/CV test, are starting to contribute as well. So pleased with where that division is. And I guess I would say -- sorry, Jack, I guess the other thing. I mean remember, that had a really bad comp last year, too. It was a very challenging prior year comp. So that might be some of what you're seeing.","Jack Meehan","Okay. Got it. And then I think on the flip side, with Cytology, I thought the international growth looks pretty good, and I know, working off somewhat small numbers. And I picked up, I guess, the comment around Germany. Just do you feel like there's -- how durable do you think the double digit on the international side is as a lever to keep Cytology nudging forward?","Stephen MacMillan","I would not expect it to be a double-digit growth. I think like all these things in international, sometimes, it's the smaller bases and timing, you get a little capital sale, you get some things like -- having said that, I think we do see it being at least a slightly growing asset outside the U.S. to offset the declines in the U.S. And it's why I think, globally, we feel like Cytology is roughly a flattish business. And international gets a little more growth. It might tweak that slightly better, but I don't think it's necessarily a double-digit grower.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Kirk with Piper Sandler.","Rachel Vatnsdal","This is Rachel on for Bill. So the international Diagnostics business continues to grow to a fast level of a pace. How much of this is driven by new products versus share gains? And how long can this sort of pace continue?","Karleen Oberton","Yes. I think we talked about -- I think the majority of the growth is from share gains, a little less from the -- the new products' contribution is the viral load internationally, which is contributing nicely. But we expect continued double-digit growth, probably maybe not at the rate that we've seen as they come against some of those tougher comps, but feel really good about that business.","Stephen MacMillan","We have been placing more Panthers internationally over the recent quarters than we have in the U.S. So I think our ability to continue to sustain that we feel really good about.","Rachel Vatnsdal","Great. And then given the combination of new products across almost all of your divisions and M&A completed so far, how much capacity do your teams have for additional transactions?","Karleen Oberton","I'm sorry. We couldn't hear that. Could you repeat that question?","Rachel Vatnsdal","Yes. So given the combination of new products across all divisions and M&A completed so far, how much capacity do you think your teams have for additional transactions?","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So I think the transactions that we've done to date have been in the Breast Health division because certainly, within Diagnostics and Surgical, there's more than adequate capacity to take on transactions. I think Breast Health has -- still has a very active M&A pipeline. They do have a lot of integration activities. But certainly, we feel that if the right deal came along, we have the ability to make the capacity to do a transaction.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Just going back to OUS here for a minute. Obviously, it's been a great driver, and it looks like there's a lot to go here. But can you give us any kind of an update on where you actually do stand in terms of market share for some of the key products? You've typically said that they were around half of what they were for key products here in the States. Where is that now? And what are your longer-term kind of thoughts about where market shares can wind up over there? Can they get to U.S. level still, do you think?","Stephen MacMillan","Brian, I think it's so hard, quite frankly, to really have a great handle on our market shares by segment because there's not great data on a lot of these. I think, anecdotally, from what we just feel, yes, there's still enormous opportunities ahead. And when you look at our relative revenue, under 1\/4 of most of our businesses are outside the U.S., where clearly huge opportunities do, again, continue to be playing out not just in the coming quarters, but really, we think we've got a decade's worth of runway here in terms of solid growth before they even catch up to the U.S., probably ultimately the U.S. shares.","Brian Weinstein","Okay. And then on some of the investments that you're talking about and having a little bit more flexibility to make some of those investments, what are the key strategic investment areas that you guys are focusing on this year? And if there was some upside to develop, where are the incremental investments likely to be made?","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. There's always the extra R&D projects that will come up even during the course of the year that we'll look at. I think we now have better and better leadership internationally. And so that ability to be thinking about adding some more sales reps behind certain franchises in certain countries, I think those kind of opportunities are the kind that can -- we can redeploy efforts as we go through and then the occasional marketing activities as well. But it's really looked at by franchise, by geography, combination, sales, marketing, R&D.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Just two questions on earnings and margins for Karleen. Karleen, so $0.03 in the buyback, $0.02 to $0.04 from removed Cyno dilution. That's around $0.05 to $0.07, and you're raising the guide by $0.02. So that incremental $0.03 to $0.05 of additional reinvestment, where is that going? And a quick follow-up on margins.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So Dave, let me walk you through how we thought about we'd raise the guidance on the bottom line. So yes, we absorbed the $0.02, additional $0.02 loss. We'd talked about the ASR was about $0.02. Again, there is -- that includes the impact of the stranded costs in the -- from Cynosure because they will bring a piece of our overhead. And then the incremental ASR -- the incremental open share repurchase is less than $0.01 for the full year. So it gets you close to $0.025 at the midpoint.","David Lewis","Okay. But you still expect the Cynosure divestiture to be $0.02 to $0.04 accretive for the year?","Michael Watts","Yes, I don't -- hey, David, it's Mike. I don't know that we said $0.02 to $0.04 accretive for the year. I think when we announced the divestiture, basically, the business was breakeven or at least was expected to be breakeven for the year. Clearly, they did worse than that in the first quarter. We said that the combination of the divestiture and the ASR would be about $0.02 accretive. Maybe that's where we weren't clear. But -- so we were kind of looking at those things as roughly $0.02 accretive. And then, of course, we absorbed, as Karleen said, some extra dilution that's baked into the raise in Q1 here.","Operator","Our next question will come from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Rajbir Denhoy","I wonder if maybe I could hit on a couple of things. You mentioned the gantry placement number has been pretty consistent at about 1,000 for several years running now. I realize that the acceleration of this business is only about 6 or 7 years old. But at some point, do we start to see a replacement cycle in 3D? Could that number start to pick up as you move out a couple of years from now?","Karleen Oberton","Yes. I mean I think, eventually, that if you think about 3D was originally approved in 2011, but you had that significant uptake in the 2014, 2015 time frame. With the 7-year life, 7 to 9 year life, at some point, there's a replacement cycle there. But I think we've intentionally smoothed out that cycle with the upgrades that we're doing to the field now. Because if you think about our greatest gantry, 3D, 3Dimensions, those features and functionalities are backwards-compatible to the installed base. So really, trying to minimize that pent-up demand in our replacement cycle. So we feel good and really are pleased with the steady approach of placements over the coming years.","Rajbir Denhoy","Okay. That's fair. And maybe just a follow-up on the last question, on David's question, about the guidance, the earnings guidance, in particular, all of the raises just around the ASR and the Cynosure divestiture. And so Karleen, I'm just curious about your views on sort of other margin expansion initiatives, which you guys can undertake over the next year-plus in order to take your margins even higher than where they are now.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So certainly, that's always a focus, to create leverage in an operating margin. And I think, always, we have ongoing programs within the supply chain organization to work on that. And then there's still efforts within the middle of the P&L that we can take. It's an active -- it's an ongoing activity throughout the organization to look for leverage points.","Stephen MacMillan","I would remind you, Raj, as you well know, our margins are already pretty good. So a big part of our focus at this point has really been on accelerating that organic growth rate via the investments in R&D, sales, marketing. And we think, overall, it's going to be a pretty good combination, but more on accelerating the sales growth than on huge additional focuses on margins. But again, obviously, we're always working and expect to improve the margins as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ivy Ma with Bank of America.","Ivy M&A","Karleen, appreciate the color on the guide so far. Not to beat the margin question to death, I just wanted to see how should we think about the margin improvement in this fiscal year and beyond given the removal of Cynosure in terms of both gross margin and operating margin would be great. And then I have a follow-up on the gross margin this quarter as well.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So if you look even at just what we've guided to for Q2, 62% to 63%, compared to where we ended Q1, you can see the midpoint of the 100 basis improvement in the margin profile. So I think that's 50 to 100 basis points is how we're thinking the impact is for Cynosure as we move forward. And I think operating margins certainly will be more than that on the gross margin given that Cynosure was such a heavy OpEx business.","Ivy Ma","Great. That's helpful. And then a follow-up. So on the gross margin decline this quarter, could you help us unpack how much in the 60 bps just relates to Cynosure, the mix and then the stuff that you would see, please?","Karleen Oberton","Yes, maybe I'll describe it another ways. The majority of that decline was really Cynosure. So if you looked at the base business, gross margins are essentially flat year-over-year. And if we looked at quarterly trending of gross margins in '19, Q1 was our best gross margin quarter. So majority is really Cynosure-related.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson Bedford","So I wanted just to revisit the segment growth. I came off the fourth quarter call thinking Diagnostics, Breast Health, Surgical would all grow in that 4% to 5% range for the year. I realize that comps come into play here, but Surgical was obviously well above this level. Breast Health was below this level. So maybe you can just level-set us on segment expectations for the year, if they've changed at all.","Stephen MacMillan","Yes. I think, overall, probably each of our businesses is going to grow solidly in the mid-singles for the year. Breast Health, that will include a little bit of help from SSI, as we said at the start. And then Surgical was probably a little bit at the higher end of that piece; and Diagnostics, pretty much right in the middle. So I think all of that gets to that 4% to 5% organic that we're talking about.","Jayson Bedford","The Breast Health mid-single include SSI?","Karleen Oberton","Yes.","Stephen MacMillan","Yes. I think, as we always said, especially going against the first 2 quarters where we had these monster comps from a year ago. That's why our initial guidance, if you recall from last quarter, only called for 1.2% to 3.0% organic growth.","Operator","And we'll go back to Dan Brennan with UBS.","Nathan Treybeck","This is Nathan Treybeck calling for Dan Brennan. Can you hear me?","Stephen MacMillan","Hey. There we go. All right.","Michael Watts","A lot of pressure on this question now.","Nathan Treybeck","Yes. Definitely. Third time is the charm, I guess. In terms of going back to Molecular, can you frame the size of the OUS opportunity in terms of, I guess, an addressable dollar figure?","Stephen MacMillan","I don't know. We've got a great number on that because, again, just some of the data sources and other stuff. But I think it gets back to we have a lot of runway ahead to consider the size of our Molecular business outside the U.S. relative to inside. Can we easily double and triple it over the longer term where we are today to outside the U.S.? Yes.","Nathan Treybeck","Okay. And just staying on Molecular. Can you discuss the split between share gains from other Molecular players versus, let's say, converting less from non-Molecular approaches?","Stephen MacMillan","It's so hard to know that when you start to deal country-by-country and everything else. I think we feel good about the trajectory. And obviously, it sources above.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ivy Ma with Bank of America.","Ivy Ma","I just wanted to talk about Surgical for a minute. Can you talk about how sustainable is that segment's growth and what your expectations are for the rest of this fiscal year, especially as the comp gets tougher later in the year?","Karleen Oberton","Yes. I think we -- what we said is Surgical -- I think Steve just talked about the segment, that we expect Surgical at the high end of that mid-single digit given the Q1 performance. Again, we have contribution from new products coming throughout the continuation of the year. But to your point, we are coming up against higher comps. So that's why we don't -- we're not projecting that 10% for the full year.","Operator","And thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today.

LLC","Operator","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hologic, Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keith, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Keith. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through November 23rd.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.","Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. It was a solid quarter overall as total revenue of $813.5 million and earnings per share of $0.58 both finished within our guidance ranges.","As we announced in September, continued strength in our legacy businesses offset lower than expected sales of Cynosure products due to the FDA letter on our MonaLisa Touch laser and our decision to suspend marketing of TempSure Vitalia handpieces and probes.","Our largest businesses performed well in the fourth quarter, continuing a trend that emerged over the course of the year. Growth in our domestic Breast Health business improved for the fifth consecutive quarter. Molecular growth accelerated excluding non-recurring royalties from a year ago. International sales increased solidly and U.S. Surgical returned to growth. And just after quarter-end, we completed a tuck-in acquisition that will further strengthen and expand our Breast Health franchise.","Before we discuss these details, let me step back and comment on the company as a whole since we're marking the end of our fiscal year. As I look back across 2018, there is no doubt that we are a much healthier company today than a year ago and that each of our major businesses is stronger. In Breast Health, domestic growth improved over the course of 2018 driven by new products and strong execution. In Diagnostics, we placed more Panthers, launched more tests, and solidified our relationships with our largest customers.","In Surgical, a revamped and more competitive sales force helped quarterly results improve steadily. In Medical Aesthetics, we dramatically improved our commercial capabilities although the numbers don't show it yet. Internationally, we built a solid infrastructure for sustainable growth with new leadership, new products, and new capabilities.","And finally, as we eliminated all of the convertible debt from our balance sheet, we enhanced our business development efforts, resulting in the acquisitions of Faxitron Bioptics and Focal Therapeutics. We have now completed four tuck-in deals successfully and expect more ahead. So overall, we made major progress since restructuring our leadership early in the year, and we enter 2019 with improved momentum.","Now let's discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail. Revenue of $813.5 million grew 1.3% on a reported basis or 1.7% in constant currency. Let me remind you that these percentages understate our true growth as the prior-year period benefited from higher sales from our divested Blood Screening business and $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue in Molecular Diagnostics, which more than offset an extra selling day.","In terms of geography, our legacy International franchises demonstrated robust 10.4% growth in the fourth quarter, our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth excluding Cynosure. Our Molecular Diagnostics business had an exceptional quarter internationally, and our Breast Health and Surgical business contributed nicely as well reflecting the broad-based improvements we have made in recent years.","Including OUS sales of Cynosure products, which declined in the period, total International sales were $198.4 million, still a solid increase of 6.3%. In the United States, positive trends that emerged in the third quarter continued in the fourth as growth rates improved sequentially in our Breast Health, Diagnostics, and Surgical franchises.","Now let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results in the fourth quarter. Our largest business, Breast Health, is clearly in a very different position than a year ago and has reemerged as an important growth driver defying external concerns about a cyclical decline. Global Breast Health sales totaled $322.2 million, a robust increase of 7.4%, including about $5 million from Faxitron. Internationally, we continue to perform well with sales growth in the mid-teens.","In addition, the much larger U.S. Breast business again strengthened in the quarter and posted growth of 5.4%, our best growth rate in seven quarters. We couldn't be more proud of the team for building a diversified, sustainable growth business to overcome the boom-bust product cycles of the past. Their strategic success was evident this quarter as growth was broad-based, encompassing mammography, Interventional, our new breast surgery franchise, and service.","At the core, sales of imaging products increased 6.2% globally in the quarter. It's clear that the introduction of our new clinically differentiated 3Dimensions and 3D Performance Systems have not only revitalized the market as a whole but helped us continue to gain market share.","Since it's the end of our fiscal year, I'll let you know that we shipped nearly 1,100 3D systems in the United States over the last four quarters, down just slightly compared to our placements in fiscal 2017, validating our stronger-for-longer forecast. Cumulatively, by year-end we had shipped more than 5,700 3D systems in the United States and are working to upgrade this installed base with new software and hardware.","At the same time, we still have runway ahead for additional placements, as customers, patients, and payers continue to recognize the ability of our systems to detect more invasive cancers while simultaneously reducing unnecessary callbacks. For example, 3D is only about 60% penetrated in our own installed base, which means that we still have nearly 4,000 2D units in the field. And overall, we estimate that 3D is about 50% penetrated in the domestic entry market as a whole including competitor units.","Sales of Interventional Breast products also showed robust growth again, increasing 15.9% globally and reaching double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. Growth here is being driven by important new products such as our Brevera biopsy system, but also by our sales force leveraging the breadth of our portfolio to partner more comprehensively with customers.","To reinforce this last point, we wanted to highlight the tuck-in acquisition of Focal which closed in early October. Combined with our recent acquisition of Faxitron, Focal strengthens our position in the rapidly growing market for breast-conserving surgery and expands our ability to help women diagnosed with breast cancer throughout their continuum of care from screening through treatment.","Focal's main product is an innovative marker called BioZorb, an implantable, three-dimensional marker that helps clinicians overcome challenges in breast-conserving surgery. From a financial perspective, acquiring Focal is accretive to our revenue growth rate and gross margins, broadens our recurring revenue base and provides an attractive return on invested capital. In addition, combining Focal and Faxitron, then layering on Hologic's much greater resources and capabilities should help accelerate growth going forward.","Our Breast Health division has never been stronger than it is today based on a clinically-differentiated core of mammography systems, multiple new products built around this core, and two complementary tuck-in acquisitions.","Now, let's turn to Diagnostics, where revenue of $288.9 million declined 0.5%. As discussed, we had some unusual items affecting Diagnostics growth this quarter, so the headline number does not represent what's actually a very healthy business. For example, Molecular sales of $158 million grew 3.4%. But if you exclude roughly $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue from the prior year period, underlying growth was actually 10.2%, accelerating for the second consecutive quarter.","Internationally, Molecular grew in double digits for the ninth time in 10 quarters. And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories, Molecular still grew a healthy mid-single-digit rate, excluding the royalty revenue from a year ago.","Sales of Aptima, women's health and virology assays on our market-leading Panther system, remain the primary growth drivers in our Molecular business. Over the course of 2018, we shipped more than 200 more Panthers to lab customers around the world, bringing our cumulative total to more than 1,500 units, more than 40% of which are now outside the United States.","Importantly, utilization of these instruments has continued to grow as new assays emerge from our R&D pipeline and as we partner with customers to drive overall testing volume. Average revenue per Panther now exceeds $225,000 a year on a global basis and grew at a low double-digit rate in fiscal 2018.","Moving on, cytology and perinatal sales of $118.0 million declined 1.2% in the fourth quarter. In the United States, cytology growth remains challenged due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals. However, during the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see the United States Preventive Services Task Force issue their final cervical cancer testing guidelines. These final guidelines reversed an earlier draft and retained an A grade for Pap + HPV testing or co-testing in women between the ages of 30 and 65.","Both tests are crucial because data from multiple large studies prove that co-testing identifies more cervical pre-cancers and cancers than either test used alone. So the final USPSTF recommendations remove a near-term concern for investors, but more importantly ensure that women will continue to have access to the most commonly used cervical cancer screening method in the United States, an approach that we believe is simple, highly accurate and cost-effective.","Elsewhere in Diagnostics, revenue related to our divested Blood Screening business totaled $12.9 million, an expected decline of 28.3% that depressed growth rates for our Diagnostics division and the company as a whole.","Before we move on, we wanted to address a concern some of you had about our Diagnostics business. While there has been outsized focus on a single lab contract, we've actually been working diligently to solidify our business with our two largest customers. And I'm pleased to let you know that in recent weeks, we have signed a multi-year deal to continue providing cytology and molecular tests and instrumentation to one of these customers.","In addition, we have agreed on terms for a multiyear extension of our supply contract with the other customer and expect to finalize this contract in the next few weeks. As you know, we don't discuss the details of individual contracts, but I will tell you that we are pleased with this outcome and have incorporated the financial effects in our 2019 guidance. Most importantly, we look forward to continuing to work with both customers to grow our shared businesses for years to come.","Now let's cover our GYN Surgical division, where sales of $107.4 million grew 3.1%. Over the course of 2018, Surgical steadily improved each quarter and returned to meaningful growth in the fourth as we predicted in our last call. As we have discussed, our new leadership team is improving the culture of our Surgical sales force and we are beginning to see the benefits of their more aggressive competitive approach.","MyoSure, which has become the largest product line in the Surgical franchise, continued recent trends of strong performance, growing low-double digits in the quarter. NovaSure continued to show modest sequential improvement, declining less than in the third quarter, but overall sales were still down mid-single digits compared to the prior year. Finally, we should highlight that we launched our Fluent fluid management system in the fourth quarter and are seeing good early interest from customers.","Apart from these operational results in Surgical, in recent weeks we also settled a long-standing patent dispute with Smith & Nephew related to MyoSure, agreeing to pay them $34.8 million and a small ongoing royalty. We are pleased to put this matter behind us so we can focus more fully on growing the business.","Now let's turn to Medical Aesthetics where sales of $70.6 million declined 12.9%. As we disclosed in September before the Morgan Stanley Conference, Cynosure sales were negatively affected by the FDA letter on certain women's health procedures and our voluntary decision to suspend marketing of our TempSure Vitalia product. Specifically, sales in the fourth quarter were more than $15 million lower than initially expected due to refunds and rebates associated with prior sales of Vitalia handpieces, unused probes, and TempSure systems, as well as reduced MonaLisa Touch sales. Normalizing for these effects, revenue would have been roughly in-line with expectations, reflecting a domestic sales force that is coming up to speed in what remains an attractive growth market.","We have adjusted our marketing messages for MonaLisa Touch in response to FDA's concerns and are working collaboratively with the agency to design the clinical trials that hopefully will lead to more specific indications and labeling. We continue to believe that a higher level of regulatory scrutiny will benefit us over time so we welcome a more level playing field on which we can communicate the tremendous value that products like MonaLisa Touch provide.","To round out the revenue discussion briefly, Skeletal sales of $24.4 million grew 1.4% as we continue to see strong sales of our Horizon system for bone density testing and human performance management.","So, to wrap up, we posted very good financial results in the quarter with improving momentum in Breast Health, Molecular Diagnostics, and Surgical, and continued strength internationally. We logged some nice successes in our Diagnostics business, both with the USPSTF and our largest customers, and completed a second attractive tuck-in acquisition for Breast Health. We are clearly exiting 2018 on a much better trajectory than when we began the year, and we look forward to continued growth in 2019.","Now I'll turn the call over to Karleen.","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. It's been a pleasure to meet some of you in the first few months as CFO and I look forward to getting to know many more of you in the coming months. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, then finish with our initial financial guidance for 2019. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.","As Steve mentioned, we closed out fiscal 2018 with a good fourth quarter. Revenue and EPS both finished in-line with our guidance. A strong performance from our core businesses offset a negative surprise with Cynosure's women's health products. We also strategically deployed capital in accordance with our stated priorities. We completed the acquisition of Focal Therapeutics, a nice tuck-in opportunity to further expand in breast-conserving surgery, and capitalized on our share repurchase authorization.","With that introduction, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margins of 61.8% decreased 230 basis points due primarily to geographic and product sales mix, non-recurring royalties included in the prior-year period, and refunds and rebates associated with our TempSure Vitalia products.","Total operating expenses of $265.9 million decreased 3.6% as we continue to balance growth investments with a desire to drive operating leverage. For example, even though research and development expenses were lower than a year ago, we have the best new product portfolio in recent memory. We have significantly improved the talent of our teams and the productivity of our efforts.","Operating margin of 29.1% declined 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. However, normalizing for the Vitalia refunds and rebates, as well as non-recurring royalties in the prior-year period, operating margins would have grown about 140 basis points. Overall, our operating profitability remains very healthy and we continue to see opportunities to improve further.","Finally, net margins of 19.5% increased 170 basis points as the factors just discussed were offset by improvements in our effective tax rate. All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 within our guidance range and consistent with the forecast we provided just before the Morgan Stanley Conference. Steve mentioned that Cynosure revenue was more than $15 million less than expected. I want to remind you that TempSure refunds and rebates also directly reduced profit in the quarter, lowering EPS by almost $0.02.","Before we move on to our 2019 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. We continue to generate strong cash flows that provide us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. During our fiscal year, we generated $687.3 million in free cash, excluding $60 million of tax recapture payments associated with the extinguishment of the company's convertible debt. We used some of this cash flow to repurchase 2.3 million shares of stock for $88.5 million in the fourth quarter, and also completed the Focal acquisition in early October for a purchase price of $125 million.","At the end of the fourth quarter, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, stood at 2.6 times, slightly below our year-ago level despite all the capital deployment that occurred in fiscal 2018. We remain comfortable around this level, recognizing that this could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity. Finally, in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $263.3 million increased slightly compared to the prior year.","Now I'd like to cover our initial non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2019. Before I do, let me remind you there are several puts and takes in comparing our 2019 guidance to our actual 2018 results.","In terms of headwind, revenues from our divested Blood Screening business is expected to continue declining significantly in 2019. And foreign exchange rates at recent levels would also be a drag on reported results. In addition, based on our 2019 holiday schedule, we technically have two fewer selling days than in 2018, although this is not expected to have a big impact.","On the other hand, tailwinds to reported growth in 2019 will include the acquisitions of Faxitron and Focal, both of which are off to a good start. As you update your forecast, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range at this early stage. We've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upside and downside.","We anticipate fiscal 2019 will be a solid year for Hologic overall. At the highest level, we are forecasting constant currency revenue growth roughly in the 3% to 4% range with EPS growth about double that. Specifically, we anticipate sales of $3.29 billion to $3.335 billion in 2019 with reported growth rates between 2.2% and 3.6%. Based on recent exchange rates, this translates into constant currency growth of 2.8% to 4.2%, better than our run rate exiting 2018.","We do expect tuck-in acquisitions to be an increasingly important part of Hologic's story going forward and therefore encourage you to focus on these reported numbers in constant currency. But as you do think about our underlying organic growth rate, I would point out that based on recent exchange rates, the headwinds and tailwinds I previously discussed basically offset each other next year. Said another way, organic growth rates should be pretty similar to constant currency growth rates in 2019 depending on how you model the various components.","In terms of geography, we expect our U.S. business to grow in the low-single-digit range in fiscal 2019, an improvement over last year while absorbing all of the decline in Blood Screening sales. International revenue should grow in the high-single digits on a constant currency basis, slightly less than 2018 as we have annualized most of the benefit from our two European distributor acquisitions.","In terms of divisional growth in 2019, our guidance anticipates that most of our businesses will grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range except for Breast Health, which we expect to grow in the mid-single digits. In Diagnostics, Molecular should continue to lead the charge in 2019 behind Panther, Panther Fusion, and increased utilization of more than a dozen women's health, virology, and respiratory assays.","We anticipate approximately $30 million to $35 million of revenue related to our divested Blood Screening business much lower than in 2018. In Breast Health, growth will be driven by multiple new mammography, biopsy, and surgical products that we have discussed, including those from Faxitron and Focal, our International businesses, and a large service annuity that now totaled well over $400 million annually. In Surgical, we expect growth to be driven by the continued expansion of MyoSure, more modest declines in NovaSure, new products such as Fluent in International. In Medical Aesthetics, growth from a stabilized and increasingly productive sales force and new products including TempSure which was recently cleared for surgical use.","As Steve mentioned, we do not expect any revenue from TempSure Vitalia in 2019, and we expect MonaLisa Touch sales to be significantly less than in 2018 given the regulatory environment. In terms of profitability, we forecast gross margins to improve slightly compared to 62.7% in the full year 2018.","As we have previously discussed, while the expansion of our International business adds gross margin dollars to our income statement, it does put pressure on gross margin percentage. So geography mix will offset most of the gross margin benefit we expect from operational improvements and continued adoption of new products. In terms of operating expenses, we expect to continue to show strong leverage that helps drive healthy growth in operating margin percentage and ultimately EPS.","Below the line, we expect other expenses net to be materially greater in fiscal 2019 than the $132 million we posted in 2018, primarily from higher forecasted interest rates. All this leads to forecasted earnings per share between $2.38 and $2.42 in 2019. This represents reported growth of between 6.7% and 8.5%, with the understanding that EPS growth would be slightly higher if not for the diminishing contribution from our divested Blood Screening business.","This guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 23%, flat to 2018, and diluted shares outstanding of about 276 million for the year. We also expect to continue generating robust cash flows in 2019 with free cash flow estimated around $700 million, excluding one-time items such as acquisition-related tax payments and legal settlements.","Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenues of $800 million to $815 million in the quarter. This reflects reported revenue growth of 1.1% to 3% and constant currency growth of 1.7% to 3.6%. We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.55 to $0.57 in the first quarter. This represents 0% to 3.6% growth on a reported basis.","As a reminder, there is some seasonality to keep in mind in our first fiscal quarter. While Surgical tends to have a seasonally strong quarter, this benefit is offset by Breast Health, which is seasonally weaker due to limited installations during RSNA and over the holidays.","In addition, on the expense side, remember that our U.S. and European sales meeting take place in the first quarter and that this will be the first full quarter to include expenses from Faxitron and Focal.","Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with how we finished 2018 with our Breast Health, Molecular Diagnostics and International businesses driving solid growth. We continue to generate industry-leading cash flows and put that cash to good use with a second tuck-in acquisition and share repurchases.","We have stronger momentum as we enter 2019 and anticipate a better year as all these trends continue and as our Surgical and Medical Aesthetics franchises return to growth.","With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Raj.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","So, yeah, thanks for the detail on the guidance for next year. Maybe I could start with Molecular. I know you didn't want to give us too much detail around the new contracts you signed, but you had a very strong quarter here in the fourth quarter, up over 10% on an underlying basis. When you think about that business into the next fiscal year, I mean, should we think about it in the 5% range? Or really, maybe you can help us in terms of how to think about that for the next year.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. I think that probably makes sense on the Molecular business, Raj. I think we feel very good about where that's going. That clearly would be a mid-singles. Then, obviously, the total Diagnostics business, probably a little less because of the cytology piece. And if anything, we might hope to beat that on the Molecular side, but we like where we're going right now with it.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Maybe just one other point of clarification. You noted \u2013 and again, looking at my notes here, but you said the commercial capabilities in Aesthetics has improved and you're not seeing it in the numbers yet. And I'm curious if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail on it in terms of what you're referring to there. Is it the sales force that's finally stopped hemorrhaging folks or \u2013 again, because it remains a bit of a drag here, so when we think about it improving, what should we really be thinking about?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, Raj, it's great. It's really referring to both sales and marketing, but especially the sales team. We came into the quarter, and I would tell you, July was off to a tremendous start, which showed we've got the team and the products in place. We feel really, really good about where that team is. Really, only a year after Kevin Thornal went in as President. And I will tell you in late July, I was really looking forward to this earnings call because I knew it was going to be the one that we were going to be reporting strong double-digit growth based on what we could see already happening in the quarter, and then the FDA and TempSure letter. But we're seeing those results and especially what was going on at that point in time.","And then as we look at, frankly, the territories that were, call it, more vacant a year ago, we now have good people in. And so we certainly feel much better about where we are. I'd say we've now got a normalized sales force and feel really good and frankly, still attracting some very good people coming over.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thank you. Two questions from me.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Isaac.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. One on Diagnostics, one on Aesthetics. On Diagnostics, just to try and close a book here on the large contracts, could you try and give us some quantification as to the impacts so that we can get a better sense of the underlying growth in the business if we exclude the impact of the new contracts?","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Isaac, it's Mike. I'm sorry to play traffic cop on that one a little bit, but, I mean, we're really not at any liberty to talk about the economics or the specifics of those things. As you can imagine, that's pretty highly competitive information and highly confidential. We want to keep it to ourselves. We did, as we said in our script, work that into our 2019 guidance, and we're pleased with how it worked out.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. And I think just to build \u2013 simply, if you do think about it, we're guiding our Diagnostics business, call it, likely low- to mid-single-digit growth. Clearly, Molecular is going to be better than that and cytology is probably a pretty flattish business, if that can help a little bit.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then on the Aesthetics side, with that $7 million in refunds and rebates, just trying to get a sense of, is there anything left there that we should expect in the next quarter or two as that closes out? Or is that pretty much all in the past now? Just trying to make sure that as we look at the sequential trend in Aesthetics, that there are no surprises left before it kind of gets back to the growth mode. Thank you.","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Isaac, it's Karleen. Yeah, I think we've captured everything. I think our teams here did a really nice job. They actually connected with each of over 160 TempSure customers and believe we've captured all in the fourth quarter and don't have any exposure as to prior-period sales moving forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. I'll start with Breast Health. Steve, a couple of questions there. You mentioned the upgrade opportunity. I'm wondering if you could kind of flesh that out a little bit. Are you starting to kind of replace some of the early 3D systems or were you specifically talking about 2D? And then just a little bit of color on performance of the new products, 3Dimensions and 3D Performance, to what degree are those getting into new customers?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, the first part is both software upgrades to existing 3D systems that we'd already sold. We are also upgrading certainly the later generations of 2Ds that we can upgrade, as well with 3D, that's also a software change so that does factor in.","In terms of the second part, 3D Performance and 3Dimensions, I think we're just really pleased that you go back a year ago and we're a little bit on our back heels. And as those products launched, being able to get our messaging out, we're seeing very good uptake. And you've seen it certainly in the MQSA data but also in our overall results here where our Breast Health business really strengthening through the year. And I think we feel really good based on orders as to where that business should be headed this year.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one follow-up. On guidance, can you clarify what's embedded for acquisition contributions in terms of a dollar amount? And then on NovaSure, when do you think that kind of bottoms out and starts to recover? Thanks.","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. So in terms of the acquisitions, obviously Faxitron and Focal are both included. I think we've talked about combined historically they did about $40 million and we're looking for them to probably grow in the double-digit range.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First off, Steve, can you give us an update on the competitive intensity you're seeing in Surgical?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think it's anything different than what we've felt over the last few years. There's always a little pockets here or there, but I would not say anything meaningfully different, Dan.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then for my follow-up. On the body component of your Aesthetics business, I actually thought that might have been a little bit stronger given the positive commentary and from prior calls. Can you help you reconcile the two? Is it just seasonality or was there something else that happened in that category?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. I think we did have a tougher comp. That we had the submental launch that happened right at the end of the previous year in that quarter so we got a lot of revenue writing at the end. So you got a little bit of that. And frankly some of the icons, some of the other products just got a little hotter in the quarter, and I think people were having some success there. Anything more?","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","No, I think that's right.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Great.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys, congrats on a Steady Eddie quarter. So, Steve, maybe I want to start on the Diagnostics piece. And if I look at the guidance, gross margins being up year-on-year, relative to what the Street \u2013 I think the Street was overtly nervous on maybe large contract renewals, and it looks like this is coming much better than expected. But I guess my question is, is there upside here? Because when you look at Dx, in your commentaries, you said Molecular is growing and accelerating. It was actually up 10%. Why shouldn't we expect these trends to continue into 2019? And as you mentioned, some of the conversations you have with the large customers, was there any \u2013 should we be thinking about the virology opportunity amongst your large customers? Any thoughts on that I think will be helpful.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. I think we feel good about where Molecular is going right now but don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. A 10.2% quarter, we're about ready to say that that is a sustainable number, probably not. Would it be something we want to shoot for? You bet. But our International business was off the charts strong as that's been building up. But I don't think the sustainability of that \u2013 we'd probably be careful saying at this point in time because particularly International, we've grown International 9 out of the last 10 quarters in very strong double digits.","And that, as we start to go against those comps, it's starting to be a very meaningful part of the business. That's going to get tougher, I think, in the road forward. But I think overall we feel very, very good about where it's going. Yeah.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","And then maybe one on guidance here. Karleen, and maybe, Steve, for you too as well, I guess when you look at the parts of gross margin (00:43:34) maybe up slightly year-on-year, but if we're looking at higher tax rate, higher below-the-line expenses, are we now looking at operating margins being flat or even expanding at the high end to get to the EPS range?","And when you think about the free cash in a tremendous free cash here. So, Steve, when you think about priorities for free cash deployment, is this all debt paydown given higher interest rate or should we be thinking of tuck-in M&As? Thank you.","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","Vijay...","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","It's like nine questions in...","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","That was a world record for follow-up.","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","So maybe I'll start on kind of the assumptions for guidance next year. I think we're pleased with the gross margin up slightly versus next year when you think about absorbing the impact of tariffs, as well as currency headwinds.","We are assuming that we have increased our leverage and our operating income line which is going to drive the EPS growth on the bottom. And I think the tax rate I think you said is increasing but it's actually flat 23% year-over-year.","And I think from a cash flow perspective, as we've stated before, we're really focused on deploying that free cash flow. Priority would be tuck-in M&A followed by opportunistic share repurchase just like we've done recently here with Focal Faxitron in the 2.3 million shares repurchased in Q4.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Good job.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Steve, I was wondering about if you could just elaborate a little on your conversations with the FDA and what exactly you're looking at in terms of putting together a clinical trial on the women's health side. Do you think it's possible you could be back in the market with either MonaLisa or Vitalia this year? Is this going to be more of a 2020 event?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","I think the simple way to think about it is obviously MonaLisa is on the market but I think the whole market is kind of retrenched at this point in time. And I think the smart thing to assume at this point in time is Vitalia will not be back during the fiscal year. If it came back sooner, then it'd be a wonderful upside to us. But I think as we look at the work that needs to be done, it's probably an out-year event.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, it would be great to hear your expectations on Fusion as we enter the upcoming respiratory season. On how much within the mid-single-digit or so Molecular growth do you think that's contributing there?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Fusion, as we've been saying all along, is really a multiyear build that's very small this year. So we've got the respiratory assays on it just beginning that. But as we've always said, Fusion is a gateway that over time it allows us to go much further into PCR assays and everything else. I think frankly based on a supplier or whatever and their own issues, I think it might have been taken out of context. But we're very pleased with the initial uptake, but I've always said this one's going to build over many, many years.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","And, Jack, it's Mike. One piece of that is obviously is adding menu to the platform over time. And we started with the three respiratory assays, as Steve was alluding to, which is a good start. Just got our Group B Streptococcus, which is a women's health assay approved this quarter, and just in recent days got clearances for some of the software that take the open channel capabilities up a notch. So, doing a good job of building out that menu, but as Steve said, it's going to take a little bit of time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Doug.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. This is actually Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to start with another question on Diagnostics. Just curious if you could provide some commentary on how broader Diagnostics pricing is trending? And how are you embedding the impact to pricing and revenue guidance? I guess said differently, what could Molecular grow this year if pricing remains stable?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. We're seeing just modest declines. Obviously, the PAMA pressures and everything else, but I'd say marginally negative but not a whole sales step change down. I think frankly based on a lot of us being able to sell our workflow advantages with Panther, everything else, being able to try to fight off steeper price cuts.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then for my follow-up question, could you just provide an update on how efforts to reallocate resources in Medical Aesthetics is progressing? And then are you assuming any material new product launches this year to hit your Medical Aesthetics revenue guidance? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. I think we feel good about the rebuild of the sales force there, obviously with TempSure Vitalia off the market, going back and selling a little bit more out of the rest of the product line. We did \u2013 as we look into this year, TempSure is just getting a surgical indication, so that'll provide a little bit of news as well for us through the year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Want to circle back to a couple of questions that were asked or alluded to earlier. So I guess first is given that we're entering or getting close to entering year two of PAMA, Steve, would anticipate any incremental pressure on the Molecular business? And obviously the same goes for the third year of that obviously a year away.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's embedded in our growth rates. And I think we feel pretty good about -- we've got additional volume. We have new products coming, and it's just another pressure we absorb like any other business going forward.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, the other piece of that, Bill, as you know as well as anybody is in an environment that could be consolidating, I mean, we're pretty well-positioned with Panther and a menu now that has \u2013 geez, off top of my head \u2013 well over a dozen assays. So it plays into the need for the customer to drive efficiency and improve the workflow.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Understood. Thanks. And then also just wanted to, I guess, get some additional color on the Interventional side of the business, Steve, clearly one of the bright spots here this year. Just talk to us about the sustainability of the growth platform with that business. Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. I think this has always been part of Pete Valenti, the Head of our Breast Health business, as he thought about adjacent areas to really expand into and put a lot of energy from the day he walked in the door. If you think about it, we launched the Affirm prone biopsy system a couple of years ago, Brevera, and now Faxitron and Focal will also start to fit into that. So it's really been much more of that portfolio shift from just gantries to extending across the continuum. And really like where that business is going. Is it organically a double-digit grower? Probably not. But are we going to be able to generate very strong growth? We've had four double-digit quarters in a row. It's becoming a very meaningful contributor to the business. And with Faxitron and Focal also coming into that, it should continue to be a very strong grower here for some time.","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. And I would just add, Steve, that on Brevera, demand is outpacing supply. So as we get supply in line, we should see some acceleration from Brevera. So we feel really good about that as well.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Just a few clarifying questions here first and then maybe a follow-up. I guess, for Karleen and Steve, just to follow up here, number one, just thinking about the organic growth for fiscal 2019. Our math has 2.5% to 3.5% organic growth as the implied range. Karleen, is that close to your math?","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","No, we're closer to 3% to 4% organic growth.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","But when you deal with currency and Blood Screening going down, David, it probably comes out to be a little bit better.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And your assumption, Karleen, in that number is, I'm assuming, $45 million to $50 million of M&A contribution in 2019?","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. So what we're thinking about in the organic growth is that the incremental growth for Faxitron and Focal is part of ours because we believe that like we've seen with our distributors that we've purchased internationally, that those businesses will actually perform better as part of Hologic versus stand-alone. So that could be the difference of how we're thinking about it.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. And don't forget Faxitron, one quarter is organic, next year as well.","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","Right, right.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","It could be part of it.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Some consideration for the future will be just to give a direct organic growth number. I think investors \u2013 sort of non-standard, I think investors would appreciate it, just food for thought. And Steve, just following up, the SculpSure number, the on-body number, I'm just trying to understand, sequentially that number is down on an absolute basis. Even if the comps are more challenging, the business is still down $6 million sequentially. How can that business be down sequentially on an absolute basis and the underlying trends in the business be getting better?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Seasonality. Don't forget seasonality is a big deal. That quarter is always down significantly sequentially because of the summer months.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Jaime on for Rich. A quick question that I had, I guess, you guys had announced a agreement with Porter Instruments (sic) [Porter Instrument] within your Medical Aesthetics business. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the strategy there and how it might influence your revenue projections for the Medical Aesthetics business in 2019?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, Jaime. It's really an ancillary product that we're distributing that helps reduce the pain for the patients. So it's a \u2013 basically, it's a nitrogen oxide product that patients can take. In the grand scheme, relatively small revenue, but complementary to the procedure and enhances the patient experience for a lot of the other products and procedures that we sell. But it should be starting to be somewhat meaningful as we go forward.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. And strategically, I think it illustrates what we can do as we can build out our sales force, right?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","We'll have one of the larger and more well-equipped sales forces in the industry. So the ability to bring our own organic innovations is one piece and then hopefully, look for some in-license type opportunities as well.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the Surgical business, I don't know if I maybe missed it, but did you guys give an actual range for what you're expecting that business to grow in 2019? And if so, can you talk a little bit about the cadence? I know it's shown sequential improvement here in fiscal 2018. So is it fair to assume that that can continue to accelerate in 2019? Thanks.","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. What we said is we expect low- to mid-single-digit growth for that division and it's really a couple of elements there. We expect on NovaSure to have lower declines versus 2018. But we do expect to have MyoSure continue to grow in the high single-digit, maybe low double-digit range, as well as contribution from our new Fluent product that was recently launched.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","One thing to keep in mind on the pacing of that, I mean, there is a little bit of seasonality in Surgical. Our December quarter, which is our Q1, tends to be a little bit stronger and then the Q2 tends to sequentially get a little less and then it builds over the course of the years. So just keep that in mind as you're modeling.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Daniel Brennan with UBS.","Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. I was just hoping to get a \u2013 first question would be just on the virology opportunity. Maybe you can provide some color what the traction's been so far, U.S. versus OUS, and what's kind of assumed in fiscal 2019 for virology?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. You know what? We've been very pleased with the virology uptake. We've always described this as a \u2013 I always think about it as a thin slice of pie that each quarter, when we look at our graphs, each quarter is selling more both domestically and internationally. But it's a multiyear build. And as we've continued to say, even in the U.S., a lot of major contracts were locked up for a while, so we're building it nicely over time. And I think it'll be bigger in 2019 than it was in 2018, be bigger in 2020 than it will be in 2019, and probably bigger in 2021 than in 2020. So just kind of keeps building steadily, frankly, in a very nice pace.","Daniel Gregory Brennan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Steve. And then maybe on the OUS opportunity, obviously, it's been a big driver. I think you provided guidance for high single-digit, given that you've now comped out those two acquisitions of the distributors. But maybe provide some color regarding the underlying drivers from here. What are some of the biggest opportunities OUS that still might be untapped or ahead of you? Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. It's almost franchise-by-franchise. I think we've got a much stronger presence for Breast Health now, certainly with now having direct operations in Germany, Spain, as well as the UK, feeling really good about our European business and just the underlying capabilities to drive both the gantries, but also starting to get into the Interventional space, products like Brevera and those things as well over time.","Diagnostics, we've been making great progress. As we mentioned, almost 40% of our Panthers are now outside the United States. So we've been getting good traction with our women's health assays, also obviously the virals as well outside the U.S. And our Surgical business, while still small internationally, has been showing really nice growth as well. So I think we see opportunities there, and frankly Medical Aesthetics will be as well outside. It sounds like we have time for two more questions.","Operator","I think we have time for two more questions. We'll take our next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for fitting me in.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Karleen, a couple of \u2013 hi \u2013 a couple of clarifications. I may have missed it, but did you give a specific revenue guide up down for Medical Aesthetics for the year?","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. I think for the year we expect Medical Aesthetics to grow kind of in the low- to mid-single-digits.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great.","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","And really we do expect that women's health is going to be a headwind for that business next year.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And guidance for net interest expense?","Karleen Marie Oberton - Hologic, Inc.","So I think we just said it's going to be up over the current year \u2013 maybe up about $50 million.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On a broader one \u2013 got you. And then just a bigger question, Steve, in the Breast Health market, obviously your biggest competitor in that market is a tad distracted at the moment. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? What's going on? I guess how much of your market opportunity of that -- of competitor installed base do you think is up for grabs?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","We like to think it's all up for grabs. I would say pragmatically the sales reps aren't nearly as distracted as corporate management is. So at the field, we don't always feel those things quite as much as the rest of us might. Having said that I think we just continue to innovate. We are one or two generations ahead of certainly that competitor. And they still haven't matched frankly what we've been selling a couple of years ago. So I think we just continue to innovate and feel very good about our progress at the Street level. And it's why I think we're gaining market share every single year right now and expect to continue to do so.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question. We'll take our final question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Andrew Brackmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. This is actually Andrew Brackmann on for Brian. Two questions on Panther. I'll just ask them upfront. I think you said the utilization last year grew low-double digits. Could you maybe talk about what's implied in your guidance for this year? And then maybe could you talk a little bit more about the competitive landscape there? Are you seeing anything different? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. I think we assume frankly for additional Panthers, we'll continue to place more Panthers and we'll continue to get a little more usage from each Panther that's out there. The competitive landscape, I don't think it's dramatically different. Obviously as we become a bigger player, particularly on a global stage, not just in the U.S., we're running into other strong competitors around the world. But I wouldn't say we're seeing anything materially different.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. This is all the time we have for questions today.

Cascella","Thanks, Deb, and good afternoon and thank you for dialing into our second quarter call. Joining me on today's call is Glenn Muir, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Peter Soltani, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Women's Health; and David Harding, Senior Vice President and General Manager of International Operations.","Today, we're going to summarize the second quarter results. I'll give you an update on our 3D tomosynthesis. We'll also discuss our Diagnostic franchise, including where we stand with the integration of Gen-Probe and our progress in achieving targeted synergies, and provide a brief overview in some of our other key businesses. I'll then turn the call over to Glenn to discuss our financial results and guidance. And then as Deb said, we'll open the call up for Q&A.","Before I begin, I would like to put into perspective the quarter's results and how they relate to our overall business thesis. Although we experienced some volatility in our second quarter revenue, our business fundamentals remained solid. This quarter's revenue shortfall was caused by a few specific events, which I will detail momentarily. But the longer-term opportunities Hologic represents have not wavered a bit. Tomo uptake is extraordinary, given external circumstances. The Gen-Probe acquisition has significantly strengthened our Diagnostic business, and the added synergies we've been discussing with you are becoming a reality. The mid- to long-term growth profile for Hologic is extremely attractive across multiple product lines. We have assembled the necessary products to drive sustainable growth and have a solid business case for each of our franchises.","I'll now turn to some of the details in the quarter. Glenn will discuss this in much greater detail, but in summary, adjusted Q2 revenues were $619 million. They were 31% higher than last year, though below the guidance range we provided on our last quarterly call. On a pro forma basis, revenues were flat to last year. Solid expense management, combined with the benefits of cost synergies related to our acquisition of Gen-Probe, allowed us to deliver EPS of $0.35, which was ahead of our guidance. To summarize, the major elements of the shortfall were related specifically to the following. Our China ThinPrep business experienced some disruption, as we restructured our sales organization with a combination of dealers and direct to gain broader coverage of the market. Although we believe this is recoverable, it penalized our revenues by nearly $8 million in the quarter. In the U.S., ThinPrep also experienced some downward pressures, as major labs experienced utilization issues, which created order shortfalls of $4 million off from expectations. And finally, there was a fall-off of 2D mammography as more customers considered tomo purchases. This situation was exacerbated by the scarcity in capital spending dollars on nearly a global basis. This accounted for another $6 million of our shortfall.","In addition to our strong earnings, there were a number of other positive developments in the quarter. Strong 3D tomo uptake continued, as we met our initial goal of placements in the U.S. for the first 2 years post-approval. The highly anticipated Oslo study was formally published and demonstrated a strong result for 3D, with substantial improvement in cancer detection rates and fewer false positives versus conventional 2D alone. We also had 2 other important studies. The Italian STORM screening study published online in The Lancet Oncology, and the Stephen Rose study from Houston Breast Imaging, which was recently accepted for publication in the American Journal of Roentgenology, both with equally compelling results.","Synergies from the Gen-Probe acquisition continue to track ahead of plan and are expected to exceed $60 million in the first year versus our initial target of $40 million.","I'd now like to talk about 3D tomo and our commercial efforts around that product. Overall, we experienced strong demand for the product and remain pleased with the growth of adoption. Importantly, we remain on track to more than double our installed base of domestic tomo systems during fiscal '13. In the U.S., we continued to see the same dynamic we discussed last quarter, whereby increasing demand for 3D tomo was largely offset by a corresponding decrease in 2D digital systems. In fact, the reality in the U.S. market is the majority of customers want to buy tomo, but struggle with budget approval and the logistics of a partial practice conversion. And what I mean by that is they're struggling to sort out how they can buy just 1 unit. Following the publication of the Oslo study, our quote activity grew by 38%, indicating a significantly stronger interest in the product. This quote activity has nearly doubled what we experienced last year and currently double that of the interest in 2D systems.","Competitively, the facts are still clear. We have the only 3D tomo system in the market in the U.S., with limited competition outside the U.S. We are achieving more competitive displacement in the U.S. and Europe markets as more marquee customers decide they can no longer wait for tomo, as it is being viewed as the best-in-class technology. We have more confidence than ever in the adoption of 3D, with the primary constraint on its growth related to the tight capital spending environment. In the near term, higher interest in 3D and limited capital budget dollars have accelerated the decline in 2D demand beyond what would normally be expected in a replacement cycle. Nonetheless, the overall outlook remains compelling as we penetrate the $4 billion U.S. digital market.","From a reimbursement perspective, as we said we would do after key clinical studies were published, we began formal discussions with CMS to request a reimbursement code. In early April, we had our first meeting with CMS, where we presented clinical data, including the results of the Oslo study. In addition, data from other U.S. studies were also reviewed. At the same time as our discussions go on with CMS, we are engaged in discussions with private payers in an effort to establish reimbursement, irrespective of the timing of obtaining a CMS reimbursement code. Our expected time frame remains the same as what we previously communicated, and we anticipate having an interim or alternative reimbursement code in place by the end of the calendar year.","Now I'd like to talk a little bit about the other businesses, and I'll start with the Diagnostic segment. Overall, we experienced some challenges in our legacy Diagnostic business, specifically within cytology. And as a result, our total Diagnostic business was effectively flat on a year-over-year pro forma basis. That said, I do want to emphasize key product growth drivers, where our molecular business experienced solid growth and market share gains.","I'll give you a little bit of an update on PANTHER. We remain very pleased with the ongoing launch of the PANTHER system, as placements continue to exceed our expectations. Glenn will report on some of the details, but as we said on our last call, we have begun transitioning from an initial focus of DTS customer conversions to new accounts. This strategy is already resulting in some critical new account wins. It is important to understand these recent wins have yet to appear on our results due to lag time associated with both the validation process and the transition of test volumes from prior platforms. This could take potentially 3 to 6 months to realize. But to put some perspective on this, we have closed a total of 48 new accounts this past quarter alone, with 23 of them being in the U.S. and the balance from international. We are finding interest in PANTHER is driven not only by its superior automation capabilities, but also a significant interest among lab customers for consolidating, expanding test menus onto a single platform. While our APTIMA assays for CT\/GC and Trichomonas have broad appeal, we expect an acceleration in wins from accounts currently using competitive systems once we have HPV approved on PANTHER, which we expect before the end of the fiscal year. This system has broad appeal from large to mid to even smaller labs. Remember, PANTHER represents a strong economic opportunity for a lab running as few as 25 tests per day.","A little bit about HPV. This franchise continues to demonstrate impressive growth, increasing more than 45% on a year-over-year basis. We estimate our market share is above 20% and will be firmly in the mid-20s by year-end. APTIMA HPV experienced its strongest quarter ever, and we're starting to see key account wins based on our competitive advantages in automation and specificity. These developments represent real inroads in the market and are a great example of the revenue synergies we discussed at the time of our acquisition. In fact, there are a number of high-volume regional labs that have already contracted in validating APTIMA HPV, and those in the very late stages of evaluation. As stated, we believe HPV assay adoption will grow even more quickly when available on PANTHER.","Similarly, for APTIMA Trichomonas, we are seeing a compelling growth opportunity, as we continue to build out the market for molecular-based testing. Trich revenues are maintaining a high double-digit growth rate and, in the quarter, grew 57% over last year. During the quarter, we received clearance for APTIMA Trich to run on PANTHER, and we expect this to drive further growth.","Even our flagship molecular product, our APTIMA Combo 2 for Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing grew 7% in the quarter, with international growing more than 15% and the U.S. market growing 6% on the strength of our market leadership and competitive takeaways. This is another example of our revenue synergies.","Overall, we were quite pleased with the performance of Gen-Probe in the quarter. The women's health molecular business grew 10% over the pro forma results from prior year. Glenn's going to cover the diagnostic details on our legacy business, but I would like to comment. In the past, we have talked about a 2% to 3% annual erosion rate for liquid-based cytology in the U.S. This quarter, some labs and other market participants stated a market decline of as much as 8% to 10%. We believe this is the result of an increasing adoption of screening guidelines, causing the interval between exams to expand. Our ThinPrep business has declined approximately 7% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. We believe our less-than-market erosion rate is due largely to competitive account conversions offset by the timing of some large lab orders, which we feel will be recoverable. Consequently, we are increasing our net erosion rate to 4% to 5% for the balance of the year, up from the 2% to 3% erosion we had previously quoted.","So as we look at our Diagnostic business today, our molecular diagnostics product continued to generate attractive growth and represent the future of the franchise. That's consistent with a broader view of the industry, which recognizes that molecular is the part of the market that will continue to generate the highest growth rates. Our acquisition of Gen-Probe positions us to remain at the forefront of this higher growth market segment, with a strong product portfolio and the ability to drive future revenue synergies. With respect to our more mature products, specifically ThinPrep, we will focus the U.S. business on account conversions and believe international opportunities for growth remains strong. In addition, these product lines are highly profitable and strong cash contributors to our overall business.","Now to move on to Surgical. Here, again, Glenn will talk about the details, but I wanted to talk about some of the subtleties in the business. MyoSure has turned out to be a strong growth driver for the company. We are achieving a revenue run rate of around $65 million annually, with what we believe to be, still, an early market penetration. NovaSure remains under pressure in the U.S., where healthcare economics work against this otherwise extremely powerful technology. I do not believe we will have very select o-US growth opportunities for this product in places like Europe, China and Brazil, where we are already seizing these opportunities. So despite the challenges NovaSure poses in the U.S., the outlook for our overall GYN Surgical business remains attractive, based on international expansion and the continued impressive growth of MyoSure.","In summary, we are confident that we are executing the right strategy to position Hologic to achieve long-term and sustainable growth across our franchises. In Breast Health, it is no longer a matter of if tomo becomes successful, but rather when. This is a $4 billion opportunity in the U.S. and potentially another $3 billion abroad. All early market indicators are very strong, and the product is performing beyond expectations.","As we have stated in the past, the early phase of market adoption will be lumpy, but there is solid evidence 3D tomo will continue to accelerate for the next 3 to 5 years. With respect to Diagnostics, the strength that the Gen-Probe acquisition has brought to the business is now a reality. The purpose of this acquisition was to provide a growth driver for our mature ThinPrep franchise, and although early, it is doing just that.","We are seeing solid growth across all of our molecular product lines. Our cost and expense synergies are growing, as we accelerate our consolidation ahead of schedule. We are now seeing the power of our revenue synergies with multiple account conversions in the U.S., driven by the power of our physician sales team, and international growth rates for even the more mature product lines, like CT\/GC, are averaging in the mid-teens.","For Surgical, the U.S. market maturity of NovaSure will be more than offset by the growth potential of MyoSure as it becomes a more substantial piece of this segment. In the meantime, pricing is stable and operating margins are over 40%, a 10-percentage-point improvement over a year ago.","Finally, our deleveraging strategy remains intact, as we continue to generate strong profitability and cash flow.","In summary, we firmly believe that our leading-edge products and commitment to fiscal discipline will continue to drive strong profitability and long-term growth for Hologic.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn to talk a little bit more about the numbers.","Glenn P. Muir","Thank you, Rob. Second quarter non-GAAP consolidated revenues increased 31.4% due to the addition of Gen-Probe, and foreign currency had a negligible impact on revenues. On an apples-to-apples basis, pro forma revenue growth was flat compared to the prior year, when adjusted to include Gen-Probe for Q2 of last year and to exclude divested businesses, such as LIFECODES and Adiana, in both quarters. I will detail the reasons, starting with our largest segment.","Diagnostics revenues represented 49% of total revenues this quarter, increasing $151.1 million or 99.5%. On a pro forma basis, which includes Gen-Probe revenues from a year ago and excludes revenues from our divested businesses, Diagnostics revenues were essentially flat, and below our forecasted pro forma growth of low- to mid-single digits. We experienced a sharper decline in the legacy Diagnostics business than expected, which was offset by growth in the Gen-Probe molecular business. Within our legacy Diagnostics business, the overall ThinPrep revenues declined 7% year-over-year, caused mainly by a shortfall in China and lower major lab purchases in The States. The China shortfall was largely due to the disruption caused by our restructuring of our sales channel. The purpose of the restructuring is to provide broader coverage into multiple market tiers and provinces as we introduce our expanded portfolio. We believe this is recoverable, but it will take some time.","In addition, as Bob indicated, in the U.S., we experienced a larger-than-expected decline in ThinPrep volume due to delays in orders from large lab customers, leading to a decline in volumes beyond what we would normally expect as it relates to interval expansion. The good news is ThinPrep is gaining market share as a result of recent competitive wins against our major liquid-based cytology competitor, who continues to be challenged with regard to HPV testing from their sample vial. This has created a much higher rate of account conversions in the quarter, and as a result, we believe the overall U.S. market will continue to erode. But this accelerated erosion will be partially offset by share gains in the marketplace.","Gen-Probe's revenues increased 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, which excludes the contributions from divested businesses in both periods. This solid growth came from strong results for our clinical Diagnostics products, which were up high-single digits on a pro forma basis. Notably, our APTIMA Combo 2 for CT\/GC was the largest contributor to growth this quarter, and we were especially pleased with the robust growth from our recent portfolio additions, such as Trichomonas and HPV. The blood screening business grew 2%, consistent with our outlook for that business.","Breast Health revenues represented 35% of total sales and increased $1.4 million or 0.7%. This increase was below the mid-single-digit guidance we provided last quarter. Total segment revenue growth was driven by a low double-digit increase in service revenues, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in product revenues. This is a continuation of the dynamic we reported last quarter, specifically the ongoing mix shift to our superior 3D tomo platform from our legacy 2D Selenia product lines. This quarter, on a dollar basis, our worldwide 2D mammo systems were down 20% year-over-year, and our 3D systems were up 30%.","Looking at our Dimensions product lines, that is both our 2D dimensions alone and also our 3D tomo systems. They represented 75% of worldwide digital mammography product revenues and 63% of units sold this quarter. Order growth during the period drove a 29% sequential increase in backlog of worldwide mammography systems at quarter end on a unit basis. As it relates specifically to 3D tomo units, this quarter, we saw a 34% increase in sales order bookings and a 98% increase in backlog, both year-over-year. The strong order rate driving our backlog continues to increase and represents an important data point, supporting our belief that the adoption curve not only remains strong but also appears to be on an improving trend. We are very pleased with the strong interest, growth and increasing adoption of our Dimensions product lines, including 3D tomo.","GYN Surgical revenues represented 12% of total sales and declined $3.5 million or 4.5% this quarter on a reported basis. Excluding Adiana in both periods, GYN Surgical sales increased 1.4% compared to last year, below the guidance of mid single-digit growth we provided last quarter. On a geographic basis, domestic sales were essentially flat year-over-year as a result of lower NovaSure sales. However, our outside the U.S. business grew over 18%. Although NovaSure declined in the high single digits, we are confident we are not losing market share within the endometrial ablation market. As Rob explained earlier, we continue to experience the headwinds we cited last quarter, in the form of high-patient deductibles and the continued emergence of lower-cost, non-GEA alternatives, which pressured results again this quarter.","Further challenging NovaSure sales is the increase in payers adopting mandatory treatment pathways that place a higher priority on initiating therapy with lower-cost drugs and IUD treatments. This trend is unlikely to change with the further implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The overall decline in NovaSure was offset by another quarter of very strong performance from MyoSure. MyoSure sales continued to increase substantially, with revenues increasing nearly 80% year-over-year. This business is at a run rate of around $65 million annually. And the product is still at the early stage of adoption, with only very minor contribution from international as yet. We remain very optimistic about the longer-term growth outlook for MyoSure.","Next, a brief review of second quarter non-GAAP performance on the rest of the P&L. Our gross margins were 62.6%, up 140 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially, and within our guidance range despite the lower revenue. The strength in margins was primarily the result of geographic and product mix, namely the weakness in international markets, which tend to have lower selling prices than in the U.S., as well as the shift from 2D to higher-priced 3D mammography systems, and from sales of Adiana to the higher-margin MyoSure. Year-over-year Breast Health and Surgical posted higher margins for these reasons, and Diagnostics posted lower margins, primarily due to the decrease in cytology sales, which were partially offset by Gen-Probe.","Operating expenses increased $46.3 million or 31.2%, to $195 million, representing 31% of sales compared to 32% last year. In addition, expenses were down almost 2% sequentially and were $10 million or 5% below the low end of our guidance range. Compared to guidance, expenses were lower due to our ability to gain operating leverage and manage expenses in the face of challenging times. I would like to emphasize the areas in which we managed expenses did not come from activities that generate revenue or support future growth, but rather from operating cost-saving initiatives, as well as from the realization of cost synergies from the Gen-Probe acquisition. Importantly, we are increasing the amount of Gen-Probe cost synergies we are expecting this year to just over $60 million, up from our previous guidance of $40 million. And as a result, net income of $93.8 million this quarter was in line with our expectations and resulted in EPS of $0.35 this quarter, which was above our guidance range of $0.33 to $0.34.","Now turning to the balance sheet. As of March 30, our cash and equivalents totaled $752 million, which was up $186 million from the end of fiscal '12 and $32 million from the end of the first quarter, reflecting another period of focused working capital management, contributing to strong free cash flow generation. Note that several of the cash flow drivers in the second quarter are consistent with prior years. Sequentially, our second quarter included higher cash outflows as a result of the timing of tax payments of approximately $80 million as compared to less than $5 million in Q1, higher interest payments totaling approximately $60 million as a result of payments on our various debt instruments, contingent consideration payments to former Interlace shareholders of just under $90 million. And lastly, this quarter was the first quarter we incurred the medical device tax, which was $6.5 million. One item to note that added positively to our cash inflow this quarter was the approximate $85 million cash receipt for the sale of our LIFECODES business. However, we excluded this amount for purposes of our non-GAAP results and free cash flow guidance for the year, and did the same with the contingent consideration payment to Interlace.","Our total debt obligations stand at $5 billion, resulting in a ratio of total debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 4.5. We remain committed to reducing this ratio to 2.5 by the end of fiscal 2015. For operating free cash flow guidance for the fiscal year, we are maintaining our original guidance of $600 million based on the continued earnings strength. As a reminder, we have continued to define this measure as cash before the Gen-Probe financing of $3.5 billion, in order to highlight the cash flow available for interest and debt repayment. Our expected free cash flow is net of both working capital adjustments and capital spending, including equipment we place at customer sites, which together approximate $100 million per year. It does not include proceeds from divestitures, such as KV Pharmaceutical or LIFECODES, nor does it include the contingent consideration payment for acquisitions, which, for fiscal 2013, are expected to be slightly over $200 million.","To achieve our stated goal of improving our balance sheet condition, we completed 2 financial transactions during the second fiscal quarter. The first transaction occurred in February, when we exchanged $370 million of outstanding convertible notes that were expected to be put to us in December 2013 for equivalent convertible notes with the same strike price. Then in March, we repriced both the $1 billion Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility, which lowered the interest rate on each by 100 basis points, from LIBOR plus 3% to LIBOR plus 2%. The convert exchange will provide us with additional debt repayment flexibility, so we can pay higher interest term loan debt sooner. It doesn't change our original expectation of approximately $775 million of debt reduction by the end of the calendar year. The Term Loan A refinancing was to take advantage of lower available interest rates and should drive annual savings of approximately $10 million.","Switching to guidance, our expectations are fully detailed in the earnings release and our supplementary PowerPoint presentation, both which are posted on our IR website.","For the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect revenues in the range of $625 million to $630 million, representing year-over-year growth of 33% to 34%. On a pro forma basis, excluding the divested businesses, we expect growth of approximately 2.5%. We do not expect any more purchase accounting adjustments relating to our Novartis collaboration. Our guidance assumes currency rates consistent with the average rate during Q2 '13, the continued ramp-up of new products, including the Dimensions, PANTHER and MyoSure system. In Q3 of the prior year, Adiana generated revenues of $2.2 million, and LIFECODES had revenues of $11.4 million.","We also expect gross margins of approximately 63% and operating expenses of $190 million to $195 million or approximately 30% to 31% of revenues, up year-over-year, primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe's operating results, and down sequentially from Q2 '13 due to the timing of R&D projects, headcount reductions, cost savings initiatives and increased Gen-Probe synergies. In addition, Q3 of '13 operating expenses include approximately $6 million in additional G&A expense related to the medical device excise tax that went into effect on January 1. We'll have interest expense of approximately $56 million and an effective tax rate of 32%. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately 273 million and diluted EPS in the range of approximately $0.36 to $0.37.","For fiscal 2013, which ends on September 28, we are reducing our non-GAAP revenue guidance to a range of $2.53 billion to $2.55 billion from our previous expectation of $2.61 billion to $2.64 billion. Year-over-year, our new guidance represents an increase in revenues of 26% to 27%, primarily from the inclusion of the Gen-Probe acquisition. And on a pro forma basis, revenues in each of our operating segments will increase low single digits over fiscal 2012. The pro forma growth rate for Diagnostics includes Gen-Probe revenues for the full year of fiscal 2012 and excludes revenues from divested business, primarily from LIFECODES, which totaled $23 million and $45 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. The pro forma growth rate for Surgical excludes Adiana revenues of $11 million in fiscal 2012.","For gross margins, we are reaffirming our guidance of approximately 63%. For operating expense, we are lowering our guidance to $760 million to $770 million, which is approximately 30% of revenues. We now expect to incur approximately $20 million of G&A expense in fiscal 2013 related to the medical device excise tax, and are factoring in just over $60 million in cost synergies relating to the Gen-Probe acquisition.","For interest expense, we are maintaining our guidance of $220 million, and we are reaffirming our expected diluted shares outstanding of 272 million and our effective tax rate of 32%.","And lastly, we are reducing our EPS guidance to a range of $1.54 to $1.56 from $1.58 to $1.60, which results in EPS growth of 11% to 13% over last year. This reduction factors in the lower revenue guidance, coupled with reduced operating expenses from Gen-Probe synergies and other cost-saving initiatives. As a reminder, this EPS guidance includes the impact of the medical device excise tax, which we now expect to be $0.05 dilutive and, if excluded, would drive EPS growth to 15% to 17%.","And with that, I would like to turn the call back to Rob.","Robert A. Cascella","Thanks, Glenn. Just a couple of closing comments. I'll say once again, the fundamental pillars of growth for our business remain strong. Tomo is poised to become the new standard of care in mammography, and all indicators continue to reinforce this outlook. Our portfolio approach, proprietary assays and superior automation position our Diagnostic business to enter new market segments and drive growth over the long term. Although MyoSure is in the early stages of the successful commercialization, we believe it has the potential to accelerate growth of our Surgical business. As a result of these positive indicators, we are reflecting a stronger second half of the year. However, when considering the GAAP required to maintain guidance in light of the U.S. healthcare concerns and unstable European market and a slowdown in all the key parts of the world, we believe it is only prudent for some moderator optimism. Over the mid to longer term, our current product portfolio and development pipeline will drive sustainable growth for Hologic and will continue to be complemented by our strong profitability and cash flow.","I want to thank you for your participation on the call and have the operator open the call up for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Rob, I appreciate your comments on the macro environment, and I think everyone knows it's challenging. But I think one of the stated objectives for management in the last couple of quarters has been guidance was conservative, and obviously, it wasn't as conservative as you hoped. So I guess the first question, can you just explain to us your approach to guidance for the remainder of the year? And how do you convince shareholders that this guidance frankly is achievable?","Robert A. Cascella","Sure. And I think it's a very fair question, David. First off, I think we have strong confidence in our earnings numbers. I think we've done a good job at maintaining costs and expenses, and we are seeing the cost synergies from the Gen-Probe acquisition materializing at a faster rate. More importantly, from a revenue perspective, the things that we commented on, in both my script and Glenn's, has been, on the Breast Health side, we have an increase in backlog, which we believe relates to additional bookings and also, obviously, revenue for the second half of the year. And the other side of what we talked about on our Diagnostic businesses, we have a large number of competitive takeaways. We have market penetration in new areas within the Diagnostic market, all contributing to what we define as our second half revenue. Now keep in mind, our second half has always been stronger. We average somewhere between 3% to 5% higher in the second half than the first half. In this analysis and in this guidance, we are averaging around 3% for fiscal '13, and we're basing that on the strength of what we just saw with bookings rate and backlog in Breast Health, as well as the competitive takeaways that have not yet made their way to revenue on the Diagnostic side.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Very clear. Maybe a follow-up on guidance as well. Your fourth quarter revenue guidance, implied revenue guidance, it looks like it's in line with your historical cyclicality, which you basically just mentioned. The EPS number though, for the fourth quarter, does look stronger than we would normally expect. And if I'm reading that right, and are there any reasons why the fourth quarter earnings number would be materially stronger than the third?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, it's a little -- a fair question. And it's a little bit of some of the things that we talked about earlier. When we look at our -- the ability to leverage costs and expenses, it is completely driven by the fact that not all of our cost basis is fixed -- or variable, I should say. And as a result of that, as revenues increase, not only do we get favorable impacts in manufacturing, but we also are able to leverage the fixed operating expenses, so that our profitability, our operating margin changes by percentage points as a result of that. And that's just math. 90% of our operating expenses are fixed and don't move with revenues. So as we generate higher levels of revenue, it changes the metric relative to our operating returns.","Operator","And we'll now move to Richard Newitter from Leerink Swann.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just maybe, Rob, could you -- last quarter, I think you had some of the same dynamics playing out in the Breast Health division, and you kind of saw a strong backlog of 3D and the trends in 2D, but you left your guidance unchanged. Now you've made some assumptions, clearly, about what kind of acceleration in -- or impact from the deferral of 2D. One, can you quantify what that is for the back half, what kind of year-over-year decline do you think you'll see in 2D? And then two, what gives you confidence that it won't necessarily be worse than what you're anticipating right now, since it was a little bit worse than what you had anticipated as of last quarter?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I think it's a very fair question. As we indicated earlier, it looks as if the 2D fall-off rate is about 20%. We're not expecting that to be dramatically different for the balance of the year. I don't see it improving, and in fact, we're trying to manage it from an erosion perspective. What we're doing defensively, quite frankly, in order to shore that number up, is to really look at the low end of the market, with a lot of the used Selenias that we now have in on trade from our 3D dimension sales, and going after the low end markets in different parts of the world, as well as the low end market that has not yet converted here in the States. Again, as we look at the change in mammography, I think from a positive perspective, we're seeing great quote activity, we're seeing a lot of interest in 3D, but it is causing the 2D replacement market to stall. And what we're doing now is trying to mitigate further erosion with some of the measures that I just talked about. And they're very, very tactical.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Got it. And just a quick follow-up. I may have missed it, but did you provide kind of where you stood with respect to your original kind of initial adopter, 500 to 700?","Robert A. Cascella","We said we were very pleased that we made the range that we had given for the first 2 years after FDA approval and, more importantly, that we were also confident in our more than doubling of the installed base for fiscal '13.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Off of what level?","Robert A. Cascella","Off of the level that we ended fiscal '12 at. So if you did the math as to where we said we were at, which was 60% of the range for fiscal '12, we said that we would more than double the aggregate installed base of tomo units in the United States in '13.","Operator","And we'll now go to Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just looking at the quarter, I don\u2019t think anybody's surprised by the utilization pressures or the comments on 2D mammo, but can you talk to the China dynamic, $8 million hit from the restructuring? I guess just give us some conviction that, that will recover in the near term, and maybe just a little bit more color on the steps you took there.","Robert A. Cascella","Sure. I'll have David Harding comment on those as well. David?","David P. Harding","Yes. Thank you. So we made a concerted decision at the beginning of Q2 to restructure our Diagnostic sales channel in China. We believe that in order to really maximize our growth in this attractive market, we must have a hybrid distribution model made up of both direct- and dealer-based channels. So as we move into a broader set of geographies, we really have to think about redeploying our direct sales teams to the areas of greatest potential and leverage dealers in other markets. The change in the sales channel structure obviously resulted in some sales team disruption and impacted our customer ordering patterns, in what is already a pretty challenging seasonal period due to the lengthy Chinese New Year holidays. To be very specific, we had sales leaders out of the field for certain periods during this restructuring. New dealers had to be qualified, brought on board and trained, and customers had to become acclimated to their new primary contacts, in some cases. And all of this took its toll on the numbers. During our continuing work to optimize the sales channel, we will also be rationalizing our expense profile, so that the overall China profitability remains strong. And as we move into the back half of the year, we're confident that we will drive revenue growth, because I think the fundamentals of the China market are really quite attractive. And while it's highly competitive, it's a great geography as the government continues to invest to broaden healthcare coverage. So we're confident that our revenues will continue to grow.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then Rob, are you able to give us any color on mix for the new tomo customers between academic centers, community hospitals? Just what's the customer profile evolving to look like? And also, any thoughts on C-View?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, sure. I think that the -- and I'll let Peter comment on C-View. I think as far as mix, I think we're seeing many more commercial sites versus academic sites buying tomo today. There are sites that are buying it because they believe in the technology, they believe in the marketing power behind the product as well. And there are sites that are interested in gaining market share within their regional markets. Peter, you may want to give an update on C-View.","Peter K. Soltani","Sure. The -- we're really just waiting -- it's pretty simple. We're just waiting for FDA approval, and we expect that, that will be forthcoming very, very soon, hopefully within a few weeks.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then a quick one for Glenn, and then I'll hop off. You have 1 fewer week in the fourth quarter this year, so I just want to make sure that, that was factored into the segment guidance that you gave earlier.","Glenn P. Muir","Yes, it was.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So are you able to tell us what the segment assumptions are for the fourth quarter then, given 1 fewer week?","Glenn P. Muir","From a revenue growth standpoint, Tycho?","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","And we'll move to Amit Bhalla from Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Glenn, why don't you finish Tycho's question, then I'll ask mine? It was revenue.","Glenn P. Muir","Yes. I think he's talking about revenue. So I think when we get to Q4, we are -- we have tailored our revenue expectations down to the point that, for the fiscal year, we're at low single digits almost across the board in each operating segment. So the extra week, as we talked about before, doesn't really affect any of the capital equipment businesses. It really is on the Diagnostic side of things. But that has been taken into account in the current forecast.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. My questions are -- I don't understand this comment you made about the China decision. How come, Rob, you didn't factor that in when you were giving your guidance for fiscal 2Q? This -- a change in sales like that just doesn't happen overnight. So can you explain that? Why didn't you factor it in? Why didn't you tell us about it last quarter?","Robert A. Cascella","I think it might be a small oversight, and what I mean by that is I think that we thought that much of this could be done in a much more accelerated time frame. But what we really didn't account for is the customer side of the disruption. We knew that the field would be upset because territories were more compressed, the validation process on dealers that we had already identified we thought would be more accelerated. So we had planned this in Q1. We began kicking it off in Q2. And yes, we should have known better. I don't think we anticipated the complications that the market in China would have represented, because we do this all the time in different parts of the world and felt like we had a good process and a good roadmap to affect it.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then my follow-up on Diagnostics. Can you talk about how your -- what your assumptions are for the pricing environment for the remainder of the year in this low single-digit growth assumption? I mean, competition is getting a little bit tougher. What are you thinking about in terms of pricing?","Robert A. Cascella","Well, it's all over the map, right? I mean, I think -- and in the case of ThinPrep, we have a very strong franchise and great market presence. So we're obviously tuned in to taking share away. I think that's incremental revenue for us. So it will be at a more competitive price, but it shouldn't erode our current pricing structure. I would say that in the case of Diagnostics, we have maintained pricing relative to our CT\/GC business. In the areas where we're going after market share, namely in HPV, we have gotten much more aggressive. And you are absolutely right. I think the likes of our competitors in this market are getting very aggressive. I think what we're bringing to bear and what I think has been resonating with our customers is really the power of our automation and the broadness of our menu. I think all of that, linked with the fact that we have this universal transport medium or vial, is giving them a very efficient way for generating high-volume revenue within their labs. So there's a lot of operational efficiencies that we're able to talk about, which allow them to improve gross margins beyond just simple pricing, and that gets back to our automation and this vial strategy.","Operator","We'll now move on to Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just hoping to get an updated snapshot on your x U.S. footprint, specifically just given your China comments. Curious to know a couple of items. First off, just could you maybe ballpark the percentage of sales that you generate in China at this point? As I recall, Asia was about 9% in total and just trying to put that $8 million number in context. And then maybe if you could put some color commentary on the rest of the BRIC nations, Brazil and Russia, that would be helpful.","David P. Harding","Yes. So I think that's about right in terms of a revenue number for China. We look at about 26% of our overall revenues coming from the international market, and China represents a fair chunk of that. So in about that 9% range is more or less accurate. In terms of our overall footprint, our China headcount is large. It represents a major piece of our overall international footprint and will continue to be that way going forward. In terms of the other BRIC nations, they are less peopled, but are very important. If you think about the overall employee footprint, it's largely concentrated in Europe and in China, but we continue to expand in places like Brazil, where we have a lot of excitement going forward. In Russia, we have a few people that cover that market, but it's largely a dealer-based channel. In India, again, a small number of people, largely driven by dealers.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry. Just to clarify, as I understood it, all of Asia was 9%. Is that incorrect?","Glenn P. Muir","That is correct. So China would be a slightly smaller chunk of it.","Robert A. Cascella","And it's about 2\/3 of it.","Glenn P. Muir","Yes.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then if I could just sneak in a follow-up. On just the picture in Gen-Probe, obviously, you guys have a bigger channel than they did. Can you update us on where you are in distributing Gen-Probe's products, specifically in Europe and Japan?","Robert A. Cascella","I think that for the most part, the European team is trained. We've had good success in terms of market growth, as I indicated, even our very mature CT\/GC business was up 15% on a pro forma year-over-year basis. So we're pleased with the uptake. On an international basis, we're probably seeing, I think, equal successes in different markets, but we are going through product registration processes that can take 6 months to 1 year to complete. So the market that we are most successful in today is Europe, but we believe that, that will branch into China and Japan over this next year.","David P. Harding","Yes, just to add a little bit. This is David. We are, in fact, transitioning to our direct business in Japan. So that will take place in the coming quarter, and we feel that we can drive a lot of incremental sales as a result of that. In China, we are still awaiting registration and approvals from the Chinese government, before we can begin fully deploying our sales team there against the core Gen-Probe product line.","Operator","And we'll now go to Vijay Kumar from ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to touch on the whole reimbursement discussion. You mentioned that you had your -- initially met with CMS. You were also in talks with private payers, and there has been some question marks in the marketplace, where the 3D tomo wouldn't necessarily get a $50 incremental. And people often cite cost benefit analysis. And I'm just curious if you could comment on this thought and sort of how those initial discussions have gone relative to your expectations.","Robert A. Cascella","I would say that the -- and Peter will comment as well. Of course, I would say that private pay is very interested in a cost benefit analysis. And, in fact, that is the reason why, irrespective of the timeline with CMS, that we have private pay interest. I mean, look, we can reduce the number of callbacks, we can reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. And, in fact, just the fact that we find more cancers earlier saves money. So that part of the argument works very, very well. And our modeling around that argument, I think, is compelling. With CMS, I think it's really going to be a matter of really suggesting that this is a beneficial technology. And, in fact, it's not as much about cost savings as it is about patient benefits, particularly the Medicare patient population, because that's what their focus is. And we've been able to effectively demonstrate that there is a reduction in recall and higher sensitivity, even with Medicare. And, in fact, in some studies, it's been enhanced for Medicare patients as well. Peter, you may want to add...","Peter K. Soltani","Well, I would just emphasize the importance of the health economic aspects of tomo and some of the additional burdens, in terms of equipment costs and the reading physicians, that would warrant an additional reimbursement. So, again, we're very optimistic that we'll get the right outcome.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And now I just want to go back to the China restructuring. Not to beat a dead horse, but I mean, if you look at the competitor commentary, utilization in the U.S. is down anywhere from mid- to high-single digits. And if you look at the magnitude of miss, $4 million in the U.S. versus $8 million in China. Can you just talk to us -- like what gives you the confidence like those steps can be remedied? Like what's the time frame which it's going to take for sales to come back?","David P. Harding","I think we're very confident that sales are going to come back in Q3. If you just sort of look at the pattern, Q1 was very strong. As you know, Q2 is seasonally very weak, in general. And then add on top of it these restructuring activities, we're very confident that it's going to pop back in Q3 and Q4.","Robert A. Cascella","I think the other point we might make when we think about China and the miss on China is just to restate that, that is actually a miss from what we had been forecasting to do in that territory as opposed to a comparison with the prior year. I mean, the China business was still a strong business. It is down a little bit year-over-year, but the miss that we're talking about was our expectation for continued revenue ramp in this particular quarter. So it still is a great business for us.","Operator","And we'll now move to Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","My first one is really a math question. I want to take a different angle on a question that was asked earlier. You've cut your total full year forecast for operating spend by just about $35 million. It sounds like almost half of this is incremental Gen-Probe synergies. Is the balance simply the drop through on a lower revenue number? Or are there other areas you've cut? And then building off of this, it seems like your operating spend will be, by far, the lowest in the fourth quarter, I believe around $180 million. This implies incrementals in the 70s. Is there any reason we shouldn't be cognizant of that as we contemplate how to model out spend in subsequent quarters and, for that matter, operating cash flow? I just want to make sure there's no calendar effect on expenses or some expense that was pushed out of this fiscal year into next.","Robert A. Cascella","Yes. I'll give you one summary on just the balance in addition to Gen-Probe synergies, and they will happen overtime over the course of this year. And, in fact, some of those involve facility closure and so on and so forth. So you may see an uneven weighting from 1 quarter to the next. But in addition to Gen-Probe, we've taken a hard look and have continued to take a hard look at all of the businesses, and are looking at areas where the company may have had an excessive expense structure or unnecessary costs and expenses and so on and so forth. So we have very selectively, over the last 6 months, have been doing much to consolidate. We closed another facility and we announced that earlier, not this quarter. That had nothing to do with the Gen-Probe business. It was all part of the biopsy business. And all of that is an effort to try to consolidate facilities and personnel. But Glenn, you may want to comment on the balance of what's in the year.","Glenn P. Muir","Yes. No, I think Doug hit it right on. When we look at our expense forecast for the remainder of the year, it does, number one, now include the Gen-Probe cost synergies, which are much better than when we started the year. We are now seeing just over $60 million for the full fiscal year in Gen-Probe cost synergies. That was factored in, as well as these overall Hologic cost initiatives, saving initiatives. So we don't tend to add expenses even though we had revenue growth in our original plan. We don't add hiring or expenses in advance of that revenue. So we were very aggressive in dialing it back for Q3 and Q4. So when we look at Q4, Doug, it is a range of expenses, but the $180 million you quoted is within that range that we would be expecting. There's really no onetime expenses that are lower that we would point to. If I look at FY '14 though, and I think you're alluding to what -- how to model it going forward. As a reminder, we all know Q1, we are hit with some higher marketing expenses for RSNA, but that's not really the point. I think if we get to FY '14 and we begin to trend up on the revenue side, well, at that point, the operating expenses will increase. So they won't stay at a low level of Q4, hopefully, forever. I would expect them to begin to trend up, but that trending to trail our revenue growth. Right now, we're looking at operating expenses at 30% of total revenue. So we've constantly lowered that from 33% down to 30%. So we've made great strides on the cost side, which you can imagine with -- on the gross margin side, leaves us with operating margin now well over 30%. So we're in the 31%, 32% for operating margin before tax. So we're in a pretty good situation from that standpoint. I would also point out with some of these cost savings, not all of the savings affect just operating costs. There will be a little bit of a gross margin improvement as well, with some of these cost initiatives. So we actually do have a greater sense of comfort when we give guidance, on the gross margin guidance we gave of approximately 63%. So I think Q3 and Q4, from an earnings standpoint, we would expect to continue to look fairly strong.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's all really helpful. And I guess if I could ask a follow-up or, really, a separate question on ThinPrep. I know it wasn't the best quarter, but at the same time, you talked about share gains, which, for what it's worth, is consistent with what we've heard about in some of our recent checks. What inning do you think you are in this initiative? And how do you weigh the risk that a customer who's inclined to move to APTIMA HPV might not, because co-testing isn't available to them on another platform from a competitor? And are you still planning to seek approval for co-testing on non-ThinPrep vials?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, sure. I think to the first part of the question, I think we're really early on. We're probably 2 quarters into what we defined as a much more aggressive campaign to really go after account conversions. Our intent would still be to get validated for the SurePath vial. I think the difficulty today is that no one is, and I think that's what's created some of the issues. So we recognize that that's part of the market, and we certainly don't want to have an impediment against our APTIMA HPV because of that limitation.","Operator","And we'll now go to Bill Bonello from Craig-Hallum.","William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","So I just have a question, too, on the Diagnostics business. In terms of cervical cancer overall, I mean, as you look down the road, do you view this as a growing product area for you? In other words, can the gains in ThinPrep share and the growth in HPV, is that enough to offset the accelerated interval expansion in cytology testing, in general? And sort of if so, how do you think about the potential growth in that business overall?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes. I mean, look, it's a very fair question. We think, over the next 3 to 5 years, that there is an acceleration in the erosion of the U.S.-based cytology business. But we also think that co-testing becomes a much bigger part of that market from an HPV testing perspective. So there is a bit of normalization even though the interval expansion could be 3 years or more. And I know some of our contemporaries have commented on what doctors now are complying with, those guidelines. More importantly, however, is that we see pockets of growth for both product lines in different parts of the world. We think that there are markets that have not made a decision outside of conventional Pap, that are substantial markets, Germany, for instance. We think that the market penetration in a place like China is very early on. For that matter, Japan is very early on. And that's probably -- some of those are not markets where co-testing will prevail, and they will either be cytology markets or they'll be HPV or DNA and genetic testing market. I think beyond that, Latin America is wide open as well, and we see those as opportunities. So I don't -- I think if we look at the cervical cancer screening from a U.S.-centric perspective, I think it ends up becoming a trade-off. I mean, we are winning today and growing that business quite simply because we don't have much of a presence in HPV, and we are changing that. But without a doubt, the cytology market will decline as a result. Now we can gain more share, but at some point, the cytology market erosion in the U.S. will outpace the ability to gain more share in the U.S. Where we see the opportunities for both of those products is on a global basis. And that's where I think that, if we start looking at the future, and what I mean by the future is maybe the next 3, 5 and even 7 years, I think we see stronger growth on an o-US basis for either one of those products than where we are standing today.","William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just when I think about your PANTHER placement and the competitive wins that you talked about, how is that playing out in terms of kind of what you expected for PANTHER placements and wins when you first contemplated doing the Gen-Probe acquisition?","Robert A. Cascella","I'll answer 2 ways. I mean, one, just from a metric perspective, we're ahead of plan relative to placements. Two, the product is extraordinary. I talked about workflow benefits and operational efficiencies. I talked about the ability to now add menu to that product. It has been so well-received in each of the scenarios that we have applied it to, that it gives us great confidence about just the overall potential of that product from a longer-term perspective. So I think one, again, reiterate, it's exceeded expectations. And, in fact, we believe that when HPV is approved on PANTHER, that not only will we close more HPV accounts, we'll close more CT\/GC accounts with it, because what people are waiting for is a complete STD menu on that product. And it has the capabilities to do that. And it has the features and functionality to make random sampling a reality, so that you get workflow efficiencies, as well as a full menu. So we're ultimately -- and if you haven't gotten it from my comment, we're ultimately very, very excited about it.","Operator","We'll now go to Anthony Petrone from Jefferies Group.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple on Gen-Probe. I don't know, Glenn, if you can just review maybe the blood screening trends in the quarter. And maybe a higher-level question, can you review what major contracts are still up for bid this year on the blood screening side? And then I have a follow-up.","Glenn P. Muir","Yes, there's really not a major bid up for this year. That's a fairly stable business. And for this year, we're looking for it to be up 2%. So it actually dragged down. I commented on Gen-Probe being up 6%. Well, the blood screening did drag that percent down a little bit. But that would look to be stable. The growth in blood screening will come in the future, especially if you look at some of the Asian countries out there. China has some tenders out there. There's one in Thailand, we're working on, I believe. But those are all -- they don't kick in for a couple of years. There's one for Japan that they're looking at. But once again, these are a couple of years out. These are long-term contracts at this point.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just a follow-up there on the operating cost side. You mentioned the $50 million or so in cost savings through this year. Can you just review for us what are the savings from LIFECODES, the sale of LIFECODES and how much is in that $50 million number? And then just what type of portfolio pruning potentially could you see later in this year that can also help that number?","Glenn P. Muir","Yes. Well, we did include -- there was a little bit of disconnect concerning LIFECODES last quarter, because we did not anticipate owning it beyond December and had to readjust our cost guidance -- cost expense guidance for the full fiscal year. We increased it by $10 million to take into account having LIFECODES for this quarter. And we hit just under that. I mean, the actual expenses at LIFECODES in Q2 were $8 million or $9 million on revenues of a little bit over $11 million. That's now done. So when we look at the remainder of the year, that LIFECODES is kind of already reflected in our full year's forecast of $760 million to $770 million. As we look at pruning, we have pruned the big pieces at this point. We always look at the portfolio, and we'll continue to do so. But I don't see another big piece that will come in play this fiscal year.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Robert A.

We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. It was a very strong quarter overall, as total revenue of $830.7 million and earnings per share of $0.58 both finished ahead of our guidance ranges.","As we preannounced before the JPMorgan conference, our first quarter performance was again led by our largest core businesses: U.S. Breast Health, International and Global Molecular Diagnostics, all of which posted double-digit constant currency growth to start our fiscal year. These strong revenue results continued the positive momentum that started to build in the second half of 2018 after we reorganized our leadership team earlier in the year. They represent progress in our efforts to accelerate growth by focusing on our core strengths, especially in Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, and the efforts we began several years ago to dramatically transform the productivity and output of our R&D teams to create a much more robust stream of new products.","In Breast Health, we are building on our large installed base of market-leading, clinically differentiated Genius 3D Mammography systems. Specifically, we have launched new mammography systems that help us segment the market better, developed new products that enable us to play a greater role in the patient's Breast Health journey, grown our service revenue and acquired two small companies to enter the adjacent growth market of breast-conserving surgery. Together, these strategies have broken the boom-and-bust cycles of the past and should result in more consistent, predictable Breast Health growth going forward.","In Molecular Diagnostics, we continue to fuel an attractive Razor\/Razorblade business model that is enabled by our large and growing installed base of fully automated Panther systems and the broadest assay menu in the mid to high-volume molecular space. We now have more than 15 tests that have been FDA cleared or CE marked to run on the Panther or Panther Fusion platforms. Two-thirds of which have been introduced just since the start of calendar 2017. And these new assays combined with our unique ability to partner with customers to drive demand and establish categories, such as sexual and reproductive health, have led to strong consistent growth in system utilization as well as sales.","We are also making great progress in extending our Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics strengths to international markets where the opportunities are large, but our shares are low compared to the United States.","Over the last few years, we have very deliberately and carefully built the foundations for reliable and consistent international growth. As a result, OUS revenue excluding blood and aesthetics grew at a low double-digit rate in both 2017 and 2018. And we are off to a good start in 2019 with 14.9% growth in the first quarter.","With that introduction, let's discuss our first quarter results in more detail now. Revenue of $830.7 million grew 5.0% on a reported basis or 5.7% in constant currency, well ahead of our expectations.","The acquired Faxitron and Focal businesses performed well contributing $12.2 million to revenue. If you back out this contribution as well as revenue from our divested Blood Screening business you can see that growth would have been about 4.1%, still a significant improvement compared to recent quarters.","In terms of geography, our domestic businesses accelerated in the first quarter, posting growth of 4.1% led by Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics. And as I mentioned earlier, our legacy international franchises also performed well recording our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth excluding Blood Screening and Cynosure.","Molecular had another exceptional quarter internationally and our Breast Health and Surgical businesses grew at double-digit rates as well, reflecting the broad-based improvements we have made in recent years.","Including international sales of Cynosure products, which declined in the period, total international sales were $208.9 million still a robust increase of 10.7%.","Now, let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Let's start with our biggest business, Breast Health, which has reestablished itself as an important growth driver for the company and generated much of the upside in our results recently.","Global Breast Health sales totaled $324.7 million in what is typically a seasonally soft quarter, a robust increase of 13.4%. Even excluding $7.7 million of Faxitron revenue in breast imaging and $4.5 million from Focal in Interventional Breast, the division grew 9.1% globally. We are especially pleased that in the U.S. which represented more than three-quarters of global sales in the quarter, sales increased by almost 8% excluding Faxitron and Focal, the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year growth.","As we discussed at JPMorgan, while some have been overly focused on our Aesthetics division, which represents only about 10% of sales, we have quietly but strategically transformed Breast Health from a domestic capital franchise into a steady diversified global growth business across the continuum of breast healthcare.","There have been several aspects to this strategic transformation. First, we have prioritized international expansion which was evident again this quarter with Breast Health sales growth in the mid-teens. Second, we have strengthened our service business, a nice source of recurring revenue that is larger than gantry sales and grew steadily in the first quarter.","Third, we have used our strong cash flows to complete two tuck-in acquisitions over the last six months, to establish a foothold in the adjacent growth market of breast conserving surgery. Faxitron and Focal performed well this quarter, posting revenue that was in line to slightly better than our internal expectations.","Fourth, we have increased the productivity of our R&D engine. New product sales contributed significantly to Breast Health growth this quarter, led by our new clinically differentiated 3Dimensions and 3D performance mammography systems. These new products, which have helped us gain market share through better customer segmentation, drove 15% growth in breast imaging revenue this quarter, and together represented the majority of 3D systems sold.","These new gantries are helping us to continue to convert customers from traditional 2D mammography to 3D, which provides better clinical results. But at the same time, we have now begun to farm our existing installed base of 3D systems for upgrades, such as our new Intelligent 2D, Clarity HD and SmartCurve products. These new upgrades contributed about 200 basis points to global Breast Health growth in our first quarter.","Overall, we couldn't be more proud of our Breast Health team for building a diversified sustainable growth business. We have more work to do, of course, but our Breast Health division has never been stronger than it is today, based on a clinically differentiated core of mammography systems, multiple new products built around this core and two complementary tuck-in acquisitions.","Before we move on, let me mention this, since we're starting a new fiscal year we've simplified our external reporting a little. Specifically, in Breast Health, we've eliminated the small other revenue line in our press release and added these sales to imaging. These sales were only about $2.7 million in the first quarter compared to $2.3 million in the prior year period, so the numbers are too small to matter.","Now let's turn to diagnostics where revenue of $296.6 million increased 5.0%, which we're very pleased with. Molecular remains the growth driver in this division. As we said at JPMorgan, we have transformed this business as well from a niche player in sexually transmitted disease testing to a broad-based molecular diagnostics leader with strong customer partnerships.","In the first quarter, Molecular sales of $164.3 million grew 11.2%, accelerating for the third consecutive quarter, if you exclude non-recurring royalty revenue that benefited the fourth quarter of 2018.","Internationally, Molecular grew well into the double-digits for the 10th time in 11 quarters. And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories molecular still grew at a high single-digit rate. This was better than in recent periods and reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers to drive testing volumes and better patient care.","As evidence of this, we announced last quarter that we were finalizing multi-year contract extensions with our two largest customers and both of these are now complete. Molecular growth was broad based in the quarter as we leveraged our fully automated Panther system. We continue to place more Panthers and drive increased utilization by encouraging customers to consolidate testing on the system.","In the first quarter specifically, revenue growth was driven by strong sales of our new quantitative viral load tests as well as legacy women's health assays for HPV Trichomonas and Chlamydia Gonorrhea. And we have many more assays and capabilities in development for markets around the world. For example, just last week, we again demonstrated our leadership in the infectious disease space by announcing a first-of-its-kind FDA clearance for an innovative new assay to detect a sexually transmitted bacteria called M Genitalium.","Moving on, cytology and perinatal sales of $118.1 million declined 3.2% in the first quarter. It's worth mentioning that cytology sales were basically flat while perinatal sales declined significantly due to a shift in ordering patterns. In the United States, growth in the cytology market remains challenged due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals. However, ThinPrep remains a core strength for us given the key role it plays in women's health and the ability to run several of our molecular assays out of its collection vial.","Elsewhere in diagnostics, revenue related to our divested blood screening business was higher than expected at $14.2 million, a little more than last year. As a reminder, this revenue mainly reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements we have with Grifols.","Now let's shift gears and cover GYN Surgical, where sales of $108.4 million grew 1.4%. Surgical trends were consistent with recent quarters. MyoSure, which now represents a little more than half of Surgical revenue, grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, while NovaSure sales declined at a mid-single-digit rate. We believe Surgical growth rates will improve over the course of 2019 based on improving sales execution in the United States and increasing contributions from new products such as our Fluent fluid management system and Omni hysteroscope.","Now, let's turn to Medical Aesthetics where sales of $79.8 million represented less than 10% of consolidated revenue and declined 11.6% a disappointing result. This decline resulted from two primary factors; first, increased competition in the non-evasive fat reduction category negatively affected sales of SculpSure lasers as well as consumable PAC keys. As a result, revenue in our body subcategory declined by more than 40%.","Second, the women's health market has not recovered following the FDA's cautionary letters on certain procedures. As a result, sales of women's health and other products declined more than 20%. In contrast, sales of our skin-related products performed well in the quarter increasing about 10%.","So, what we have now at Cynosure is a salesforce that continues to come up to speed with some pockets of good performance in an aesthetics market that still exhibits attractive growth overall. It's also clear that we have more work ahead to generate the constant commercial buzz that this market demands.","We are developing new marketing approaches toward this end and also seeking out new products that can attract customer attention in the context of rapid product cycles. These include internally developed systems such as our TempSure Surgical capability as well as in-licensed products.","To round out the revenue discussion briefly skeletal sales of $21.2 million grew 8.5% against a very weak prior year comparable especially outside the United States. Given the small revenue base here relatively small changes in comps or ordering patterns can cause large swings in percentage growth rates.","So, to wrap-up, we posted very good financial results in the first quarter, driven by strength in our largest businesses; Breast Health, International, and Global Molecular Diagnostics. We are working to further accelerate growth by leveraging our core strengths especially in Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics. We are off to a good start in 2019 and as a result we are increasing our guidance for the year. Karleen will discuss that guidance in a moment.","So, now let me turn the call over to her.","Karleen Oberton","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through the rest of our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, then finish up with our updated financial guidance for 2019 as well as the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis.","As Steve described, we are pleased with our first quarter results as revenue and EPS exceeded our guidance based on strong performances from U.S. Breast Health International and Global Molecular Diagnostics. We also strategically deployed capital in accordance with our stated priorities.","We closed on the acquisition of Focal Therapeutics, a nice tuck-in opportunity, to strengthen our position in breast-conserving surgery and capitalized on our share repurchase authorization. Our fiscal year is off to a good start and we are raising our financial guidance accordingly, despite an incremental foreign exchange headwind.","With that introduction, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the first quarter. Gross margins of 62.2% decreased 160 basis points compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to product and geographic sales mix, as our international sales carry a lower gross margin percentage than sales in the United States.","Gross margin was also negatively affected by a stronger U.S. dollar, trade tariffs in China and disappointing domestic Medical Aesthetics sales. And don't forget, as Steve mentioned, the upside in revenue related to our divested blood screening business comes with little growth margin.","Total operating expenses of $274.7 million increased 1.1% in the first quarter. This increase was mainly driven by the impact of the Faxitron and Focal acquisitions, which contributed roughly $6 million of expense. Excluding Faxitron and Focal, operating expenses actually declined 1.2%, reflecting our ability to drive operating leverage while still funding investments for future growth.","Operating margins of 29.2% declined 20 basis points in the first quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to the effect of product and geographic mix on gross margins. Overall, our operating profitability remains very healthy and we continue to see opportunities to improve further.","Finally, net margins of 18.9% decreased 50 basis points compared with the prior year period. All of this led to non-GAAP net income of $156.7 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, exceeding our guidance range. Before we cover our revised 2019 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics.","Our finance teams had a very effective start to the new fiscal year. In addition to closing the Focal acquisition, we strengthened our balance sheet by restructuring our debt and acting opportunistically on our outstanding share repurchase authorization.","Specifically in the first quarter, we amended our credit agreement, which includes a five-year $1.5 billion senior term loan and a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. We used these proceeds from new facility to refinance at a slightly lower interest rate, our previously outstanding senior term loan and revolver. Based on our strong financial position, we were also able to extend our debt maturities, gaining increased financial flexibility.","At the same time, we repurchased 3.7 million shares of our stock for about $150 million in the first quarter, helping reduce our shares outstanding. And we have more than $260 million remaining on our buyback authorization. Even with all this productive capital deployment at the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio net debt-over-EBITDA stood at only 2.8 times. We remain comfortable around this level recognizing that the ratio could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity.","Moving on, adjusted EBITDA of $260.7 million increased slightly compared to the prior year. Finally, the company generated $82 million of free cash flow in the first quarter. Excluding a non-recurring litigation settlement with Smith & Nephew, free cash flows would have been $116.8 million. We continue to generate industry-leading free cash which enables us to pursue tuck-in acquisitions such as Faxitron and Focal while also acting on our share repurchase authorization as we see opportunities in the market.","Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our full year guidance based on our good first quarter results, partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar which is affecting all multinational companies. At a high level, we are increasing our constant currency revenue guidance and slightly raising our EPS forecast.","Let's start with revenue. As a reminder, we've previously guided to reported sales of $3.29 billion to $3.335 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 2.8% and 4.2%. Based on our strong first quarter results we are increasing our revenue guidance to $3.305 billion to $3.335 billion which includes between $40 million or $45 million of revenue from our divested blood screening business.","Based on recent exchange rates, our new revenue guidance translates to constant currency growth of 3.8% to 4.7% better than our initial 2019 guidance. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened materially since we first guided. In fact, based on recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency fluctuations are driving an incremental headwind of roughly $15 million to our previous revenue guidance.","Despite this headwind, we feel confident about the growth in our core businesses and our ability to control expenses. As a result, we are increasing our EPS guidance slightly to a range of $2.39 to $2.43 which represents reported growth of between 7.2% and 9.0%. I should point out that EPS growth would be higher, if not for the increasing currency headwinds and diminished contributions from our divested blood screening business.","This updated full year guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of approximately 272 million for the full year which reflects progress on our buyback program and effective tax rate of approximately 23% which is the same as our original guidance.","Now let's turn to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue of between $795 million and $810 million which reflects growth of 2.5% to 4.4% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, our guidance reflects revenue growth of 0.7% to 2.6%. As a reminder, our second quarter of 2019 has one fewer selling day than the prior year period although we don't expect this to have a significant impact.","In addition, it's worth explaining that we expect quarterly revenue to decline sequentially versus the $830.7 million, we posted in the first quarter for two reasons. First, we forecast less revenue from our divested blood screening business; and second as a reminder the March quarter is seasonally weaker than the December quarter for our Surgical, Medical Aesthetics and Diagnostics businesses.","On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.55 to $0.57 in the second quarter which implies growth rates of between 3.8% and 7.5% continuing to outpace revenue growth. As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range as we still \u2013 as it's still early in the year and we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides.","Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with how we started 2019 with our Breast Health, Global Molecular Diagnostics and International businesses driving robust growth. We continue to generate industry-leading cash flows and put that cash to good use with a focus on tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases. Based on all of this, we are raising our financial guidance despite incremental currency headwinds.","With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll first go to Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I thought we could just start with a little bit on gross margins here. Obviously post blood screening the sale we've seen gross margins kind of trend a little bit lower here. I understand the commentary about OUS having a lower margin. But can you break out for us kind of the margin by geography and just give us an idea about how you're thinking about gross margin longer term here as that mix continues to shift? Kind of something in the low 62s, is this the way that we should be thinking about the business longer term? Or is there an opportunity to maybe drive that to something back towards the mid-60s over time?","Karleen Oberton","Hey, Brian, it's Karleen. Let me give that a shot. So yes, so in the quarter margins came in a little over 62%, which was a little bit below that plan. And one of the pieces of that was the FX headwinds, which is about 50 basis point hit to the margins on the quarter. I would also say that in the quarter the shortfall in the domestic Medical Aesthetics sales contributed to that. But as we think about gross margins longer term, yeah, we're trying to think that they would trend up from where they are now. I think there's a couple of things that we think about would drive that. We continually evaluate opportunities for efficiencies both on supply chain and our manufacturing network as we pursue some of the tuck-in M&A strategies. We like to look for those products that would have accretive gross margins. As an example, Focal of the BioZorb product is very accretive to our overall consolidated gross margins. And then international while there is a disconnect in the margins between the U.S., we think there is opportunity as that business grows to create more leverage there.","Steve MacMillan","Brian? Sound like Brian froze in the Chicago cold.","Operator","Mr. Weinstein your line is still open.","Brian Weinstein","Hi, can you guys hear me? Can you hear me still?","Steve MacMillan","Yes, there you go.","Brian Weinstein","Yes. So, just on new products, you guys have talked a lot about it. Can you give us some idea about the contribution to total revenue? What percentage of revenue new products represent?","And then also can you highlight some of the key items in the pipeline that we should be looking forward going throughout the year? And then Steve just want to make sure you have a lifejacket because I hear it's supposed to be in the 60s when you leave tonight. So, just want to make sure you're warm enough.","Steve MacMillan","Thank you, Brian. So -- go ahead Mike.","Mike Watts","Yes, hey Brian on new -- it's Mike. On new products, I don't have a specific number in front of me. We did say at the JPMorgan Conference that that total more than tripled in 2018 versus 2017. Certainly Q1 continued those trends. I would say some of the bigger products would obviously be 3Dimensions and 3D Performance in our Breast Health business. We've been very successful with the Affirm prone table and Brevera. In the Diagnostics business, we're seeing really good uptake from the viral load assays as well. So, those are probably the main ones.","Brian Weinstein","All right.","Operator","All right. And next we'll go to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Bill Quirk","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. And I can fasten on Tyler's share with Brian is complaining about, it's pretty balmy where I'm sitting.","Steve MacMillan","What it is out there, Bill? It's like 20 below?","Bill Quirk","Might be negative 35 at the windshield, but who is complaining. Steve if we -- Steve or Karleen, if we back out the Faxitron deal, looks like Interventional was fairly flat. I was hoping you could add some additional color about that particular business line and how we should be thinking about that trend over the balance of the year.","Karleen Oberton","Yes sure. It's Karleen. So main reason for that trend is Brevera. I think we've talked about some of the supply constraints that we have on the disposals related to that capital equipment. So, we've intentionally held back sales on the capital side because what we don't want is to sell the capital to customers and then not be able to supply the needle that goes with it for the procedures. So, don't want to have frustrated customers in the field. As we think about that, we do believe that supply should improve as the year goes on and then we should see improving trends for that subdivision.","Bill Quirk","Perfect. Thanks Karleen. And then secondly guys wanted to ask a little bit about the Mycoplasma genitalium assay that was just approved. I mean it seems like a pretty natural extension of the reproductive health diagnostics offering that you have. Can you help us think about market size and how we should think about this filtering into the Diagnostics business? I recognize that it's probably not as large of a market as say HPV or Chlamydia, gonorrhea. But just help us give a few items to think about to frame it up.","Steve MacMillan","Sure Bill. And this has been a really great one for our team because believe it or not we started looking at this back in the early 2000s when we started to realize that just the existing assays didn't seem to capture everything in terms of cervicitis and some of the other things. And our team has been quietly working on this one for quite some time. And I think it's going to be probably a lot more like our Trich assays. These kind of things that, any given quarter here you're not going to see a huge amount it's going to be getting off. But we've already been in talk with some of the payers. We think it will emerge to be a very significant assay, call it, in the three to five-year horizon.","But certainly over the beginning times, here like most of our assays, very small out of the gates as we build the support and the awareness. But it's another one of these where we do think our TMA technology puts us in a unique position to have more sensitive and specific assay in this space. So limited expectations for this year, but it's going to one that is again in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 we'll look back and say, this has turned out to be a really nice addition to our portfolio.","Operator","All right. We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks. So maybe, Steve, just on breast imaging. I'm getting to organic overall breast because of high singles here. And this is all coming from imaging. I mean, some of the comments you're making on new product traction, upgrade cycle. Why shouldn't these trends be sustainable in the back half, right? Because certainly it looks like there is something going on in the CapEx market. Stryker this morning spoke about beds and stretchers being up. Maybe just can you comment on CapEx environment and why these trends are not sustainable?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Vijay. I think, let's say, it was a really nice quarter. We also had a softer comp. Yeah. I think the comps get stronger as the year goes on. The other piece, just if you look at the global economic environment right now, we want to be careful. It was a great quarter, an awesome quarter.","We want to be careful not to get too far out of our ski tips here, not knowing where things are going. But I will tell you, we feel really, really good about the underlying trends. We're hearing good things from our customers and we'll see where we go. But we're just one quarter into the year.","Vijay Kumar","Helpful, Steve. And I had one follow-up. I mean, just curious I think we had RSNA in December and I would have thought that's going to be weak, but you guys crushed it. Maybe Karleen, on the EPS guidance, it looks like revenues, bottom up came up a little bit, right? We had some FX offsetting, maybe better M&A and the Q1 strength. But did I hear you correctly? I mean, share count went down on the guidance for $4 million. And that's about 140 bps contribution, but your EPS was just tweaked up by $0.01. Is there something below the line that we should be thinking of? Or is this a margin question? Thank you.","Karleen Oberton","No, no. I don't think there's anything below the line. I think FX is incremental headwind on the bottom line as well, that we factored in here. So I think it's just early, early out of the gate here and don't want to get ahead of ourselves.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Hi. Apologies. I'm going to have to ask about Cyno though, and I appreciate it's down 10% of revenues. But we did see some pretty tough results out of your peer the other day from Allergan. Just curious, is there something in the market that's kind of causing this shift? And it sounds like for some of their commentary there, just kind of equipment, a little heavier. So can you maybe just talk to pricing? And then secondly, Vitalia, now that it's reintroduced, can you just talk on conversations with the FDA around generating data and how you think about kind of backing that up? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Tycho, on the first part, within the body contouring category, we've been relatively constant on holding our pricing. It was a tougher quarter. I think what we've clearly learned and it's going to affect our R&D and licensing strategies here as we go forward is in any given quarter often times the docs had a little bit of amount of money that they're going to spend for new equipment. And if you got kind of the shiny new toy you may go that way. And there's been a product or two from some of the private companies that have done pretty well in the short term. You get a little bit hot in the quarter and that clearly affects things.","I think as it relates to Vitalia going forward, we've been back in discussions obviously the last five weeks. There wasn't a lot of discussion going on with the FDA. But we feel like we have a pathway forward. It's going to be a couple of years, pragmatically before we really have the data on both that and MonaLisa to strengthen the data and claims. So that's where we're just imagining expectations in that women's health piece of the business for the next number of quarters. But still very bullish about the longer-term outlook. But it's clearly kicked it out a couple of years past what we had hoped and expected.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then on diagnostics, there is some news out today that the FDA is going to have an evaluation panel on looking at devices for HPV detection. I know it's kind of professional just curious, if you have any thoughts there. And then can you also clarify on perinatal what the shift in ordering pattern was about? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Good job getting two follow-ups into one. So, thanks Tycho. The FDA panel, we're encouraged by this. And obviously as the leader in both HPV as well as PAC and co-testing and everything else, we've been having great dialogue both with FDA as well as the National Cancer Institute and see that there will be continued evolutions. What we're seeing around the world right now is a real mixed bag all over the place different countries having different approaches, whether it's co-testing in submarkets, clearly adopting mRNA our technology in a lot of markets. And there's a lot of different approaches happening around the world right now and I think the FDA wants to kind of take a peek at both that as well as the U.S. We've been in those discussions and feel pretty good about what we're working on for the longer term in this category as well. So, we will see where it goes. Did you want to add something, Karleen?","Karleen Oberton","Yes, I was just going to answer the question with regards to perinatal and the ordering pats. So this Tycho' goes back to the recall that we had. So what happened is we had products become available again in Q1 of 2018. We had an acceleration of restocking of the product as well. We had a reversal of the reserve that we had taken in the previous period.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon guys. Thank you. So just on guidance question if I could. I'm just trying to deconstruct the impact of -- if I think about FX being a little bit worse debt refi helpful and then obviously the operational changes getting better. If you could try and maybe take each of those piecemeal I'm trying to figure out how those all kind of netted together?","Karleen Oberton","So, yes, I think from a top line perspective, are you talking the top line and the bottom line, Isaac?","Isaac Ro","EPS. I mean, obviously the EPS update was not significant on a net basis. But I felt like there are a few moving parts that's why I wanted to try and deconstruct it.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So, I would say that on the FX piece that was probably a couple of pennies that drops to the bottom line kind of a headwind that we didn't have from the original guidance.","Isaac Ro","Okay. And then debt refi?","Steve MacMillan","That\u2019s pretty meaningful. $15 million of incremental FX and drops to gross at least what happened.","Karleen Oberton","Yeah. It's probably $0.02 to $0.03. ","Mike Watts","Yeah. The other stuff below the line, Isaac was about the same really not much change in other income expense. It's mainly that FX piece.","Isaac Ro","Okay, got it. And then maybe separate topic. On the Breast Health business, I think the question was asked earlier about what was going on with the imaging side. I'd be interested if you could maybe identify the growth contribution you got from better capture of aftermarket revenue the nonmammography-related products. You gave a little bit of detail there, but just looking to get more? Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Isaac. I think the biggest piece is we've been fragmenting the market. Everybody's been looking for what was going to be the next big whether it's 2D, 3D, or \u201c4D\u201d. And what we've been saying all along is we're turning this into understanding the market, bringing new innovations. We brought 3Dimensions at the higher end. We brought 3D Performance at the lower end. And we've, obviously, still got a firm prone, the biopsy system.","We've got all of these products. And then increasingly we did reference about 200 bps of growth of now really starting to sell upgrades in terms of the Clarity HD, the SmartCurve panel things to already our 3D base that are out there. And I think that's the exciting part now that we have both continued innovations on the core mammography 3D systems, but also starting to mine the base that's already out there.","We've watched the SmartCurve panel and again we've got over what 5,000 6,000 \u2013 well over 5,000 about 6,000 installed base out there. And we have more business coming through. We've also got the service revenue coming through as well. So it's that shift from just a boom bust launch one new product once a decade and ride it up and then ride it down to a steady stream of innovation, customer segmentation understanding, which customers want which, and the ability to go mine even the existing 3D bases to start to bring more upgrades along the way.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.","Richard Newitter","Thank you. Steve, if I could just \u2013 how are you doing? If I could just follow-up on the breast imaging. So I appreciate what you're saying. I think it's great that there's a bit more stability and predictability and that the R&D strategy is paying off. But I'm also just wondering, is there a to use your words 4D-like product that's cooking? And if so when might we be thinking about that product cycle? Is that three years away? Two years away? And then I have a follow-up.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. You can imagine we've got lots of great additional things in our pipeline. We've always -- we've been the innovator in this space, certainly over the last decade. We continue to innovate on both claims and products and it's a huge reason why we are by far the leader in the 3D space and in the mammography space in the U. S. and why we have significantly gained the market share over the last five years.","So, having said that, we've still got a bunch of our existing 2D base to convert to 3D, and what we've been trying to tell you along is, there'll be more innovations. It may not be quiet the impact in the future because of the fragmenting customer base and just because of the way we have filled up the customers and going back and mining the existing base instead of waiting until the next big thing coming.","And our goal that we've said all along been in the company now for 20, 21 quarters, we said, we wanted to build a very sustainable growth business in Breast Health. That's exactly where we've been. So we're far more focused on doing that and believe that our innovation engine is much more geared for that going forward than for just a big one-hit wonder. But we do have some very cool things still in the pipeline.","Richard Newitter","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just going back to the Aesthetics business for a moment. You mentioned several times kind of a shift in thinking to kind a keep up with the shiny object kind of nature of this business. You're going to collaborate more through business transactions or relationships, I guess. Can you just give a little more color around how that would work? What kind of structures these relationships would take? And are you open to a further tuck-in M&A in that segment as it presents itself? Or this is the direction going forward that you'll take in the Aesthetics segment? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think the fascinating part is given the lifecycles of some of the products in the aesthetics space, we think there's a lot more opportunities frankly to have a balanced approach of both organic and inorganic innovation. And the inorganic to a large degree doesn't even have to be acquisition as much as it can be in-license, like we did with Nitronox. And we're in discussions with a lot of other companies.","And when we've certainly seen some of the private competitors in this space, it's not necessarily needing to acquire. You can actually license, write it for a few years and the lifecycles are clearly different than rest of our businesses. So in some cases frankly licensing is a better way to go probably than acquisition.","Operator","Next we'll go to Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Dan.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. Hi, Steve. So, two questions on breast imaging. First, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what you're talking about regarding farming the installed base of 3D for upgrades. What is the runway there? And how durable should we think about the 200 basis points of tailwind you reported in the quarter?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Dan. I think there's a lot of runway ahead. If you think about it, we launched our first 3D systems in the United States almost eight years ago now. And in the meantime we've come up with better detectors. We've come up with particularly better software packages and then things like the SmartCurve paddle that also come with different algorithms and different software packages.","So the ability to go back now as we think about the future it's not just converting our 2D to 3D. It's now looking at all of our existing 3D systems, many of whom were bought by early adopters and thought-leading institutions. So want to make sure they are staying on the cusp of state-of-the-art. And as we've come up with frankly better CAD packages, better packages software to be able to drive, there's a lot of opportunity there. And we do think that'll be a meaningful way. If you look at our SmartCurve paddle that's probably not even \u2013 it's just in a small percentage at this point of our existing 3D base. I mean, I'd say, it's probably certainly less than 20% and that's probably even less than that. So as you start to build it out. There's opportunities for years and years as well to just be upgrading our 3D while we continue to upgrade 2D. And I think that becomes part of the \u2013 it becomes a broader playbook than the days of yore. So we have so many things at our disposal now to drive that sustainable growth.","Dan Leonard","And then my follow-up is a bit similar to Vijay's question from earlier. So I know that typically the December quarter is not a seasonally strong quarter for breast imaging, but it does seem like it was seasonally strong in the hospital capital spending environment. So based on whatever data or intelligence you have internally, do you have any way to isolate how much the performance might have been due to just healthy year-end customer budgets and healthy market as opposed to run rate performance in self-help?","Steve MacMillan","Yeah. We don't have a great handle. You get a little anecdotes here or there. Somebody had some extra money in their budget at year-end and spent it, this kind of stuff. But it's also why we just want to be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves. I'll tell you we feel very good about the underlying order trends. We feel very good about the competitive wins we're getting. We feel very good about a lot of what's going on in the business. But to \u2013 we can't be quite as granular saying, we got 160 bps that came from extra budgets being released or anything like that, that would just be pure speculation.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Good afternoon.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Jack.","Jack Meehan","My first question is on a topic I'm sure you love which is the adoption of ASC 606 with the new fiscal year. I'm curious relative to result under the prior standard did that impact the results in the quarter at all? I asked just I know there are some changes around revenue recognition. Just curious if that impacted the results versus if they have been reported under 605?","Steve MacMillan","Jack, you'd be surprised. I think we'll let Karleen answer this one.","Karleen Oberton","Yes, Jack. Jack, there was minimal impact in the quarter. I think the only \u2013 moving forward our business model aren't \u2013 there's no real meaningful change to our revenue recognition under our business model under the new rules. The only impact that we had was on adoption related to deferred revenues to the order of I think it was about $6 million to $8 million that was on our balance sheet that we really had no performance obligation, which is essentially written-off to retained earnings in the adoption, but other than that really no impact.","Jack Meehan","Great. Yeah. Thank you for the clarification. And then did want to follow-up on the Molecular segment a two-parter. Just in the U.S. with some of the reimbursement changes, I'm curious what you're seeing on the pricing environment, if there's been any change for Molecular specifically. And then international growth looks pretty good. So maybe just talk about the adoption of Panther ex-U.S. would be helpful.","Mike Watts","Hey, Jack, it's Mike on the first piece, I'll take that one. Yeah. The PAMA-related reimbursement cuts. As everybody knows nothing has changed dramatically in terms of our ASPs. Pricing depends on the quarter, but tends to be flat or down just a very little bit depending upon the product. I guess, the thing that I would point out is even as those reimbursement rates come down, you think about it it's still pretty good reimbursement for some of these tests especially that are helping bring patients into the facility and that are being run on a fully automated Panther instrument that doesn't really have a lot of additional labor costs associated with it. So there's still I think decent profit there. On the international piece, Steve did you want to take that?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think International we've continued to be placing Panthers continued to drive menu particularly in Western Europe. I think we've made a lot of progress over the last few years. We've got a leader over there it's been doing great things. And the magic with every Panther we place the new start to menu coming in. We also just got a lot better tracking the metrics as well usage per Panther. There were days in the old days we used to sell a Panther and then it wouldn't get used. We've gotten so much just rigorous basic operational discipline and understanding every Panther around the world what it's doing, and if we can help drive more business through it working it that way, so no magic, just good hard work customer by customer making progress.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Q \u2013 David Lewis","Good afternoon. Steve, one for you and then one for Karleen. So Steve questions on breast on call and I think the strategic change in breast is getting a lot of attention, so just two kind of related questions there. Is the weighted market growth rate -- weighted average market growth rate for this business higher now? Are you saying that you can grow faster than weighted average market growth rate versus period of time based on some of the changes you made and what's the new number for this business? How do you see this business going forward?","Steve MacMillan","Yes David. Just look at results versus past, I don't know that we've got a perfect weighted average market growth rate for the category. I do think if you look at the last 20 quarters or whatever, we've probably grown faster than whatever that weighted average market is. And we continue to try to be shifting and driving that to a higher number.","Q \u2013 David Lewis","Okay. And then Karleen just a lot of questions on margins and you talked about currency. But revenue's up. Operating income is about the same. Is it all just currency or is there any select areas of reinvestment or conservatism? Because it looks like there's a limit of reinvestment as op income still the same by our math. Thanks so much. ","A \u2013 Karleen Oberton","Yes. So on an op income -- I think if you look at the sales and marketing lines are up specifically as we talked about the strategic changes in the Breast Health business. We have invested in that sales team to have a team that can sell the portfolio of products. So if there's been reinvestment that's where it's been.","Operator","Next we'll go to Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Q \u2013 Doug Schenkel","Hey good afternoon guys.","A \u2013 Steve MacMillan","Hey Doug.","Q \u2013 Doug Schenkel","Just maybe starting on capital deployment, could you update us on your plan for 2019? You repurchased more shares more quickly than we expected and lowered share count guidance for the year. So I'm just wondering what we should think about in terms of our -- or how we should think about share repurchases for the balance of the year. And building off of that I'm just wondering if market volatility is impacting your M&A efforts at all.","A \u2013 Karleen Oberton","So I'll start with that. So as we've talked about with the free cash flow, we originally guided at the beginning of 2019 that we estimated about $700 million. The priority there is clearly M&A. So we deployed about $125 million in the quarter on the Focal acquisition. And then what we've said it's going to be very opportunistic in regards to share repurchases after M&A. And I think we executed on that in the quarter and I think that's what you'll continue to see out throughout the balance of the year.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a couple follow-ups on Molecular Diagnostics. In your prepared remarks, Steve, you mentioned that you've been having a bit more success getting Panther customers to consolidate more menu on to Panthers.","I'm wondering if this is primarily in the U.S., or if it's happening more broadly geographically. And I guess on the topic of virology and menu, I'm just curious if you'd be willing to comment whether you've had any success converting your two large lab customers to use viral load assays as part of the contract renewal. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","So Doug, probably on the first part of, whatever I was really talking about is, I think we're getting much more granular at getting smarter at penetrating wherever there's a Panther, making sure we're getting a lot more usage. I don't want to overplay that we're getting all this massive consolidation on to our Panthers. We still see huge opportunities for that.","So it's more customer-by-customer, particularly outside the U.S., which was really my reference where we would've placed the Panther, it wasn't getting -- it might have been \u2013 being used for one assay instead of two or three or four. So we've been building that out more than anything. But I think, obviously, continuing to feel very good.","And we're not going to comment on specifics of our largest customer contracts consistent with the -- our policies for quite some time. But there would be a huge inflection. I think you'd probably expect something of that that you're \u2013 we're seeing ongoing strength.","Mike Watts","Operator, I think we might have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Thank you, sir. We'll take our last question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Raj.","Raj Denhoy","Maybe I could ask just a couple of cleanup ones here. So Focal and Faxitron, I guess, $12.2 million in the quarter. I know it's still early days. But anything in terms of what you think the opportunity set for that is now that you've had it for a while? And is your breast-conserving portfolio sort of fully baked here? Or where should we expect more acquisition in that category?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think we feel really good about the sales teams we've got there and the products. We're still, I'd call, in a very early stages of pulling those sales teams together and leveraging especially the disposable side of the sales force. I think everything we've seen has reinforced that these are both good acquisitions that are on or above our new models. Not sure that we necessarily need more things in the portfolio. I think we feel good about that.","I'd also say, it's most -- both are mostly U.S. businesses today. And again, over time probably significant opportunities outside the U.S. Those will come a little bit more over time as we ramp up the right organizations and some of that. But I think we're off to a really good start, really pleased. And as we've talked in the past, certainly, Raj you well know it, these are the great kind of the tuck-in deals that I think will be very good for us.","Raj Denhoy","Great. And then, maybe just very last question, just on NovaSure. You mentioned still down, but expectations will improve over the course of the year. So any more detail around that, sort of the cadence of the approval and what's needed to actually get that back on track?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. I think, certainly our own sales team is promoting it more. It's been an interesting one, because the whole GEA market has kind of dried up a little bit or shrunk really ever since one of the competitive products was taken off the market and in a weird way there maybe some competitors coming later in the year. The way we almost think about some of that is, it may actually reignite some discussion. There is still way too many hysterectomies done in this country.","And I think as we get our messaging out a little deeper, we'll continue to try to strengthen that business. But it's clearly well established in an established category that hasn't been growing. And with that category not growing, given our very strong market share we've kind of been going sort of along the ways of the market. So we like to get it going back a little bit better. ","Raj Denhoy","Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Thanks Raj.","Operator","Thank you everyone. That is all the time we have for question today. This now concludes Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Call. Have a good evening. You may now disconnect. "],"10933":["Hologic, Inc.

LLC","Operator","Good afternoon, and welcome to the Hologic Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is James, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.","I'd now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, James. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Hologic second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our newly redesigned website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived for 30 days.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic CEO.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss Hologic's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.","Our results were solid overall. Total revenue finished above our guidance range, and earnings per share met our expectations. On the other hand, we are writing down the value of Cynosure and lowering our annual revenue guidance based mainly on a reset of expectations for that business, which we'll discuss more in a moment.","As a quick overview of our second quarter results, revenue of $789.3 million grew 10.3% on a reported basis, or 8.3% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the Cynosure acquisition and the blood screening divestiture, both of which occurred in the second quarter of last year, revenue increased 4.8%, or 2.6% in constant currency. This was in line with the assumptions underpinning our last guidance.","In terms of geography, our international business again demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter. International revenue exceeded $200 million for the first time and increased 28%, helped by the contribution of Cynosure. Even excluding Cynosure and blood, international sales increased 15.1%, with broad based strength across our various divisions and regions.","In the United States, revenue of $588.5 million increased 3.3%, again primarily due to the acquisition of Cynosure. Excluding Cynosure and blood, U.S. revenue was basically flat.","In terms of divisional performance, our Breast and Skeletal businesses performed well in the second quarter. Diagnostics sales were a little soft as anticipated as we believe fewer women had regular checkups in January and February due to weather and the severe flu season. Surgical sales declined again in the quarter, as expected, although we are seeing early signs of improvement.","As for Cynosure, the business is stronger today than at any point since we bought it. But at the same time, it's now clear that given the almost complete rebuild we've had to do with the U.S. sales force, we will not meet our original expectations for the business. As a result, we booked a significant write-down this quarter and are resetting our short-term revenue expectations, while maintaining the firm belief that Cynosure 2.0 will be a consistent growth engine for the future.","Given these moving pieces, in my remarks today I'll try to put our divisional revenue result in the context of how we see the company from a strategic perspective. If we go back to 2014 and 2015, the dramatic turnaround that our team executed relied mainly on better domestic commercial execution. We knew we had clinically differentiated products and succeeded in driving their market shares to very high levels in the United States.","More recently, we began layering in contributions from new products that were emerging from our revitalized R&D pipeline. And last year, our efforts to build strong international foundations began to bear fruit. Also last year, we divested our blood screening business and acquired Cynosure to shift our portfolio toward higher growth markets.","As we survey the company today, we are very pleased with the positioning of our Breast Health business as well as our international growth prospects. We have successfully managed through fears of a cliff in 3D placements, and have transformed our international business from a start-up to a vibrant growth engine.","Given these successes and all the good things that we see happening in Cynosure and Surgical, we are confident that these businesses are also improving in similar ways. Cynosure and Surgical are classic examples of what some of you heard me say, that sometimes the underlying capabilities of an organization are better than the numbers reflect. Said differently, it's common that, during transitions, the numbers will lag the foundational progress that's being made, and that's what we believe is happening at Cynosure and Surgical today.","One reason I'm confident of this is the organizational change we made in December when we eliminated the position of Chief Operating Officer. This was a major shift in how we run the company. The executives who lead our primary businesses and regions now report directly to me, which brings me closer to our end markets and the sales teams that I value so highly.","In addition, we have formed an expanded global leadership team to promote greater alignment and faster decision-making across our organization. I'm energized by this new structure because it enables me to drive an even greater urgency for organic and inorganic growth, and it's helping the entire organization return to a level of activity and speed of decision-making that characterize the early days of our turnaround.","With that introduction, now let me focus on the four areas I mentioned before: Breast Health, Cynosure, Surgical and international. Breast Health, our largest business, outperformed again in the second quarter. Global Breast Health sales totaled $300.1 million, a solid increase of 4.9% compared to the prior year period.","The U.S. business was essentially flat compared to the prior year period while international sales grew a robust 27.6%, marking our third consecutive quarter with growth over 20%. This performance reflects the tremendous progress we have made in building a sustainable growth engine through both organic and inorganic means, including the acquisitions of two of our European distributors.","As I mentioned, we are pleased with the strategic positioning of our Breast Health business. Today, Hologic is much more than a company that sells mammography capital. Instead, we have built a diversified, increasingly global Breast Health business around the core of our Genius 3D mammography systems. And increasingly, growth is coming from new products, software and service even as capital placements in the mature U.S. market level out. In fact, domestic 3D gantries represented only about one-fourth of total Breast Health sales this quarter.","We continue to feel great about ongoing market share strength in mammography, fueled in part by new products. For example, we are seeing good adoption of our new 3D Performance mammography system, which enables us to convert lower volume customers cost effectively. And late in the second quarter, we received full FDA approvals for our new 3Dimensions platform, the world's most technologically advanced 3D mammography system.","Of note, the new and improved hardware and software of 3Dimensions, which enable higher resolution images and increase patient comfort, are backwards compatible with most of the Genius systems we have sold over the last several years. So, we can further smooth the boom and bust cycles of the past by driving upgrades to the several thousand Hologic 3D systems in the field, while continuing to replace thousands of remaining 2D gantries with new Genius systems.","We are also pleased with the progress we've made with our interventional breast business. As we have introduced new products that enable us to participate more broadly in the clinical continuum of care and as our sales force has sold our portfolio more effectively, interventional has emerged as an additional growth platform for the company.","In the second quarter, sales of interventional breast products increased 10.3%, based in part on solid U.S. uptake of our new Brevera breast biopsy system, which improves biopsy workflow and the patient experience. In addition, sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system continue to grow.","Now, let's turn to Cynosure, our Medical Aesthetics business. Cynosure sales were $85.5 million in the second quarter, an increase of 11.5% compared to pro forma results in the prior year period, when Cynosure was an independent company for most of the quarter. On a sequential basis, Cynosure sales declined versus our first quarter results, reflecting the seasonality that we discussed in our last call.","As I mentioned upfront, we are very disappointed in the write-down related to our acquisition of Cynosure. While we remain optimistic about the market and our growth prospects, it is clear now one year after closing the transaction that we will not achieve the revenue goals contemplated in our deal model. As many of you know, we had an unusual amount of churn in the U.S. sales force, both pre and post close, which was highly disruptive to the business and clearly set us back.","As we sit here today, roughly two-thirds of the domestic sales force is new in the last year, with many having been hired just in the last 60 to 90 days, as we needed to get managers in place before adding new reps. In many respects, delivering the results we have over the last two quarters, with only a partial sales organization, actually gives us more confidence that as the team comes up to speed we will see much brighter days ahead. I spent time with this team a couple of weeks ago, and the spirit, commitment and talent have me excited about where we're headed despite where we've been.","Nonetheless, to acknowledge our much lower starting point, we are resetting revenue expectations for Cynosure today. We believe this will give us a more realistic set of targets against which we can hopefully outperform and, at the same time, reduce the outsized focus on a single franchise that represented only 11% of sales in the second quarter.","We firmly believe Cynosure is on the right track, just like we knew that Kevin Thornal would get international on the right track when we sent him to Europe in early 2016. We know we have to prove it. But Kevin and his new management team are settling in at Cynosure, and their confidence is building.","Let me discuss a few of the positive developments that underpin our confidence. First, we have significantly increased the size and, more importantly, the quality of our domestic sales force compared to a few quarters ago. Our new leaders are now acting as talent magnets for positions at all levels, and attracting top talent from leading companies. And while most of our new reps will need six to nine months to get fully up to speed, they are already winning business, which is an encouraging sign.","For example, a new sales leader played a central role as we won a significant new SculpSure contract with LightRx. LightRx is one of the nation's largest medical aesthetics providers, and conducted an extensive analysis of competing non-invasive fat products before choosing to expand its use of SculpSure. While revenue will play out over time, the agreement represents an important confidence booster for potential SculpSure customers and even our own reps.","Momentum is also building for SculpSure in other areas. Patient ratings on RealSelf, which is an influential website for the aesthetics industry, have increased dramatically and are now on par with our primary competitor. Patient interest and referrals have increased significantly based on our DTC efforts, and customers are noticing.","The final reason we are encouraged about Cynosure's prospect is the strong launch of TempSure Envi, our new radiofrequency platform that minimizes facial fine lines and wrinkles, tightens skin through soft tissue coagulation, and improves the appearance of cellulite. TempSure got off to a good start even with a sales force that was operating at far less than full strength in the quarter. As our sales force matures, we believe that TempSure will be an important growth driver, especially if we roll out new applications in women's health and general surgery. We also expect TempSure will become a great example of how to win the right way in Medical Aesthetics. We will do this by creating long-term value for our customers and by leveraging our scale, stability and strength to gain sustainable competitive advantage in a fragmented industry.","Now let's shift over to Surgical which posted sales of $99.4 million in the second quarter, a decline of 3.2%. MyoSure had a good quarter, posting growth of 12.3% and surpassing quarterly NovaSure sales for the first time. But NovaSure sales declined by 16.3%. As we said in our last call, we expected Surgical to be down in the second quarter. But recent ordering patterns continue to support improving trends in the back half of the year as new leadership makes a difference, comps get easier, and our revamped sales and marketing efforts take hold.","MyoSure and NovaSure remain the leading brands in their categories by far, and our commercial efforts are designed to emphasize their many advantages. We believe that educating customers about the many advantages of NovaSure has helped market share trends stabilize. For example, you might have seen recently a new peer reviewed publication that highlighted better outcomes for NovaSure patients than with a new competing procedure. In addition, a recent survey of more than 700 OB-GYNs showed that 57% of physicians who try that new product had discontinued their use of it and returned to another ablation device. Of these, 87% of doctors return to NovaSure, the clear market leader.","As we discussed last quarter, we are also taking steps to boost growth in what has been a declining endometrial ablation category. For example, we are partnering with actor and director, Aisha Tyler on a direct-to-patient campaign called We Hate Heavy Periods, to help overcome the stigma associated with discussing menstrual health. We are working to ensure that the one in five women who experienced abnormal uterine bleeding know that reliable, minimally invasive treatments are available, and that they don't have to suffer in silence.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me touch briefly on another nice success story, the growth of our international businesses. Even excluding Medical Aesthetics and blood screening, OUS sales increased a robust 15.1% this quarter, our fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. And if you include contributions from Cynosure which we have now integrated into Hologic's regional management structure, OUS revenue cracked $200 million for the first time in the second quarter.","To put this in perspective, international is now larger than our domestic breast imaging, molecular diagnostics and cytology franchises. So we've made really nice progress compared to what was basically a start up just a few years ago. And importantly, our performance in the second quarter was driven by broad based strength across divisions and countries, which gives us confidence that international growth is sustainable over the long term.","So to wrap up, our financial results were solid in the second quarter. Revenue exceeded our guidance and EPS was in line with expectations. We are pleased with the second quarter performance of our largest division Breast Health, as well as the progress we are making internationally. And while we are disappointed with the reset on Cynosure, many signs emerged that show we're on the right track there and in Surgical as well.","Now I will hand the call over to Bob.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today in my remarks I'm going to highlight some of our other divisional sales drivers, walk through our second quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then I'll finish with our updated financial guidance for 2018. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percent changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency. Steve already highlighted our Breast Health, Surgical and Cynosure businesses, so I'll start my discussion with Diagnostics.","Global Diagnostics sales of $279.7 million decreased 7.6% in constant currency. Removing the impact of our divested blood screening business, diagnostics sales grew 1.8% against the toughest comp of the year for the core business. As we alluded to on our last call, we believe U.S. diagnostics result in January and February were affected by severe weather and a terrible flu season that reduced well-woman visits. As evidence of this, our Diagnostic sales per day declined in January and February compared to prior year periods, but rebounded nicely in March.","Diagnostics growth was once again led by molecular diagnostics, where global sales of $150.7 million increased 4.4%. In the United States, where we enjoy very high market shares in our key assay categories, molecular sales grew 2.5%. International molecular diagnostics grew a healthy 15% based on strength across our Aptima women's health test as well as in products.","Moving on to cytology and perinatal. Global revenues of $117.7 million declined 1.4%. We are the undisputed market leader in cytology with our ThinPrep liquid Pap test and are proud of the role that more than 650 million pap tests since introduction have played in dramatically reducing deaths from cervical cancer.","Our product advantages and customer relationships have enabled us to gain significant market share over the last several years. But as a reminder, it's harder to drive incremental gains from these high levels and we continue to face headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening intervals in the United States. Rounding out Diagnostics, blood screening revenues were $11.3 million in the quarter, higher than expected as we continue to fulfill our obligations to Grifols following the divestiture of the business.","To wrap up the revenue discussion, Skeletal Health, a division that doesn't get much attention due to its small size, posted revenues of $24.6 million, an increase of almost 10% in constant currency. Growth was evenly distributed between DEXA products and services where interest is increasing and body composition testing for human performance and our new fluoroscopy system.","Now moving down the P&L. Gross margins of 62.7% declined 120 basis points compared to the prior year. This was due primarily to geographic mix, as our international sales carry a lower gross margin percentage than sales in the U.S. Gross margin was also negatively affected by the sales mix specifically they divestiture of the blood screening business and sales of lower margin Cynosure products.","Total operating expenses of $266.9 million increased 19.7% in the second quarter, mainly due to the inclusion of the Cynosure costs. If you were to back out Cynosure operating expenses, our base business declined in a low-single digit rate reflecting the very deliberate efforts to control costs and drive operating leverage. Our operating margin of 28.9% declined 380 basis points due to product and geographic mix, as well as the divestiture of our blood screening business and the addition of Cynosure.","And finally, net margins of 18.7% decreased 120 basis points as the negative mix factors I discussed previously were partially offset by improvements in our non-GAAP effective tax rate mainly as a result of U.S. tax reform. All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year. As a reminder, the prior year period still included the month of regular revenue and profit from blood screening prior to the divestiture.","Now before we move on to guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics. During the second quarter, we took advantage of volatility in our share price to opportunistically repurchase our common stock. Specifically, we bought back 2.8 million shares for a total of $106.5 million. This left just under $200 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. In addition, while this activity technically fell outside of our second quarter I'm pleased to announce that as of last week, we are officially free and clear of our convertible debt. Retiring this highly dilutive debt provides us with a much stronger balance sheet and reduces variability in our diluted share count.","At the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio net debt over EBITDA stood at 2.7 times, a comfortable level for us. And finally, adjusted EBITDA of $248.2 million in the second quarter declined 3% compared to the prior year as improvements in our base business were offset by the divestiture of blood screening.","Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and the third quarter. In conjunction with our re-evaluation of the Cynosure business, we are resetting expectations for near-term revenue in Medical Aesthetics, and this is the primary factor driving a reduction in our 2018 revenue guidance.","As Steve discussed, we remain confident that Cynosure is on the right track, and we see several tangible signs that the business is improving. However, it's clear now that this improvement is taking longer than expected so we wanted to establish a more realistic set of baseline assumptions for Cynosure that we can hopefully beat rather than chasing a number and fueling controversy in the stock every quarter.","More specifically, although we expect to see sequential improvement in Cynosure revenue in the third quarter, we don't believe the business will return to year-over-year growth until the fourth quarter of this year. As a result, we expect Cynosure's full year revenues in our fiscal 2018 to be down materially versus the $390 million the company posted on a pro forma basis in the prior four fiscal quarters from October of 2016 to September of 2017.","If we look at the rest of Hologic, our revenue forecasts haven't changed much in aggregate since our last guidance. As a result, we now expect full year revenue to range from $3.18 billion to $3.21 billion with reported growth rates between 4.0% and 4.9%. Based on recent exchange rates, this translates to constant currency growth of 2.7% to 3.7%, and organic growth in the low-single digit range.","As a reminder, we are defining organic revenue to exclude blood screening for the full year and Medical Aesthetics for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018. And as we discussed last quarter, organic revenue growth also adjusts for fewer selling days in 2018 and non-recurring royalty revenue in our Diagnostics business.","Despite the change in our revenue guidance, we feel confident in our ability to control expenses, as well as the multiple ways we can drive leverage within the P&L. As a result, we remain committed to our previously communicated earnings per share guidance range of $2.22 to $2.27, which represents reported growth of between 9.4% and 11.8%.","In addition, we expect that cash flows will remain strong. We continue to forecast the free cash flows this year in the mid-$600 million range, excluding the non-recurring tax recapture payments associated with retiring our convertible notes. This updated full year guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of roughly 280 million for the full year, and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.","Now, let's turn to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue of between $795 million and $810 million, which reflects a decline of 2.8% to a decline of 1% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, our guidance reflects revenue ranging from a decline of 1.4% to growth of 0.5%.","On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.55 to $0.57 in the quarter, which implies growth rates of between 10% and 14%. As you update your estimates, we would again encourage you to model around the middle of our guidance ranges as we have incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecast.","Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to conclude by saying that we posted solid results in our fiscal second quarter led by our Breast Health business and our International franchises. These businesses are well-positioned to drive future growth given the strategies we have in place, and we enjoy durable leadership positions in many other product categories as well. The tremendous progress we have made across multiple fronts since 2014 has enabled us to retire all the convertible debt we inherited, completing a major financial initiative and resulting in a much stronger balance sheet.","We remain confident that Cynosure is headed in the right direction, but are deeply disappointed in the write-down this quarter as well as the reduction in our full year revenue guidance. The revenue growth rates implied in the back half of the year are clearly not what we aspire to, although it's worth emphasizing that we are maintaining our guidance for EPS growth this year and remain a strong generator of cash as well.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one, plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question today from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. We appreciate all the helpful details on Cynosure. But of course, like others, I want to dig in a bit deeper. Last quarter, it sounded like you felt like you were making pretty solid progress with the sales force and that you were seemingly on track. We definitely got that sense as well at our conference when we had the fireside chat with you intra-quarter. So, could you provide a bit more detail on what changed for Cynosure, certainly, over the past quarter and, to some extent, over the last few months? And related to that, is the guidance reduction entirely due to Cynosure sales force changes or is there something broader here? For instance, are there some market dynamics in play that maybe you didn't appreciate fully even a few weeks ago?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, Doug. It is not market dynamics. It is very much \u2013 we feel like we're making good progress with the sales team. But at the end of the day, we were expecting a huge ramp in the second half of the year. And I think as we budgeted and everything else and really went back and looked through our mid-year forecast, I think it's unrealistic in terms of what we were expecting for the second half of the year. But feeling \u2013 there is no difference in how we feel from the time we were at your conference to now, other than the ramp going forward. But I think at the end of the day, we delivered in the quarter, frankly, within the range about what I thought we would. But I think the ramp that we had implied in the second half of the year was just way, way beyond what we're going to get to.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. I guess that's kind of the crux of the question, right? I mean, not to be difficult here, but I'm sure you appreciate that, that one thing that you're talking about as being the one thing that changed is kind of the most important thing that's changed. So, what did you see happen in the quarter that you didn't appreciate even a few weeks ago?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Nothing happened in the quarter that we didn't appreciate a few weeks ago, other than really thinking more about the true trajectory going forth. We just delivered $91 million, frankly, in the first fiscal quarter, call it, $85 million and change this quarter, which is frankly very consistent with the seasonal declines you see. Feel good about where we're going. But again, our original guidance for the year implied a much, much stronger ramp, especially in that second half of the year. But I think the team is settling in very, very well. I was just with the sales force a few weeks ago. I think the true churn that occurred in the sales force was just far bigger than we ever imagined, but do feel very good about the leadership and the people we have in place now.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, Doug, I think, in addition to that, as the teams were settling in, I think we've learned a lot more around the ramp.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","And so, we were expecting a much more significant ramp. And as the teams have come in, in this last quarter, I think we've got a better understanding and a better handle on that. And hopefully, we've put ourselves in a situation where we can get into a situation where we can beat and raise, and are looking at this as a conservative number as opposed to chasing the number.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, Doug, just to add one more point. This was only Kevin Thornal's second quarter of actually running the business. And I know it seems like forever, trust me he's a very large shareholder in this company and myself. And where we are, it seems like forever in terms of what we're doing in terms of the turnaround here. But at the end of the day, even as Kevin has gotten in and gotten a lot deeper into the business, much better handle on where that trajectory is going.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. So in Diagnostics, how much do you think the Easter flu weather impacted the quarter? And can you talk about the competitive environment with some of the new products whether you think those are starting to resonate?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Jack, hey. This is Bob. I'll answer the first part of your question in terms of the impact. Quite honestly, it's really hard to know. But what we can say is based on some data that we have that well-woman visits in January and February declined at high-single digit rates in the U.S. versus year ago. So we do think it had a decent impact on our business and we saw in March where it actually rebounded and improved a bit.","And on the new products, I think we're getting some nice progress on those in the uptake. And so far they're still small relative to the overall size of our STI platform, but we're seeing nice feedback certainly from Fusion as well as some of the new products, the Virals and some of the other new products that we have globally.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","We've always said that those are \u2013 yeah, I'm sorry. We've always said those are primarily going to be a growth driver in 2019.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then a two parter on Breast Health. International, great results. Maybe just talk about what the drivers were there. And then in the U.S., recent MQSA data month-to-month, but just talk about some of the recent placement trends? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. International, I think, we are thrilled with the progress we're making. And I'd also remind everybody since we have Kevin Thornal running our Cynosure business, he's the one we sent in Europe a couple of years ago and it was a train wreck. And he totally put all the foundational elements into place that are paying off today for international business. Country by country, we are winning more tenders. Our dealers are more engaged. We also did pick up our dealer in Germany as well as Spain and are winning more accounts since those are now owned by us than they used to win \u2013 winning more tenders than what they did when they were standalone dealers. So, just feeling great about the foundational progress that has been built over there.","Regarding the MQSA data, I'd remind everybody, there's always little variations. And particularly there was a change in methodology that occurred in April where the FDA is now basically having the ACR, certify the machines. We think that may have resulted in more volatility than usual on the most recent number.","Having said that, we feel great about what we are doing in the Breast Health business. And I'm so proud of our team. The market shares we continue to garner, particularly in the United States on 3D, is well beyond, I think, what anybody, ourselves included, could've imagined a couple of years ago in a very competitive market. What our teams are doing there, and not only driving additional gantries and winning so many competitive customers over to us, but then building out that product line. Our interventional business being built out, the service business, the software, and if you see, again, that whole cliff that everybody was so concerned about a couple of years ago under Pete Valenti and our team in the U.S., they have really, really started to change that curve and feel very good about both what they've done and where we're headed.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, if I had to maybe draw an analogy, it's been an interesting season so far. One of \u2013 your peer company from your former life, they took their numbers and the stock actually went-up because the feeling was it was clear when you went for it. And I think what some of the hoarders are questioning is especially looking at quarter stock is in the aftermarket, has the guidance been reset? Like, what's the comfort level that this has been now reset and we won't have any more disappointments going forward?","Stephen MacMillan","Sure, Vijay. It's a great question. Glad you asked it. We feel very good. We don't like the reset. And candidly, we have a lot of debate of do we go as low as we do? We wanted it to be a clearing event. We wanted to get the numbers down as painful as it is. We know there's been a huge overhang and there's been such an obsession with Cynosure. And I would tell you, as I sit here today I have two very mixed feelings. One is I am disappointed because we never like to do this to have to write down and take guidance down. On the other hand I much more confident in our outlook of where we're going. And I fundamentally believe business by business, we have every business getting stronger and going on the right track. So it's \u2013 and I know that's a weird juxtaposition of emotions. But as I sit here \u2013 I know having been with the Cynosure sales team, that market is still a great market. We are increasingly getting the team together. And I don't think people fully understood even though we've talked about it, the gaping holes we had in that sales team. So now as I'm starting to see people getting the wins together. really feeling very good. And my \u2013 frankly, I think our hope was this would be the clearing event to try to get the obsession around Cynosure monthly number, quarterly numbers behind us to where we're not going to be missing and we're going to get into a good place going forward.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore Group LLC","No, understood. And maybe, Bob, one on the guidance. The EPS, I'm kind of having a hard time getting to the range. Is there something below the line maybe on the tax rate for the year which went down, which maybe perhaps \u2013 and explain such as given the guidance cut on the top line and what we saw from a margin front in the Q?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","No. The tax rate is pretty consistent across the quarters. What we have said is, we were taking some investment \u2013 the opportunity to make some investment as a result of the tax rate reduction earlier in the year, and we're actually managing some of the rate or the take down through OpEx reductions. So we're not making \u2013 we've made some investments. We were planning to make more. We're actually probably scaling some of that back to ensure that we've got the strong foundation, because we didn't deliver all of the EPS earnings potential as a result of the tax rate reduction to the bottom line when we first gave guidance.","Operator","Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs has our next question.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Isaac.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","On Cynosure \u2013 hey. Could you tell us when we might be able to expect meaningful new product launches? And the reason I asked is SculpSure got a 510(k) clearance in 2015, and 2016 was a good year for Cynosure so clearly that product cycle has an immediate and significant impact. So you said that the business might need some refreshing in the portfolio. It would be helpful to know kind of when we might expect that.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. I think TempSure just launched in this last quarter. So I think part of what gives us increasing confidence of where we're headed is the TempSure launch is off to a very nice start. And it will have additional applications that will be coming over time, so it may not have the incredible spike. SculpSure was probably an unusually large huge uptick. But I think the fundamental strength of TempSure feel really, really good about where that's going. And the initial sell-in, frankly we're very, very pleased with.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up on capital allocation. Obviously, this is one of the more significant transactions under your tenure and it's been obviously a little disappointing to start. So how has that informed your appetite for future deals? I think in prior quarters you've said that you're still interested looking at bolt-ons. But I'm wondering if maybe it makes sense to pump the brakes a little bit more until you put up a couple good quarters here or if this really sort of unaffected to your view on future M&A? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Isaac, obviously, we're incredibly disappointed. And therefore it does affect how we think about it going forward. But really, what it comes down to is we now want to be really focused as we'd like to be on true tuck-ins that supplement our existing businesses. So, that's where we're very focused, much smaller deal size than obviously Cynosure. That was an unusual opportunity. But at the end of the day, we're very focused now really by division. That added a new division to us. Now, all of our focus is within the existing divisions.","And the other piece I would say is, I'm much more closely driving the inorganic, the business development propositions by having the division presidents reporting directly to me, and feel very good that we're both making go and no-go decisions faster in the process. And I do think \u2013 I hope to see some small little things that will be coming forth over the course of the year, but clearly on a very different scale.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So, I guess I think I know the answer to this first question, but I'm going to throw it out there anyway, Steve. It sounds like \u2013 did I hear it correctly that you finished hiring out or building out, I should say, the sales team for Cynosure, so all those seats are filled and now it's kind of a bit of a waiting game to get them up the curve?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. It's not fully built out, but I'd say we're 90-ish percent there now. And it is. And I would say it's \u2013 while it's \u2013 I'd probably say it's less about waiting for them to get up to speed. We're training them in a different ways much more aggressively. We're seeing some of them starting to hit the ground running and getting their sales far faster than what we might have usually expected. And that's what gives us a good outlook. I think coming back really to an earlier question two of we haven't wanted to take debt by a thousand cuts. We wanted to survey the situation long enough, have Kevin in this role. He's been reporting directly to me now for the last four months. I think we have a very good handle on where the business is going, what's going on, and figured, okay, let's just take it down and then we build from here.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Understood. And then just, I guess, kind of thinking a little longer term, Steve, about the business with new products like TempSure as well as the ongoing competitive dynamic. Once we kind of get through the period of getting these guys up and running, trained, productive, how should we be thinking about the longer term kind of pace of the segment? Should we be thinking about this as double-digit type of revenue growth once we get beyond this interim period here?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Absolutely. That's how we're thinking about it, Bill. This is still the fastest-growing market of any market we compete in. And as you know, with us, every market we compete in, we play to do very well and grow faster than the markets. And I fully believe we will be there in the exact same place over time.","This is a product-driven, relationship-driven, sales force-driven business, just as our other businesses. We've had a little bit of an extra learning curve in this particular one. But there is nothing in it that says we can't compete and do exceptionally well. We also see it still \u2013 despite obviously a major competitor in Allergan, the rest of the business is still very \u2013 the rest of the industry is still very fragmented. And we see big opportunity still over time that will also be an area for tuck-ins and things like that once we have the sales force well established. And that's exactly where we're going to be focused.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Steve. Can you talk more about the strategy to get GYN Surg growing again, other than easy comps and new leadership? And on the competitive front, you did \u2013 publication has been asked if you retracted, so I'm just wondering whether you're willing to comment on that at all as well.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. I'm very, very happy that you asked that question. It will not be retracted. We feel very good about the underlying way that that study was done. So, feel really, really good about that.","And you said other than easy comps and leadership, I'll go with the second one. Other than leadership, well, leadership is what it's about. And this is another one that we replaced the President, the VP of Sales, three of the four regional leaders and more than half of the managers, all in the last nine months, and feel really, really good about where that business and those leaders are going from a competitive standpoint. You see, MyoSure started to pick back up this quarter. We're watching the underlying trends and feeling good that that business has come down.","We said back in January at your conference, I said, hey, we're going to be in for a few rougher quarters. If you look, our first quarter was down, call it, 8%; this quarter, down 5-ish. I think we may still not \u2013 we'll likely still be down a touch maybe this quarter. And I think by the time we exit the year, exactly as we said at your conference in January, I think we'll be back to growth and moving in that right trajectory. But as I acknowledge, I think we fell asleep at the switch a little bit too long. We were slow making leadership changes in that division, and our teams are fighting back now.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, a follow-up on Cyno, for Bob maybe. Was the entire guidance cut from Cyno? You said it was primarily Cyno, so I just want to make sure there's not something else that's changing in the assumptions. And then, does the write-down have implications on the level of reinvestment you're willing to make on that business around DTC and other areas?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. I'll take the second question first. The answer on that is no, it doesn't affect the level of investment. The write-off is really a reflection of, hey, we've got a much lower base than it was originally contemplated in our model and it's going to take us longer, but we're still expecting growth in that business and we'll invest behind that.","In regards to the takedown, the majority of it \u2013 vast majority of it was Cynosure. We took that down multiple tens of millions of dollars, as you can expect or as you can imagine, relative to the forecast that we had built in. There are some small changes relative to probably Diagnostics with the not getting back, the January and February, but those are small.","I would add one other thing on the piece with NovaSure. I think not only the clinical results that have come out and were published, but also some of the survey, I think we've given our sales organization more tools to be able to be much more competitive in the marketplace. So, it's not only new leadership, it's also new tools to actually get out there and provide. And then with NovaSure ADVANCED that's been out, really driving that as well.","Operator","Jon Block with Stifel has our next question.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Jon.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, Steve. I'll ask two quick ones. First, just on the gross margins. The gross margins were a bit below what we were looking for specific to fiscal 2Q. And so, Bob, maybe if you can talk about, was that specific to one division versus another? And then, how should we think about gross margins going forward? And then, I just got a quick follow-up.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. So, there wasn't any one-time discrete event in there. It was really a result of probably two things, geographic mix with our international business really driving that and then product mix within the divisions. I would expect that to be flat to slightly improving over the rest of the year. As Surgical comes back to growth, that's a very highly \u2013 a very accretive gross margin business. And then, actually as the U.S. business and Cynosure, that also has a much better gross margin than overall Cynosure as a whole. So, we do think that that will help \u2013 kind of help with gross margin going forward, and we've obviously got our continued productivity model programs as well.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, I think I've got this number right, but the 15.1% international growth, call it, ex Cyno and blood, can you approximate what the organic growth was, sort of if you exclude some of the recent distributor tuck-ins, if you can quantify that? Thanks, guys.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. This is Bob. That was still roughly double-digit total.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we hear from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. So, a question or two. So, I appreciate the fact that when you revamped the European sales force, you sent Kevin over there and you were able to turn it around. But when I look at that, it's because I think Hologic certainly has very good technology, very differentiated products and certainly there is a medical need for those products. So \u2013 and the same thing in Surgical, I can certainly understand how the sales force coming in, a new management coming in is going to do that. That isn't really the case with Cynosure. I mean, there's not a lot of medical need for it. There is \u2013 the publications around it are a little bit choppy in terms of what it is. It's like \u2013 so, my question is, it's like, where the same playbooks work given that you're trying to go into a market which is a little bit fuzzier than what you're normally going after?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Fair question, Derik. I look at it slightly different. While the medical need is traditionally defined might not be as big, there is huge demand. And the people who want these procedures and the docs providing them, there's a lot more data and the opportunity to drive data. But at the end of the day, this is about great products and great sales people. And that's really what drives this business, and building long-term customer relationships. So, that is not that different than what we can do. And we know, we just got to go prove it. We will.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I mean \u2013 and have you seen any traction at all in the OB\/GYN market for MonaLisa?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, yes. And again, we think that particularly with additional clinical data over time and our sales force, we're seeing some new customer interest in that product and do feel very good about where that will go over time, and also that that will be the leading edge frankly to help a lot of OB\/GYNs get into cash pay, everything else. We always said we didn't do Cynosure for 2017 or 2018, we did it for the long haul. We know patience is thin right now on it, but we're incredibly focused and, frankly, only the coming quarters, what we say now probably isn't going to matter a lot, but I'm very confident we'll be putting those points on the board as we go forward.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Operator, I think we have time for maybe one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And just to follow up a little bit on that last question. There's a lot of talk obviously within Cyno about what's going on in \u2013 on the body category, and you mentioned a little bit here on OB\/GYN. But there's other parts here, the skin part is well. Can you just talk about where it is that you're really seeing the deficit here relative to what you originally thought? Is it all on that body side? Is it that the OB\/GYN's a little bit less or is the skin not coming through kind of where you thought? And can you also address, if you wouldn't mind, what your longer term margin expectations are for the business? I understand \u2013 I recognize that you're still thinking longer \u2013 double-digit growth in the outyears, but how do you think about the profitability of this business going forward? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure Brian. The first part is the deficits that we see are less byproduct category than they were the gaping holes where we didn't have sales people on the streets. And again, we keep trying to emphasize, there were a lot of holes in the sales force, we just didn't have people showing up. And therefore every product line was that \u2013 we had areas that had virtually very few sales at all. So, it's \u2013 the gaps we're looking at are far more by territory than by product line. As we go forth and we're starting to see it, as we're putting people back in those territories, we're seeing SculpSure, we're seeing TempSure, we're seeing Icon. We're seeing all of the categories start to get the lift back up for the things.","Ultimately, profitability over time, we think it's going to take some time. The gross margin will be slightly dilutive to the company here in the nearer term. Long-term, can that be at the company average? We certainly would hope so. Operating margins today are very, very small, so that will be an opportunity over time. I think that'll still take multiple years before that gets to a \u2013 an operating margin that is not dilutive to the company.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call.

My name is Kelsie, and I'm your operator for today's conference. In addition, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now I would like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the conference. Please go ahead, Ms. Gordon.","Deborah R. Gordon","Thank you, Kelsie. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings call. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Friday, August 17, and a copy of our press release discussing our third quarter results, as well as our fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 guidance, is available in the Overview section of the Investor Relations section of Hologic's website. Also in that section is a PowerPoint presentation related to the comments that will be made during today's opening remarks.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Hologic during the course of this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement, in our third quarter fiscal 2012 earnings release and in the company's filings with the SEC.","Also during this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures can also be found in our third quarter earnings release, including the financial tables in the release. Please note, today's call will consist of 30 minutes of opening remarks from management, followed by a 30-minute question-and-answer session. We do need to limit each participant's question to just one, with one related follow-up as necessary. However, please feel free to go back into queue, and if time permits, we'll be more than happy to take your questions at that time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Rob Cascella, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Robert A. Cascella","Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon, and thank you for dialing in to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Glenn Muir, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Peter Soltani, our General Manager of Breast Health; and David Harding, General Manager of International Operations.","Today, I'm going to summarize our third quarter performance, update you on the market adoption of our Dimensions 3D tomo system and provide a brief review on some of our other key businesses. Glen will then discuss the financial results in greater detail and provide color on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 guidance. We will then open up the call for 30 minutes of Q&A.","Before I start on the quarter, I would like to provide a brief update on the status of the Gen-Probe acquisition. I want to remind everyone, we are not closed yet, so my comments will be limited to the events involving the transaction. The Gen-Probe shareholder vote will occur tomorrow, July 31, and closing of the transaction is expected on August 1. As we announced on July 11, Carl Hull, CEO of Gen-Probe, will remain with Hologic for a minimum of 15 months. He will serve as General Manager of the combined diagnostic franchise, which will include both the cytology and Molecular businesses.","I'm also pleased to tell you that the majority of Gen-Probe key senior leadership are also being retained, as well as many other key employees throughout the organization. Although Glenn will report more thoroughly, I must comment we were thrilled with the success of our financing efforts and believe our effective borrowing rate on this transaction is an indication on the power of the combination of these 2 leading companies. With respect to the integration planning and implementation, I again couldn't be more pleased. It has been an intense 2 months of effort on the parts of Hologic and Gen-Probe. We've had over 100 people as part of 15 functional and 6 cross-functional teams focused on all aspects of integration, day one priorities, future goal setting and synergies. In addition, we've been assisted by E&Y and Mackenzie, [ph] who both played extremely valuable roles in this process.","Our value drivers are focused primarily on commercial requirements, product development priorities, sales force rationalization and the international rollout of products. We are extremely pleased at how well the teams have work together on very tough strategic and emotional issues. The success of these plans will have much, much more to do with the revenue synergies that we have discussed in earlier presentations. We are leveraging the Hologic global distribution infrastructure for these wonderful world-class products. In short, I am even more enthusiastic about this transaction. We are confident in our growth projections and firmly believe the revenue synergies made available by this combination are even more attractive than originally expected.","Now I'd like to take a few minutes to give you an update on the third quarter. In Q3, revenues increased 4.2% over the prior year to $470 million. Without question, the numbers fell short of our expectations, but we believe there are favorable indicators. The Diagnostic business was strong, Surgical grew on a sequential basis, and 3D mammography ended the quarter with a very strong backlog. Also encouraging is our gross margin improvement. We are seeing a benefit from both the acceleration in our Diagnostic and Surgical segments, as well as the heavier concentration of 3D mammography in our results. Non-GAAP earnings per share rose 7% over prior year to $0.35, ahead of both guidance and consensus. Although a challenging quarter, it has been one with many positive indicators. I wanted to address for a moment some macroeconomic trends that we're seeing and how they're impacting our business. Clearly, the persistence of economic conditions in Europe is having an impact on our business. Sales cycles have slowed, and there is an increasing pricing pressure. In addition, the collapse of the euro has caused both margin erosion on European sales and a negative translational impact. In the quarter alone, our revenues were impacted by more than $4 million.","We do not expect this trend to improve over the near term. It will unfortunately be a reality for some time. We do believe however, that packet of growth remain. Our ThinPrep business continues to gain traction in both developed and emerging international markets. Dimension 2D and 3D are thriving in places like Latin America, the Middle East and Australia. While international Selenia units are slightly down on a year-over-year basis, our Dimension units have nearly doubled. On a mid-to-longer term basis, we see continued growth in both our international Diagnostics business, specifically ThinPrep and Cervista. We also believe European market acceptance of 3D mammography will accelerate with the published results of important clinical trial data. Finally, we believe our Surgical business will have modest OUS growth as current economic conditions do not work in its favor.","I'd like to now provide you with a bit more color on tomosynthesis. We remain very pleased with the uptake of our Dimensions 3D systems. As noted last quarter, we've started to see demand for 3D eclipsing demand for our 2D systems. We firmly believe this is the result of the power of this technology, irrespective of limitations related to reimbursement and market conditions. To rehash a bit about the third quarter, as we stated in our press release on July 11, we experienced a significant acceleration in the shift of orders from 2D to 3D. This created both opportunity and some challenges. We expected tomo installations would take longer than 2D due to physician training requirements. This delay was exacerbated by the logistics of training all radiologists on image interpretation prior to shipment. Customers' preference has been to have all radiologists trained on a peer-to-peer basis before units are installed. To be clear, this is third-party training and, as you may recall, was not a requirement for 2D training. The good news is the significant growth in domestic 3D bookings generated additional backlog, and we expect the majority of these units to be installed in the fourth quarter.","So what do we do in response to our physician training limitations? We are working to increase access to physician training in order to support the current and expected growth demands. Additional classes are being created with more radiologist trainers. Most importantly, we want to structure broader training availability, while not compromising the quality of the programs since we believe this is paramount to customers realizing the full benefit of technologies. We believe that over the next couple of quarters, we will be in much better shape to respond to our increasing demand. Nonetheless, as I mentioned, 3D sales are exceeding expectations. Based on Q3 installations, we are approximately 45% of our 2-year unit goal of 500 to 700 3D systems in the United States. We have units in over 45 states today. But with units shipped to date and units already in backlog and expected to ship in the fourth quarter, we are already at our target of 60% of this range by the end of fiscal '12, as previously stated.","For tomo reimbursement, we remain on track with our strategy and are reaffirming our estimated timeframe for securing a dedicated tomo reimbursement solution by the end of the first half of calendar '13. We are still expecting the publication of clinical results from some key studies to peer review journals by the end of this year. Overall, we're very pleased with the preliminary results thus far and believe each paper will establish another level of validation for this powerful technology. A summary of papers submitted and those to be submitted are as follows: the FDA clinical trial paper by Dr. Rafferty is submitted and accepted by radiology; the Oslo study, which has over 12,000 patients, has been submitted; Dr. Rose's study, another prospective screening study of 9,000 patients, has been submitted; there is a Magee paper on advanced diagnostics, which has been submitted; and an Italian paper of 7,000 patients is pending submission.","I'd like to talk about some of the other business units now and their impact on Q3. Diagnostics experienced a solid quarter overall, with growth of 11% on a year-over-year basis. The ThinPrep franchise remains resilient, with some modest declines domestically due to lab consolidation and, therefore, some lower pricing under volume arrangements. In addition, we do see some signs of interval expansion. As a result, domestic units were down approximately 3% compared to last year. This is an erosion rate we have been indicating for some time, so really no surprises. International growth was quite strong, however, aided somewhat by sales through TCT. We were very pleased with the early successes we are having with our business in China and additional growth opportunities in other emerging markets. The combination of better penetration in Europe and our focus on emerging markets has generated strong international unit growth of over 30% on a year-over-year basis. We expect sustainable international growth throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal '12.","Regarding the Molecular, the revenues for our Molecular Diagnostics division were up 30% on a year-over-year basis, almost all of which came from sales of Cervista in the U.S. and in China. Revenues were again fueled by new customer account wins, growth at existing accounts and international penetration. Our high throughput automation system, approved late in Q1, is being well received in the U.S. market. We currently have over 30 units installed domestically, and early customer feedback is very promising. Internationally, we continue to launch our medium throughput automation. We have installed 14 MTA systems internationally and have a robust pipeline of potential new accounts.","Full commercial launch of Cervista HPV began in China in Q2. And while it is still early, we are very pleased with the initial response. We have converted a large number of manual accounts and are making steady progress in the market. This should be considered as further validation of our market segmentation strategy, whereby Cervista will play a valuable role in emerging, decentralized markets. We obviously expect our Molecular business to undergo significant change with the combination of Gen-Probe products and technology. The combined teams are anxious to get to the market with our rollout strategies.","Now to talk about GYN Surgical. The Surgical business declined 2% on a year-over-year basis, but when adjusted for the discontinuance of Adiana, the business unit grew 3% over prior year and 4% over the prior quarter. This growth was primarily due to our MyoSure product line, which nearly tripled when compared to last year. Importantly, NovaSure did realize some growth over the prior quarter of 3% sequentially. We believe the NovaSure improvement is partially due to our now fully trained sales team additions being better focused without the distraction costs by exiting the Adiana business.","We remain totally committed to NovaSure and have a series of product improvements under development, intended to enable us to effectively compete for years to come. This remains an underserved market, and we believe we have the best technology available with the highest efficacy.","One newer data point supporting this is the meta-analysis published by the British Medical Journal on global endometrial ablation. This analysis included 19 randomized controlled studies, where the results of over 3,000 women undergoing such procedures were analyzed. The results concluded NovaSure was more effective than either thermal balloon or free fluid ablation technologies. We believe this is a compelling example of the superiority of our product.","So we were encouraged by Surgical's performance in the quarter and believe it will be a growth business in the future.","In summary, we're generally pleased with the quarter. We believe we have the appropriate plan in place to respond to our increasing demand for tomo. Our international Diagnostics business continues to outperform our initial expectations. Surgical's long-term growth outlook is encouraging. And finally, we're excited to be approaching the closing of the Gen-Probe acquisition and pleased with the tremendous progress made with our integration efforts.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn P. Muir","Thank you, Rob. Starting with some additional detail on our acquisition of Gen-Probe. On July 19, we announced the pricing of our private placement of high-yield notes, as well as expected pricing on our anticipated $2.8 billion of senior secured credit facilities. We are very pleased with the terms we were able to secure. The expected blended average interest rate of all the tranches of the debt financing is approximately 4.8%, slightly below the 5% estimate we shared with you when we announced the acquisition in April. The cash rate is actually 4.64%. And with the original issue discount included, the yield is the 4.8% rate we announced. The offering is expected to close concurrently with the completion of Hologic's acquisition of Gen-Probe.","Our acquisition strategy changes following the Gen-Probe acquisition. Specifically, our capital allocation plans will focus squarely on the repayment of our debt obligations. We estimate our total debt to EBITDA ratio will start out over 5x upon the close of the acquisition. And we have a target of reducing this to 2.5x over the next 3 years or by the end of our fiscal year 2015. Given our cash flow generation abilities, coupled with Gen-Probe's, we remain confident this goal is achievable.","As Rob mentioned, the integration plans are comprehensive and sound, and we expect to integrate Gen-Probe into Hologic smoothly. After undergoing a rigorous integration planning process over the last several months, we remain highly confident in the $40 million in year one cost synergies we guided to at the time of the acquisition and the $75 million in the first 3 years. We also remain confident that our projected revenue synergies are achievable and will help us to realize a return on invested capital of approximately 13%, well above our 8% weighted average cost of capital.","With regards to Gen-Probe's June quarter, we are mindful the acquisition is not yet closed, so we are not at liberty to discuss. We will begin incorporating their results from August 1 forward, which will be part of our September quarter reported at our next earnings conference call scheduled for November 12, along with expected guidance for fiscal 2013. In addition, we will include their June quarter's results in our upcoming SEC filings, specifically in a footnote disclosure in our Form 10-K, to be filed at the end of November and as part of pro forma financial information in our registration statement for our high-yield notes to be filed in January. Our efforts today are focused on a successful start to our integration and the launch of our combined commercial operations.","Now moving onto the quarter. Consolidated revenues of $470.2 million this quarter increased $19.1 million or 4.2% from last year and was slightly below the low end of our guidance range of $475 million to $480 million. We saw growth in 2 of our 4 operating segments, with the increases in Diagnostics and Breast Health offsetting softer year-over-year results in both GYN Surgical and Skeletal. FX had a negative impact on consolidated revenues of approximately $4.3 million this quarter, or a reduction of 100 basis points to total revenue growth year-over-year. So revenue growth on a constant-currency basis was 5.2%.","Turning to our operating segments, Breast Health revenues increased $6.3 million or 3.1% from last year. This revenue growth came from a 9.5% increase in service revenues. Product revenues on the mammography side was slightly down year-over-year due to the ongoing shift to our dimensions mammography product lines from our legacy Selenias, as Rob discussed. Revenues benefited from growth in our breast biopsy line again this quarter, specifically Eviva, which posted 30% growth year-over-year. Digital Mammography product sales and associated service revenues represent the largest portion of the segment revenue, almost 70% this quarter, with about 1\/2 coming from each.","Looking closer at Digital Mammography product sales, results were driven primarily by our Dimensions line, which represents 71% of Digital Mammography revenue and 60% of units this quarter and were sharply higher than one year ago. As we reported in our press release on July 11, third quarter product revenues were slowed by the increase in shift of orders from 2D Digital Mammography systems to our 3D tomo systems. The number of 3D tomos in our domestic backlog increased 76% sequentially from last quarter. 3D upgrades represented 25% of all tomo unit sales in Q3, up from 21% last quarter. We continue to believe that over time, all 2D Dimensions sold will upgrade to 3D and as such, upgrades remain an important contributor to 3D tomo adoption.","Shifting to Diagnostics, this segment was the largest contributor to consolidated revenue growth again this quarter. Year-over-year revenues increased $15.3 million or 10.6%. Almost 3\/4 of this segment's growth this quarter came from our core Diagnostics businesses, primarily our ThinPrep pap test, with the balance coming from our molecular diagnostic product line. Worldwide ThinPrep test volume increased 8% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Importantly, core Diagnostics sales growth benefited from our acquisition of TCT in June a year ago. TCT's strong performance this quarter clearly demonstrates both the successful integration of our former distributor and our success increasing the number of ThinPrep tests sold and the addition of numerous new products to the TCT infrastructure. We continue to expect close to 20% annual revenue growth from TCT in fiscal 2012. We saw a strong performance again this quarter from our Molecular business. We saw double-digit growth in our Cervista HPV line, with overall growth in both domestic and international markets, driven primarily by new account growth versus the prior-year period.","Our GYN Surgical segment reported a $1.7 million decline in revenues or 2.1% year-over-year as a result of lower year-over-year revenues from NovaSure, as well as the $3.6 million incremental reduction in Adiana due to the discontinuance of that product line. MyoSure had a very strong quarter, growing from a business with revenues in the low millions in Q3 of last year to over $10 million in the current quarter. Sequentially, NovaSure sales started to improve with low single-digit growth.","International sales continued to grow, increasing 21% year-over-year and representing 27% of total company revenues in the third quarter, up from 25% last year. We attribute this to our continued focus on global expansion in recent years. Excluding the $4.3 million negative FX impact, international growth was 25% year-over-year.","Now for a brief review of third quarter performance on the rest of the P&L. Gross margins on a non-GAAP basis was 62%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, up 80 basis points sequentially and at the low end of our guidance range. Despite slightly lower-than-expected revenues, we are pleased with our gross margin results. The strength in the margins was mainly the result of the increase in sales of our Diagnostics products, which contribute to higher gross margin in our capital equipment and also the discontinuance of the Adiana product line, which historically had a significant negative impact on margins.","Non-GAAP operating expenses declined $0.3 million or 0.2% to $141.1 million in Q3 and declined $7.5 million or 5.1% from Q2 of 2012. Total operating expenses represented approximately 30% of sales, down 130 basis points versus the prior-year period and down 150 basis points versus Q2 of '12. The decrease in operating expenses compared to our guidance included a favorable R&D spend this quarter as a result of the shift in certain projects from fiscal Q3 to Q4. We continue to target opportunities to grow operating expenses more slowly than revenues in an effort to take advantage of the potential leverage in our business model. Non-GAAP adjusted pretax income increased $13.2 million or 10.3% to $140.3 million this quarter and non-GAAP adjusted net income increased $6.8 million or 8% and $92.6 million. Fully diluted non-GAAP EPS was $0.35 this quarter, $0.01 above our guidance of $0.34 and $0.03 higher than Q3 of last year. We continue to generate strong free cash flows, and we ended our third quarter with cash balance of $906 million, an increase of $193 million from the end of fiscal 2011 and up $51 million sequentially. This sequential increase is primarily due to improving working capital management and continued strong generation of cash from operations overall. We generated approximately $105 million in free cash this quarter.","Now moving on to guidance. We will fully \u2013 we fully detail our guidance expectations in our Q3 '12 earnings release and our supplementary PowerPoint presentation, both of which are posted on our IR website. Therefore, I will simply highlight our guidance estimates here.","This guidance includes Hologic's current operations and does not include the results of Gen-Probe or the additional financing. For Q4 '12 ending this September 29, we expect revenues of $485 million, representing growth of 4% year-over-year. Our guidance assumes constant foreign currency rates with the end of Q3 '12. Adjusting to foreign currency rates from 1 year ago, on a constant-currency basis, our revenue would be $491 million or $6 million higher, and growth year-over-year would be 5%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margins of approximately 62% to 62.5%, operating expenses of $145 million to $150 million, interest expense of approximately $10 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 34%. All this results in expected non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.35 to $0.36.","For fiscal 2012 ending September 29, we are reaffirming our most recent total revenue guidance of approximately $1.9 billion, which we provided a couple of weeks ago, and which represents growth of approximately 6%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect gross margins of approximately 62%, operating expenses of $585 million to $590 million, interest expense of approximately $42 million and an effective tax rate of 34%. All this results in expected non-GAAP EPS of $1.36 to $1.38, which implies growth of 7% to 9% year-over-year.","Turning to cash flow guidance, we anticipate free cash flow for the year of approximately $400 million, which continues to be driven primarily by our operating earnings. As you are aware, capital expenditures are not a big part of our business, and we are expecting steady CapEx and depreciation of approximately $65 million each for the year. And in summary, we view our fiscal third quarter performance favorably. Despite some of the revenue softness due to the accelerated shift from 3D to \u2013 shift from 2D to 3D tomo, we remain on track to hit or exceed our placement 2-year goal of 60%. Our international operations posted solid year-over-year results as our investments in emerging markets in recent years offset ongoing weakness in Europe. The organization remains focused on execution and expense control this quarter, driving non-GAAP EPS results that exceeded our guidance. We accomplished all of this in the face of a large potential distraction, our acquisition of Gen-Probe, showing notable performance from our inspired and focused team. We look forward to both the continued improvement in all of our segments in Q4 and the next phase of Hologic's growth following the close of our acquisition.","Now with that, let me turn the call back to Rob.","Robert A. Cascella","Thanks, Glenn. So in closing, we are keenly focused on execution. Completing the Gen-Probe acquisition and moving forward with our near-term product rollout plans is paramount to our success. Continuing to drive forward with our other strategic initiatives will ensure our longer-term growth expectations. We look forward to reporting to you next quarter on the close of fiscal '12, and more importantly, a first look at the newly combined business for fiscal '13. We are confident we have one of the finest product portfolios in this company's history, particularly with the addition of our expanded diagnostic line. Although many external challenges remain, Hologic is well positioned for sustained growth over the next 5 years. Thank you for participating on the call. We're going to open it up for 30 minutes of Q&A at this point.","Operator, please open up the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just maybe first off, Rob, if you could comment by each of the business units -- on your thoughts regarding the pricing environment, not only for capital equipment, but as well as consumables. Then secondly, just want to clarify on the mechanics for the Gen-Probe numbers this quarter. When will we be getting a look at the second quarter numbers? It sounds like they might not come up until November, and I wanted to clear that up.","Glenn P. Muir","Isaac, let me start with the Gen-Probe question. That is correct. We do not have June results available for us to disclose today, and those results will be disclosed as part of future SEC filings. And the first one, you're correct, it's the November timeframe in a footnote with our 10-K.","Robert A. Cascella","As far as pricing, what we're seeing is just really the, I think, the results of a weakening economy in Europe that is certainly putting a lot of pressure on downward pricing, competition's pricing and so on and so forth. Not a total surprise. The persistence, as I've commented on my script, is one that I think we just have to accept as reality. I don't believe that we're seeing that same kind of downward pricing here in the states. Although it is -- really, the results are quite simply that the tomo product is so new in terms of adoption that there is not that same kind of pricing as a result of more mature technologies.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And elsewhere in the business, if you could maybe clarify what you saw in pricing regarding Surgical and Diagnostics, that would be great.","Robert A. Cascella","Sure. On Diagnostics, the International business, it's doing quite well. And we're -- although we're certainly being aggressive on some competitive takeaways for both Cervista and in the case of ThinPrep, these are typically in countries that either we have had little penetration or in fact no volume. So it may be at a lower AUP than what some of our historic pricing might be, but it is business that otherwise we have not had. Domestically, or -- with Surgical, which is primarily the market that we focus on, there is some price erosion as we went back after market share. And just to put it in perspective, we are talking about something much less than 5%, but we are buying per share at a very, very aggressive rate in order to grow that business.","Operator","Moving on to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And maybe just to follow up on that last question on pricing. As you go to negotiate HPV contracts, are you able to talk at all about pricing for the Gen-Probe products yet, or do you have to wait until the deal closes?","Robert A. Cascella","We have certainly not talked about the Gen-Probe products at all. That wouldn't happen, Tycho, until we were closed with the transaction.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then to clarify your comments on pricing in Europe, does that creep over to tomo as well? I mean if Siemens' gotten more aggressive on pricing. They have been for a while I guess but...","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, we're -- and I think that's a correct statement. Siemens has been heavily discounting their tomo unit. I think what we're seeing is a lot of the earlier sites have now bought tomo, so we're into sites that are on the edge of whether they want to invest in it. And consequently, they are negotiating much more aggressively as a result of that. So clearly, it is impacting tomo, but because the European market is representing a much smaller percentage of total tomo sales, it is having a lesser impact on the business.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then you had a sequential increase in NovaSure. Can you talk about your thought on that product line? You\u2019ve backed off the DTC, right? So can you talk a little bit about what's driving that?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I think it's a couple of things. I mean we shifted the focus of DTC to really follow-up on those women that had responded to our awareness campaign. So it's really conversions that we're focusing on, been having a very routine exchanges with women that we're asking for additional information. The other element that has created a positive movement in the product line is simply the comment that I made earlier. We had 30 incremental people that were brought on at the beginning of the year. Those people are now fully trained. They're not being burdened by all of the confusion over the discontinuance of Adiana. And as a result of that, we're seeing a bit of an uptake in terms of market share gains in the States.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Last one and I'll hop back in the queue. Can you talk about the sustainability of growth for the service business for Breast Health? Is that really a function of rolling out tomo, there's more service upfront, or can you just talk about the dynamics there?","Robert A. Cascella","Realistically, the service business will continue to grow until there is an influx in where tomo units really take off. Because as we've talked about in the past, as we sell more tomo units and trade out Selenias, the tomo unit is under warranty, and the Selenia would have been under a service contract. So there will be a gap in service revenue, when there is a much sharper uptake in the number of tomo units that are being sold. But the good news would be is that we're replacing a $40,000 or $50,000 service contract with the sale of a $400,000 tomo unit. Following that 1-year warranty, we went back to a service contract revenue as well.","Operator","Moving on to Ross Muken with ISI.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Vijay in for Ross. So I wanted to dig in a little bit on the 3D tomo update. Just looking back to when you launched 2D, could you compare and contrast sort of how was the 3D update progressing when you compare it with the 2D launch? And you also mentioned the clinical trial data by the CRN [ph] and reimbursement rates next year. How are those factors going to impact adoption?","Robert A. Cascella","Sure. I'll give you a couple of data points on the difference, and I think it will be compelling for you. So in 2003, we introduced Selenia, and globally, we sold 57 units. And it's a product that had reimbursement, and there was an established market for it. Today, we are talking about, in the first 18 months of selling tomo here in the states, that we're targeting a number that's going to be 350 or 360 units based on the statistics that we gave out earlier. So the adoption and uptake of a relatively new technology without reimbursement, we think, is very compelling. The clinical trials, as I said in my opening comments, we think will be a further validation of the technology. Meaning that these are prospective high-volume studies with, we think, very compelling results relative to improvements in both sensitivity and specificity. So we think they will help tremendously. And we, obviously, are anxious to get those in a published state, so that the world can see the results.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then on Gen-Probe, I know that you guys probably aren't going to comment. But one point that you mentioned in your prepared remarks was -- caught my attention. The Revenue synergy is looking even more attractive than originally expected. So I just -- what led you to make that comment? Sort of where's the delta -- incremental delta coming from?","Robert A. Cascella","We are just seeing more opportunities for we to have very complementary selling activities. I think there's a lot of effort over the last couple of months that have gone in to product rationalization, product rollout strategies here in the states and abroad. And we're, quite frankly, we're just very, very encouraged by that. And that was the basis of that comment.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I'm curious about the overall sales cycle in the U.S. for Dimensions and for tomo. Are you saying that the cycle from the time you first initiate with a potential user is narrowing, staying the same, getting wider? And what are the macro trends that -- are there broader macro trends that are influencing that?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes. I'll make a comment and Peter Soltani can add to that as well. I think in general, the sales cycles are [indiscernible]. People are obviously much more physically oriented around a tough economic condition. And as a result of that, we're seeing people really wanting to make certain that they obviously have units that are going to be installed, and they're going to generate revenue right away, that there is some near-term reality to reimbursement and so on and so forth. So it would be difficult for us say that even tomo wouldn't be impacted by that. We're just seeing a lot more resilience in that product than not. And, Peter, you may want to add.","Peter K. Soltani","Yes. I mean, the only thing that I would add is those customers who may have budgeted [indiscernible] to get a 2D unit are hearing about the positive clinical outcomes and are rethinking the investment in what would essentially be an obsolete product. So that is also adding to a bit of the delay that they may put off purchasing a 2D unit until they can budget to get a 3D unit at some point later in the year or next year.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then as you think about what your customers are telling you as far as the volumes that they're seeing, what kind of an average increase are they seeing in total volumes once they bring out a tomo unit at this point? Do you have any information on that?","Robert A. Cascella","It's going to be different for the different types of sites that are buying it, right? If it is excited [ph] as in the business of breast imaging, for-profit mammography, if you will, then they're spending more advertising dollars and their out garnering market share in their local communities. To what extent that occurs, I couldn't really respond. I think other sites are buying it as we had stated earlier. Those early adopters, because of the strength of the technology and they're not as interested in marketing the differentiation of this product versus a 2D system. So it really is all over the map. And a lot of it has to do with the profile on the customers that we're selling to.","Operator","We'll go ahead and move on to Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So on Breast Health and Dimensions, specifically, can you talk a little bit about what the actual install times are right now and where you think they can go? And just secondly, what's the underlying cancellation rate for Dimensions systems? Obviously, you're not seeing -- it doesn't sound like you're seeing an increase in cancellations, but there is always an underlying cancellation rate. What is that for this type of product?","Peter K. Soltani","Well, I'll say the cancellation rate -- I'm not sure that we have any cancellations, or maybe I don't understand the question, but people that commit to purchasing unit are actually quite anxious to get the unit in. With respect to the installation cycle time, from an installation standpoint, from our perspective, from the things that we have to do, it's a comparatively fast process. So we can get things turned around, depending on the location, geographic location, within a couple of weeks, frankly. The delay really comes in with the site itself and their own internal logistics of getting a multitude of radiologists trained. So they typically don't want to have just a couple of radiologists trained. A site that may have 10, 15, 18 radiologists that would be a mix of full-time mammographers, as well as some part-time mammography readers. They'll tend to want to get everybody trained before they have to get it installed at their location. And that's sort of the variable that we've been dealing with.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And what is that roughly? Are you talking like 2 or 3 weeks? Are you talking 1 month or 2 months?","Peter K. Soltani","Yes, that could be a couple -- it could be up to a quarter, depending on, again, what the dynamics are around the site itself. So I would say 2 or 3 months maybe a bit of an extreme, but it can be a significant amount of time. And then there is an expense for this site as well. And in some cases, we can do WebEx training. In other cases, the site may elect to send in physicians to an offsite and do that. [ph]","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, Rob, my follow up on reimbursement. I think you've said in the past 65% to 75% of sites are getting reimbursement on the first try. How has that changed over the last quarter?","Robert A. Cascella","Sure. We're seeing a fair amount of consistency relative to the success of sites that are submitting, as well as in the amount, which we believe we're still averaging, somewhere around $50. So that's been a very consistent process.","Operator","We'll now hear from Rich Newitter with Leerink Swann.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I just want to start off with the GYN Surgical segment. It looks like MyoSure had a very nice uptick. And I think you said it was over $10 million this quarter. Can you just give us a sense of -- is this what a run rate -- are we approaching a run rate for this product? How should we think about modeling this seemingly successful product launch?","Robert A. Cascella","It's very successful. And I would say that from a market potential, we think this is a $200 million to $300 million product line. Relative to its trajectory, it's a lot like the NovaSure launch in the early days relative to the success in the market and the growth parameters around that. So without giving you a specific number, I would certainly say that it is -- we are expecting double-digit growth from this product line for at least the foreseeable future, '13 and beyond.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And then maybe just a follow-up one on the tomo side of the business. Can you help us just with the timeline of the data publications that are going to be coming likely in the second half? Can you help rank which might be the most impactful? Are all of these going to be more or less viewed together once a decision has been formulated in the first half of calendar '13 for reimbursement? Or is it really the Oslo study is the big one and then the rest are going to just be there to support that?","Peter K. Soltani","Yes, I can take that one. I think the studies should get published before the end of the calendar year. The way that I would look at them is that they're all going to sort of reinforce each other. So regardless of which one perhaps gets published first, they're all very compelling. Of course, in the case of Oslo, the key point is really the sensitivity. Whereas with some of the U.S. reading studies, we'll get a good view of both sensitivity and specificity in a typical screening practice. So they're really going to reinforce each other is my view, our view.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And you don't think region will dictate what's more important? Is it the U.S. studies might carry a little more weight or does it not matter, it\u2019s just the pure outcomes?","Peter K. Soltani","Yes, so the one observation that was offered you with respect to the Oslo study is that it does have participation with folks from UPMC. So there is at least some American involvement, and it will be published in a U.S. peer review journal.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In Digital Mammography, can you just break out the growth in the U.S. versus OUS?","Robert A. Cascella","For tomo or for Digital Mammography?","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Digital Mammography.","Robert A. Cascella","Well, I think 2D digital, I don't think we're seeing growth in 2D digital at this point. I think we're seeing a switch between lower-end legacy Selenia products and now higher-end 2D Dimensions products. But that overall business is simply a replacement business at this point, except for some markets outside the United States. So the growth in that business is coming from the adoption of 3D mammography.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so pardon me. Just maybe mammography, U.S. versus OUS growth?","Glenn P. Muir","Yes. Year-over-year, our mammography growth was down a little bit. This was a soft quarter year-over-year. And Europe for us is fairly steady and -- as was the U.S. I mean what we're doing is we're entering a period prior to the launch of the 3D. So I think, Jayson, it was just down a little bit year-over-year in both. I wouldn't say it's U.S. or outside the U.S.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then just lastly for me, have you made any infrastructure changes to your business in anticipation of the Gen-Probe deal, whether it be sales force cuts, shutting some R&D programs, et cetera?","Robert A. Cascella","Sure. All of those things are part of the integration process. So there's been a fairly detailed effort around product rationalizations, product roadmaps, obviously, the sales force rationalization in terms of the right numbers and a focus in specialties. So we're clearly right in the midst of that and ready to implement upon closing.","Operator","And our next question will come from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Rob or Glenn, you\u2019d mentioned earlier in the call that your sales reps aren't yet talking about Gen-Probe's products and, obviously, that makes sense because we're still a couple of days from closing the deal. But from a logistics standpoint, can you just walk us through what we should be thinking about in terms of the selling team? Have they already been cross-trained? And are we going to go through that here over the next couple of weeks? And then do you get concerned at all that as the team gets all the new Gen-Probe products to sell that they'd take their eye off the core Hologic portfolio?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, those are really good questions. The training really commences with -- following closing, and there are a series of programs that will be offered, that are pursuant to some of the sales meetings that are taking place and so on and so forth. The team will be -- obviously, there's a combined laboratory sales team and also complemented by our physician team. So we have great presentation here in the states. That was the same kind of resource rationalization in Europe and so on and so forth. So I think we have a little bit of training to get under our belt right after the acquisition, but we feel very positive about these teams staying very focused. Your comment about do they lose focus on some of the legacy Hologic products? Obviously, we have business managers that are focused specifically on that to ensure that, that doesn't happen. We also have created a comp structure, which doesn't allow that to happen because there are -- obviously, in order to get rewarded at their highest level, they need to have the right kind of product mix that they're selling as well. So we think we're addressing it with management and our comp structure.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just I guess as a follow-up. Just thinking a little bit about the leadership structure within Diagnostics. You mentioned you're moving both cytology as well as the Third Wave molecular products to -- under Carl's guidance. Can you talk just a little bit, Rob, about how much, I guess, independence is the Diagnostic team and division going to have? How do we think about -- I mean I assume obviously Carl will be reporting directly to you. But if you can just talk to that?","Robert A. Cascella","But Carl is going to be a General Manager of one of our franchises, our business units, just like David Harding and Peter Soltani that are here in this room with us today. So we certainly want there to be a fair amount of autonomy, but they are going to be measured by a series of objectives that will be set mutually established at the beginning of the year with targets across product lines, profitability and talent management, and so on and so forth. So I would expect to remain as involved in that business as I do with the other businesses in Hologic. But clearly, the general managers that are running each of these has that strategic responsibility, the day-to-day operating responsibilities and so on and so forth. So we feel like we have the right kind of team in place, and we also have some very strong Hologic people that will be assuming roles within that combined franchise as well. So we think we have the right kind of balance between legacy Hologic products, as well as the newer Gen-Probe products.","Operator","And our next question will come from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","One on the revenue synergies, Rob, that you had mentioned. I'm wondering if that represents upside to the initial points and target that you put out around the close of the deal or if there are other offsets there? And then just a clarification on tomo. All the sites that you've seen currently, are those single unit purchases or do you have sites actually purchasing multiple units? And one, if I could sneak in, for a guidance. I know you haven't said anything for fiscal '13, but, Glenn, can you provide any outlook how you're thinking about the med tech tax for next year?","Robert A. Cascella","Sure, on the revenue synergies, I don't think we're in a position to talk about whether or not it will increase our numbers for '13. I think we're in the process of pulling all of that together as a combined business, and we'll talk about it after Q4 when we give guidance for '13. As far as tomo, Peter, you'll have a good sense of that in terms of multi-unit versus single-unit customers.","Peter K. Soltani","Well, there is going to be one challenge that we're going to face in the sense that unlike the conversion from film to digital, which was sort of the equivalent standard of care, tomo presents an improvement over standard of care. The sites will typically want to budget enough to make a wholesale migration, especially if they have multi -- many units within their system. So it's just something that we'll have to see how it develops over the course of the year.","Robert A. Cascella","And I think the point behind that is quite simply that sites that have 5, 6, 10, 15 units want to convert entirely to tomo. They don't want to face a product limit [ph] like they did with 2D. So there's a great revenue upside to it, but there's also a logistics issue that's associated with it. And we're seeing sites convert with multi-units and we're seeing obviously a lot of sites that are single unit sites also converting. So it is a mixed bag.","Operator","We'll now hear from Lennox Ketner with the Bank of America.","Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess one -- just quick one for Glenn. Just in terms of your guidance for 2012. I know you're reiterating the $1.9 billion that you gave on July 11. That was obviously a little bit lower, kind of, at the low end of your initial range. And I'm just wondering if you could just frame for us what's driving that lowered guidance given that you're still expecting to hit your tomo targets for the year? Is the right way to think about it just that, that's due to the pressure you're seeing in Europe? Or how should we think about what's driving that?","Glenn P. Muir","Well, I think a little of that goes back to the initial guidance from a year ago is $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion for the year. But we do have to appreciate that this quarter, this June quarter, we were a bit softer than we expected though, Lennox. I mean we're off by a good $10 million, so I think we have to understand that as part of the total. We don't make that all up in Q4, although we have a pretty significant increase in Q4 as tomo really takes off as we begin to reflect some of that. In addition to that, we do have some FX that hit the revenue line, which was a bit more than $10 million for the fiscal year. We didn't really talk about it, but I would throw that in there. And then I think when we gave that original guidance of range, we did have Adiana in for the year. And as you know, we discontinued that in April. So we lost another good $10 million there as well. So I think the $1.9 billion is very realistic based upon where we'll be on Q4 and the uptake that we're seeing in Breast Health. And then maybe I could just answer Anthony's question on the med device tax, because it does come up from time to time. And we have not put out any kind of guidance for FY '13. But the way to think about it is we will be paying our fair share, our 2.3%. If we look at our fiscal 2012, really as proxy maybe, and think about the $1.9 billion, the way I would think about it is 73% of our revenues are U.S.-based. That's what would be covered under the tax. We get to take off service. That would come out of the equation. In addition to that, it's not the revenue price we sell at, but a manufacturing selling price. So in essence, I think it comes down to 60% to 65% of our total revenue, $1.9 billion we would apply 2.3% against. So if it was FY '12 we were talking about, it'd be the low $25 million for the med device tax. That's the way you would calculate it. For our fiscal of 2013, it does only affect 3 quarters because our fiscal year starts October 1 and the tax starts on January 1. So we're going to be in there for 3 quarters of a year.","Lennox Ketner - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just one follow up, if I could, is on the ThinPrep business. I believe you said it was down around 3% in the U.S., which is consistent with what you\u2019ve talked about in the past in terms of the long-term outlook. How should people be thinking about that going forward at the end of our longer-term model? Do you still feel like down low-single digits? Is it the right way to think about the U.S. ThinPrep business from a longer-term perspective?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, we've commented before that we thought there was going to be a fairly consistent 2% to 3% erosion on a year-over-year basis for, at a minimum, the next 3 years, maybe slightly beyond. But we do think that at some point, and where that is, is obviously a guess that we struggle with as well, that as there's increased adoption to new guidelines does that accelerates that erosion, we just think that there's a lot of inertia behind the path. And as a result of that, we're focused on that 2% to 3%. But we do think at some point, and let's call it 4 or 5 years out, that there is an accelerated erosion that is the result of guideline achievements [ph] .","Operator","Moving on to Jeremy Feffer with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Most have been answered. Just going to follow-up with one. Any early word from insurance companies on adopting the women's preventative health services mandate in the ACA?","Robert A. Cascella","No. We would only hope in many respects, but we were certainly hearing a lot of talk about it, but there's also a lot of confusion about what it exactly means and what actually does survive. So yes, we believe that many of our products are well positioned because of being prevention, wellness and so on and so forth. But that is not anything that, from a private pay perspective, we're seeing traction on.","Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And just to be clear, would -- mammography would be covered under that, correct?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Just 2 for me. One is a clarification. I think at the end of your fiscal second quarter, you also had really good order growth you were talking about with tomo. Now you have enough orders. Can you maybe, in the hundreds that you talked about, can you maybe just talk about from the time that someone places an order to when it gets booked, just the average that it is today, how that changed from maybe a quarter ago and what you expect that to be over the next few quarters?","Peter K. Soltani","Sure. I mean it's hard to put a number on it because it varies. I mean there's sites that will have -- I mean, for example, the site may be getting an additional -- their second or third tomosynthesis unit, in which case they don't have any barriers relative to training, or in which case things can proceed fairly quickly. Other sites that are really just getting going that might have a larger number of folks to train will clearly take longer. So it is really a range, I would say, sort of the extremist maybe an entire quarter's worth. But there isn't a good average number that I can really give you that would make sense.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, I was looking for an average. I recognize there was a range over all the instruments, so I was just curious if that was something that's kind of -- if you expected that to continue to elongate given what you're seeing or if that -- if kind of where we're at now, you could get to more of a steady state?","Peter K. Soltani","Yes. A great way to look at this, I think, is that this is the rollout of a new capital equipment cycle. And generally what all of us that sell capital equipment want is a bigger backlog, so we have better visibility and can manage things like installations more effectively. It's just early on in the introduction of those products, so we're all operating here at Hologic with a fairly thin backlog relative to what a quarter's requirements are. And consequently, we are a bit more susceptible to a customer delay, which could range to give you the range that you had asked for. We could ship a tomo unit tomorrow if a customer ordered it today or that customer may say I want to have all my rads [ph] trained, so why don't you ship it in 2 months when I get everybody pulled together. So unfortunately, there is a very broad range, and our answer is let's accumulate as much backlog as we can, so we get better visibility on the quarter, and we have much better planning capabilities as a result of same.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Glenn, on the -- I think you actually gave your target on the RIC for Gen-Probe at 13%, if I heard correctly. Can you maybe just talk about the timing of hitting that number? And also if that assumes just kind of the disclosed cost synergies that you've disclosed so far, or if you're assuming more kind of being maybe a bit more aggressive on the cost synergy side?","Glenn P. Muir","No, it would include a bit more, including some revenue synergies. So what we've talked about in the past is if we only include the cost synergies that we gave guidance to, the $40 million in the first year and the $75 million by year 3, we felt over the 10-year planning period, which we used to calculate our return on a discounted cash flow basis, we'd be at 9%. But once we factored in some of the revenue synergies that we haven't disclosed that we are now looking at in some of the models that we've created, we feel we can get up to that 13%. So it is over that extended planning horizon.","Operator","We thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That is all the time we have for questions today. This does conclude Hologic's Third Quarter and Fiscal 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Have a good evening, everyone.","Robert A. Cascella","Thank you."],"10657":["Hologic, Inc.

My name is Greg, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Deborah Gordon","Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer and Glenn Muir, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call will consist of opening remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Friday, May 23 and a copy of our second quarter release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Also in that section is a supplemental second quarter financial presentation related to the comments that will be made during today's opening remarks.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call may be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statements included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the GAAP can also be found in our second quarter earnings release.","I would now like to turn the call over to Stephen MacMillan.","Stephen MacMillan","Thank you, Deb, and thank you all for joining us today. On today's call, I will cover three key topics. One, our second quarter results and highlights, two, actions taken since I joined the company and three, the results of our recently completed strategic review and how they relate to our plans for growth and value creation. I will then turn the call over to Glenn for more detailed financial discussion.","Starting with our results and highlights. In the second quarter, we generated $625 million in revenues and $0.37 in EPS, both of which were a bit better than we expected at this stage in our turnaround. After experiencing a decline in revenues during Q1, we were encouraged to deliver modest year-over-year growth. Much work lies ahead, but these results are a sign that we are making progress toward our initial goal of reversing the sales declines. While one quarter alone does not make a trend, it does show we do indeed have near-term growth opportunities to offset the much discussed headwinds.","I would now like to touch on some key highlights from the quarter. In our diagnostics business, the Japanese Red Cross, or JRC, selected our new collaboration partner, Grifols, to screen the country's 5.3 million annual blood donations. This represents a huge win for Grifols and us and is a strong validation of Hologic's Panther system and its capabilities.","The JRC made its selection after rigorous scientific evaluation of our instrumentation and assays in comparison with the latest offerings from the incumbent vendor. The technological advantage of the Panther and the benefits it delivers in terms of workflow, reliability and ease of use are becoming more evident in ongoing competitive evaluations.","Implementation of this contract will begin toward the end of our fiscal 2014. Therefore, the majority of the initial financial contribution will be realized in fiscal 2015. This win is a great way to kick off our new relationship with Grifols and we look forward to working closely with them to win additional business around the globe.","The JRC's endorsement of Panther platform builds an another strong quarter of Panther placements overall. We are seeing growing interest in the Panther platform and are increasingly confident we will reach our goal of installing 1,000 units by the end of fiscal 2015.","While most of the Panther placements do not have the same visibility as a major contract win such as the JRC, they are nonetheless just as important to our business, even if they are occurring one lab at a time. Each and every placement helps lock in sockets that can yield ongoing revenue growth especially with further menu expansion over time.","We also made solid progress on executing on our opportunity to convert Quest testing volumes to our Aptima family of assays during the quarter. And even aside from Quest, we are driving broader adoption of our Aptima HPV test and are encouraged by our progress.","The strength in our molecular and blood screening businesses largely offsets declines in our cytology and perinatal business, which are attributable to ongoing ThinPrep headwinds in the U.S. due to interval expansion.","Within our breast health business, we saw two important developments during the quarter. First, global sales grew by a healthy 8% versus last year, driven by increasing adoption of our 3-D mammography technology and we are now well on track to reach our stated goal of placing at least 500 3-D mammography systems in the U.S. this year.","Second, in addition to the strong 3-D mammography results, we received positive news on the reimbursement front. In early March, the AMA CPT Editorial Panel announced that the application for breast tomosynthesis was accepted for three Category I CPT codes for both screening and diagnostic mammograms .While we will not know the exact codes and associated rates until November, we do know the beginning in calendar 2015, there will be three new CPT codes for breast tomosynthesis. Although it will take some time for the regional Medicare carriers and private payers to implement coverage of reimbursement for these codes, this is an exciting development for our breast health business as well as for the patient seeking to benefit from this technology.","Clearly, we are building momentum and are optimistic that upcoming developments on the reimbursement front, as well as the growing body of peer-reviewed publications will stimulate further adoption of what and many of the medical community view as a game changing technology. When you look more broadly at the 3-D mammography market opportunity, it's also important to keep in mind that today less than 10% of the U.S. digital mammography installed base is 3-D. In other words, we are building momentum and still have significant growth opportunities ahead of us.","Moving on to our surgical business. While sales were still down versus year ago, the trends are modestly encouraging as growth in MyoSure as well as broader international opportunities for both MyoSure and NovaSure are helping offset the domestic NovaSure headwinds.","Finally, while much smaller, even our skeletal business reversed multiple quarters of sharper declines and posted growth of over 4% in the quarter. Overall, the key take away from this quarter is that every franchise showed improved performance, demonstrating that despite the headwinds we face, our core assets have the ability to perform better and drive overall company growth.","The second item I would like to cover is actions taken since joining the company in December. My initial focus has been on performing an in-depth evaluation of our leaders, our businesses and overall structure and our products. In March, we announced key changes to senior leadership that will play a significant role in establishing the team that will not only help meet our near-term turnaround efforts, but also create and execute a long-term plan to generate sustainable growth.","I am extremely pleased that Eric Compton has joined as our Chief Operating Officer. In this role, he will oversee the day-to-day operations of our business units, as well as our global R&D and manufacturing efforts. Eric joined us from Johnson & Johnson, where he enjoyed a long and successful career with increasing responsibilities, most recently as the Worldwide President of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics.","I am also pleased to have Claus Egstrand on board as Hologic's Senior Vice President and General Manager of International. Claus joined us from Merck and has a tremendous amount of experience overseeing a variety of international businesses within large organizations over his 30 plus year career. Having worked previously with both of these leaders, I am confident that we are building a team comprised of the right people in the right roles to win.","On a separate senior management team note, we also announced that after a 25 year career here at Hologic, Glenn will be retiring. I would be remiss if I didn't thank Glenn for his leadership and significant contributions over the years. We are in an active process to bring in a new CFO and are grateful that Glenn will remain in his role to ensure a seamless transition and continued execution of our financial strategies.","Before I do turn the call over to Glenn, I want to update you on the third item, our recently concluded strategic review. We promised on our last quarterly call to provide the conclusions of the review. And to be perfectly clear, the purpose of the review was always to determine how best to maximize shareholder value. We carefully assessed a wide range of options including significant divestitures, but concluded that the best near-term path of a greater value creation is to, one, accelerate growth of our existing businesses, two, no major divestitures, those are our opportunities to divest fringe assets and three, implement more effective capital allocation and financial planning with a major opportunity to lower our tax rate significantly over time.","And now for a little more detail on how we plan to achieve these goals. Beginning with item one, accelerating organic growth. Our game plan for growth can be distilled down to three focus areas, people, products and global expansion. As I mentioned earlier, we have made important changes to our senior management team, with an eye toward providing strong leadership, improved execution and performance oriented accountability.","In addition to people, our products are the core of our efforts to return to sustainable organic growth. We have a terrific portfolio of products and our path to growth will require an ongoing innovation engine. To support this, we are implementing initiatives designed to produce a steady stream of new products in each of our businesses. In addition to significant innovations, we believe we can also drive value through ongoing product improvements in line extensions that broaden the reach of our products in the global marketplace. Simply put, our plan will require additional investments in R&D and international expansion but we plan to fund these via sales growth and reallocation of internal spending.","As indicated last quarter, global expansion will be a critical element to our growth strategy over the long-term. We have many best in class products that command leading market shares domestically yet hold disproportionately low market share positions internationally. This is an area where new members of our senior management team will add value and insight.","With regard to divestitures, as we indicated our last call, we do not plan to make any significant divestitures at this time. That said, we will be doing some pruning around the edges. Although there will be a modest near-term impact to our top line, we believe the trade-off is worthwhile since these are among our lowest margin businesses. Glenn will speak further to some of our efforts in this area.","Finally, our strategic review reaffirmed at that our primary commitment from a capital allocation standpoint is to pay down debt. In addition, one of the biggest initiatives to emerge from our strategic review process is the need to immediately focus on long-term planning that will reduce our tax rate. This certainly will take time but represents a clear opportunity to improve profitability. Fortunately, our tax planning initiative dovetails nicely with our plans to further globalize the business since greater resources will need to be allocated to non-U.S. markets.","With that I will now turn the call over to Glenn.","Glenn Muir","Thank you, Steve. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year non-GAAP basis. Second quarter revenues of $625 million were up 1% compared to prior year of $619 million. Prior year revenues included $10.6 million from LIFECODES, a business we sold in March 2013.","Diagnostics revenues of $291 million declined 4%. These results were in line with our expectations as the decrease is primarily attributable to the LIFECODES divestiture and lower ThinPrep revenue. Revenues in our cytology and perinatal business declined 4%. International revenues were flat, while U.S. revenues declined in the high single digit, primarily as a result of lower sales of ThinPrep due to the ongoing screening interval expansion.","Our molecular diagnostics business declined 8%, primarily as a result of our divestiture of LIFECODES. However, operationally, after adjusting for LIFECODES, molecular grew 1%. Overall performance in molecular was also mapped a bit by weakness in our flu business. However, our core Aptima franchise experienced healthy growth in the low double digits resulting primarily from strong uptake at Quest and broader adoption of Aptima HPV.","Blood screening revenues were up 5.5%. Strong international growth helped offset the anticipated impact of lower domestic blood donations. The recent JRC win will build on our strength in international markets.","Moving on to breast health. Revenues increased 8.5% to $239 million driven primarily by very strong growth in 3-D mammography system sales, which drove in 8% overall increase in breast health product sales. We also realized incremental revenues to a smaller extent from growth in sales of our C-View system, as well as from biopsy system sales, specifically the Eviva. Solid service revenue growth of 9% was driven by a growing installed base of digital mammography systems. Partially offsetting these increases was the expected overall decline of 2-D mammography system sales as customers shift to 3-D.","Now turning to GYN surgical. Revenues of $72 million were down 2%. Strong double-digit worldwide growth in MyoSure and to a lesser extent international NovaSure sales growth helped offset a low-teens decline in domestic NovaSure sales.","I will now review second quarter non-GAAP performance for the rest of the P&L. Gross margins were 62.5%, down 10 basis points from last year, but above our original annual guidance range of 61.5% to 62%. The strength in Q2 gross margins was due to higher than expected revenues and a favorable revenue mix from blood screening, domestic 3-D mammo and service. As we look at the second half of the year, we are comfortable we will be at the high end of our original annual range based on anticipated fluctuations in product and geographic mix.","Operating expenses were $188 million, representing a decrease of 4% and our estimated annual tax rate remained at 34.5%. As a result of higher than forecasted revenues and margins, we generated earnings per share of $0.37, exceeding the high end of guidance we provided last quarter by $0.03.","Before turning to the balance sheet, I will expand on a couple of decisions we made to streamline operations that resulted in charges during the quarter. As Steve mentioned, we are exiting some of our smaller businesses. As part of this effort, we are seeking a buyer for our MRI breast coils product line. Based on recent fair value estimates, we recorded a $29 million charge in our GAAP P&L, primarily related to intangible assets. This is an example of a business line divestiture that will help us focus our resources on more strategic and profitable areas of the company. We do not yet know the timing of this divestiture and will update you as appropriate.","In addition, as part of our efforts to gain further efficiencies, we are closing our high-tech drum business in Germany and we consolidated certain assets into our newer Delaware facility. Consequently, we reduced headcount and plan to sell our facility in Germany. We recorded a small charge in our GAAP P&L associated with this plant closure in our second quarter.","Despite these charges, we see these as positive developments in our plan to focus resources where they can have the greatest impact on our growth strategy. As we continue to make progress on these and similar initiatives, we will provide updates. We will also look at other small divestitures, depending on the valuations they can come in.","Now turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with $490 million in cash, down $339 million since the end of fiscal 2013, primarily as a result of $563 million in dept payments we made since the beginning of our fiscal year, partially offset by various cash inflows. During the quarter, we successfully completed a refinancing of our term loan B resulting in an interest rate reduction of 50 basis point. As part of this transaction, we made a $25 million voluntary prepayment on this loan balance.","We generated $69 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and $249 million year-to-date. Therefore, we still expect to generate $500 million to $525 million for the year. In addition, our return on invested capital on a trailing 12 month basis was 8.3%. For definitions and calculations of operating cash flow and ROIC, please refer to our supplementary PowerPoint presentation. We ended the quarter with total debt obligations of $4.3 billion and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.4 times.","On the capital allocation front, deleveraging is our overarching priority. As I mentioned a moment ago, we voluntarily prepaid a small amount of debt related to the term loan B, and we will continue to apply excess cash to debt repayment.","Lastly, we did not repurchase any shares during the second quarter under our share buyback program.","I will now review our fiscal 2014 third quarter and full year non-GAAP guidance. As a reminder, our guidance is detailed in our supplementary PowerPoint presentation and assumes currency rates consistent with the averages during Q2 2014. It does not assume any share repurchases or divestitures.","For the third quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $615 million to $625 million which are flat to 2% down year-over-year and we expect EPS in the range of $0.33 to $0.34. For the fiscal year, we are raising our revenue guidance range to $2.46 billion to $2.49 billion from our previous range of $2.425 billion to $2.475 billion to reflect higher than expected revenues to-date.","We are also raising our EPS guidance range to a $1.37 to $1.40 from our previous guidance of $1.34 to $1.38. This new EPS range is also based on the stronger results to-date, tempered by slightly higher than anticipated spending in the second half.","While we posted modestly better-than-expected results so far this year, we are still early in the stages of a turnaround and our guidance for the remainder of the year reflects that as well as the ongoing headwinds we face. We certainly aim to be better but feel this is a realistic outlook today.","In summary, our second quarter results was return to growth and lay the groundwork for a stronger year than we anticipated at the outset of fiscal 2014. We look forward to demonstrating our ongoing commitment to organic growth and debt reduction in the coming quarter.","With that I will turn the call back to Steve.","Stephen MacMillan","Thanks, Glenn. Before we take questions, I would just like to reiterate that we are pleased to report results slightly ahead of expectations. The result of the quarter further demonstrate that we are winning in the marketplace and can continue to do so with the strong portfolio products we currently have.","The JRC contract win and strong 3-D mammo results are evidence of that. Our strategic review has been completed and we are moving forward with a strong leadership team to optimize execution, drive new product development and capitalizing underpenetrated opportunities across the globe. We will be domestic small fringe assets but our focus is now squarely on organic growth and debt repayment. In the months ahead, I look forward to updating you on our progress and providing additional details on our vision for Hologic's future.","With that, Greg, will you please open it up to questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson Bedford - Raymond James","Good afternoon, and congrats on the progress. I guess I want to ask about the earnings guidance. Given the revenue levels, it appears that operating margin will really have to come down in the second half and historically this has been a business where second half margin has been stronger than the first. So can you just shed a little light in terms of, is there increased spending associated with the back half of the year?","Stephen MacMillan","Yes, Jason. I will take that one. To be quite candid, I think we cut a little bit too much coming into the year, and as I look to get the R&D organizations rebuilt and even some of our sales and marketing efforts, probably a little more spend in the second half than we had in the first. I will also tell you, it will be well-controlled and not set ourselves up of getting ahead of ourselves. But it really comes down, in my mind, we probably cut a little too deeply going into the fiscal year.","Jayson Bedford - Raymond James","Okay. I will limit that to one. Thanks.","Stephen MacMillan","Thank you.","Operator","And next we will go to Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. My first question is, could you just provide some thoughts on the expected impact of the approval by the FDA versus HPV test as a primary screen? I would think that it may present ultimately an opportunity for you on the Aptima side, but could present more challenges on the ThinPrep side. Could you just walk us through your thoughts there?","Stephen MacMillan","Sure, Doug. I think long-term, you nailed it exactly. First off, I congratulate Roche for the work that they did to get that. In the short-term, on ThinPrep, we frankly don't see much impact. When you think about how well established the Pap test is, also in terms of co-testing and the guidelines and the conservative nature of the specialists involved here, we think this is going to take some significant time. Over years, will it start to have an impact, yes. In the coming quarters, probably don't expect much.","Having said that, as part of giving a guidance, we want to be a little conservative just in case. We always plan to be conservative and hopefully be better off in that. Long-term, I think as we become a major player in the HPV space, it probably does create some opportunity for us as well and we like our growth there.","But again, clearly Roche is going to be a can tremendous competitor there. It has the leg up on this particular chapter.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Okay, and one quick follow-up to Jason's question. I know he was focused on historical second half spending patterns and Steve you did talk about ramping some investment on the R&D side. That being said, the sequential drop off in sales and marketing spend was pretty material, pretty impressive. Is that an area where you would expect to spend more? Or do you think that we can see the type leverage we saw this quarter moving forward?","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. Long-term, you are going to see leverage because a lot of that, the cuts and changes made, I think in some ways make us healthier, leaner and we certainly don't want to bounce back. You know I have always run lean organizations. We are going to keep that. Having said that, it is a pretty big drop, and I think just going into the year, we might have cut into a little bit of bone that you can survive with for the short-term, but I want to rebuild some of the bone, particularly as I would say in the sales and marketing and the R&D efforts, but on a going basis, we will be reallocating, certainly adding some G&A as we go forward.","So there is probably a little bit of conservatism in the OpEx spending. We are at that very interesting stage right now, where I am thrilled with what the team delivered here. But we want to be careful not to get ahead of ourselves. We don't want to be getting too far ahead of ourselves and too excited but there are some very good things going on.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Stephen MacMillan","Thank you. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","And next, we will go to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Obviously a lot of news around morcellation. I understand that you guys do not sell a laparoscopic device for MyoSure. Can you maybe just talk about the impact that you could potentially see in the business and do you need to manage this with physicians?","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. Actually the great part is, the physicians get this and understand that probably the only thing we have in common with laparoscopic commercialization is the term, is that word. But as you well know, Tycho, it's a very different process. We operate completely differently from those systems. Once the press started to hit, if you recall, the Wall Street Journal is out and front of this, or New York Time, whatever, back in December, we have been really close to the physician community here and our MyoSure, what I would remind everybody, our MyoSure hysteroscopic tissue removal system, we basically moved away from the morcellation word and the physician community totally gets it.","Our team has just added ACOG over the last few days. This is much more of a consumer media event, certainly concern on the other side. It should not have an impact on our business. Having said that, again you always want to be cautious and conservative and know that anytime there is dustups in the media these days, there is a chance for confusion among possible patients and some conservatism. So there could be a little bit of that.","But overall, the physician response has been very good. And our sales force, this is where our surgical sales force is tremendously educated and it has been a wonderful resource for even some of the physicians that even get caught up in the media itself and want that reassurance or want that clarification.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","And then, just switching over to some of the reinvestments you will be making. As we think about Gen-Probe and the pipeline there, are things like viral load assays and the radiant [ph] PCR technology still on track? Or are they being put on the back burner, as you evaluate other options?","Stephen MacMillan","No, they are both front and center. The Panther platform is tremendous and it is going to be about building out, if you look at both of those as extensions off of Panther, one on the assay part and building out the menu, the other part is making Panther even better and more broadly usable. They are both, we see, key to our future there. It's a great asset to Gen-Probe what we got out there. Frankly, we are probably going to do the greatest job in the early days of integrating, but pulling that team together now and there are some great things out there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with ISI Group.","Stephen MacMillan","Hi, Vijay.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Hi, guys. How are you? Congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe just getting back to that guidance question? There are a number of moving parts in the quarter, right. So you obviously had a blood screening win and a couple of other folks mentioned you do have concerns on morcellation as with HPV. So I just want to make sure, what's sort of baked into the guidance? How much of the Japanese win do you have in the guidance and what kind of sensitivities do you have around either HPV or morcellation softening?","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. Let me start with the JRC. The JRC, we see really kicking in, in August. So it will be a modest fourth quarter event, but really it's going to be much more about 2015 for that contract kicking in.","On both ThinPrep, even NovaSure, and to some degree MyoSure, we are probably a little cautious right now. Again I want to make sure we get our sea legs. We have got a lot of change going on in the company. Luckily our field forces are really delivering right now. But some time, right at that stage right now, we are feeling going about some things but you never know what you don't know yet. Just making sure that we get back, given our history, wanting to really get back on a path where you guys can count on us quarter-after-quarter to deliver what we said.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group","Great. Thank you, guys.","Stephen MacMillan","Thank you, Vijay.","Operator","And next, we will go to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Good afternoon.","Stephen MacMillan","Hi, David.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Hi, Steve. How are you?","Stephen MacMillan","Great.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Steve, I want to push you a little bit here on the strategy. It's really the same word but in two different areas which is, the word is incremental. So, when you talked about investments to reaccelerate growth, it sounds like you have these areas to reinvest, but it also sounds like you want to invest at a rate commensurate with sales. I am wondering, just given this transformation, why not take bigger action and invest faster now and accelerate that path to growth?","And then in the same question, maybe this is more for Glenn of for yourself, same thing on tax credit. It sounds like the strategy is, let's redomicile IP, let's move manufacturing operations, which are incremental ways of lowering your tax rate. There are structural tax rate lowered. So in two areas of the strategic plan, there could be a faster way to get there and I am wondering why the decision was made to be more incremental than faster? Thank you.","Stephen MacMillan","Sure, great question. David, first on the incremental. Let me add an extra clarification. I picture our investments in R&D being at a probably significantly higher rate than necessarily sales growth and funding that out of probably some reductions in G&A and other areas. So effectively, what I think you will see is, we will be investing more in R&D than sales and marketing. Probably beyond an incremental basis, but offset from the G&A side. So could we be more aggressive? Possibly.","We are also at that stage, bring in the new leaders, I want to make sure that we are smart about where we put those investments and I mean that we are in that interesting blend right now where I am signaling to the team, look, we think we can generate a lot more growth and we are looking at the ideas but we are not just a ramp it up. So what you are probably going to see is it will ramp up over time as the ideas bubble up and as the competencies bubble up. And I think if we see great opportunities, we will certainly look to invest more there. So we won't be held back but we will be smart about it.","On the tax piece, I may go ahead and let Glenn jump in on this one.","Glenn Muir","The tax rate is really reflective today of where we are as really a U.S. based company with primarily U.S. sales and U.S. operations. And it's our intention to take greater advantage of the international opportunity out there and to move some manufacturing and IP resources overseas to be closer to those customer markets. But that will take a little bit of time and those are the effort that will help to bring that tax rate down from being a primarily U.S. based tax rate today.","Stephen MacMillan","David, if I add one other color or commentary as it relates to maybe dimensionalizing, say the R&D investments. Take our surgical business as an example. That's an area where we really have done very little on ongoing incremental innovation, improving our products, building out.","We have basically a two product division. So as we challenge that team to come up with the third, fourth and fifth products, and then line extension everything like that, I am totally convinced we will build that capability over time and make those investments, but it's not like from second quarter to third quarter, ready to just turn on the stick.","I think it's a little bit of what we even had with the extra strong profit here in the second quarter. It's one thing to talk about the R&D. It's another to make sure that we fund it appropriately over time. Hopefully that gives a little more granularity or color to that.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We will take our next from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.","Mike Matson - Needham & Company","Thanks for getting me in. I guess I was just wondering on the strength of the 3-D mammography growth that you had. Do you think that the CPT code had an effect in the quarter? I know the dollar amounts not known yet, but just having your customers know that there is a code coming and that will help their ROI on buying one of these systems. Do you think that played into the strength at all?","Stephen MacMillan","Mike, it probably didn't have a huge impact in the quarter in terms of actual booked revenues. I would say, it's having a huge impact on the field force morale and also the psyche in the buyers and I think it does give us confidence going forward that the known certainty that something's coming, even though we don't what the numbers are, is reassuring to the hospital customers that we start to feel that even more going forward.","I think as we said last quarter, we were focusing the field not use that as an excuse to hold back and I think our team was really out there fighting despite not having it, and then we were holding the reimbursement team to really get this across the finish line. And I think they are delivering there as well. But I think it does bode reasonably well for the quarters ahead.","Mike Matson - Needham & Company","All right. That's all I have. Thanks.","Stephen MacMillan","Great. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And next we will move to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Stephen MacMillan","Sure.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. I just want to ask about the cytology business. I think Glenn, in the prepared remarks had said it was 4%. I was wondering if you could put a little color on the U.S. versus ex-U.S. dynamic there from a growth standpoint? The reason I ask you is, just trying to get a sense of where we are in the process of digesting those wider intervals for ThinPrep. Where do you think we are in that process? Thank you.","Stephen MacMillan","Yes, Isaac, I can jump in on this one. I will tell you, the U.S. was down probably very high single digits and the international was about flattish. So we don't want to go into exact specifics but you are still seeing that hit in the U.S. market and we are assuming that continuing and hopefully that will start to slow but we are not ready to declare an inflection point in the slowdown yet. Glenn, did you want to add to that?","Glenn Muir","No, that was basically it. We are seeing continued some softness on the U.S. side. I think we were kind of pleased it wasn't more than what it was. It seemed to hold out fairly well for the quarter.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Got it. That makes sense. Thanks so much, guys.","Stephen MacMillan","Great. Thank you, Isaac.","Operator","And next we will go to Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies","Thanks. One on mammography, maybe Stephen or Glenn. Can you maybe just comment on when the mammography business reaches an inflection point maybe with 3-D uptick offsets the 2-D declines?","Stephen MacMillan","I think we are starting to see it. I think we really started to see it in this quarter, where we seeing, especially the U.S., an acceleration in that business. If you look globally, we posted 8% growth. Our U.S. growth was even a little bit better than that.","Glenn Muir","Yes, I would add that almost one half of the mammo systems were 3-D. So that's a pretty impressive number that we built up to over this timeframe is to jump up that just about half now are 3-D tomo of all mammo units going out the door.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies","And then just a quick one. Is pricing stable there?","Stephen MacMillan","At this point, yes. It may get a little rougher once other competitors come in to the U.S. marketplace.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","Hi. Thanks a million for taking the questions. If I can, maybe just following up on some of the investments. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the evolution? I think Gen-Probe was investing a lot in R&D and had a focus on expanding internationally. I think that was the focus previously of Hologic as well. You said maybe you put the brakes on that and cut a little more deeply than perhaps you should have but can you maybe talk, is there anything materially different about how you are going about doing that than what the plan was before? Thanks.","Stephen MacMillan","Sure, and the question being R&D or international. I am sorry, Jon.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","I think a little bit of both. Again, to me it sounds like that was a strategy previously. Maybe it kind of got slowed down. I am just wondering if it's just about throwing dollars? Or if there is something more material about how you are thinking about doing it versus what the plan had been previously?","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. So let me take the R&D piece first. Post the acquisition, we did cut pretty deeply into the R&D organization. I think now we are really looking at the assays that we want to develop as well as fusion and everything else that we want to bring to market. Sending the signals that we want to invest, we want to be thinking about the future, that our whole plan for organic growth really is R&D driven and very much of the model that Gen-Probe had executed so successfully. And frankly, that Hologic, back in the early 2000s had executed very, very well and built up the mammo business. So it's emulating those models of great investments in R&D, great R&D teams and a steady stream of our products.","On the international front, I think, frankly, we probably had some starts and stops in terms of investments. At the end of the day, we are really looking at it very granularly now, by franchise, by country. Which franchises are we going to invest in, in which countries, looking at what are the reimbursement rates for each of those countries. I think getting very specific about where the opportunities are. We are not applying, what we call the peanut butter principal of just saying and let's go grow international. But we can look at our surgical business, country by country. Where are we not developed? Where we have opportunities?","The same for the molecular diagnostic business and much as Gen-Probe was starting to look there, they were still in the very early innings of global expansion. So a lot of this is now a very strong focus. Bringing Claus Egstrand in. I can tell you, he is two and half weeks into the job right now and already have been seeing a lot of opportunity. Again, those opportunities won't happen necessarily in the next quarter, but they will happen here in the coming years.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","Great, and that's very helpful. That's what I was going to get at in my next question. Just to be clear, do you think we should start seeing proof of the success within one year, two years? I am just curious what you think the timeframe is? Thanks.","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. I think on the international expansion, you ought to start to see that within a year-ish. Some markets like Japan will be a little slower but I think it's very clear that we ought to start to see certainly topline growth. Maybe not a lot of bottomline because we will be making the investments in those businesses.","On the R&D front, reaccelerating and everything else, as we talk with our Board, it's probably a couple of years away before we really start to see the fruits of what we start to put in now. But what we have also said is, luckily we have a couple of great franchises with Panther and the 3-D tomo that can help drive a lot of growth here over the next couple of years while we reinvest in the R&D for the out years.","Operator","And next we will hear from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Matt Larew - William Blair","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. This is Matt, in for Brian Weinstein. Just in light of the recent JRC win here, just wondering, are there other large tender opportunities coming up in the near future? And you mentioned that Japan certainly was very focused on the technology evaluation. Just your thoughts on whether others are more cost or technology focused? Any comments there would be helpful. Thanks.","Stephen MacMillan","Sure, there is certainly nothing of the magnitude of the JRC coming up. There are some tenders going around Europe, Middle East and frankly it's a great question, you asked around technology versus pricing.","We probably worry a little bit some of them maybe a little more price driven than what we are seeing. I think what we loved about Japan is everybody probably well knows that the quality concerns in Japan are always at the top of the list and we prevailed very well there. Where it's a pricing game, we are certainly seeing some aggressiveness in the competitive set to try to hold on to business and that puts some certain pressure on that business as well.","Matt Larew - William Blair","Thanks for taking the questions, Steve.","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. Thank you, Matt","Operator","And next we will hear from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Steve, as you say that you think you are nearing an inflection point in 3-D tomo adoption, potentially in U.S., can you talk a little bit about the strategy and the progress you may be making with conversations individually with individual insurers?","And then also, what can we expect in terms of the timing and the process, once you do get more clarity around final amounts on the CPT code? And how should we think about that actually translating into actual coverage from a timing and what your strategy is to work with insurers to get that materialized?","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. I think pragmatically the insurer piece won't play out until well into 2015. I think everybody is going to be fairly cautious and that's where we are at such an interesting time in the company right now, where there is some nice nuggets here that look good, but we want to be cautious and not get ahead of ourselves.","So between, let's say the CPT will come out in November, it will kick in January. By the time you get the local, between the Medicare pieces, and then also private payers adopting, it's probably going to be rolling out really through 2015. But I think what it does do is, as the clinical evidence of 3-D mammography and as more word gets out about just the superiority of what we have, I can tell you, there is not one of us on this call whose wives, mothers, daughters, whatever, who wouldn't want to have 3-D.","And I think as the consumer awareness also builds in this very important area, that should bode well. So I think the way I would really thinking though about the 3-D businesses, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's not think there is huge spike here, but I think we should think about it as it should be a really nice run here for a number of years, given where we are.","Thanks, Richard.","Operator","And next we will hear from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. A quick one for me. Just coming back to morcellation. I realize that, it sounds like anyway, that you have perhaps dialed back some of your expectations for MyoSure. But with one of your main competitors off the market, any chance that we could actually see that be a source of upside over the balance of the year and also as we think about 2015?","Stephen MacMillan","No, you know what, because it really gets back to, we do not compete against the J&J piece. For the same reason we shouldn't be affected. Unfortunately, it's a great question. You would like to think we could go get that business, but for the same reason, we are unaffected because we are used in a completely different procedure. We are not indicated nor would we be able to go in and effectively try to get that business. You can bet, it was one of the fist things, as I am still learning our products but I jumped on thinking, okay, we don't have a problem, where is the opportunity. Unfortunately, we don't.","Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray","Okay, no, fair enough, and then just a follow-up on the blood screening question. Any update, guys, on China? Obviously they have been incrementally moving towards using NAT. I know there's a handful of folks involved here, but just a general update there would be great. Thanks.","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. You know what, we don't really have an update there other than we are going through the process. So I don't have anything more for you, Bill.","Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And next is Jon Block from Stifel.","Jon Block - Stifel","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one, numbers were certainly strong across the board, but one thing that stood out to me was breast health internationally. If I look at constant currency, down almost 4% year over year. Maybe if you can just give us some color, I am surprised it was down mid-single digits in light of the product cycle internationally. Can you talk about the capital environment overseas? And then specific to GE, anything different in the competitive landscape now that they have been out there with their tomo offering for a couple of quarters? Thanks.","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. Great insight. I would say that the international breast piece was more an anomaly, some very big sales that happened in the previous year, especially in the Middle East and frankly some of the emerging markets. So I think what we have had as I dig in and it's where I want to careful and I want to start to get to a more regular cadence. We have had some real huge variations in geographic swings in the breast health business. To me that, I like to see be smoother over time. So I think it's less a trend.","Clearly, with the competitive set out there Philips, GE, Siemens, even Fuji, it is a more competitive world outside the U.S. I think this is probably a slightly unusually softer quarter due to the comps of last years.","Jon Block - Stifel","Okay, perfect. Then just a quick follow-up. Glenn, this might be more for you. On the initiatives around tax planning, when could we possibly see that come into play? Is that 2015, or think further out? And then as part of that, could you arguably see some inefficiencies on the manufacturing as a result as we get there? Thanks, guys.","Glenn Muir","Jon, on the tax timing, we are talking further out than FY 2015. We have to begin to set up some of that manufacturing IP transfer now. It needs to be tied into where we are doing business for some of the emerging markets. So there is a lot of planning that's involved. I don't think it has to necessarily have an impact on the efficiencies of our manufacturing and we do some nice manufacturing outside the U.S. now.","Costa Rica is a great example. In fact some of the margin improvement is because we have moved many of our disposal products down to Costa Rica. So I think there is some opportunities there. We guess now are at a better size and scale to be able to take advantage of some of these international opportunities. But they are more than a couple of years out, Jon.","Stephen MacMillan","There is real structural work that needs to happen.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Next we will hear from Bill Bonello with Craig Hallum.","Bill Bonello - Craig Hallum","Thank you very much. Can you just talk a little bit about your plans for a couple of the businesses where you have been seeing declines for a while now, the domestic ThinPrep and NovaSure? How are you thinking about investment in those businesses? Could we just have to accept that they kind of at a steady decline or are there things you believe you can do to reverse that trend at all?","Stephen MacMillan","Great question. On a macro basis, I think ThinPrep with the extensions of the interval expansions, there is just going to be unit losses there that no matter what we do from a selling standpoint or anything else. We are thinking about R&D. Are there ways that we could inject some different life into a franchise like that.","NovaSure, the same thing and our sales forces are still out there fighting. So part of our strategy to return to organic growth and we are talking about internally is, if we can even slow the rate of decline, particularly those two key franchises, which by the way are also great gross margin franchises, even on the margin, if we can use to slow the declines, I am not sure I would be ready to say we can turn them around in the U.S.","I would say, it's back to the also our global footprint and both franchises are underdeveloped internationally. ThinPrep is a little bit more established but there are significant opportunities, we really think, for both franchises outside the U.S. and I think, again, we have been subject to the bigger headwinds of U.S. reimbursement that were U.S. issues because we have been way too dependent on the U.S. market and so part of our diversification and insulation from some of those trends will be to build these franchises outside the U.S.","Operator","And next we will move to Jeff Relic with Canaccord.","Jeff Relic - Canaccord","Good afternoon, folks. Steve, where do you think you are on Panther consumable yields? What I am asking is, like what kind of percent of your target yields are you at now given the Quest business is starting to ramp? Thanks.","Stephen MacMillan","You know what, Jeff? I honestly don't know the answer to that yet. We will have to get back to you on that. There's still a few parts of the business I am not 100% in detail. Glenn?","Glenn Muir","Yes, we have been making good progress on the Panther. A big chunk of the Panther's have gone out in the last six to nine months. So that is now ramping up. But just to clarify, Quest is not Panther. Quest is Tigris. So what we have been able to do with Quest is they did order quite a few Tigris' at the end of last fiscal year. Those are now in place and those are now up and running. And you are seeing the benefit on the CPG side. You are seeing the benefit on the HPV side. And now on the Trich side from Quest.","Jeff Relic - Canaccord","Okay, thanks, Glenn.","Glenn Muir","There is a lot more room on the Panther side. It is all about getting Panthers out there. We are ahead of our schedule to get 1,000 Panthers in the field by the end of FY 2015. We feel good about that. Once we have that, it's then expanding the menu and Steve talked about that. So I think we are in a good position with that product. People love the Panther. It's a great piece of automation and workflow.","Operator","And our last question today comes from John Zecy with MorningStar.","John Zecy - MorningStar","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick question on the diagnostic pipeline. If you could maybe just talk a little bit more about the opportunity in viral load testing? I am just trying to get a sense of how the pipeline is going to evolve and sort of your plans for rolling that out and how that might potentially offset some of the ThinPrep softness? Thanks.","Stephen MacMillan","Sure. We clearly have articulated, that is an area we are developing. That will still be a little bit, particularly in the United States market, that's going to be years away. But we are developing those assays and do expect to be there. Nothing, again, that's certainly further out in terms of timeframe at this point.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today.

Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Jamie, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Deborah R. Gordon","Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will consist of opening remarks followed by a question-and-answer session. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Wednesday, August 20, and a copy of our third quarter release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Also in that section is a supplemental third quarter financial presentation related to the comments that will be made during today's opening remarks.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call may be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can also be found in our third quarter earnings release. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Thank you, Deb, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Before we begin, I'm excited to welcome Bob McMahon, our new CFO, to his first Hologic earnings call. As many of you know, Bob joined the Hologic team during the quarter from Johnson & Johnson. Bob's strong operational and leadership skills are already evident, and we know Bob will have a big impact on our performance and direction in the quarters and years ahead.","On today's call, I will: one, review our third quarter results and recent developments; two, give an update on leadership changes; and three, discuss key business highlights, particularly the landmark JAMA publication that came out last month.","I'd like to begin by providing some context for where Hologic is today. After steep sales and earnings declines early in the year, we had indicated we hoped to stabilize the business by the end of the year and pave the way for a return to growth in 2015. Our fiscal 2014 results to date now offer a more definitive sign that we have stopped the declines and are returning to growth a little faster than expected. While the absolute growth rate is not the level we aspire to, this was a second straight quarter of sales growth as our turnaround is clearly taking hold.","The reported overall sales growth was slightly below last quarter's rate, though this quarter was qualitatively stronger as our Breast Health, Molecular Diagnostics and even our Surgical businesses all grew. Our higher-margin U.S. businesses accelerated, and the outlook for our key U.S. Breast Imaging business strengthened considerably. These results clearly demonstrate improving growth trends with our key franchises strengthening and our financial outlook improving.","In addition to the results which we'll discuss further, we put a completely new leadership team in place during the quarter, a new CFO, new Chief Operating Officer, new Head of International and a new President of Breast and Skeletal Health. All 4 leaders have outstanding track records at blue-chip companies. I am incredibly energized at what this team will bring to the company. We mentioned Eric Compton, our COO; and Claus Egstrand, our Head of International on the last call.","I'll now touch on the 2 most recent additions. Bob, our new CFO, joined us after more than 20 years with Johnson & Johnson, most recently as worldwide Vice President of Finance and Business Development for the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Group, bringing with him significant experience in the healthcare industry. While at J&J, Bob held a number of senior financial positions of increasing responsibility and demonstrated strong leadership capabilities. I am fully confident that Bob will bring a new level of leadership to our finance team and to the company, and I'm already seeing it.","Also during the quarter, Pete Valenti joined us as Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health. Pete has a successful track record of driving strong sales performance throughout his nearly 30-year career with Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Covidien and Bausch + Lomb . Pete will play an important role in building on the strength we are already seeing in our 3D mammography franchise where his expertise in marketing will surely be of great value to the company. The additions of Bob and Pete round out our new management team, with each executive possessing strong leadership skills and experience on a global scale. We now have a strong team in place to instill operational excellence and continue to drive the company's turnaround as we work towards our goals of delivering sustainable organic growth and maximizing shareholder value.","Now, let me briefly review our fiscal third quarter results that underscore the progress we are making. Revenues were $633 million, up 1% from last year and represent the second consecutive quarter of growth. In fact, overall revenues grew despite a small international decline of 2% as we took measures to institute financial discipline throughout our organization, which I will expand upon in a moment. Revenues in the U.S. grew 2%. Globally, 3 of our 4 franchises, Breast Health, Surgical and Skeletal, delivered growth during the quarter. Although modest, we are especially pleased to see surgical return to growth for the first time in many quarters. MyoSure continues to represent a strong growth story, while the NovaSure decline started to slow. While overall diagnostics experienced a decline, the decline was smaller than what we saw on the first 2 quarters of the year. In fact, our U.S. Diagnostics business improved, primarily as a result of our molecular diagnostics business, posting high-single digit growth in the U.S. and low single-digit growth internationally. Overall, the key contributors to our growth in the quarter were 3D mammography system sales, service revenues associated with our large and growing installed base of digital mammography systems, strength within our Molecular Diagnostics business lines and a resurgence in our surgical franchise. From a geographic standpoint, virtually all of our growth in the quarter came from the U.S. while international revenues were down. However, it's important to understand that some of the international softness is due to our commitment to break from past habits and exercise pricing discipline throughout the quarter in all geographies. We believe this would yield downstream benefits since there is genuine demand for our products in these markets. Without a doubt, some of our greatest growth opportunities are in untapped foreign markets, and we expect to take advantage of these opportunities as we further establish our global infrastructure.","During the quarter, perhaps the most significant development that will play into our future growth was the publication of the largest clinical study to date using Hologic's 3D mammography technology. This study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association or JAMA, was conducted at 13 leading academic and clinical sites in the United States and involved more than 450,000 exams. Among the important findings of this study were: one, a 41% increase in the detection of invasive cancers, those which are most important to find and find early; two, a 29% increase in detection of all cancers; three, a 15% reduction in recalls for additional imaging; and four, no significant change in the detection of ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS, which is cancer that has not spread beyond the milk duct, and therefore, may not need to be treated as aggressively as invasive breast cancer. The significance of this study cannot be understated. For the first time, on a large-scale basis, we have data clearly demonstrating that our 3D mammography and only ours, uniquely increases the detection of invasive breast cancers, which are cancers most important to identify and treat early while not increasing detection of low-grade cancers that some have suggested are overdiagnosed or overtreated. These results address the most frequently cited concerns with breast cancer screening and underscore the value of our 3D technology in addressing these challenges. We believe the JAMA study confirms what several other studies have shown so far, that 3D mammography facilitates the early detection of invasive cancer, lowers the rate of callbacks with unnecessary testing and creates meaningful savings to the healthcare system.","With regard to reimbursement, we are awaiting publication of new CPT codes for 3D mammography and their associated rates this fall. We realize there are a number of moving parts here as the existing G-codes for digital are migrated to CPT codes and the entire reimbursement framework is reevaluated by CMS. At this point, we will have to see where things fall out, but we are optimistic the final outcome will be helpful to our 3D commercialization efforts.","Our Diagnostics franchise is showing signs of strengthening as we work to return this business to growth. The key driver of that strength is our molecular diagnostics business where we are having nice success growing our HPV franchise, ramping up our business at Quest and increasing revenue pull through from Panther placements. Looking ahead, we also see a significant opportunity for accelerating growth in international markets in the years ahead. Also on the international front, implementation of Grifols' multi-year contract with the Japanese Red Cross should help offset anticipated weakness in U.S. blood donation volumes. Despite the well-known headwinds facing our Cytology business, we are now seeing reasonable progress in our Diagnostics franchise.","As noted earlier, our surgical business returned to growth in the quarter, as domestic NovaSure declines slowed and were more than offset by the combined o U.S. growth in NovaSure and strong double-digit MyoSure growth worldwide. Although the quarter is only one data point, we are optimistic this business is turning the corner.","Before turning the call over to Bob for a more detailed financial discussion, I would like to review our progress and outlook. Our focus on driving organic growth is beginning to yield positive results and validates the recent organizational and operational changes we have made. Despite the ongoing headwinds facing the company, we are more confident in our outlook based on the consistent improvement we've been able to deliver thus far in fiscal 2014, and especially in the third quarter. We have shown an ability to stem some of the declines in the challenged areas of our business, while accelerating growth in areas of key strengths such as 3D mammography and Molecular Diagnostics. We now have a talented and experienced leadership team in place that will build on this momentum. As Bob will detail shortly, we are raising our guidance for the year to reflect our improved performance and growing confidence in the outlook. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bob.","Robert W. McMahon","Thank you, Steve. I am excited to be part of the new Hologic leadership team at a time of tremendous opportunity for the company. I look forward to partnering with Steve and the rest of the senior management team to support the efforts already underway to drive growth and capitalize on new opportunities and deliver improved operating and financial results. I also look forward to building relationships with our investors and the analyst community in the coming months.","Our third quarter results are a signal that the turnaround of the company is taking place, but we realize there is more work ahead of us. With that, I will now review our third quarter financial results in more detail. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary regarding changes will be on a year-over-year non-GAAP basis.","As Steve mentioned, third quarter revenues were $633 million, up 1% on a reported basis compared to the prior year of $626 million and up 0.5% operationally. These results exceeded our guidance range of $615 million to $625 million for the quarter.","Now moving on to our results by division, starting with Diagnostics. Revenues of $293 million in this division declined 1.5% in the third quarter. Drilling down into the Diagnostics major business lines. Revenues in our cytology and perinatal business declined 7% to $123 million. International revenues were down 3%, while U.S. revenues declined 9%, primarily as a result of lower U.S. sales of ThinPrep due to ongoing screening interval expansion, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in average selling prices based on customer mix.","We had a good quarter on our Molecular Diagnostics business, which increased 7% to $116 million, driven by growth in the U.S. Our core Aptima franchise experienced healthy growth in the high-teens, primarily due to continued uptake at Quest and the broader adoption of Aptima HPV. This growth in Aptima HPV sales was complemented by high-single digit growth in CT\/GC and strong growth in our Trichomonas assay.","Blood screening revenues of $54 million declined 4%, primarily due to the timing of contingent revenue from our collaboration with Grifols. We are encouraged by the Japanese Red Cross and other wins, which are expanding our long-term opportunities in international markets and expect to see this impact primarily in 2015.","From an instrument placement standpoint, we had another strong quarter with Panther and are on track to place 1,000 instruments by the end of fiscal 2015.","Now moving on to Breast Health. Revenues increased 3.5% to $238 million, driven primarily by strong growth in 3D mammography system sales in the U.S. and we are on track to meet our goal of installing at least 500 3D mammography systems in the U.S. this year. Partially offsetting this increase was the anticipated decline of 2D mammography system sales as customers shift to 3D. In addition, as Steve mentioned, we focused on exercising some pricing discipline during the end of the quarter. And as a result, our international business experienced a decline. Service revenue was again a key contributor, and we achieved 8.5% growth in this business, driven by our growing installed base of digital mammography systems.","Now turning to our GYN Surgical business. Revenues were up 3.5% to $78.5 million. Strong double-digit growth in our MyoSure franchise globally and double-digit growth of NovaSure internationally helped offset a high-single digit decline in domestic NovaSure sales. And finally, our Skeletal Health business grew 0.9% to $23 million.","Now moving on to our third quarter performance for the rest of the P&L. Gross margins were 62.9%, up 50 basis points from last year and above our annual guidance range of approximately 62%. The strength in the third quarter gross margins was due to a variety of factors, including higher-than-expected revenues, favorable product mix and favorable geographic mix. Also during the quarter, we benefited from favorable manufacturing variances in our Diagnostics business due to an increase in inventory, driven by a system cutover earlier in the year, as well as volume increases. These manufacturing variances contributed approximately 75 basis points to the company's gross margins in the quarter. Operating expenses were $198 million, representing a 7% increase versus the prior year. And during the quarter, we have a slight increase in our estimated annual effective tax rate from 34.5% to 34.75%. This is primarily a result of some unbenefited losses associated with some of our smaller businesses we are looking to exit. As you know, lowering our effective tax rate was one of the biggest initiatives to come out of the strategic review process earlier in the year, and we are still developing a long-term plan. Despite this slightly higher tax rate, we achieved earnings per share of $0.37, which, while down 3% from last year's third quarter EPS of 38%, exceeded the high end of our guidance by 3%, driven by a higher-than-forecasted revenues and gross margins.","Now turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with $638 million in cash. Our operating cash flow was $158 million for the quarter, and we have generated approximately $400 million year-to-date, leaving us on pace to generate $500 million to $525 million for the year, as previously discussed. We also continue to focus on paying down our debt, and year-to-date, we have paid down $579 million in principal payments. We've improved our net debt to EBITDA ratio to 4.2x as compared to 4.4x at the end of Q2, and we ended the quarter with total debt obligations of $4.3 billion. On the capital allocation front, deleveraging is our top priority, and we did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter under our share buyback authorization.","I will now review our non-GAAP guidance, which, as a reminder, is detailed in our supplementary PowerPoint presentation and assumes currency rates consistent with the averages during the third quarter. Before providing our fourth quarter guidance, I'll first detail a one-time revenue item that will benefit our results over and above our ongoing business performance. We have entered into an amended license agreement with Roka Bioscience. As part of the amended agreement, Roka has exercised an option to reduce their future royalty obligations, and as a result, Hologic will receive approximately $20 million in cash and common stock in the fourth quarter. This will be reflected as an addition to our revenue for the quarter and fiscal year and will result in an incremental $0.05 in EPS. However, my guidance commentary will exclude this one-time benefit and I will speak in terms of the expected results of our ongoing business.","With that said, for the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $630 million to $640 million. We also expect to achieve EPS in the range of $0.36 to $0.37, mainly driven by higher forecasted revenues and an increase in our gross margin percentage to approximately 63%. Again, this excludes the one-time benefit of $20 million in revenue and associated $0.05 in EPS related to the amended license agreements.","Based upon our performance to date and improved outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our full fiscal year revenue guidance to $2.50 billion to $2.51 billion, up from our previous range of $2.46 billion to $2.49 billion. We are also raising our fiscal year EPS guidance range to $1.44 to $1.45, up from our previous range of $1.37 to $1.40. Again, this excludes the one-time benefit of $0.05 associated with the amended license agreement.","Before turning the call back over to Steve, I would like to reiterate how excited I am to be a part of the Hologic team, and I look forward to contributing to the turnaround that is taking place. Our goal is to deliver organic growth with strong profitability and cash generation. We will be focused on delevering the company and improving our operating flexibility while employing a more disciplined approach to capital allocation in the future. With that, I will turn the call back over to Steve.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Thanks, Bob. Before we take questions, I would like to remind everyone of our priorities and commitments. First and foremost, we are focused on driving sustainable organic growth across all of our businesses, and believe we are already seeing signs of progress on this front. We're committed to reinvigorating our innovation engine and establishing a strong global infrastructure, which will require time and investment, but should yield significant benefits for the company in the long term. We are committed to paying down our debt obligations and restoring the company's financial flexibility while generating the sizable cash flows we have historically realized. We believe focusing on these priorities places us in the best position to drive improved performance and maximize shareholder value. This is a company with some truly breakthrough products, and we are on the path to improve performance. With that, Jamie, please open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions, 1 strategic and 1 very specific on the numbers. Steve or Bob, you talked about the growth of mammo in the business the last 2 quarters, that's been very clear. Can you just walk me through the fourth quarter number? Because the implied guidance for the fourth quarter implied a break in that momentum, as I'm sure you're aware last quarter or last year this time, was your easiest comparable. So on a comparable adjusted basis, it implies fourth quarter as sort of decelerating. Is that just conservatism or is there something specific to the fourth quarter? And I have a follow-up for Bob as well.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. I think as you pointed out, David, we are going up against our easiest comp in the fourth quarter. So our reported growth will actually be a little bit better than it was in the last 2 quarters versus year ago. We're still being -- I would say, as we're shifting our guidance, I wouldn't want to signal that I'd say we're going from more conservative to more realistic guidance. We had 2 pretty big beats, but I think we feel pretty good still about the direction, but haven't sat through all the ups and downs and been through the full year cycle here yet to get overly ahead of ourselves on the revenue front. But I think we're feeling reasonably good about where it's headed.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, Bob, maybe, if you could indulge us. We've had multiple CEO changes here over the last several years at Hologic, but we haven't had a CFO change in decades. So maybe if you could share with us your perspective from a financial point of view on what are the interesting opportunities as you've gone from a larger organization to a rather small one? What are the opportunities? What do you see short-term? What can you achieve short-term? What do you see long-term? Any help would be very much appreciated.","Stephen P. MacMillan","David, before he answers that, I'd like to jump in and say one of his goals is to prevent the frequency of CEO changes. So with that, Bob will take over here.","Robert W. McMahon","It's a good question. You had a number of questions in there and maybe I'll take it in a couple of areas. When I think about what are some of the focus areas that I'm going to be looking at, both short-term and long-term, I'll really speak to kind of 3 areas. And first and foremost, as Steve talked about, what we want to do with this company. I'm really going to be focused on helping improve the operational execution of the business. This is going to be including working with some of the new leadership, as he mentioned, in our divisions, to increase the profitability and helping drive better performance by instilling some of that financial discipline. I think there's real opportunity there, both in the short term and also in the long term. I also think that we need to be focused on a much more disciplined approach to capital allocation. We want to leverage those strong operating cash flows to pay down the debt. We are improving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. But as you, I'm sure, know, we're highly leveraged relative to our peers and we want to increase our operating flexibility going forward. As part of that, one of the things that we are going to be looking at more concretely is ROIC. We have been publishing that. That's a metric that I think is a really important metric for this company. And I think by increasing that, that really creates shareholder value, leads to shareholder value. Our current is 8.3, and I think that's something, longer term, I'm going to really be focused on improving that over time. And then finally, I spoke to it a little bit, our opportunity around optimizing our tax position. Again, I think that's one of the key opportunities. I think that's something that we're looking at over time. We haven't had a tax planning in the organization of any significance, and we're a primarily U.S. based company, but longer term, with the growth opportunities that we have in international, we think that we'll be able to have a nice dovetail there between our tax strategy and our growth strategies to lower that tax rate over time.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, maybe if you could spend a minute talking a little bit about how you guys are driving the x U.S. growth. And trying to get a sense of the infrastructure you put in place beyond the new leadership team and just some of the ways in which you could help us stay comfortable that this pace of improvement is sustainable?","Stephen P. MacMillan","I would say that the truth is, we're still on probably the top of the first inning, we're probably in the batter's box. Claus Egstrand Just started midway through the last quarter and if I'm candid with you, part of what he's going to do is rip a few things apart before he rebuilds and puts it all back together again. So I think he's been assessing the situation, sees clear opportunities to focus in specific geographies and specific franchises, and is really taking a franchise-based approach and a country-based approach to the efforts. And that's going to really start to build the infrastructure candidly this quarter, and really, next quarter. So I think it's going to be a build over time, as we look at it. But to underscore the opportunities, we are delivering nice growth in Europe. We did bring in a new head of our European business last year, and she's been doing a heck of a job driving that business. So I think that will be generating the shorter term growth, while he really then refocuses on Asia. And while everybody focuses a lot on China, we specifically have huge opportunities even in Japan. So big opportunities for us ahead. And I think what you'll see is, this is going to be a multi-year journey. Much like our tax strategy, a lot of what we're looking at is it's going to take a little bit of time as we build the right people and get everything in place.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And just maybe one follow-up, obligatory question on the overall volume environment, specifically the Surgical business. I'm just wondering how much in the environment, I mean, improvement, rather, you might attribute to things like weather, ACA versus underlying trend, versus share? It seems like to me, it's really more company-specific, but I'm curious about your views on the overall environment.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Any time we have an uptick, probably always my first default is to credit the external events. I think that did it. I would tell you though, I think our sales force in that division has really settled down. If you look back, go back to third quarter, fourth quarter, call it our fourth fiscal quarter last year and even our first fiscal quarter of this year, that surgical division was thinking it might be sold off, turnover was incredibly high. That team has really hunkered down and refocused on executing and I'm just incredibly proud of the leadership and at all levels of that organization and how they've really settled that team down and refocused on the customers. And we saw very nice continued progress in MyoSure and even the NovaSure declines starting to slow. And I think it's just a blocking and tackling of those extra sales calls every day and reenergized team there. So that's probably one of the ones we're most proud of.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.","Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","You did a good job paying down a significant amount of debt so far this fiscal year, but I was wondering if you could tell us what sort of level you're comfortable with, I guess, on a leverage ratio perspective. And then what level of debt would you consider allocating some of your cash flow back to shareholders, either with buybacks or dividends?","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, Mike this is Bob, I'll take that. And so as I mentioned, currently, were at 4.2x. I would tell you that's too high. I think we've mentioned getting back into a more normalized and that would probably be in the 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio we've put out there. We think we can get there by fiscal year '17, and I think that, that makes sense. And I think until we do that and pay down, it's probably premature to talk about how we would distribute excess cash, but that will be something that we will be taking on over time.","Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And then just a question on the JAMA study. I'm just wondering, obviously got a lot of headlines. Do you view this as something that's more important in the clinical community, more important in the patient community or equally important in both areas? Because I know some of this data has sort of been out there in various forms, maybe not quite as visible though.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Great question, Mike. I think, really, both. There's still been the naysayers within the hospital purchasing community that have been able to kind of throw back. Well, we don't have any big studies, you got Oslo, you got Scottie, you got Rose, some little things here and there. I think we immediately are starting to see more interest, certainly from both the hospital community. And again, as you well know, because you're very familiar with capital purchase cycles, it's not like this quarter, sales are going to have this huge inflection point, but I think the momentum driving it is very good. The other piece that we literally saw that day was hospitals who were suddenly getting calls from patients starting to demand it. And I'd tell you one anecdote, we had some folks at a hospital I won't say, that had been very reticent and really was kind of going through the motions, I think, humoring our team and one more time. The meeting started at 10 a.m. that day and somebody came into the meeting and said they'd already gotten 6 calls from patients that morning, asking if that hospital had Hologic 3D mammo. So it clearly made for a better sales call than we otherwise would have expected. So I think it's both the patient awareness and I think we can do even more on that. The other anecdote in all of this is actually the OB\/GYN community where we should be doing a better job of really educating that audience. We've been so focused on radiologists and the traditional users but as you know, we've got very nice sales forces calling on OB\/GYNs. And a lot of the OB\/GYNs hadn't really been very familiar with. So it's also something that we can leverage there. Again, given the size of that audience, that will take some time, but a study that's published in JAMA certainly has a lot of credibility with that audience as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Richard Newitter with Leerink.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Steve, kind of just piggybacking off of that, can you talk a little bit about the capital equipment spend environment? Obviously, you're in a unique position, you have a differentiated technology to perhaps push you over the edge on some levels, but are you noticing any changes in the tone or the conversations with the administrators, their willingness to kind of prioritize capital? Can you comment there?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Not seeing any meaningful difference. It's clearly not the late '08, early '09 time period, so it's open up, but it's still fairly rigorous. I would say, I think in general, we're competing against a lot of healthcare IT in terms of capital investments coming from the hospitals. So we've really got to make our cases. And I think even our own sales team in that Breast Imaging business is getting better at making the economic arguments in addition to just the technical features and benefits of the products. So it's still a slog in some, the process has gotten a lot more layered, shall we say, in terms of the number of sign offs within an institution, but nothing meaningfully different, say, today versus, I'd say, even a year ago.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just follow-up also on tomo. You mentioned that you're optimistic that the CPT code decision and the rates that are set will be helpful to your commercialization process in January of next year and going forward. Can you give us a sense of, are hospitals more concerned right now with perhaps not buying just because they don't want to be in front of that given uncertainty? What are the rates going to be? How is the paradigm of reimbursement for the whole 2D, 3D process going to change? Or is it the other way, are you noticing a pickup in discussions and willingness, and they want to get ahead of the CPT code that they know is coming one way or the other?","Stephen P. MacMillan","It's probably a little more of the former, though it's a combination of both. I think the lack of differentiation is a simple smokescreen and a simple objection that can be put up there. Frankly, given the incredible differentiation of this product, even we're challenging our sales teams, and a lot of our sales teams that have been selling it, are selling through that objection. I do think knowing there's something coming is helping get people a little more comfortable. And I think that extra certainty will be a nice additional, call it, accelerator to the curve.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe first one, Steve, for you. On the international breast side, I asked last quarter, I think the business was down last quarter, and you pointed to a tough comp. But down again this quarter, and you mentioned pricing environment. So can you talk to maybe, the landscape over there? It's a different one from a competitive standpoint from what you're seeing from a pricing environment because I think when you mentioned pricing internationally, that was specific to Breast Health.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. Very good question, Jon. I'd put it this way. We largely deal with the dealer network outside the U.S., and candidly, when you look at the performance of the company over time, I think we had developed a habit of allowing deep discounts at quarter end to get some extra revenue across the finish line. And we're in the process right now of saying, you know what, we're not going to do those deals. I think Bob has come in and my new team exerting a very different level of financial discipline that we're going to be willing to walk away from some deals that I think will come over time, but it's probably -- if you look, dare I say, we're never going to get into monthly reporting, but if you look at the months within the quarter, very different in the last month, dare I say, the last weeks of the quarter. And so I feel very good about where we will be going there.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe just a quick follow-up on surgical. Anything specific? I mean, I don't believe there was sort of an iteration for the NovaSure product line. Was it when you alluded to the guys hunkering down, has some of the dust settled from Affordable Care Act and what's free from sort of an IUD standpoint? And I guess where I'm going with this is, do you think that the worst is behind you and even though you might be fighting negative growth on NovaSure, we can see some stability going forward?","Stephen P. MacMillan","I do think the worst is behind us. We're clearly probably getting a little bit of a pop from the ACA, but that's cut both ways because IUDs are now covered. I really think this one is largely is coming down the sales execution, and being reminded that we've got 2 great products in the bag. And I think to some degree, there was probably a bit of infatuation with MyoSure, and we just kind of took our eye off the ball a little bit with NovaSure. And now, the team, I think, has really hunkered back down and realizing if we can just slow the declines on NovaSure, that also helps get them a lot of closer to hitting their quotas and really helps both. So I think that the leadership team there has really reengaged and refocused the team on remembering what a great product NovaSure still is, even if it's facing some general declines. So I think we'll still see some declines there in the U.S., but the rate of them seem to come down and then we're really trying to ramp up those businesses outside the U.S.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe a follow-up to Jon's first question there, just on pricing. In general, it seems like there's a broader strategy here to extract more price where you can. So maybe can you just comment beyond mammography, and where you see additional opportunities to extract price within the portfolio and maybe by geography?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, Tycho. I would tell you the bulk of it is probably, really in the Breast Imaging business. I would love to say that it's broader than that, Bob. I'm not sure if you've seen anything else in your early days to say other big opportunities to extract price?","Robert W. McMahon","No, I would agree with you, Steve. I think like others, we are also seeing some pricing headwinds in some other areas of the business. And what we're trying to do is where we have the opportunity to extract that value as you talked about.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When you commented -- go ahead, Steve.","Stephen P. MacMillan","No, you go.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You did comment on ThinPrep coming down, that's obviously been a trend for a while, but did you take a more significant step down this quarter and maybe just talk on within the market, what are you seeing vis-a-vis Roche getting the primary claim?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, I think we're still seeing, in the U.S., fairly steady, it flips a little bit up and down. We can't say that we're slowing the decline yet in the U.S. on ThinPrep. And we still had a little bit of softness in China just as we're shifting to some dealers and some things on that front. So ThinPrep has continued to be a big headwind and I think it's important to point out if we didn't have that, that we'd be a lot more optimistic probably, about where we're going. But it's still a very profitable, high-margin business. It's going to be a headwind even in 2015 and so forth ahead of us but I think we're feeling it's still going down. We're working on trying to slow it and we're just not ready to declare that we're near the bottom yet.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Maybe start with Breast Health, and then a quick follow-up on Diagnostics. Steve or Bob, maybe you can give us a sense of how much 3D mammography service revenue was a driver this quarter? Our understanding is that a lot of systems are beyond sort of that 1 year, 18 month mark in terms of being out of warranty. So how much of a driver was that this quarter and what do you expect in terms of 3D services when you look into next quarter and next year?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Bob, do we have the breakout of 3D versus 2D [indiscernible].","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, I don't think we're going to be prepared to talk to the breakout of our service revenue between 2D and 3D.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes, but I think it...","Robert W. McMahon","But overall, I mean, our service revenue, which is primarily, obviously, in our Digital Mammography business, grew 8.5% as I mentioned. That was helping drive the Breast Health. We see that as a very positive development, given the large installed base of digital mammography systems that we have. And while I'm not going to project going forward, we don't see that significantly dropping off.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","No, it's helpful. And just a quick one on [indiscernible] maybe specifically on the Gen-Probe business. When Gen-Probe was acquired, the strategy really was to stay focused on women's health. And some of the business there have already been sold while others, such as say, oncology and respiratory have not. So maybe just an update on where you sit in the Diagnostics portfolio? Should we expect further asset sales or is that sort of where you like -- where the business should be at this point in terms of the portfolio?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. I think we have that portfolio pretty well set at this stage now, so with what we have. By the way, to also answer a previous -- I realized I didn't answer the second part of Tycho's question around HPV and its link to this. We do continue to feel very good about co-testing. And therefore, ThinPrep I think, is still playing a very strong role in that going forward. And meanwhile, even though we don't have the primary indication for HPV, we feel good about the direction we're going there.","Operator","And we'll go next to Vijay Kumar with ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe on the first question, big picture on the Diagnostics side. High-single digits in the U.S. And first, I know that Aptima franchise sort of performed well, but I feel like that franchise in the last quarter, it wasn't great, but then now, it's back high-singles. What's really driving this? Was this the Quest contract? And how should we think about sort of the run rate on a go-forward basis?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. Clearly, the Molecular business right now in the U.S. is being boosted by Quest. So were going to get a 4-quarter run on that and, therefore, we don't want to get too excited about exactly what that will be once that all anniversaries. We are feeling very good about HPV. We're making great strides there and I really like our trajectory there.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe as a follow-up on that. I think one of your earlier comments in optimizing the back structure caught my attention. And can you walk through sort of this blocking and tackling? And given your revenue mix, like 75% in the U.S., where do you think the tax rate could go? How long is going to take? And can you think of anything else that could accelerate the process in decreasing the tax rates?","Robert W. McMahon","Vijay, this is Bob. I think we're still in the early stages, so I'm not going to get into specific numbers around when we think that the tax rate can go down, but rest assured that's something that is high on my agenda. What I would say is, with the opportunities that we're having around up and expanding our International business, there's a number of opportunities that we can do with looking at our footprint in redomiciling [ph] things like IP, and so forth. This is something that's going to take time. As you mentioned, we have 75% of our revenues in the U.S. and we're still growing our U.S. business. But this is something that we're going to be focused on and actually have already started doing some of the kind of the blocking and tackling, and that's why some of our G&A costs are actually high year-over-year, as we're starting to rationalize some legal entities to help prepare or pave the road for optimizing some of our tax structures going forward. So we're starting to do that. When we have a more concrete plan, we will share that with you.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Suffice it to say, it won't really impact even 2015.","Robert W. McMahon","That's a fair comment.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So beyond the, call it, 1-year boost from Quest, certainly the diligence does suggest that customers that have maybe been previously looking at some alternatives are seeking or looking to stick with Hologic. So I'm curious, so what have you done organizationally to, I guess, improve your overall competitive dynamic within the existing team?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. We've really got, I'd say, it's 2 things. It's that Panther instrument, which is just a dynamite instrument. Eric Compton and Bob, both as they came over -- Eric our Chief Operating Officer. I know when he first went out to San Diego and saw the Panther system was, dare I say, salivating and incredibly excited at what a good instrument it is. And our team, I think that's really the biggest part of the magic we got out of the Gen-Probe business. Combined with our sales leadership, we have -- I really like what our sales leadership is doing in that business. And if you think about some of the magic that we probably haven't talked about quite as much, but bringing the physician sales force, along with the lab sales force and getting them really working together to help support the labs, I think, is a competitive advantage for us that is starting to show and kick in a little bit. So again, it's really a sales execution story and sales leadership and rep story, along with the instrumentation.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then as a follow up, and I recognize that we don't have a perfect crystal ball here, but any color on where you think the reimbursement might shake out for 3D? And then maybe asking in a slightly different way, where do think it has to be in order to help accelerate the overall adoption there?","Stephen P. MacMillan","I don't -- I think just -- it's almost -- this will sound like a cop out, but frankly, just getting it solidified, whether there was any differentiation or not, is enough that we ought to be able to sell the heck out of this product. This product is truly differentiated. And whether it becomes a small premium or medium premium, frankly, I don't think I want the investment community worried about a specific number. I would tell you, as I sit here, I worry people are going to peg a number and say gee, if it's above X or below Y, that it's not as meaningful. And at the end of the day, just having it quoted, we assume there will be differentiation, but we would also plan even worse case if it wasn't differentiated, but we still want to be able to drive this franchise incredibly well regardless of where it plays out. So I don't want to headline a #1 way or the other, and we ought to be able to drive it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question form Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So international surgical has been a real success story the last couple of quarters, really last 3 at least. I guess to move from baseball to football analogies, given that you and the new team are in Patriots country now, can you talk about what quarter you are in driving NovaSure and MyoSure growth internationally? And if there are ways to further leverage some of the successful o U.S. commercial efforts that have been ongoing?","Stephen P. MacMillan","I think we're still in the pre-season. There is years and years of growth ahead of us for our surgical business outside the U.S. and we're literally -- we're in the basics here of figuring out country-by-country, a reimbursement strategy and where we go. So it ought to be a very nice double-digit growth story for a long, long time. So if we play the one game, then we're clearly in the first quarter.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, this is sort of another pricing question but keeping in mind as we've talked about a little bit over the course of this call that there's been some new approvals in chlamydia and gonorrhea and of course, the recent Roche HPV label expansion. Are you factoring in any assumptions for incremental pricing pressure in Molecular Diagnostics in the fourth quarter? And that may be too quick, but as we think about 2015, as some of these new approvals competitively are coming about, should we be assuming that there is some incremental price? Is that how you're thinking about things?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. Less about the fourth quarter, but I think we are concerned a bit about the pricing pressure in that space. It's getting more competitive, certainly and I think is one of the headwinds we will face going forward in the molecular business.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple questions on the Diagnostics. In terms of the Quest rollout, how far along are you in realizing the benefits of this agreement? Meaning, are they 75% through the transition, more, less?","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, I would say we're -- this is Bob. So to follow that same analogy, I mean, we're pretty close to -- we've rolled it out, we've been very successful, we continue to see nice volume increases associated with our Diagnostics business. And as I mentioned, Quest is a portion of that. And we signed that about mid-year last year. And so, that ramp-up will start anniversary-ing itself, some in the third quarter this year, but more in the fourth quarter.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up. Thinking about the impact of Panther to the Diagnostics franchise, are most of the devices you're selling pulling through incremental volume or are they cannibalizing the existing base?","Stephen P. MacMillan","It's bits of both but we're clearly getting some incremental business and a reasonable chunk of incremental, but we're also upgrading existing customers as well.","Operator","And we have time for only one more question. That final question will come from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So I guess, my main question is around CapEx side of things. At AACC, there's a hospital who just kind of off the cuff mentioned that there was a potential new tax law that would require hospitals to actually capitalize their instruments as opposed to getting the benefit of the reagent rental. I was just curious if that's something that you have dug into or know about? And if there's any kind of update there that you can share with us now that might impact the business?","Stephen P. MacMillan","I don't think we know much about that.","Robert W. McMahon","No, we haven't.","Stephen P. MacMillan","We're not sure. I haven't heard that.","Unknown Executive","By the way, we don't let [indiscernible] either.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. That was just there was a big hospital chain who just mentioned something that I'm trying to dig at maybe into a little bit more. And then, I guess, for Bob. On the Roka side, what is the royalty now? And does it have the potential to be material or is it no longer material?","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, so we -- the royalties that we've received to date are de minimis. And actually, the details actually can be found on the Res 1. Our royalty rate was 12% and it has an option to go, depending on performance and the paydown, it could be to 8% and eventually, to 4%. But I would say, this is kind of a one-time. We haven't seen any material revenue associated with that royalty to date, and don't expect that this would have a material impact in '15.","Operator","Thank you.

In Q1, revenues of $473 million increased 9% over the prior year's first quarter. We also improved year-over-year our non-GAAP gross margins in 3 of our operating segments. Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.34, $0.02 ahead of guidance and 13% above last year. We continue to execute on bringing new products to market with the FDA approval of our Cervista HTA; CE Marking of C-View; and the SFDA approval of our China manufacturing product, the Selenia -- the Serenity products, excuse me. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also announced the favorable outcome of our injunction hearing with Conceptus. And lastly, tomosynthesis was voted the hottest clinical procedure in 2011 as discussed in an AuntMinnie broadcast. AuntMinnie is a website that serves radiologists and imaging professionals. We're very proud to have our new product recognized by this panel of experts in a field through 2 rounds of voting. ","And now I want to spend a little bit of time addressing some of the economic trends that have impacted our business. As we previously stated, typical capital equipment spending trends in the U.S. are not relevant when a superior successor technology is introduced to a market. We are certainly seeing this with our tomo product and, to a lesser extent, with our Dimensions 2D. On an international basis, we are seeing solid growth especially in emerging markets. However, some developed countries are generally struggling, which puts pressure on buying patterns as well as pricing. Another concern is the further weakening in the euro and the impact this will have on dollar-denominated businesses. ","With respect to patient business in GYN exams, recent IMS reports are suggesting growth on a year-over-year basis, which has created a level of stability in such businesses when compared to a year ago. The belief is this trend will continue into 2012, which should help our ThinPrep business. On an o U.S. basis, the trends for screening exams have improved. Although they are as much consideration over the use of liquid-based cytology versus HPV on a global basis, there is not an immediate determination in sight, and consequently, our Diagnostic business is benefited by same. ","As we stated last quarter, however, treatment procedures for non-urgent care continue to face headwinds. This is largely due to unemployment in the United States and a generally weak global economy. Having stated this, market data would suggest for the first time in several quarters an increase in the number of U.S. office visits focused specifically on excessive menstrual bleeding. In short, there is more stability in certain markets in slow recovery. And while the situation in Europe will continue for some time, any negative impact on our business over recent quarters has been offset by emerging market growth. ","I'd now like to update you on some of the business units and I'll start with Breast Health. We continue to be very pleased what the traction both 2D and 3D tomo achieved in the quarter. Overall sales of Dimensions in the quarter were solid and we remain very optimistic about the long-term potential of this technology. In the U.S., a lower-end digital mammography business has all but ended. This market is mature with fewer and fewer systems being placed. The good news is the market is shifting to more full-featured systems capable of 3D. Our sense is no one is replacing a digital mammography system with one that is not at least tomo-ready. The result is an increase in ASPs, which we believe will fuel growth this year. ","Internationally, the situation is mixed as digital penetration varies greatly from market to market. In more developed countries, the interest in higher-end tomo-capable systems is present, while those markets that are still largely analog are converting to more entry-level systems, the exception being private pay centers where the latest technology is usually very appealing. ","Consistent with the information we provided last quarter, I'd like to update you on a few tomo specifics. We remain solidly on plan. We are approximately 27% of the way towards our 500 to 700 2-year unit goal of early adopters after only 9 months of a formal U.S. launch. Over the course of '12, we continue to expect 3D penetration to accelerate and to finish the year at 60%, which is the number we stated last quarter to you. ","We find it encouraging that the profile of tomo adopters is broader than we first expected. Although still early adopters, we're seeing the profile of buyers ranging from university research types to community-based hospitals or private imaging centers. All are vying for different reasons and not the least of which to gain share with the competitive edge provided by this technology. ","Tomo uptake outside the U.S. has also been steady. In the quarter, we exceeded expectations. We believe the introduction of C-View, which is our reconstructed 2D, will be one of the most important features in the acceleration of the technology. C-View addresses the Europeans' sensitivity towards those while still providing the benefits of a 2D image for reviewing priors and efficiently analyzing calcifications. ","Perhaps surprisingly, we are not seeing reimbursement as a primary gaining item in the acceleration of tomo here in the states. The fundamentals of what's going to be necessary to fuel growth are 2 things essentially. One is the ongoing clinical validation of the technology and the second is the market dynamic of regional competition by providers. We're working on both of these to assist our customers, but realistically, this will take some time to implement. ","Turning to an update on reimbursement. Let me start by saying that we remain on track with our strategy and we are experiencing some notable progress. As we discussed, we are currently working with our tomo customers to help them with implementing the American College of Radiology's guidelines on the use of our miscellaneous coding structure. We are finding around 70% of our U.S. customers are submitting claims that are being reimbursed anywhere from $30 to $70 for the tomo portion of the exam on top of the 2D portion and on the first pass. In fact, 65% to 70% of claims that are being submitted for 3D are successfully receiving reimbursement. ","We're very pleased also with the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecologists their belief and now being appropriate for them to educate their members on the benefits of this technology. We believe this will help in consumer referrals to sites using tomo. We're also pleased to report we are working cooperatively with the American College of Radiology on really routine and very positive constructive dialogue on the use of tomosynthesis. In addition, discussions with both Komen and the ACS regarding their support of this technology are moving positively as well. And confirming what we said last quarter, our estimated timeframe for reimbursement is unchanged. We believe that we'll secure code and an amount by the first half of calendar 2013. ","In order to garner the support of these organizations, however, continued validation of this technology is going to be necessary. To this end, we're extremely pleased about the level of clinical trial activity taking place and the eventual submission of results to peer-reviewed journals. The first of which was our FDA trial, which was submitted by Dr. Elizabeth Rafferty of Mass General, who is the principal investigator. The Oslo study, which was presented in summary at RSNA, is also progressing extremely well. They've imaged over 12,000 patients and they've experienced a meaningful increase in the cancer detection rate. And these are early-stage cancers. They're invasive cancers and they, in fact, were node-negative. So very early stage. And all of this was accomplished by even a slight reduction in the recall rate. So impressive cancer detection improvement with a reduction in recall. There are also several other studies underway, some of which are going to be presented at the upcoming European Congress of Radiology Conference in March. ","Now I'd like to discuss the status of some of our other important growth drivers. While tomo is certainly attracting a considerable amount of attention, there are many other businesses that we focus on in terms of the future of Hologic, the first of which being our Diagnostic business. This franchise is a great example of a strong market-leading cash flow business complemented by a rapidly growing emerging technology. The conventional Diagnostic business, our ThinPrep franchise, has been particularly resilient over these challenging times. Glenn will share with you the growth specifics, but in general, we're seeing a strong recovery with growth fueled by international successes and a much more stable U.S. market. ","We stated in the past that we thought the U.S. business will erode at a rate of about 2% to 3% a year, but that's not the case this year. The reality over the last year has been a slowly recovering volume with relatively stable pricing. We also think we've gained some additional share with competitive takeaways. The result has been a domestic ThinPrep business at flat volume levels. Internationally, we have seen solid growth, led mainly by the incremental dollars from our TCT acquisition and pockets of growth in Brazil, Japan and selected European markets. We expect the international growth to be sustained throughout fiscal '12 especially as we continue to penetrate more emerging markets. This is simply a strong ThinPrep quarter. In fact, on a unit basis, we had our second highest quarter in the product line's history. ","With respect to molecular, the business grew over 25% on a year-over-year basis with Cervista contributing nicely. We once again posted impressive revenue growth for Cervista on a year-over-year basis driven by new customer account wins, growth at existing accounts and higher international volumes. We now have over 230 lab customers in the U.S., most have been competitive takeaways and all without our fall automation product. We believe the approval of our HTA or High Throughput Automation system dramatically changes the competitive landscape in this business and allows us to now compete at a much higher level of penetration, seeking to garner accounts from the mid- to high-volume labs and expand our market opportunity. Given the advantages of the HTA system in streamlining the extraction, analyses and detection steps, we believe we are well-positioned to leverage the early successes of our semi-automated tests. We now have the advantage of a well-proven assay and first-class automation, leveraged by the significant market presence of ThinPrep and the extension of reach of our physician sales team. Our objective is to grow this market and we now have the building blocks in place to do so. ","Internationally, we believe our Medium Throughput Automation product, which received CE marking in Europe last quarter, is an appropriate level of automation for the small- to mid-sized labs predominant to these regions. We are happy with the progress to date and have already placed several systems for evaluation at critical customer sites. In addition, we are excited to have SFDA approval in China for Cervista and to now have this product offering in this very exciting geographical market. From a product development perspective, we continue to invest heavily in proprietary assays and expanded functionality of our instrumentation. Our focus has been to broaden our STD offerings deliverable through our ThinPrep bio and which can run on our automation platforms. Our CT\/NG and Trichomonas assays are progressing on plan. We intend to start our clinicals this year and submit to the FDA in 2013. ","Now turning to our GYN Surgical business. And Glenn will report on specific financial performance, but as projected, we continue to face some headwinds with our NovaSure product line. We were encouraged, however, that sequentially the business grew 5% from last quarter but believe it's a significant subset of women and our target market are deferring these nonurgent treatments. These are the high cost of deductibles and co-pays. We are pleased with the latest IMS data, which indicated an increase of office visits specifically for excessive menstrual bleeding. We view this as very favorable, and although not a direct impact on the quarter's revenue, we believe it is an indication of increased patient awareness. And we further believe our DTC campaign is a contributor to this increased awareness. ","During the calendar year of 2011, we generated nearly 250,000 requests for information, almost 95% being incremental to our normal run rate. This has had a positive effect on patient awareness. We estimate the incremental revenue pull-through from our DTC campaign has been $10 million in the quarter and just over $30 million programmed to date. So one has to ask, \"Why are we not seeing this in terms of incremental revenue growth?\" As we have stated in the past, we believe the economic climate has delayed the uptake of these relatively expensive procedures. We firmly believe this is a temporary condition, and longer term, NovaSure will prevail based solely on its superior efficacy. In an effort to ready ourselves for this spending -- for the pending market movement, we have added to our surgical sales force and are poised to take advantage of this increasing wave of awareness. I'm optimistic we will see a definitive turn in NovaSure demand by the second half of '12 as the economy further stabilizes. ","Glenn will report on the performance metrics of our other products within surgical, but I wanted to comment on the continued excitement we're having over our MyoSure acquisition. This product will continue to have double-digit quarter-over-quarter growth for the balance of this year. Within the context of some other key drivers, I'd like to speak to our international expansion. As you are aware, we meaningfully entered the Chinese market last year with acquisitions of TCT and Healthcome. We believe this China business more than triples over the next 5 years and reaches annual revenue of $300 million during the same time period. TCT has already added nicely to both revenue and earnings and the recent SFDA approval of Cervista HPV will help grow our presence in China significantly. We believe this market will initially be served with manual offering, so the current version of Cervista should gain quick acceptance and when linked to an 16\/18 assay will provide a powerful combination. ","In addition, in December, the SFDA approved our Serenity digital mammography system ahead of our expectations. Serenity enables us to penetrate the emerging entry-level market with a superior performance alternative to competitive offerings. Remember, this product incorporates the same best-in-class Selenia detector technology as our higher end products. While the initial launch of Serenity will be limited to the Chinese market, our expectations are to use this product in other price-sensitive emerging markets throughout Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and eventually India. ","I'd now like to briefly review our 4 pillars of growth. As a reminder, we expect to continue acceleration of our revenues and earnings, achieving double-digit compound growth by 2015. To achieve this, we're focused on driving solid organic growth, building out our product portfolio through continued investment in R&D, expanding internationally and pursuing our tuck-in acquisition strategy. We are on track with all of these initiatives, specifically in the quarter we posted attractive organic top line growth of 6%, excluding any acquisitions. Our successes on new product approvals over the last 12 months speak to our commitment to R&D, namely FDA approvals of tomosynthesis; our Sentinelle prostate coil and 16-channel breast coils, the Trident, especially in radiography system; and finally, our HTA system. In addition, we received SFDA approval in China of Serenity and Cervista HPV as well as CE marking in Europe for C-View and Cervista MTA. ","As for international expansion, I just spoke about our opportunity in China. Clearly, we are very enthusiastic about the potential and we have the building blocks now in place to even expand our growth further. We also are making ongoing investments in other countries, such as adding infrastructure and additional distribution in places like Asia and Latin America. ","Finally, as I believe this quarter's results will demonstrate, our recent acquisitions have provided us with important technologies to strengthen existing franchises and to fuel future growth. We will continue to invest in product line extensions, ideally those that leverage our existing sales and marketing infrastructure with leading-edge technologies that possess strong clinical advantages. ","In summary, we're very pleased with the first quarter's performance. Worldwide demand for our 2D and 3D Dimensions systems is extremely promising. The approval of HTA and the CE marking of MTA will enable us to drive further growth in our Diagnostic segment and we're also encouraged by the stabilization in the U.S. market of ThinPrep. We expect to reverse the softer trends of NovaSure and our GYN Surgical segment and we expect ongoing substantial growth from MyoSure. Finally, we will continue to take advantage of considerable opportunities to introduce our broad and growing portfolio of exciting products in the emerging markets we serve. ","Thank you very much, and with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn Muir.","Glenn P. Muir","Thanks, Rob. Consolidated revenues of $472.7 million this quarter versus $432.6 million in Q1 of last year grew $40.1 million or 9.3%, exceeding our expectations. We saw growth in all 4 operating segments with double-digit year-over-year growth in 3. Our Breast Health segment was the largest contributor to this overall growth, increasing $20 million or 10.2%. Diagnostics again experienced strong performance, increasing $15 million or 10.8%. GYN Surgical revenues were up 3.8% and Skeletal Health grew 10.3%. FX had no impact this quarter. ","If we exclude the revenues from the 3 acquisitions we made in fiscal 2011, our organic growth was approximately 6% and our acquisition-related growth was 3%. Breast Health revenues grew to $215.4 million this quarter from $195.4 million in Q1 '11. This growth of 10.2% came from a $14.1 million or 10.9% increase in product revenues and a $5.9 million or 9% increase in service revenues. Breast Health product revenues primarily benefited from the continued shift in sales from Selenia to Dimensions mammography system. In addition, our breast biopsy products continued to gain market share, and once again, we had a record quarter with sales up 24% year-over-year. ","Our digital mammography product sales increased to $77.3 million in the quarter, representing 36% of total Breast Health revenue. Service, at $70.9 million, was 33% of total Breast Health revenues. Looking closer at digital mammography, product sales were 8.4% higher in Q1 of last year. On a sequential basis, digital mammography revenues, as expected, were lower than Q4 '11 due to the usual delayed purchasing decisions ahead of the RSNA meeting in late November, early December. This was highlighted in the guidance we previously provided for Q1 and we actually realized stronger growth than we had expected in the quarter. The year-over-year growth was driven by a significant increase in both units and revenues of our Dimensions line, which accounted for 62% of digital mammography product revenue and 50% of units. This sales mix is consistent with Q4 '11 and sharply higher than the 37% of revenues and 30% of units just one year ago when we were still only commercializing 2D Dimensions in the U.S. These numbers do not include software upgrades to 3D from 2D Dimensions, which did increase substantially year-over-year and also sequentially. The upgrades to tomo represented approximately 15% to 20% of total tomo unit sales this quarter as existing Dimensions customers look to add 3D capability to their practices. ","Overall, we continue to be pleased with the adoption of 3D tomo and strongly believe that over time all 2D Dimensions sold will upgrade to 3D. As Rob indicated, at our current run rate, we are well on our way to hit our target of shipping 500 to 700 tomo systems in the U.S. within the first 2 years. ","Switching to our other segments, Diagnostics revenues were $154.1 million with year-over-year growth of 10.8%. Over half of the growth in Diagnostics was driven by an increase in ThinPrep revenues, the majority of which came from our acquisition of TCT with the rest coming from increased international volumes. In Q1, TCT contributed revenues of approximately $13 million, of which 85% were from sales of ThinPrep. As noted in our earnings release, TCT contributed incremental ThinPrep revenues of approximately $7.3 million in this quarter as they have been our partner and distributor for over 10 years. This was the second full quarter we owned TCT and we remain ahead of our original internal projections. We continue to expect close to 20% annual revenue growth in fiscal 2012. ","ThinPrep unit volume worldwide increased 6% year-over-year and surpassed last quarter's total, now making this volume level the second highest total ever on a worldwide basis. The U.S. market is currently stable and we continue to penetrate the international market. Molecular Diagnostics also contributed to the year-over-year growth in the Diagnostics segment with a 30% year-over-year increase in revenues from our Cervista HPV product line. This growth occurred both domestically and internationally. ","In GYN Surgical, revenues grew 3.8% year-over-year to $78.5 million. MyoSure sales contributed to this increase, while a decline in NovaSure tempered the growth. Adiana sales were essentially flat. Nonetheless, NovaSure sales improved sequentially with a mid- single-digit improvement versus Q4 of '11 as a result of our DTC campaign, which helped to drive slightly higher procedure volume. Also, on a sequential basis, we grew MyoSure revenues over 40% and we expect strong double-digit growth to continue. Skeletal Health reported solid growth of 10.3% this quarter with revenues of $24.7 million, up from $22.4 million, led by an increase in bone densitometry product sales. ","Regarding the international performance, we continue to experience solid growth given our focus on international expansion. This quarter, international revenues reached a new high of $117.5 million, which comprise 25% of total revenues. This represents the same percentage as last quarter and is up from 22% a year ago. ","Turning to the rest of the P&L. Gross margins on a non-GAAP basis were 62.5%, up 50 basis points from last year driven by improved gross margins in 3 of our 4 operating segments. This quarter, the Diagnostic Group contributed the largest gain due to increasing overall volumes and the added contribution from including TCT in China. Our overall gross margins met the high end of our guidance range of 61.5% to 62.5%. Regarding operating expenses, non-GAAP expenses of $151.4 million came in near the low end of our guidance and increased 11.1% from a year ago and 5.4% sequentially. The increase primarily rose from costs associated with our TCT, Healthcome and MyoSure acquisitions. R&D still remains an investment priority and is on track with our targeted range of 6% to 7% of revenues. ","OpEx was also favorably impacted by the deferral of certain clinical trial-related expenses out of Q1 and into Q2 due to timing. Non-GAAP earnings exclude certain items that are fully detailed in our earnings release. Our adjusted pretax income this quarter was $136.4 million versus $121 million last year, an increase of 13%. Using our annual effective tax rate of 34%, non-GAAP adjusted net income rose 13% to $90 million compared to $79.9 million for the same period last year. We reported fully diluted non-GAAP EPS this quarter of $0.34 versus $0.30 a year ago, an increase of $0.04 or 13% and $0.02 above our guidance of $0.32. Essentially, this $0.02 peak versus our guidance came 1\/2 from better-than-expected revenues and 1\/2 from lower-than-expected clinical trial expenses. ","Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash balance totaled $794 million, up approximately $81 million or 11% from the end of fiscal 2011. This growth is primarily due to the continued strong generation of cash from operations. Historically, we have certain large cash payments due in the first quarter of our fiscal year and this quarter was no exception. Such payments include bonuses, interest on convertible notes and the earn outs, these totaled to combined $57 million this quarter. Regarding free cash flows, we generated approximately $97 million this quarter, consistent with Q4 '11. The current quarter's cash flows were comprised of approximately $112 million of cash flows from operations, less capital expenditures of $15 million. ","The total dollar backlog for all of our products was $260.6 million, which was down $3.4 million or 1.3% from $264 million at the end of September. The decrease was primarily in Diagnostics and due to the timing of orders. Breast Health was up $3 million or 3%. As a reminder, due to the wide diversity in our products, the backlog is not a good indicator of our revenue trend. ","Moving onto guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2012 ending on March 24, we are expecting revenues of $470 million to $475 million. Year-over-year, this reflects a 7% to 8% increase in revenues primarily due to the contributions from our TCT acquisition, organic growth across all 4 of our business segments and increased sales of our new products, such as Dimensions and MyoSure. Our guidance assumes constant foreign-currency rates with the end of Q1 '12 this quarter. We expect gross margins of approximately 62% to 62.5% on a non-GAAP basis. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $150 million to $155 million or approximately 32% to 33% of revenue, which is slightly higher on a sequential basis from Q1, as the expected increase in R&D expenses from various clinical trials, some of which were pushed out from Q1, will offset the usual sequential decline we see in Q2 in sales and marketing expenses. ","We expect non-GAAP interest expense to be approximately $10 million, excluding $19 million of noncash interest expense related to our convertible. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 34% and we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be approximately $0.33 on diluted shares outstanding of $267 million. We are guiding to EPS slightly below that of our first quarter due to the timing of the clinical trial costs we expected to cure in Q1 that will now cure in Q2. ","For fiscal 2012, which ends on September 29, we are reaffirming our total revenue guidance range of $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion, which represents growth of approximately 6% to 8%. This guidance reflects our expectations that, first, Breast Health will grow in the mid- single digits, led by Dimensions and breast biopsy; and second, Diagnostics will grow in the high single digits, led by TCT and Cervista HPV; and third, GYN Surgical will grow in the high single digits, led by MyoSure and a rebound in NovaSure. ","We expect contributions from our 3 fiscal 2001 acquisitions to account for approximately 200 basis points of the total top line growth. We are guiding to non-GAAP gross margins of 61.5% and 62.5% for the year. The key driver to future margin improvement is the expected increase in revenues. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be $590 million to $600 million, up approximately 5% to 7% from fiscal 2011. This reflects the additional costs primarily associated with the full year of TCT, Healthcome and Interlace. We are expecting interest expense to be approximately $42 million, excluding $79 million of noncash interest expense related to our convert. We are expecting a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%, and we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.01 to a range of $1.36 to $1.38, which implies growth of 8% to 10% year-over-year. We expect 269 million of diluted shares outstanding for the year. We remain mindful of the various economic headwinds and best continue to be fairly conservative with our guidance. At the same time, we do expect to grow all 4 of our operating segments. Looking into the remainder of FY '12, we are optimistic that many of our new products, such as tomo, MyoSure, Cervista and several others that Rob mentioned, along with our expanding international presence in China, will all contribute meaningfully to our performance. ","Turning to the cash flow guidance. We are reaffirming our free cash flow expectation of approximately $400 million to $425 million, which continues to be driven primarily by our operating earnings. As you're aware, capital expenditures are not a big part of our business and we are expecting steady CapEx of $50 million and depreciation of approximately $65 million for the year. ","And in summary, we are encouraged by the strong start to the year as we see contributions to growth from each of our business segments. We expect this to continue fueled by increased contributions from our recent acquisitions, our expansion into international markets and the opportunity 3D tomo presents as the replacement market develops and tomo becomes recognized as the standard of care. ","And with that, let me turn the call back to Rob.","Robert A. Cascella","Yes. Thank you, Glenn. Just to close, we're very confident that we have one of the finest product portfolios in the company's history today. And although there are many external challenges that remain, we believe Hologic's poised for sustained growth over the next 5 years. I want to remind everyone about the upcoming ECR in March and thank you for your participation on this call. We'll now be pleased to answer all of your questions. ","And operator, you can open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Amit Bhalla from Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I wanted to just ask you a question, Rob, on leverage for the rest of the year. I think you've talked about in the past that if you could grow the top line 6%, you could see some real leverage in the business. This quarter, you grew 9% and the outlook looks pretty stable from here on out. So can you comment on your latest views on earnings leverage?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, we'll hold to some of the estimates that we gave out earlier relative to, I think, once we cross over that 6% revenue growth or top line growth. Because not all of our expenses are variable, we start reaping the benefits at a much higher rate. So this quarter was a pretty strong top line growth at 9% and what we saw was a strong revenue -- or earnings benefit as a result of that. Now, as Glenn indicated, some of that was due to the fact that we had a deferral of some of our clinical expenses, but the -- a good 50% of that overage was because of just an operating benefit.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just my follow-up is on the Surgical business. So you've made no change to your guidance of high single-digit growth. And I know you're expecting the second half of the year to be stronger, but you're also going to face some tougher comps in the Surgical business in the back half. So why not change that growth guidance at this point because you have to be growing well into the double digits to beat it?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, Dave, you're in for that.","David P. Harding","Yes. I guess when you look at our business with NovaSure, there's 2 key things that you want to look at. The first is where we have lost some share over the last couple of quarters when we launched the MyoSure product and some of the peripheral accounts. Now that we've got the sales reps on, we've got them through training, we see a regained focus on these smaller accounts to make sure that not only are we bringing them MyoSure but we're keeping -- we're growing the NovaSure business there. I think more importantly, something that Rob talked about were the IMS visits. As you probably are aware, IMS tracks about 640 different codes, and the 3 that we really pay attention to are total OB\/GYN visits, which are women going into an OB\/GYN for any kind of visit at all. The second is really annual exams and the third is excessive menstrual bleeding visits. We've typically seen that excessive menstrual bleeding visit number going down over prior quarters and the business has kind of tracked with that. Now that we see an increase there and we couple that with the more sales force that we've put in place, I think we've got some strong catalyst for growth in that business. And that's why we didn't revise the guidance there.","Operator","And next we'll take our question from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies Group.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple on Diagnostics and one on NovaSure to follow-up. You mentioned just on NovaSure a second-half recovery kind of baked in there as well. So I'm wondering if that does not develop, at what point do you kind of reconsider the DTC program for that product line? And then on Cervista, can you just explain, with HTA now approved, how you avoid the potential cannibalization of the ThinPrep business now that you're selling both offerings?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, sure. I think with respect to NovaSure, Steve, why don't you give some color on that?","Steven Williamson","As far as the DTC program goes, we have really revisited it. We've changed it from getting out there and just getting information into these women's hands to focusing on conversion tactics, so getting those women to actually take action based on the information that they've received. I think this is probably one of the key contributing factors to this IMS growth rate that you've seen. Now these women have been given information. They've been told and shown how to take action and then they've taken that and they're going to the doctor and we're seeing that in the IMS visits. So we don't think that that's all going to pour through to us. We have some pharmaceutical and non-GEA competition out there, but I think this change in tactics is starting to pay off for us. And that's what we're expecting to see moving forward.","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, and as far as the dynamics between our HPV business with HTA and our ThinPrep business, we think there's a long way to go with HPV. I think initially, certainly there's going to be a greater rate of co-testing and potentially an interval expansion. We have not seen that thus far and I think it's because we're coming off of a couple of very, very low years or eroded years. I think, over time, over the long term and let's say that's a 3- to 5-year period, yes, we would believe that in addition to the market growing in HPV that we'll see interval expansion and some pricing compression on our cytology business. We are not seeing that today and we do not anticipate seeing that in a meaningful way throughout '12.","Operator","We'll now go to Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just thinking about some of the data you guys presented or that was presented by Mass General and, also on others at RSNA, can you talk to the degree to which the improved sensitivity that's representative of the data that has been kind of replicated in the field? I know you're hearing this from a lot of the early adopters. You also talked about having a broader set of early tomo adapters, but to what degree are they reporting improved sensitivity that we've seen in the data thus far?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, anecdotally -- and I'll let Peter comment as well, but anecdotally, I think it clearly supports what the clinical trials have suggested and that we are hearing from sites all over the country, if not the world, about increased sensitivity or higher detection. Peter, you may want to add?","Peter K. Soltani","No, I would agree with that, that we're seeing fairly similar results really globally at all of our sites. But again, right now, it's a little bit anecdotal of [indiscernible].","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And how much of that is a focus to your discussions with payers?","Robert A. Cascella","It will clearly be a significant element of the arguments and positions that we present. I think the 2 pieces of our payer justification will be higher sensitivity or detection and also savings from a reduction in recall. So we're finding that these prospective trials that are being done certainly support higher sensitivity or detection and we have continued to promote the fact that there is a reduction in recall. So it is both elements that I think will be important to payers.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then my follow-up on the China opportunity, you've put some numbers out there. Can you just help us think about how we should think about box numbers for Serenity in China? Are we talking hundreds? Or I mean, how do you think about the opportunity over the next couple of years for box placements?","David P. Harding","Yes, this is David Harding. I think it's a little bit premature to give real specifics there, but I think in a couple of years' time, it should be in the hundreds for sure. We'll start it out relatively slow this year, certainly less than 100 for the remainder of this fiscal, but we hope to see that ramp very rapidly in strong double digits over time.","Operator","We'll now go to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick one on the gross margin. It looked like your fiscal '12 guidance was 61.5% to 62.5%. You just put up 62.5% with increasing revenue for the rest of the year. I guess, what would bring the gross margin line down outside of mix?","Glenn P. Muir","Yes, it is the mix though, Jayson. That is primarily what will affect it. So when we look at Q2, and the reason we guided down slightly for Q2 from where ended up on Q1 was the belief that Breast Health was going to have a stronger quarter than Q1. And the Breast Health margins, I mean, we're talking mid-50% type of gross margins versus the over 70% that we have on the Diagnostic disposable products. So the mix shift is the biggest contributor. But if we are successful in driving that top line revenue, that also is going to help us hit more the top end of that range.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up for clarification, Dimensions, you mentioned 62% in digital product revenue, which looks like it's about, let's call it, $48 million. This doesn't include the upgraded software, is that correct?","Glenn P. Muir","The 62% does include, on a revenue basis, the upgraded software. So as we look at Dimensions, which is 62% of that total, that includes both 2D and 3D, so that includes the tomo as well. And of the 3D that we're selling today, we're only converting 15% to 20% of those are really upgrades of a pre-existing Dimensions unit. So that's been slow the last few quarters. That was not where the initial focus was on 3D, it was selling new systems, but we are beginning to see an increase in that software upgrade as well.","Operator","And next we'll go to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","William Carlile - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Bill Carlile, on for David Lewis. Looking at your tomo penetration and the targeted set of centers that you've been guiding us to for a while, you're in the 500 to 700 early adopters, and now you're mentioning that there are some centers beyond that set that are starting to adopt tomo. And maybe could you clarify about what percent of the tomo placements that you're getting right now stand outside that set of 500 to 700 centers?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes. I think when we look at it, and I want to also be clear because we're seeing a difference in what the definition of an early adopter is. I don't think we're seeing incremental sites, so I first want to make that statement. And if we do look at the difference between research university type versus community hospital, imaging center, it's about 50:50 today in terms of the profile of the current buyer. And I think the part that is maybe different, too, that is a bit of a surprise is, in university setting, and although that was what we believed our first target market is, I think they are struggling because they don't always know how to integrate a tomo unit into their practice where the imaging centers are doing it at a much faster rate because they see the commercial value in it. So that's where we may be trading off some of the research university type customers with private imaging centers over this very near-term period of time since we've introduced a product.","William Carlile - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And has this dynamics really taken place over the entire course of the tomo roll out? Or has it accelerated, I guess, since data came out at RSNA?","Robert A. Cascella","That's a good question, Peter, I don't know if we have that kind of information, but what is...","Peter K. Soltani","So I mean, first of all, it's too soon after RSNA, but I would say it's been roughly about the same. I don't think there has been any particular trend one way or the other.","Operator","And Sara Michelmore from Brean Murray has our next question.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Yes. I just wanted to clarify your comments on the timing of this Oslo study. So it sounds like in 12,000 patients, that's essentially half the patients, the target patients have been screened at that point. Do you need that study to be entirely complete to have the data you need? What's the timeframe in which you could receive some of that data? And is that still the study you think is the most important as you go out and try to talk to payers about reimbursement?","Peter K. Soltani","Sure, this is Peter, yes. When we spoke with Dr. Scott, who's the PI on the study at RSNA, his goal was to try to publish the data from the halfway point, which was roughly around 12,000, 13,000 patients. So we're hopeful that he will still do that sometime, say, in the next 6 months or so. And just as a reminder, it is a collaboration with folks at UPMC at Pittsburgh. So we do expect that that data will have tremendous value, both in the U.S. as well as outside of the U.S. So, yes, it will be a factor in our reimbursement efforts.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a clarification, Rob. You'd talked about that reimbursement may not be as big a gating factor in some of these early adopters as you might've thought. How important do you think the reimbursement is at this point? Can you just give us your updated thoughts on is this really what you need to have an inflection point? Or have your thoughts evolved on that?","Robert A. Cascella","Sure. Over all, in the broadest of assessments, yes, reimbursement is going to be necessary in order to get into the far reaches of the mammography installed base. I think over this period that we are now living through, which is this pre-reimbursement 2-year cycle, it is not reimbursement that is the factor that's causing either the acceleration or non-acceleration of the product. It is much more related to customers getting comfortable with the clinical validation and we think that's happening every day. And two, as more and more sites buy tomo and we're in about 38 or 40 states today with it, it is creating a competitive dynamic in state and city or in community, which in and of itself is driving further adoption. So we think those 2 elements of the tomo rollout is what's more important today than even reimbursement.","Operator","And our next question will come from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum.","Matthew Hewitt - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Just there's been some companies that are selling a little bit more capital equipment centric products that have been a little bit more conservative with their guidance from the year. And obviously, you've just put up a very strong first quarter. It sounds like you expect that to continue given the adoption. But meanwhile, you've had Moody's and both S&P are talking about some of the hospitals and their outlooks being negative. I'm just wondering how you balance the 2 sets. You've got strong growth and conversion versus issues at hospitals, sorry.","Robert A. Cascella","And it was a little bit of a comment that I made during my script that we don't think the traditional capital spending trends always apply when there is a new successor technology, which has the potential to obsolete that, which is the incumbent technology, but what ends up happening as a result is that there is an urgency in buying it because it is better. It may be clinically is better, from a marketing draw, it's better. So there are monies that would be rationed towards this new technology where perhaps those same dollars would not chase after the upgrade of a new ultrasound platform, the upgrade of a new MRR platform or a CT platform, because ostensibly, you're really just -- you're getting a very measured level of improved functionality where this is a displacement technology, and as a result of that, it is garnering more dollars. So our level of confidence is, I want to say, we've seen this kind of trajectory in the days of digital and we believe that the benefits of tomo are far more compelling over digital than digital was to analog. And that's what's giving us a sense of early confidence.","Operator","We will now take a question from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted just to probe a little bit more on tomosynthesis. Just going through the numbers, I think you had mentioned 27% penetration of that initial market in last quarter, I think 20%. And so just given the RSNA conference and that sort of tailwind you've got, what are the expected -- maybe a little bit of an acceleration greater than you saw. So maybe if you could just help give us a view of the backhaul you've got -- you have in that business exiting the quarter. And then maybe an addition to that, give us a sense of what the impact to gross margins was from your tomo mix just given how big it is now.","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I'll take a crack at the issue of RSNA. I think as Peter said earlier, we're coming off RSNA, which was literally in the month that we were closing the quarter. So trying to see some strong activity that results from the RSNA interest probably isn't practical to think that Q1 was going to be the quarter that we would see that. As a matter of fact, I mean, as people get excited and budget dollars are reallocated, I mean, it is clearly a 3- to 6-month selling cycle. So I think we're seeing great interest and a lot of activity, but realistically, it's not like just turning the light switch on. It is going to take a few months to get that momentum behind the products.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, and if I could just kind of follow-up on that question about gross margins. You guys had obviously got a reasonable amount of mix in your Breast Health business now coming from tomo. So what impact has that had on your improvement year-over-year for gross margins? Can you maybe quantify how much that helped?","Glenn P. Muir","Yes, Isaac, I mean, I don't think there's an easy answer to try to quantify the actual gross margin amount from tomo. It clearly contribute to the higher gross margin. So Dimensions themselves, those 2D or 3D units, they themselves are at a considerably higher price point than the Selenia unit, which we're now moving away from. So that's giving us the first push forward. And just to repeat, to us, selling Dimensions is really the key whether it's 2D or 3D, because we do believe that in the future, every Dimension out there is going to upgrade to 3D to be able to offer the tomo capability. So it is all contributing in a positive way to hitting that 62.5%, but it's pretty difficult to quantify this quarter exactly what the percent was. There's a lot of mix between the disposable products and the capital equipment side, but it will be significant. The tomo margins are considerably better than the older Selenia margins, which are under 50%.","Operator","We'll now go to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. First off, Rob, you're talking more positively about utilization trends, really not in just one product category but across a couple of them. And you also just speak consensus, not on the other hand touching toppling guidance. So I guess, first question, what do we need to see or I guess what are you perhaps maybe more comfortable with in terms of the business in order to bump that number up?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I mean, it's a great question and I would say, look, this is the first quarter of our fiscal year. We're comfortable that we saw some very positive results. We also saw, I think, a bit of a recovery relative to utilization ends and it's across a couple of product lines, as you indicate. It was just a little early for us to feel as if we wanted to up our guidance on the top line at this point in time. I think we saw it on the -- obviously, we passed our earnings benefit through for the year, but I think as this year unfolds, we'll get much more confident about -- relative to revising our revenue forecast.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then as a follow-up, if we think about the HPV space, Rob, we got a couple of new competitors here over the past couple of quarters. What are you seeing, if anything, in terms of average ASPs?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I think the segment of the market that we're playing in has been fairly insulated. It's the low- to mid-tier lab. I think where we're going to see some more aggressive pricing is in the higher volume labs. And I think that's a market that we're now going after, but it is clearly incremental revenue for us. So I know I won't anticipate margin erosion for us, but I do believe the AEPs are going to be lower than what they've been historically.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Rich Newitter from Leerink Swann.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just one on tomo. Glenn, you had mentioned that you're happy, of course, to sell a 2D that's 3D capable or the full thing all in and activated. Can you break down for us maybe what the mix is of the actual systems that are being placed that are fully activated? Is it most of them kind of coming in and being used or people kind of just waiting to see and getting ready to turn it on at some point in the future?","Glenn P. Muir","Yes, below the -- of the Dimensions unit, the 2D and 3D, which comprise 62% of digital mammography, so the balance being the Selenia systems, which has been a big reversal on one year, so shifting to Dimensions, of that total, less than half are the 3D tomo. So the bulk of the Dimensions today are still going out in the 2D format. So I think what you're seeing happening in the marketplace is there's a lot of interest in having 3D tomo or having the capability of having in the future because of what people are hearing and not wanting to be locked out of the market. So they're moving to the Dimensions 2D to protect that upgrade path.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then just maybe to follow-up on that further, are these mostly customers that were just in the market? They were kind of among the earlier bunch to convert to digital and they're approaching their replacement cycle. Or is there just something else that's driving to make their decision?","Peter K. Soltani","It's Peter. I think it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, there are certainly customers who are in their natural replacement cycle looking to update their equipment and will have sought to get additional funding to move up to 3D. So it does represent sort of the mix.","Operator","And we'll now move on to Bill Bonello from RBC Capital Markets.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Completely switching gears, you guys have almost $800 million of cash on the books now. I'm just curious sort of what it would take for you to rethink your capital allocation policy and perhaps become a little more active or active on share repurchase and maybe, even God forbid, a dividend?","Glenn P. Muir","Yes. Well, Bill, I think I don't know if you can never have too much cash and we're very pleased with that balance. But when we look at our capital deployment strategy itself, I think we'd feel differently if we didn't think that they were tuck-in acquisitions that fit within our distribution and product categories that we might be interested in, in the future. So I think that continues to be a priority, including setting some cash aside for some of the earn outs that we have coming up during the remainder of the fiscal year. So we are still interested in looking at those tuck-ins and we're also interested, number two, in reducing the leverage from our debt, the convertible notes that we have outstanding. And, as you know, we have a piece of that due, a tranche of it due in December 2013. And, I mean, it's clearly far enough away for us to do a lot of different things. But our preference would be to begin to de-leverage a little bit with those notes. So I don't think a share repurchase is out of the question, but I think, at the moment, we believe we can drive a greater return by focusing on some of these tuck-ins. And you know what? We kind of walked through it last time. I mean, when we look at the tuck-ins, number one for us is we look at an IRR, we also look at a payback, we also look at the accretion to the EPS. So all of those factors come into play when we take a look at what we can do in the marketplace.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, I mean, when we think about acquisition strategy, I mean, tuck-in sort of as big as we need to think about, is there any chance that you do something that's a bigger $500 million kind of spend?","Robert A. Cascella","I think we would define a tuck-in by how it fits within the organization so not so much about the price of it or the value that it brings. So it's about a technology that we think we can leverage with our sales and marketing infrastructure and possibly our factories and things like that. So I mean, I think it's maybe a little bit all over the map relative to the appropriate target, the expected rate of return and how well it fits within our existing infrastructure.","Operator","And we'll now go to Thomas Kouchoukos from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Thomas Kouchoukos - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just I think as following on Tycho's question from earlier about the China opportunity with Healthcome, maybe a different way of asking, I think you talked about kind of a gradual ramp out with that Serenity product. I guess another way to ask is, how much market is there today in terms of revenue for that application? And then what do you feel you're losing out on by not having a low-end system in those regions?","David P. Harding","Well, I think it's a little bit premature to say what precisely the size of the China market is. This is David Harding, by the way. The mammography market in China is still really developing. It's at a very nascent stage. And so we feel that we are going to grow with that market. And certainly, as Rob indicated earlier in his comments, we hope that our overall China business will get to a $300 million mark in 5 years. So a good chunk of that will be in the Breast Health space. And we hope that the Serenity product will occupy a large chunk of that. Right now in the other emerging markets, we're really using our value-oriented Selenia offering to capture those things and really take some of that market share. So we don't feel like we're necessarily losing a lot of opportunity right now, but we feel that we can actually accelerate our growth by deploying even more value-oriented Serenity product in the future.","Thomas Kouchoukos - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then one follow up. Just I know it's very early and I think you just rolled this out in January, but on HTA, any anecdotal info you can provide just to how the system's performing and maybe what accounts are thinking at first run at this?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I think it's -- we're pleased with the product relative to its reliability, uptime, its performance. I mean, the FDA approval process was quite rigorous. So we know that it works well and we have a very stable assay now. So we're focusing on some of our existing customers that were using our sample transfer technology that are now going to full automation with the HTA as well as some of the sites that were still under an ASR. So we're -- I mean, it's a limited successes today, but all of the sites that we've installed, the product into today are enjoying good success with it. So it's a lengthy process, as you indicated; long validation times, a lot of extra training and so on and so forth. So I think we'll have probably more to report when we issue our second quarter results.","Operator","And we have time for one more question today and that question will come from Jason Mills from Canaccord.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","A lot of my questions have been asked and answered, so I have a few P&L questions. Glenn, how do you think about your sort of an esoteric line on your P&L, but your tax strategies moving forward over the long term, just given the scale of your business internationally and the growth internationally as well?","Glenn P. Muir","Well, I think, Jason, there is an opportunity for us. We've never taken full advantage of any kind of offshore operation, either manufacturing or with our technology on the R&D side. And as we begin to expand in China, that is one area that we're taking a look at, the technology and transferring some of that to get some benefit. But I think you're probably referring to a 34% tax rate and how do we bring that down a little bit?","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes.","Glenn P. Muir","Yes, and a part of it is 75% of our sales are here in the United States and this is where the majority of our manufacturing is. So it's harder for us to take advantage of some of the other, I think, tax strategies of offshore. But those are the areas for the future.","Jason R. Mills - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And then in the middle of the P&L, I mean, curious to note sort of the growth over the last, say, year or so in the headcount or resources that are applied directly to selling the product, both domestically and internationally, so then how do you see that transforming over the next couple of years with the opportunities you've talked about not only in China but Latin America? Perhaps a need to add to selling resources in those geographies relative to your expectations for the top line growth that could come from those initiatives as well.","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, and I don't think we'd see significant headcount additions in that area. When we talk about infrastructure additions, we're looking at really our own salespeople that would be in country supporting our dealers. So it's a handful of people on a country-by-country basis and they're really defined to assist as sales specialists. So we found that to be very, very successful in different parts of the world and we will continue on with that strategy. But I don't think there's any plan underway that would suggest that we need to add another 200 or 300 salespeople on a global basis at this point.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. That now concludes Hologic's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2012 Earnings Call. Have a good evening."],"10938":["Hologic, Inc.

My name is Eduardo and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.","I would like now to introduce Mr. Mike Watts, Vice President Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Thank you.","Mike Watts","Thank you, Eduardo. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's President Chairman and CEO; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through October -- through August, excuse me, 23rd.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Steve MacMillan","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, our fifth consecutive quarter of strong consistent overall results.","Total revenue of $852.4 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63 were both above our guidance. Similar to recent periods, revenue growth was driven by our largest businesses Molecular Diagnostics and Breast Health and we're also happy that the performance of our Surgical division continues to strengthen. These strong results continue the positive momentum that started to build in our core businesses throughout 2018.","During this time, each of our divisions has made progress to varying degrees on the four strategic levers we can pull to drive growth. Let me touch on each of these to illustrate both the progress we have made and the opportunities ahead.","First, commercial execution in the United States has been our strong suit, enabled by our excellent sales teams and best-in-class products such as our Genius 3D Mammography systems, our Panther molecular diagnostics instrument, our ThinPrep liquid pap test and our MyoSure and NovaSure surgical devices.","Across these core brands, we are executing effectively as we build on our number one market shares, maintain premium pricing, and partner with our customers to drive demand. These products are the foundation for our strategy and overall financial success.","But since we already have high domestic market shares in some lower growth end markets, we need to do more to drive attractive growth. That's where the other three strategic levers come in.","To start, we have worked hard over the last several years to expand into international markets where we have much more headroom to grow shares than we do domestically.","Not long ago some of you may recall that I described our business outside the United States as a startup or said another way, it was basically treated as an export business. Today, thanks to strong leadership and very deliberate efforts to build our channel strength international has emerged as a solid and consistent grower.","Third, we have doubled down on innovation and revitalized our R&D pipelines to build around our core product assets. Today, after several years of significant changes in our R&D capabilities, all of our divisions have established a healthy cadence of innovation for the first time and the results are beginning to benefit our financials.","For example sales of recently launched products totaled more than $180 million in the third quarter. This represented about 21% of our total revenue and grew more than 40% compared to a year ago.","And fourth to supplement our organic growth, we have announced three tuck-in acquisitions over the last year all built around our Breast Health core to further diversify our revenue and enable us to operate across the continuum of patient care. Given the strength of our cash flows and balance sheet, we believe these smaller deals will be an important part of our future growth and hopefully not just in Breast Health.","With that introduction let's discuss our third quarter results in more detail. Revenue of $852.4 million grew 4.7% in constant currency ahead of our expectations. Within this the acquired Faxitron and Focal businesses contributed $12.8 million to revenue and we are off to a good start with these deals.","Excluding sales from our divested blood screening business which declined in the third quarter, revenue of $838.2 million grew 5.3% in constant currency. This was an acceleration of 30 basis points sequentially compared to our second quarter growth rate.","In terms of geography, domestic sales of $642.5 million increased a healthy 4.2% in the third quarter. Excluding our divested Blood Screening business again U.S. growth would have been 5.0% accelerating for the fourth consecutive quarter.","Our largest franchises Molecular Diagnostics and Breast Health once again led the charge as we continue to build around our Panther and Genius installed bases. Additionally, we are also pleased to see our U.S. Surgical business improve again continuing the steady progress that began early last year.","Outside the United States, sales of $209.9 million increased 6.2% in constant currency. This was a solid performance, but growth was a little slower than the recent quarters mainly due to macroeconomic and political challenges in our small Latin American business which is mostly Breast Health.","Excluding Latin America, OUS growth would have been about 200 basis points higher. More broadly total Diagnostics and Surgical both grew low double digits outside the United States and Medical Aesthetics returned to growth as well.","Now let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Let's start with our biggest business Breast Health where underlying trends remain strong. Global Breast Health sales finished inline with our expectations in the third quarter and totaled $325.4 million, a solid increase of 6.7% against a tough prior year comparable.","As we have said many times before, our Breast Health division today is much steadier and more diversified than it ever has been with innovative market-leading products across the continuum of patient care and around the globe.","In terms of geography, domestic sales drove Breast Health growth in the quarter with revenue increasing a very strong 8.9%. OUS Breast Health sales declined by 1.5%. This was driven mainly by the challenges in Latin America that I mentioned earlier as well as the annualization of some prior year tender wins and order timing.","In terms of subsegments, imaging sales grew 6.1% while interventional sales increased 9.5% as we focus on selling our growing portfolio. In imaging, sales of our Genius 3D systems increased strongly driven by our new 3Dimensions and 3D Performance gantries.","These innovative new products have now clearly established themselves at the heart of our capital portfolio. Other new products including Intelligent 2D, Clarity HD and SmartCurve also contributed nicely to imaging growth as did revenue from our acquired Faxitron business.","In interventional our third quarter results benefited from our focus on portfolio selling as well as revenue from our acquired Focal business. These positives more than offset a headwind from lower Brevera sales due to the supply constraints we have previously discussed.","Before I turn to Diagnostics, I want to spend a minute on our pending acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine or SSI a French innovator in cart-based ultrasound technology. This tuck-in deal is very consistent with our capital deployment goals. It's fairly small at an enterprise value of roughly $85 million and leverages our existing call points.","It's also expected to be accretive to our revenue growth rate, albeit with some slight dilution to EPS in the near term. We have wanted to expand in ultrasound for a while as the technology is used across the full continuum of Breast Health patient care.","We had previously done a small distribution deal to sell the Viera portable ultrasound scanner and acquiring SuperSonic Imagine will enable us to further enter the larger cart-based market which has been growing at a high single-digit rate.","Having evaluated several targets in this space over the past few years, we believe that SSI's newest product the Aixplorer MACH 30 represents best-in-class technology highlighted by excellent image quality. So SSI will support our reputation for providing clinically-differentiated products.","The MACH 30 is used as a supplement to mammography for screening women with dense breasts and also to help guide biopsies and surgeries. Importantly, less than 15% of SSI's revenue is generated in the United States which provides an excellent opportunity to leverage our strong domestic sales channel.","Over time we are hopeful that the MACH 30 can develop into a platform a bit like Genius, one that enjoys significant clinical differentiation and onto which we can layer software and hardware upgrades.","From a process perspective, we expect to purchase about 46% of SSI's shares in the next few days. This will enable us to obtain Board seats and give us a controlling interest in the company. Then we will file a cash tender offer to acquire the remaining shares and hopefully close the deal in the first quarter of our fiscal 2020.","Now let's turn to Diagnostics, where revenues of $305.4 million increased a strong 5.1% in the quarter. Excluding sales from our divested Blood Screening business which declined in the quarter, Diagnostics revenue increased an even better 7.1%. Molecular remains the growth driver here based on the productivity of our R&D team which has now earned U.S. clearances in 11 consecutive quarters and the sophistication of our lab and physician-based sales teams.","In the quarter, worldwide molecular sales of $170.9 million grew 11.7%, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth despite a challenging prior year comp. Internationally, molecular grew 22.1%, well into the double digits for the 12th time in 13 quarters. Although international is a small piece of our total molecular franchise, we are seeing very strong performance there. And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories, molecular sales still grew 9.4%. This reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers especially our largest ones to drive volumes and better patient care in established testing categories.","In terms of product, molecular growth was broad-based in the quarter as customers consolidated testing on our large installed base of fully automated Panther instruments. Sales of our largest Aptima women's health assays for chlamydia gonorrhea, HPV and trichomonas all increased solidly. In addition although sales of new Diagnostics products are still relatively small, they more than doubled in the quarter led by our quantitative viral load tests and by Panther Fusion.","Moving on Cytology and perinatal sales were $120.3 million in the third quarter, a small increase of 1.3%. Cytology sales increased slightly all outside the United States while perinatal sales were flat. In the United States, growth in the cytology market remains challenged due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals. Elsewhere in Diagnostics revenue related to our divested Blood Screening business was higher than expected at $14.2 million although this decreased by 23.7% compared to last year.","As a reminder, this revenue mainly reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements we have with Grifols. We expect Blood Screening revenue will total about $10 million in the fourth quarter and decline further to about $30 million for our 2020 fiscal year.","Before we discuss GYN Surgical let me mention our leadership transition in Diagnostics. As you probably know Tom West accepted a CEO position at another company in June. We are happy for Tom and even more excited that Kevin Thornal has succeeded him as President of our Diagnostics division. As many of you know, Kevin led our European Breast Health turnaround a few years ago and guided Cynosure through a difficult stabilization process. He has a great track record of strengthening businesses, so he will fit well with our already strong Diagnostics leadership team. The division is performing well today and we believe Kevin's fresh leadership will accelerate the progress we have already made especially in business development.","Now let's shift gears and cover GYN Surgical where sales of $112.2 million increased 5.2%, our fastest growth in eight quarters. This continues a steady cadence of improvement under new leadership since the business bottomed in the first quarter of 2018. Thanks to a strengthening sales force. MyoSure continues to be a healthy grower and we have built on this foundation by introducing new related products such as our Fluent Fluid Management System and our Omni Hysteroscope. And we are excited that more new products are on the way based on increased efforts in both internal development and licensing.","Now let's turn to Medical Aesthetics where sales of $85 million represented about 10% of consolidated revenue and declined 5.5%. Despite this decline we saw additional signs of improvement for the second consecutive quarter. Our U.S. sales force stabilized and posted its third consecutive quarter of sequential growth under the leadership of Eric Anderson who has now replaced Kevin as President of the division. And OUS sales grew at a low single-digit rate after four consecutive quarters of declines. So we still have a long way to go at Cynosure, we believe we are beginning to find our footing.","To round out the revenue discussion briefly, skeletal sales of $24.4 million grew 9.8% based on solid growth of our DXA systems for bone density and body composition testing.","So to wrap up, our third quarter results represent our fifth consecutive quarter of good performance. Building on our market leading brands in the United States especially in Breast Health and Diagnostics, we are expanding internationally, churning out new products from our revitalized R&D pipelines and effectively integrating tuck-in acquisitions while looking for more.","Overall we are executing well, but know that we have many more opportunities still ahead of us, which gives us confidence in our future.","Now let me turn the call over to Karleen.","Karleen Oberton","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2019 as well as the fourth quarter. Unless otherwise noted my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency.","As Steve described, we are pleased with our third quarter results as revenue of $852.4 million and EPS of $0.63 exceeded our guidance. We benefited from strong performance by our largest businesses Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, as well as improved results in our Surgical division. Both operating and net margins improved, reversing recent trends.","We also deployed capital in accordance with our strategic priorities by agreeing to acquire SuperSonic and by repurchasing $50 million of stock. Our overall performance has been very solid through three quarters of the fiscal year and as a result, we are tweaking our financial guidance upward despite an incremental foreign exchange headwind.","With that introduction, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the third quarter. Gross margins of 61.6% decreased 100 basis points compared to the prior year period. This was primarily due to the strong U.S. dollar, trade tariffs in China, product sales mix especially related to Cynosure's performance and increased service costs.","Compared to the second quarter of 2019, however, gross margins did improve sequentially by about 60 basis points as some of the one-time headwinds we mentioned last quarter dissipated, but the FX headwind got worse.","Looking ahead, we expect better margins in the fourth quarter due to improved product mix, absorption benefits, the ramp of new product sales and our ongoing cost reduction efforts.","Moving on. Total operating expenses of $276.4 million decreased 0.9% in the third quarter. However, excluding Faxitron and Focal, operating expenses declined 3.9%, reflecting strong discipline -- expense discipline especially in G&A. But as Steve said we remain fully committed to funding internal innovation and our R&D pipeline has never been more productive than it is today.","Based on improvements in the top-line and strong operating discipline, operating margin of 29.2% increased by 40 basis points in the third quarter. Operating margin also improved sequentially to our best level since the first quarter of 2018.","Other expenses net totaled $28.8 million in the third quarter, 11.4% less than a year ago as benefits from our currency hedges outweighed higher interest expense. Given the strengthening U.S. dollar, we expect similar hedge gains in the fourth quarter. Our currency hedges will reset as we move into 2020, theoretically eliminating any gains if currency stay constant.","Finally, net margin of 20.1% increased 80 basis points compared to the prior year period, our best result since the first quarter of 2017. In addition to better operating margins and lower other expenses, we also had a slightly lower effective tax rate.","Overall our net profitability remains very healthy. All this led to non-GAAP net income of $171.6 million in the third quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63, which exceeded our guidance.","Now I'll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. In the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock for $50 million, helping reduce our shares outstanding and boosting EPS. As of quarter end, we had a little more than $210 million remaining on our buyback authorization. Since 2016 we have put our strong cash flows to work, buying back more than 24.6 million shares of stock for $926 million, which has been a great investment and use of our capital. This doesn't even include the cash we used to retire convertible debt that was in the money.","As we cleaned up our balance sheet, we also lowered our overall leverage ratio, which stood at 2.5 times at the end of the third quarter. We remain comfortable around this level, recognizing that the ratio could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity.","Finally, we generated $138 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. Our strongest cash flow enables us to simultaneously pursue tuck-in acquisitions, while also acting on our share repurchase authorization.","Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. As a reminder, our updated guidance does not include the impact of our pending acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine. Based on our good third quarter results, we are increasing our constant currency revenue guidance slightly and raising the low end of our EPS forecast.","Let's start with revenue. As a reminder, we previously guided to sales of $3.325 billion to $3.345 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 4.3% and 4.9%. Based on our third quarter results, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $3.335 billion to $3.350 billion, which includes approximately $50 million of revenue from our divested blood screening business.","Based on recent exchange rates, our new revenue guidance translates into constant currency growth of 4.7% to 5.2%. This is better than our last forecast and much better than our initial 2019 guidance, which called for growth of 2.8% to 4.2%.","For modeling purposes, let me remind you that U.S. dollar has strengthened materially compared to our prior fiscal year. In fact, based on recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency fluctuations will reduce reported revenue by roughly $36 million in fiscal 2019. This is an incremental headwind of more than $5 million relative to our previous guidance.","Despite this, we feel confident about growth in our core businesses and our ability to control expenses. As a result, we are raising the low end of our EPS guidance slightly. We now expect EPS of $2.42 to $2.44 for the year, which represents reported growth of between 8.5% and 9.4%. This is better than our initial 2019 EPS guidance, which was $2.38 to $2.42, even as we have absorbed the net effect of a worsening currency headwind and made reinvestments for future growth.","This updated full year guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of about 272 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $834 million to $849 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year period this reflects growth of 3.5% to 5.3% on a constant currency basis.","On a reported basis, our guidance reflects revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.4%. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.64 to $0.66 in the fourth quarter, which implies very strong growth of between 10.3% and 13.8%. Obviously, this is higher quarterly EPS growth than earlier in the year just based on the timing of revenue and expenses.","As a reminder, our fourth quarter of 2019 has one fewer selling day than the prior year period, although this occurred over the Independence Day holiday, so we don't expect a significant impact. Also recall that Medical Aesthetics revenue is always seasonally weaker in the summer months. And finally, as Steve mentioned we expect blood screening revenue to decline from the third quarter level.","As you update your forecasts we encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges, as we have tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate recent foreign exchange rates as well as potential upsides and downsides.","Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2019 with Molecular Diagnostics and the Breast Health driving solid growth and Surgical strengthening. These businesses along with our international franchises are well positioned to drive future growth given the strategies we have in place.","Both operating and net margin improved in the quarter and we continue to put our strong cash flows to work through tuck-in acquisitions and share repurchases. Based on all this we are raising our annual revenue and EPS guidance slightly.","With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right. We'll take our first question from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar ","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter here. Congratulations, Steve. And just two quick ones, Steve. Maybe one on \u2013 maybe I'll start with the Breast Health, right? This really was strong. I'm just curious on what drove this. CapEx environment seems to be really strong. So was this more of the strong CapEx environment that you're seeing, or you had some FDA regulation on dense breasts. Are you seeing some uplift from there? And maybe could you also comment on how the order book is shaping up on the Breast Health side?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Vijay. I think the capital \u2013 certainly capital spending looks pretty good in hospitals right now. We continue to feel good about that. I do think that 3D, it's hard to put an exact number on what the breast density legislation is, but we are certainly able to have conversations that nobody else can, with the customers as they're gearing up to make purchases.","And just as a reminder for people, we are the only 3D that has an FDA indication approved for dense breasts. And as there's more and more legislation driving towards disclosing dense breasts \u2013 breast density, it clearly plays to our advantage. So I think we feel like we've been certainly winning and we're on the leading edge of the technology there. So it's just a good place to be and our team is continuing to get better and better, at really selling the overall value proposition that comes with the best product in the market. To your second piece on the order trends, we don't get too far ahead, but I would say orders continue to look good for us.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. And I would just add kind of beyond the gantry activity in the capital environment, I think our teams are continuing to come up building that capability and selling the portfolio of products as well as continuing growth in our service revenue.","Vijay Kumar","Just to add onto that Steve. If you piece in all the different elements execution has gotten better. It was good to see some of the laggards Aesthetics and GYN turn the corner. And you're layering on this up, tuck-in deals that you've done which will annualize next year. Are we now at a place where Hologic can lay claim to being a mid-single growth asset? Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Vijay. I think we feel really good. When you consider \u2013 Pete Valenti we are with him. Obviously, he's been running our Breast Health business for five years right now. He's reminding us that the first strategic plan inherited it showed the traditional old days of growth curve and it would have been a decelerating, or really a declining business in 2018, 2019. I want to get \u2013 we want to be careful not to get too far ahead of ourselves on exactly where we are.","We want to just keep putting numbers on the board. I think candidly, we were trying to chase some numbers a few years ago, and I think we got a little ahead of ourselves trying to proclaim where we are. I think at the end of the day, let the numbers keep speaking for themselves, and getting back to strong execution in our markets, and I think we'll show where we fit there. So thank you.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks, guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Chris Lin","Hey, good afternoon. This is Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve in your prepared remarks you mentioned that customers are consolidating molecular diagnostics assays onto Panther and that it has been a driver of growth. Could you just elaborate a bit more on that comment? Specifically, are customers consolidating women's health and virology assays onto Panther?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. It's bits of both. What \u2013 primarily, it's just continuing to expand our growing women's health assays. As we mentioned, we got 11 straight quarters of FDA clearances in the United States. And I'd say truthfully, it's probably a little bit more of still getting more women's health stuff as the women's health line is expanded and to some degree certainly the virology kicking-in. But yeah, I think the way to think about our Panthers and the assays it's sort of this wonderful gift that keeps giving every quarter.","We keep placing more Panthers in the labs. And every quarter each Panther that we have is generally doing more revenue. So we have sort of a force multiplier here of more of an installed base and then more menu coming through. And it's a combination of more of the women's health plus some virals, and just really continuing to build. And that's what's driving \u2013 you got nine \u2013 almost 9.5% growth in the United States, where its strong market shares already.","Karleen Oberton","Yeah. And I would just add to what Steve said the elements that he talked about the ability to add menu on the Panther, it's also the value proposition for our customers that as we expand our menu, they get more leverage out of the Panther. And I think that's \u2013 a lot of what we're seeing is the value that customers see in the Panther.","Chris Lin","Okay. And can I just go back to revenue guidance? You beat fiscal Q3 revenue guidance by about $20 million, but you only increased full year guidance by about $7 million to $8 million. Looks like FX is an incremental $5 million headwind. So this would imply that you reduced underlying full year guidance by about $5 million to $10 million. So could you just help us bridge the revenue guidance a bit more? Thank you.","Karleen Oberton","Yeah. And so I might just look at it a little different way. If you looked at our second half of the year guidance from our last guide, we're at the midpoint to where we are now. It has increased overall for the second half of the year, while absorbing the incremental FX. So, again, I think the original guidance at Q3 that we gave in prior quarter would have indicated extremely high fourth quarter. We're pleased with how Q3 went and pleased that overall we've raised the second half of the year revenue guide.","Chris Lin","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Anthony in for Raj. So maybe just a couple on the SuperS deal and maybe just a little bit more detail on expected revenue contribution next year and maybe a little bit on the growth profile of that asset and just the underlying margin profile of that business as we move into fiscal 2020? And then I'll have a quick follow-up on Diagnostics. Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure Anthony. Until we close that deal, we're going to avoid getting too far into the details. But we think, generally they did about in the high $20-ish million in revenue in 2018 and it's growing at what looks to be a low double-digit rate. So as we consolidate that and ultimately once we close on the deal, we'll give a little more information.","But I think as we're thinking about at the highest level, it'll drop in $30-ish plus million of revenue at some point. We don't have it -- we won't have it probably fully closed until our first quarter as we talked about, but feel really good about its underlying growth rate and frankly the technology itself.","And as a big reminder most of their revenue right now is outside the United States. So it brings us nice revenue there and our U.S. sales force is chomping a bit to get their hands on it. So we think it'll be a clear double-digit grower of an exciting new product for us.","Unidentified Analyst","That's very helpful. And just on Diagnostics. Maybe just a little bit on the share front. So certainly sounds that volumes are doing well on the Molecular side. But anything on share just when you consider a number of recent launches around competitors out there whether it be in Europe in the U.S.?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think the way we think about share is our international molecular business grew 22%. Our U.S. business grew over 9%. I think we'll stack that up with pretty much anybody. And ergo I think we're probably growing faster than the market without knowing specific shares.","Mike Watts","Yes. It's Mike, Anthony. I think despite those very high shares in most of the key categories, I think what the team has done a really good job of doing is working with our customers to drive underlying demand and drive testing to guidelines and those kind of things. So that's helped us grow the business even though the shares are already pretty high.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks.","Mike Watts","Thanks Anthony.","Operator","We'll now take the next question from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. Steve GYN Surg you commented steady progress in U.S. Can you just touch on NovaSure and MyoSure? I didn't hear you break those out.","Steve MacMillan","Sure Tycho. I think MyoSure continued to be really strong and I think we stopped giving the Invader piece. I think the way I think about it is MyoSure was still a clearly double-digit grower, feeling great about it. NovaSure is still declining in that probably high singles level. We'd like to be a little bit better. But overall love the trajectory of the business.","Mike Watts","And as a reminder we've introduced some new products there as well between our new fluid management system which is called Fluent and the new Omni Hysteroscope. And those are clearly -- those are related to MyoSure and are clearly helping drive growth as well.","Tycho Peterson","And then on SSI, a couple of things. You got the Clarius deal that you had before for distribution. Curious how those fit together? And then obviously their cart-based system gets used in a lot of markets vascular, gastroenterology other areas. So I'm curious about how you're thinking about some of those kind of nonmammography-based areas?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Our focus is clearly going to be just in the mammography space. So if there's opportunities beyond that we could always partner that or whatever with the technology, but our clear focus will be in the breast area. And I think it's compatible with Viera. So we'll now have both a portable as well as a cart-based option. And frankly, I think to a large degree the cart-based option is going to be the bigger drivers of revenue here. So I think we've been learning more and more about the space and excited to have the chance to really get a cart-based offering that we haven't had. Thanks Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, thanks.","Operator","We'll now take your next question from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jack Meehan","Thank you. Good afternoon. Want to go back to the Breast Health segment, just one modeling. How much was the contribution from Focal and Faxitron in the quarter? Do you break that out? And was also curious the international commentary around Latin America. Just a little bit more color on that and whether do you think that's resolved going in the fourth quarter? Does the fourth quarter guidance assume that stays pressured?","Karleen Oberton","Jack, it's Karleen. So I think from Focal and Faxitron I think we indicated they contributed just over $13 million of revenue in the quarter. When you think about international LatAm is clearly the smallest piece of the Breast Health business but it was down almost 50%. And while we've guided \u2013 well, our guidance assumes a little bit of improvement in Q4 for that business. That will be down as well year-over-year. And I think just in general international Breast Health, we did see some movement of orders from Q3 to Q4 as well as, again, in the prior year period we'd had some large tenders that obviously didn't repeat this year.","Jack Meehan","Great. And then one more follow-up on Breast Health. If I look at the service revenue in the quarter just from the Q the $117 million it looks like that was up about 1% year-over-year. So that slowed down. Just curious if there was anything to call out related to that. And maybe just give us an update in terms of some of the software upgrades and service and just where you think you are in the cycle.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So, I think we -- I think the expectation on service growth is in line with what we see. I think one of the nuances here is as we place new gantries, we have the cycle with customers will go under warranties for a year period and we have a lapse in the service contract revenue until they re-up. So that low single-digit growth is kind of what we expect.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. A couple of -- for Karleen. Karleen, on gross margin was there any downside variance in the quarter besides foreign currency? And if so what was the driver?","Karleen Oberton","Yes. I would say beyond the foreign currency and the tariffs, the other was mix and specifically in Cynosure. So if you think about Q3 last year was what I'd call the height of the women's health product from a comp perspective which those products had a higher gross margin portfolio profile than the rest of the Cynosure business. So I would say that was the second biggest driver and then obviously we mentioned some higher service costs.","Dan Leonard","Okay. And I was specifically trying to focus on downside versus plan as opposed to year-over-year. Is it still the objective? I mean, you've previously thought gross margins would have been only slightly down year-on-year in 2019 and that looks like they'll be down well more than that. Could you address that variance and also talk about being able to defend the gross margin line going forward?","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So, I think from our original guide and what we had talked about for margins, I think that one of the biggest drivers is the increasing strengthening U.S. dollar which has impacted the gross margin line I think coupled with what I've mentioned last quarter. So last quarter we had talked about a number of onetime items, but what is continuing here as well is some higher service costs that we do have teams focused on to improve. But I think what's also equally important is that when you look at our operating income margin and net margin have both improved despite the headwinds we're facing with gross margin which leads to our ability to have strong discipline in our operating expense to still drive results.","Dan Leonard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Dan Macek-Alwell","Great. Thanks. This is Dan on for Bill. I appreciate your comments on utilization within Panther instruments. It sounds like you're working well with customers to drive that figure. How are you thinking about that going forward in terms of utilization? It sounds like it's a growing figure. Thanks.","Mike Watts","Dan, it's Mike. Yes, we try to update that number formerly at the end of our fiscal year. So probably we won't give you a specific number. But I mean your intuition is right. I mean that's generally been growing kind of in the high single-digit range year-over-year that being Panther utilization per box. So there's some good progress there.","Dan Macek-Alwell","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just another one on Molecular to follow up. That's another double-digit quarter. And then, how are you guys thinking about that growth rate heading into the fourth quarter and then maybe over the longer term? I know you've said high single digits, but it's been pretty consistently outperforming. So if you could just touch on that. Thanks you.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think we continue to think about it as a high singles probably lower end of high singles and plan for that and try to deliver a little bit better certainly helps. But we wouldn't be ready to call it a long-term double-digit growth, especially with the competitive environment and everything else. But we feel like we're doing very well there.","Dan Macek-Alwell","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thank you.","Ivy Ma","Hi, this is Ivy Ma on for Derik today. Thank you for taking my question. So I have one on SSI and have a follow-up on Cynosure. So, I know SSI is targeting EBITDA breakeven for the year. Understand that you wanted to be more conservative and guided to slight dilutive for next year, so just wanted to see if there's any additional color or consideration there? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","When we bring it into us, we reported net income, not EBITDA. So on a -- while they may be breakeven on the EBITDA basis, they're losing money on an operating basis. So that's the difference there. And obviously in our hands...","Karleen Oberton","Yes. I don't think we've changed strategically kind of investments or kind of spend habits that they had. It's just as Steve pointed out a different profitability metric.","Mike Watts","I think Ivy, just to remind you, I think what we said in our original press release there that -- was the expectation would be I think less than 1% dilutive for next year or so. We think that's very manageable in the context of the overall P&L.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. And we'll probably in a position when we give guidance for next year to be able to incorporate that in on the next call.","Ivy Ma","And for Cynosure congrats on the launch for the new contouring product recently. Any updated thoughts on outlook for the segment for the rest of the year and next year? Thanks.","A \u2013 Steve MacMillan","Go ahead, Karleen.","Karleen Oberton","I was just going to say that, I think as we looked -- we're happy with the stabilization. Really pleased that we're able to launch the new products, although, I don't think they're going to be big meaningful drivers of growth that currently create some excitement with the sales force. I think as we exit the year, we expect the division to return to growth, but albeit on a much weaker comp. So feel good about where we're at right now.","Ivy Ma","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","And I'll take your next question from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Mason Austen","HI. This is Mason on for David today. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to touch on Surgical. You have a new competitor coming to the market with Cerene. I was just wondering if you could talk about how you think about the competitive dynamics with the segment moving forward with NovaSure and in the next fiscal year. Thanks.","A \u2013 Steve MacMillan","Sure, Mason. Yes. I think we continue to feel good about the direction and the results that we're generating. We've looked at the clinical package for Cerene. As you may know, there's a lot of questions around that company and business and a lot of stuff going on over there. So we just keep focusing on our customers on our innovation and feel good about where we're going.","Mason Austen","Thanks. And on the Brevera supply constraints you referenced this as a weighing on interventional results into the quarter. I was just wondering if you could potentially break that out and potentially provide an update as to when you expect to be back to full supply. Thanks very much.","A \u2013 Steve MacMillan","Yes. We're not going to get into -- the level of impact is fairly small in the grand scheme. But I think, as we've said, we probably really won't be back in the full supply until later on into 2021 -- or fiscal 2020 rather, end of our next fiscal year.","Mason Austen","All right. Thanks very much.","A \u2013 Steve MacMillan","Great.","Operator","And I'll take your next question from Richard Newitter from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","Jaime Morgan","This is Jaime on for Rich. A quick question. So I didn't think I heard you break out any of the subsegment directional commentary on growth within Medical Aesthetics. So I was wondering if you could provide any sort of commentary on the different trends between skin, body and women's health.","A \u2013 Steve MacMillan","At the end of the day, we're not providing the breakouts per se, given the size of the business. But, overall, I'll tell you, skin was up nicely. Women's health was down significantly over last year, because that was little like 12 months ago, almost to the day when the FDA letter came out. So we were doing very well with the women's health line last year at this time and the body segment is down a bit.","Jaime Morgan","Okay, great. And then, just within the U.S. you're saying that you saw some sequential improvement there. So just curious. You guys had mentioned some marketing initiatives that were launched at the beginning of last quarter. Just wondering if some of that is coming from the strength of those marketing initiatives. Thanks for talking my questions.","A \u2013 Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think, it's coming from two things. We feel really good, particularly about the Brooke Shields campaign that we have on SculpSure. There's been a lot of positives on that. And the sales force has really hit a good spot now, where we've got a combination of some great seasoned veterans and frankly most of the leadership of the sales organization, are the long-term veterans of the company the Cynosure, pre before we acquired it supplemented out with a lot of great teams on the ground. So it's a combination really of the marketing and the teams in place and then really focused on bringing a pipeline of new products that'll start to kick in over next year.","Operator","We will now take our last question from Dan Brennan from UBS. Please go ahead.","Dan Brennan","Great. Thanks. Thanks Steve, Karleen and Mike. I guess, I wanted to ask the first question on breast. If you don\u2019t mind, can you just walk us through a little bit about the strength that you're seeing there and kind of segment out kind of the contribution or how we should think about Genius versus the newer gantries' dimensions and profile? Just wondering what the runway is on each of those to sustain this type of growth rate.","A \u2013 Steve MacMillan","Sure. I think, overall, really the 3Dimensions and 3D performance have by far become the bulk of the sale now. So the old days of dimensions 3,000 6,000 9,000, largely given way to the 3D Performance and the 3Dimensions still under the Genius banner. But I think the new products, both high end and a slightly more performance is slightly defeatured on the 3DPerformance, both providing us really good opportunities to both go high end and also the lower end with our customers.","Karleen Oberton","And I would just add from a runaway perspective, I think, we've talked about the overall market penetration from 2D to 3D, as well as our own installed base would give us roughly 3,000 to 6,000 more gantries to convert to 3D and I'd say steady cadence of gantry placements since 2015 about 1,000 per year that gives us nice runway.","Dan Brennan","Thanks for that. And then just one final one. Just on the M&A front. Sounds like tuck-ins are the kind of focus going forward. But just wondering Steve, just remind us to the extent like you were to see something bigger like what's your appetite in terms of size? And maybe any color on the pipeline as it stands today. Thanks a lot.","A \u2013 Steve MacMillan","Sure Dan. I think we're -- while not a stated policy, we're generally thinking, okay, we're generating $600 million to $700 million of free cash a year. Probably not thinking about spending more than that in any given year on acquisition. I think it's kind of a good disciplinary. So that's not a formal policy never to be deviated from, but I think it should frame in kind of the thinking. And I think we're certainly hunting much more in a 100, a couple of hundred million kind of range versus anything that starts with a B. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Noah, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Noah. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks, then we'll have a question and answer session.","Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through November 24.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year over year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone.","We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We posted strong results overall with revenue exceeding our guidance and earnings per share finishing at the high end of our expectations. And we redeployed more than $300 million of capital to buy back shares and retire convertible notes.","Our fourth quarter results capped off a very productive fiscal 2017. Over the last 12 months, we made excellent progress toward building a sustainable growth company with emphasis on that word sustainable. In the short term, we delivered solid mid single digit revenue growth, excluding acquisitions and divestitures, as we said we would at the beginning of the year. But at the same time, we took three important steps to solidify our growth profile for the long term.","First, we laid the foundations for sustainable growth internationally. Second, we shifted our business portfolio toward higher growth segments with the divestiture of blood screening and the acquisition of Cynosure. And third, we began to launch new products that reflect increasing innovation from our revitalized research and development pipeline. In short, 2017 was a year in which we delivered on our near-term financial commitments and did what we said we would do to build sustainable long-term growth.","With that introduction, let's review our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $802.9 million grew 10.5% on a reported basis or 9.9% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the Cynosure acquisition and the blood screening divestiture, fourth quarter revenue increased 5.0% or 4.4% in constant currency, as all our legacy divisions grew on a global basis. We are pleased with this solid mid single digit growth rate on the top line, which represents sequential acceleration compared to the 3.1% growth we posted in the third quarter.","One factor underpinning this acceleration is growing sales of new products, which totaled more than $50 million in the quarter, nearly five times the level of a year ago. Obviously, this is not all incremental growth, but the rejuvenation of our product portfolio bodes well for the future.","In terms of geography, international sales drove most of the growth in the fourth quarter. O-U.S. revenue of $189.9 million increased 24.7%, helped by the contribution of Cynosure. Even excluding Cynosure and blood, international sales increased a robust 17.5% as a result of very focused and deliberate efforts that began with new leadership less than two years ago.","Reflecting back on early 2016, we described our international businesses as a start-up, and this was a major concern among investors and analysts, one that dominated our conversations with many of you. By the first quarter of 2017, the international business grew mid single digits. One quarter after that, it grew double digits. And this quarter, it grew 17.5%. So while we thought that international would be a double-digit grower by 2018, we've actually delivered on that promise a year earlier than anticipated. Yes, we achieved double digit international growth in fiscal 2017.","We hope you remember this success story, a complex one that occurred across divisions and geographies, as you think about the more straightforward efforts we have underway today to build a stronger, better Cynosure 2.0. We'll talk more about these in a moment.","In terms of divisional performance in the fourth quarter, we're pleased that growth accelerated in our two largest businesses, Breast Health and Diagnostics, compared to the third quarter. In addition, we believe that Cynosure sales bottomed out and should start to grow on a sequential basis from here. Growth slowed in surgical, but Skeletal reversed recent trends and posted very good results.","Now let us provide a little more detail on each of these divisions. Diagnostics has clearly emerged as a sustainable growth driver for the company. In the fourth quarter, excluding the divested blood screening franchise, we posted sales of $273.7 million, an increase of 6.6%. This compares favorably to the 5.4% growth we posted in the third quarter. Fueling this growth again was molecular diagnostics, where sales of $153.5 million increased 13.8%.","Molecular sales did benefit from $9.5 million of non-recurring royalty revenue in the quarter compared to $5 million in the prior-year period. But if you back out all these royalties, underlying molecular sales still increased 10.9% globally. The business was also very strong internationally, posting growth of 10.3% against a very tough prior year comparable of roughly 15%. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth for molecular internationally.","Global growth was driven by the Panther system, our fully automated molecular diagnostics instruments. By the end of 2017, we had shipped about 1,300 Panthers to diagnostics customers with about 800 of these in the United States. Importantly, we actually shipped slightly more Panther systems in 2017, the seventh year after our launch, than we did a year ago. This illustrates the strength of our competitive position and bodes well for future growth.","Based on increasing usage of our Aptima women's health assays and our growing menu of virology tests, the average Panther system generated more than $200,000 of assay revenue on a global basis in 2017, nearly a high single-digit increase in utilization per system compared to the prior year.","And we expect further improvement in utilization in the future based in part on new assays that will emerge from an R&D pipeline that is healthier and more global than it's ever been. For example, in recent weeks, we received FDA clearance for the first two respiratory assays that will run on our revolutionary new Panther Fusion system.","Before we leave diagnostics, we want to mention that while sales of cytology and perinatal products declined slightly to $120.2 million in the fourth quarter, this was mainly due to lower perinatal sales. Sales of cytology products, mainly our ThinPrep liquid Pap test, increased at a low single digit rate as strong international growth offset modest declines in the U.S.","We also want to mention that we've been encouraged to see various professional societies and patient groups speak out against the draft USPSTF cervical cancer screening guidelines, which represent bad science. Although primary HPV testing has been FDA-approved for three years, it is rarely used in the United States as studies have shown it can miss nearly 20% of cervical cancers, reversing decades of progress we've made against the disease. As a result, we do not expect these draft USPSTF guidelines will have much effect on our business in the near term. Instead, we believe that co-testing for cervical cancer will remain the gold standard.","Now let's turn to Breast Health. As foreshadowed in our August call, several encouraging signs had begun to emerge in this business last quarter, ranging from new products to new indications to increased insurance coverage. And in the fourth quarter, these positive factors continued to build, helping us regain market momentum and extend our leadership position.","Global Breast Health sales totaled $300.9 million in the quarter, an increase of 2.4% compared to the prior-year period and a sequential acceleration compared to the 0.9% growth we saw in the third quarter. The U.S. business declined 1.2%, although this was largely due to a tough comp in the prior-year period, when sales increased at a high single-digit rate. International sales grew a strong 20.6%, reflecting the tremendous progress we have made in building a sustainable growth engine through both organic and inorganic means.","For all of those who have been concerned about a potential cliff in domestic 3D placements, our results this quarter further prove that we have broken that boom-and-bust cycle based on strategic plans we put in place years ago. In the United States, we had a record quarter of 3D shipments, again, exceeding the 300 mark, based on strong initial uptake of our recently launched 3Dimensions and 3D Performance systems. In addition, we continued to gain market share and our backlog increased, which bodes well for future growth.","Importantly, although we have now sold roughly 4,700 3D units in the United States, this still represents just over half of our own installed base. And MQSA data statistics suggest that 3D still represents well less than half the overall market, so we still have many quarters of solid performance ahead of us.","At the same time, other growth drivers continue to emerge in Breast Health. In the fourth quarter, service revenue again exceeded $100 million and grew at a mid-single-digit rate. Sales of our Affirm prone table increased nicely. And we also launched Brevera, our revolutionary new real-time biopsy system, which should contribute to growth in 2018.","Now let's turn to Surgical, where sales of $104.7 million increased 2.7%, slower growth than we had seen in recent quarters. MyoSure continued to perform well, with sales increasing 17%. And we recently launched MyoSure MANUAL, which will help us penetrate the growing in-office market.","NovaSure sales declined 7.2% due to a number of factors, including the annualization of a competitive withdrawal, increasing competition, and some softness in overall surgical volumes.","Although our skeletal business is small, we were pleased to see it reverse recent trends and return to growth in the fourth quarter, driven by better portfolio selling, strong performance from our Horizon bone densitometry system, and stabilization of our Fluoroscan franchise. Skeletal sales totaled $24.2 million, an increase of 12.9%.","Now let me discuss our new Medical Aesthetics division. Cynosure sales were $81.4 million in the quarter. As expected, this was down significantly from the prior-year period, when Cynosure was standalone company. We estimate that the two hurricanes in the southern United States reduced Cynosure sales by $3 million to $4 million in the quarter, as sales events were canceled and purchase decisions were delayed.","We want to make two big-picture points about Cynosure that are very different than today's prevailing discourse among investors and analysts, but they illustrate how we're building this business for the long term and why we are confident that we will succeed and grow in Medical Aesthetics.","First, we'd like to remind you why we bought Cynosure in the first place. Medical aesthetics is a great growth market, one of the best in med-tech. By divesting blood screening, where volumes and price are declining and purchasing Cynosure, we fundamentally shifted our portfolio toward higher-growth segments.","The many tailwinds boosting Cynosure's market include increasing social acceptance of aesthetic procedures, high levels of disposable income among patients, decreasing reimbursement for physicians that is prompting interest in cash-pay services, improving treatments that minimize patient downtime, and growing interest among younger women as well as men. These tailwinds have been driving market growth rates in the high single to low double-digit range.","Our second point is that we are making good progress toward building what we call Cynosure 2.0, which we expect to include the greatest commercial organization that the laser industry has ever seen. This is a bullish comment, especially in contrast to recent results. But we want you to know that our goals are high, and we intend to achieve them.","This process starts with great leadership, just as it did with our international business in 2016. We have already put in place outstanding leaders as Cynosure's President and the heads of sales and marketing. We have stopped the voluntary turnover in the field and rehired a handful of high-performing reps. We've instituted new screening and recruiting methods to ensure that new hires share our commitment and values to winning as a team, to winning the right way, and to winning in partnership with our customers over the long term.","We have upgraded our structure and compensation programs to ensure that sales reps have the ability to prosper by selling our entire portfolio, which is the broadest in our industry. We've hired new leaders to revitalize the customer experience and build the same kind of customer loyalty that we see in our other divisions. And we are implementing across the division a robust sales model that has been proven to work by Cynosure's best reps.","Based on all these factors, we're confident that Cynosure's sales bottomed in the fourth quarter and are poised to grow from here. Not only will we execute better with our existing portfolio of products, we will effectively launch new products such as the submental indication for SculpSure, which is receiving positive early feedback from customers.","While we still have a ton of work to do, we are making good progress. As early indicators of this, our international performance remains solid and some domestic sales regions are performing very well. And overall, sales so far this quarter are tracking ahead of their pace in the fourth quarter.","We are confident that Cynosure will make steady progress in the coming quarters, like our international business did, and become an important growth driver for the company in 2018 and beyond, like our international business is today.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that we posted a very good fourth quarter that exceeded expectations and capped off a productive fiscal year. Not only did we execute against our short-term financial commitments, we made important progress in building a sustainable growth company for the long term by growing international, strengthening our portfolio of businesses and launching new products. I am proud of our team and all that we have accomplished together, and am eager to drive even greater successes in 2018 and beyond.","Now I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. I'm going to review the rest of our income statement, cover some balance sheet and cash flow items, and then discuss our financial guidance for 2018. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results.","As Steve mentioned, we closed out our fiscal 2017 with a strong fourth quarter. Revenue exceeded our guidance and EPS came in at the high end of expectations. During the quarter, we also strategically redeployed capital. And as we head into 2018, we see new growth drivers emerging.","With that introduction, let's move down our fourth quarter income statement. Gross margins of 64.1% decreased 160 basis points compared to the prior-year period due primarily to the divestiture of our blood screening business and sales of Cynosure products, which carry a lower margin. However, it's important to note that gross margins improved by about 60 basis points on a sequential basis even if you strip out the royalty income that Steve discussed.","Total operating expenses of $275.8 million increased 17.1% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the inclusion of Cynosure expenses. If you back these out, our efforts to drive strong operating leverage continue to bear fruit with operating expenses declining 3%. Our operating margin of 29.8% declined 360 basis points due to product and geography mix as well as the divestiture of our blood screening business. Yet, we continue to maintain one of the best profit profiles in medical technology with multiple levers to drive expansion going forward.","And finally, net margins of 17.8% decreased 220 basis points as the negative mix factors just discussed were partially offset by improvements in our effective tax rate. All this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50, hitting the high end of our guidance range.","Now before we move on to our 2018 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics. First, we had a very productive few months as we continue to optimize our debt structure and allocate capital in accordance with our stated priorities. During the fourth quarter, we took advantage of weakness in our share price to opportunistically reduce our convertible debt and repurchase our common stock. Specifically, we retired $86 million in principal of our convertible notes for a total purchase price of $106 million. In addition, we repurchased 5.3 million of our outstanding shares for a total of $200 million. So in total, $306 million in productive capital deployment.","In addition, in early October, we announced two positive changes to our debt structure, beginning with an amended five-year secured credit agreement. Through this agreement, we extended the maturities by two years, increased our financial flexibility and upsized our revolver. In addition, we also issued in early October $350 million worth of senior notes maturing in 2025 at a very attractive interest rate of 4.375%. Together, the larger revolver and the senior notes will provide us with the capacity to retire our remaining convertible notes when they become callable in December and March of fiscal 2018.","This quarter was a certainly a very productive one for our financial organizations following on the heels of the blood screening divestiture and the Cynosure acquisition earlier in the year. So I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank the finance teams for all the hard work that made these successes possible.","And at the end of the fourth quarter, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, stood at 2.7 times, slightly below our year ago level despite all the capital allocation activities that occurred in fiscal 2017. And finally, in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $262.7 million declined slightly compared to prior year as improvements in our base business were offset by the divestiture of blood screening.","Now I'd like to cover our non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2018. First, as a housekeeping item, I will make references to organic revenue, which is defined as total revenue less blood screening and Medical Aesthetics for the first two quarters of fiscal 2018. Said differently, Medical Aesthetics is included in our organic numbers for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018.","Organic results also adjust for the three fewer selling days in 2018 versus 2017, which we estimate has a sales impact of roughly $20 million. And finally, organic revenue adjusts for the $9.5 million of royalty revenue that we don't expect to reoccur in 2018, which is similar to how we excluded discontinued product lines in last year's guidance.","We anticipate fiscal 2018 to be a good year for Hologic overall. At the highest level, we are forecasting continued mid single digit organic revenue growth with faster organic EPS growth. Specifically, we anticipate sales of $3.20 billion to $3.28 billion in 2018 with reported growth rates between 4.6% and 7.2%. Based on recent exchange rates, this translates to constant currency growth of 4% to 6.6% with organic constant currency growth in the mid single digits.","As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges at this early stage, as we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides.","In terms of divisional growth in 2018, our guidance contemplates low single digit growth in Breast and Skeletal Health, mid single digit growth in Diagnostics excluding blood screening, mid single digit growth in Surgical and double digit pro forma growth in Medical Aesthetics.","In Diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the charge behind Panther and an expanded menu including the full suite of virology assays, which we expect to have in the U.S. with the approval of our HPV test around the middle of the fiscal year. We anticipate continued strong international growth in Diagnostics as well, plus $25 million to $30 million of revenue related to the blood screening transition services, which will have little to no benefit on earnings.","In Breast Health, growth will be driven by new products like the Affirm prone biopsy system and Brevera, our international business and a growing service annuity. And in Surgical, we expect growth to be driven by continued market expansion efforts behind MyoSure, new products like MyoSure MANUAL, the stabilization of NovaSure and our international business. And in Medical Aesthetics, we expect strong growth from a stabilized and fully productive salesforce and new products, including the submental indication for SculpSure and our new RF platform.","Now in terms of profitability, I would remind you that our non-GAAP margin profile in the second half of fiscal 2017 represents a new baseline for the business post blood screening and Cynosure. So from gross margin levels of roughly 63.5%, we forecast solid improvement from continued operational efficiencies tempered somewhat by the rapid growth of our international business. In addition, we expect to continue to show strong leverage in operating expenses. So from baseline of roughly 29.5%, operating margin should expand faster than gross margins.","Now below the line, we expect net non-operating expenses to be materially higher in fiscal 2018 than the $122 million we posted in 2017. This will result from higher forecasted interest rates and the refinancing activities I mentioned earlier, which are tied to the anticipation retirement of the remaining convertible notes in December and March. All of this leads us to forecasted earnings per share of between $2.10 and $2.15 in 2018. This represents reported growth of between 3.4% and 5.9% with double digit organic growth after adjusting for the blood screening divestiture.","This guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 31% and diluted shares outstanding of about 284 million for the year. Our guidance does not assume any capital deployment beyond calling the convertible notes and excludes the possible reinstatement of the medical device excise tax.","Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. As a reminder, we will have four fewer selling days this quarter than we did a year ago, which translates into more than $20 million of revenue. We expect revenues of $775 million to $790 million, down on a sequential basis, as we see a normal seasonal decline due to our global sales meetings and the RSNA conference in Breast Health. In addition, we'll be missing the $9.5 million in diagnostic royalty revenue that Steve discussed.","Compared to the prior-year period, which included those extra selling days, this range reflects reported revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.6% and constant currency growth of 4.7% to 6.7%. We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.48 to $0.50 in the first quarter. This anticipates a decline of 7.7% to 3.8% on a reported basis, but double-digit growth excluding the $0.10 in the first quarter of last year related to blood screening.","Before we open the call for questions, let me just conclude by saying that our fourth quarter capped off a successful and productive year for the company. Externally, we are encouraged by the productivity of our R&D investment and a building product pipeline, the impact that organizational changes have made on the international business and the overall shift in our portfolio to higher growth markets.","Internally, we continue to exercise tight expense controls, improve our debt structure and strategically redeploy capital. Overall, we feel confident in our foundation heading into 2018 and have the levers to deliver healthy revenue and EPS growth.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, and then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question today from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I wanted to ask a couple questions about Cynosure. First off, can you tell us a little bit about why the business declined sequentially and what's going to take it back this coming quarter, just a near-term trend question?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, why it declined sequentially, if you'll recall, Isaac, we basically changed out the whole leadership team in the July-August time period. So we gave them one quarter after we did the acquisition. Obviously, it wasn't our shining moment, and then we put the new team in. And during the new team, obviously, a little bit more transition. But I will tell you, we also, as you know, we had said we expected a fairly significant decline in the quarter.","It was probably a little worse, candidly, than what we would have hoped. But I'll tell you, having just spent a lot of time with their sales organization, their leaders over the last couple of weeks, it's a very different place than it was even 30 \u2013 45 days ago. And so I feel very good about where we're headed, and I feel very confident that we can now declare the bottom, and it's going to get stronger and stronger from here.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just on the forward, you talked about a lot of things that are going to get better in Cynosure. But I'm interested a little bit on the innovation side. The product cycles in this sector tend to have pretty high velocity. They turn over pretty fast. So can you tell us a little bit about what's coming in the pipeline that will help you guys. Will a better salesforce, better management deliver better growth? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, great question, Isaac. And I'd clarify a couple of additions to that. One is we did just get the submental approved right at the end of the quarter, so that will be kicking in for this quarter. We have the RF platform that we've talked about. That is very much on schedule, and I think you will likely see that being launched in early calendar year 2018. And it's very important to note that all the leaders in the R&D organization and all the managers are all intact. So the inside of the company has not been affected, while the outside of the salesforce in the U.S. was.","So we have a lot of pockets and stability called the international selling organization, but particularly the R&D organization, very intact. It's a big part of what we loved about this business. They've been great innovators for a long time, and we expect to continue that pace of innovation.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Isaac, this is Bob. The other thing around that pace of innovation is really one of the competitive advantages I think we have is also our clinical profile. And so one of the things with the submental that came out was not only that we got it approved slightly ahead of where it was initially, but also with superior claims to competitive products out there with a wider BMI [Body Mass Index] range and so forth. And so we're thinking about that to be able to have it serve the broadest amount of customers. So there's also that element as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Jack.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So I just wanted to pick a little bit more on your conviction in this quarter as the bottom and what's going to get to growth in the fourth quarter. You mentioned regionally in the U.S. some areas are showing strength. Can you maybe just talk matching it up in terms of where the salesforce is a little bit more mature, if that was a trend you noticed? And then just a little bit more discretely, what we should be thinking for the first quarter would be helpful.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, Jack. I think clearly, to your point, we saw pockets of strength. Our West Coast team was largely intact and has delivered actually growth in the quarter. What we had is we had several teams that largely left en masse when the transition occurred, and it's filling those pockets back up. But we know how to do that.","We're frankly being \u2013 we're building for the long haul. We could have easily gone out and just grabbed a bunch of people that had left and offered them a bunch of money like this industry typically does just to bring them back, but we're building it for the long haul. So I think what we feel really good about now is we've looked at what has made the regions that are successful doing well and really starting to emulate and pick up from there as we add the people.","But this is going to be like international. I know everybody wants to see the immediate turnaround. I just go back. To build things sustainably, it takes a period of quarters. We could easily do a one-hit wonder and go out and just hire some people and slam some stuff through. It's not what we're about. We didn't buy this business for 2017. We didn't buy it for the beginning of 2018. We are building it. And I've got so much confidence in the leaders that we have in place now. And it's a combination of some from the outside and frankly, a lot of real stars that were in the company that are stepping up in the company, being Cynosure, stepping up. So that will give us the sequential improvement. There's just little doubt in our minds that we bottomed out, and we'll build from here.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","And hey, Jack, this is Bob, another couple of points there. So we did have some impact with the hurricanes and the weather related that we obviously don't anticipate happening in the fourth calendar quarter, our first quarter. In addition, submental came in at the very tail end of Q4. We've seen very positive early pickups. We'll obviously have a full quarter of that to be able to sell that, so those are two other additional points that should drive.","In the fourth quarter, fourth calendar year quarter, it's typically the highest volume quarter of the medical aesthetics industry. So we've got a number of things here that both from a macro perspective, but also internally in addition to what Steve was saying, that give us some confidence that we will grow sequentially from the fourth quarter, fiscal fourth quarter.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Is there a number or a range that you have in mind for the December quarter?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","I would say it's up sequentially, but still down materially from prior year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. I'll give you a break from Cyno questions for a minute and maybe just shifting over to Breast Health.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Tycho.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No problem, I'm just trying to help. How are you thinking about the Breast Health setup for 2018? And maybe if you could just talk a little bit on uptake of the two different products. I'm just wondering about kind of pricing dynamics given you've got a new low-end system and a new high-end system, how pricing is going to settle out, you think, for 2018.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, at the highest level, Tycho, I feel a lot better about where our Breast Health business is headed as we go into 2018 than probably did going into 2017, and certainly materially better than how we felt six months ago. I think our team has gotten their mojo back. And the two new products are really going to help us a lot. What we're seeing is 3Dimensions on the high end is coming off to a very nice reception. And the 3D Performance is probably going to be a little bit bigger than I think a number of our reps felt. And that is going to be at a lower price. But having said that, it's similar margin to our existing business.","The greatest part about that is it's allowing us to compete. As you know, some of the big boys are being very aggressive on price. We don't want to get into a price battle. But it does give us a chance to have an offering for some of the smaller hospitals where they don't need all the bells and whistles that come in our traditional Dimensions, you know, 6000, 9000 and then the 3Dimensions. So it really gives us a very good menu of an offering. And I think that really, we already saw a nice uptick there in the fourth quarter in terms of placements.","We've also got Brevera coming. Affirm is building. And frankly, if I look at, we don't report orders. But it was a very nice uptick in our fourth quarter orders. And I think just there's a lot of things coming together in that business right now. As you know, we've come a long way and just avoiding the cliff. It's not going to be a super growth business in the U.S. just given how far we've come.","Having said that, internationally, internationally is looking very, very good and you can see the numbers there, 20%-ish Breast Health growth internationally. And everybody \u2013 remember, a big part of that growth is Kevin Thornal, who was redeployed to Cynosure. And his first few quarters internationally looked pretty ugly and today, we're in a very different place. And it's what gives me tremendous confidence both about our ongoing Breast Health business, our international business, but also Cynosure.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yes hey, Tycho this is Bob. Just to give a little additional flavor and color. So in our prepared remarks, we talked about having record shipments, over 300. Roughly two-thirds of those were the existing products. So said differently, maybe one-third of those were both a combination of 3D Performance and 3Dimensions. So it talks about the uptake has been very good. And that gives us, as Steve said, the broadest portfolio to really supply and support any customer out there. And so we're really excited about that going forward.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then for a follow-up, just a question on Fusion I guess as we think about installed based of Panthers. Can you maybe comment on what you think the attach rate might look like? And do you have enough out there to maybe make an impact on the flu season this year with the Fusions you do have out there?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","No. I'll answer the second half of the question first. No, we won't have any impact this year on Fusion on the flu season. It just came a little bit late and we still have one more assay that we want to prove. I think it does bode well for next year's flu season. I think the initial feedback from Fusion has been phenomenal. And the magic to me is the fact that we did placed more systems in 2017 than we did in 2016. And it's too early to fully predict an attach rate, but we think it will be very high. And we're seeing just increased throughput.","Everybody that gets Panther into their hands likes it. And Fusion is that much more of a game changer. So over time, we would certainly expect the majority of those and hopefully, as we get well into 2018 and beyond, hopefully most of the systems we ship will actually be Panther Fusions as opposed to Panthers. But we'll be basically taking it on a case-by-case basis, whatever is best for our customers. But I think they'll increasingly see the broader value of Fusion as well.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, I was going to say just add on to that, Tycho, we've said before that we see Fusion as really being the cornerstone of the lab for the future and our conviction only grows with customer feedback.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I guess, moving on to Surgical, how confident are you in your mid single growth outlook for Surgical? And specifically, what are the plans in place to stabilize the NovaSure product?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, Dan, good question. We continue to feel great about MyoSure and it continues to grow at rates far beyond what we probably would have predicted. We're a little disappointed with NovaSure. Obviously, there was the competitive. We had done a great job turning that business around. Then we benefited from the competitive withdrawal. But I think we might have taken it little easy. Maybe that business came a little too easy to us. And I don't think we've doubled down as firmly as we need to. We have put a new sales leader and some new leadership into that division to kind of step it up a little bit. And we're looking at some comp changes for that salesforce. And I think I put them a little bit of where our Breast Health business was about six months ago where I think they just slightly took their foot off the pedal, and we're are going to get that foot back on the pedal.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","I think with the addition of the new products, MyoSure MANUAL, that will also help continue to propel the MyoSure business, and as that becomes a bigger part of the overall Surgical business, that will drive the overall growth rates as well. So we feel it's still very early days on that. But that will really help us get a stronger foothold into the office-based procedures, which is really kind of virgin territory for us. And so that will help expand that market.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on Cynosure, I appreciate the comment that there's no more voluntary turnover in the salesforce. But can you give us at a higher-level kind of how many heads you have on the street today or how many feet on the street versus you were six months ago versus where this business was 12 months ago, so we know how much more additions you need to get that back up to par?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, we are well below where they were a year ago, and particularly in some key regions. So consider that double digit percentages down. And that's where I think as we start to add bodies back into a lot of these territories, and we're doing that now, that that will drive some very nice growth. But we are materially below where they were at this time last year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Chris Lin on for Doug. Thanks for taking my question.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, Chris.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","I want to go back to Cynosure. You know that some salesforce left en masse after the leadership change. You also know that the Q4 revenue was weaker than expected. So one, was this the sole driver of the weaker than expected Cynosure performance or do you see any change in the competitive dynamics here?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","No real change in the competitive dynamics, I think. We lost, as we were down people, we've got to put territories back in. There's always little pieces in that business where one company might get a little hotter for a quarter or two, but nothing fundamentally different.","Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe for the follow-up question. Sorry if I missed this. But did you, or are the new hires completed for Cynosure now? And I think previously, we talked about a six-month period to get sales reps to optimal productivity. So as we think about the phasing of Cynosure revenue growth in 2018, should we think growth is likely second half weighted for Cynosure?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, I think, hiring is not complete. We're hiring as we speak. And we've got some just great leaders in that business that are talent magnets, so filling those spots. But I think they will be filling through time. We'll start to see some growth here in the coming quarters and I think builds sequentially through the year. I think it will be a big driver of growth in the second half of the year for us.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Chris, this is Bob. When we look at first half, back half, there will certainly would be more growth in the back half of the year as we get that stabilized. As we mentioned, the first quarter we expect that business to be down. We expect growth in the second quarter and beyond.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Down versus year ago but up sequentially.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Versus year, that's correct.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Raj.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","I'll ask a Cyno question just to keep going on that.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","I figured you'd come with Breast Health.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Well that would be my second question, wholly unrelated, but I'll ask that as well. So you made a comment sort of in mid call about the higher standard in a sense for hiring these folks back, the having them at the value standard in a sense of Hologic. And I guess I'm curious how much of a disadvantage that's proving to be given some of the selling practices in this industry? Are you disadvantaged because you're holding your folks to a higher standard here in aesthetics?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","You know what, I'll say no, and we believe that. Ultimately, I believe you hire great people who can work hard and outwork others, you will win over time. I think all of you know, the medical aesthetics industry has been probably not quite of the same character and values. We think we can do it and we can do it the right way. It may not be as easy, but there is zero doubt in my mind that we can do it. And I'll tell you, the existing Cynosure sales leaders who stayed with us, it's what they want.","And frankly, there's a lot that the Hologic name is going to bring to this space that will play out over time. It may not be playing out in the first three, six, nine months. But what we can do for this industry, and I always believe ultimately, you do what's right for the customers, you hire great people and you treat them right and build a more enduring relationship, it will prevail. And that's what we're setting out to do. And again, you may not always see it in the short term, right, it's like athletes can win doing steroids or other things. But ultimately, who is the enduring winner are going to be that people do it right. And that's exactly what we're out to do, and we will do it.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Well, just as a follow-up. And I'm sorry, I won't get to the Breast question. But for my follow-up, I guess just in terms of how we think about the recovery in this business then, as you still have a lot of open spots. But perhaps it's a little harder to get those quality folks in because of the standard. When is this business going to get back to where it can grow to the rates that we thought it could when you acquired it?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. It's not a barrier to hiring quality people, let me be really clear about that. There's lot of quality people who want to come in. It's just not necessarily people with a ton of industry experience. We are getting very good quality people. And I think we see this being back to a double-digit grower in 2018, Raj. So we will deliver that, and therefore it will be accretive to our company growth rate.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. I hate to continue the trend on this. But can you just talk about the accretion that you now expect from Cynosure this year? I think you had talked about $0.10 to $0.15 on a higher revenue number previously. So are you still contemplating that range? And if so, is it because you are seeing additional synergy opportunities, or would you be pulling forward some of those synergies?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, go ahead Bob.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Brian, this is Bob. At the time of the acquisition, we said that we expected to have accretion of $0.13 to $0.15, and we are still aligned with that, obviously off probably a slightly lower sales base. But we have been able to identify synergies faster and have pulled some of those in. So we're still, and that's what's baked into our estimates right now.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, what we've seen in Diagnostics, can you talk a little bit about the components there specifically, how things like your CT\/NG tests are doing, any share gains there, growth rates, and then same on HPV? Thank you","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","I think in simple terms, given the growth rate of our molecular business, we're probably not going to go in it assay by assay, but we think they are growing faster than the market and taking market share, particularly in the U.S., but also reasonably encouraged obviously off a much a smaller base internationally.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","The fact that our growth, certainly in the fourth quarter, Brian, the fact that our molecular business grew ex the royalties at a double-digit rate would suggest that we have very strong growth in all of those markets, both CT\/GC, HPV and trach. We believe they're growing faster than the overall market and we are gaining share.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","How are you doing, Steve? A couple quick questions just for me. Maybe, Bob, this is a good one for you. Just thinking about the fiscal 2018 guidance, the range at 2.5 points is almost twice the range of last year. Can you just give us a sense of what's driving the wider range and what are the two or three flex factors? One obviously I think I know. But what are the flex factors that make for a wider range in 2018 versus 2017? And I know you're obviously still guiding to the midpoint, but why the wider range?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, a couple of things. To be fully honest, we're still getting our arms around the pacing of the Cynosure business. It's a higher capital business that has a little more volatility, and we're recognizing that fact. So I think that is one of the reasons that we've probably get a broader range than we had historically. We haven't been through a full-year cycle of what that business can do.","And I think the fact that as we have that capital component of it, we're trying to recognize that piece. That also is the swing factor, that and the new products. And so the uptake of new products, we probably have more new products in our 2018 forecast than we've ever had. That's a good thing. But it also creates a little more potential for upside as well as some variability in terms of the uptake and so forth. But those are probably the two elements, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And at the midpoint of your range, Bob, assuming you're forecasting double-digit Medical sales at the midpoint, then my follow-up for Steve is, Steve, you're still maintaining your synergy guidance, $0.13 to $0.15 for next year, or for this year now. Can you explain the logic of that decision? I feel like given the sales erosion and the size and scale of your primary competitor, this is probably not the year to drive earnings synergies. This is the year to reinvest to get the growth rates turned around. And maybe those two quick follow-ups. Thank you so much.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, thanks, David. I think you're exactly right. And we won't be silly to chase that to an extreme. But I think what we're seeing is there are more synergies say on the operational side and maybe some on the G&A side while we reinvest in sales, marketing, and R&D. So we're probably getting that accretion in a different way than we might have anticipated. But if we feel we need to spend a little bit more than the base business is delivering, we would certainly contemplate that.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","We've done that in the past and we will do that again.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the question.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hi, Rich.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, how are you doing, Steve? I was just wondering. Is there anything that you're seeing specifically in either the women's related to Cynosure in the women's health markets? And can you comment on your ability to leverage your GYN salesforce there?","And then also, is there anything underlying going on, on the body contouring space in the U.S. just given that this is a market that's been developed for a few years now? Is it getting saturated at all on the capital side? Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, thanks. We still think there's big opportunities on the body contouring side. In the grand scheme, while there's been competitors and products out for five or six years, when you look at the full range of possibilities in the installed base, there's still a lot of opportunity there.","On the women's health side, we also think there's much better opportunities, particularly for MonaLisa Touch in women's health than, frankly, what Cynosure had done over its last year as a standalone company and probably what we've done in the first quarter and a half, two quarters of owning it. And we're putting a more dedicated effort into particularly the women's health side.","So we also want to be careful not to distract our Surgical organization because they've got two great products and still a lot of growth potential as well. So it's like anything. You find other ways, and I think frankly, it's going to be more through the Cynosure sales organization with a refocus on the opportunity.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","I guess just as a follow-up there, Steve, is that a different strategy than you envisioned when you purchased the asset, whereas you'd need to rely a little bit more on the Cyno build-out within women's health to leverage that channel where you already have a dedicated sales force?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","No, we're still using referrals. What I'd say, our basic approach here is use the GYN Surgical salesforce for referrals to key customers, but have the Cynosure sales reps still close them, but I think building that relationship to be better.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. We'll go to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thanks and thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Two questions, I guess first off is just thinking about \u2013 I guess at some point here, we may start to hit a bit of a replacement cycle on tomo. I realize that we're about a little over about 6.5 years out now from the FDA approval. So I guess first and foremost, maybe we can just, I would love your thoughts on when we might start to see some initial replacements. Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, we think we're probably still a few years away from that. And the magic of it, to your point, is we think we've still got probably three to four years of runway with tomo itself still establishing itself into our customers that haven't flipped yet. And by that point, we'll be needing some new revenue and then the early adopters will be starting to come up and it'll probably work out very well that they'll be ready for some new stuff, call it in that 2020-2021 time period.","So it should really be key to helping us break this whole boom\/bust cycle that really, when you look at it, and I go back two years ago, every meeting we had with investors was about the cliff. And then shortly after that, every meeting was about international. Right now, everyone is about Cynosure. We just keep knocking it up. There's issues that pop up, very proud of what we've done to thwart off the cliff. very proud of what we've done in international. And frankly, we'll be sitting here 12 months from now having shown the same with Cynosure, feel very confident about it.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah hey, and Bill, just to kind of frame in kind of the opportunity, we're still roughly half penetrated into our existing base. And there's still roughly about 65% based on our estimates of the installed base in the market in the U.S. that still has an opportunity to upgrade to 3D.","The other thing is we continue to get 3D incremental reimbursement. We now have roughly almost 90% of all women covered for incremental 3D in reimbursement. So there's still a runway there. And then couple that with those, if in fact there is somebody next year which I would think would be the exception certainly not the rule, the 3Dimensions, that high end product would be a perfect opportunity for that early adopter. But we still have a long way to go with the existing products.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yes, got it. And then maybe just lastly, and Steve you kind of touched on this early regarding hitting the bottom on Cyno and starting to see a recovery here in the calendar fourth quarter. I guess, talk to us a little bit about the strength of why you feel like that. Is this because you're seeing more product getting shipped out to customers? Is it because the deal funnel is getting stronger? Are we seeing less product at resellers, just curious kind of some of the bits and pieces that give you the confidence there? Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. I go back to my, probably my core management philosophy. The reason I feel better is because of the team that we have in place. And we have a better, more engaged leadership team, then the regional leaders under them are strong and motivated. And they lost their way for a little bit earlier this year. They are back, completely reengaged.","There's always recency effect, but I was just with the entire sales organization a couple of weeks ago for their national sales meeting. Just hearing comments like, hey, this place is even completely different than it was 30 days ago. We're jazzed. We're ready to go. And it's the leading qualitative factor. And this is where I'll go back to, I think you've heard me say it, sometimes an organization is better than its numbers and sometimes it's worse than its numbers.","And I think, but oftentimes, when you're in the midst of changing something out, you can start to see it and feel it qualitatively before the numbers start to show up. Having said that, we are partway into this quarter and we're starting to see some uptick. So I don't want to get into the process of talking about quarterly updates. But because this call is particularly later into a quarter, starting to feel certainly on a better trajectory than where we've been.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's conference call is being recorded. And all lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Watts","Thank you, Callianna. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our Web site. We also will post our prepared remarks to our Web site shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our Web site through February 24.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release. Finally, unless otherwise noted, all percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Steve MacMillan","Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone.","We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We posted solid results. Both revenue and earnings per share exceeded our guidance, illustrating the progress we're making on our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company.","As we discussed at the recent JP Morgan conference, the success of our turnaround to-date has been based largely on improved execution by our U.S. commercial teams. They stabilized market-leading products that were once in decline, and optimized the potential of innovative growth drivers. Both of these trends continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.","But at the same time, we are beginning to see the next chapter of our growth story emerge this quarter in two important areas. First, our efforts to revitalize our research and development pipeline are beginning to bear fruit, as new products contributed progressively more to growth. And second, we generated growth internationally after four consecutive quarters of declines in fiscal 2016. While we realize we still have much work to do outside the United States, we are encouraged by the progress we are making and the foundations we are building.","As we look toward the future, new products and international growth will play an increasingly important role in our success. And we expect a third area, business development, to contribute as well. In this regard, the divestiture of our blood screening business, which closed yesterday, will increase our financial flexibility as we seek growth through acquisitions and other capital deployment activities.","With that introduction out of the way, we'd like to provide an overview of our first quarter revenue results, highlighting both established growth drivers and the early contributions from new products and international. Then I'll review the blood screening sale briefly before handing the call over to Bob.","Let's start with our first quarter results. Revenue of $734.4 million grew 5.6% on a reported basis, or 6.3% in constant currency. We posted good growth over and above our most difficult comparison from the prior year. As a reminder, sales in last year's first quarter grew a strong 8.1% in constant currency. This quarter we also absorbed a headwind of roughly 50 basis points from discontinued products, mainly a cystic fibrosis test in molecular diagnostics. On the positive side, as discussed in our last quarterly call, we benefited from four extra selling days between Christmas and New Year's, which we estimate contributed roughly half our growth for the quarter.","In terms of geography, U.S. sales grew a healthy 5.2% in the quarter, versus a very difficult comp from a year ago when sales increased 12.8%. This performance was a continuation of strong recent results, and once again validated the quality of both our products and our people.","We are also encouraged that international sales grew 6.1% excluding blood screening. Growth was again led by our molecular diagnostics and surgical franchises, both of which grew faster than 20% in constant currency, and are beginning to show results from the foundations we have built over the last couple of years. While international sales clearly improved, we want to emphasize that it's only one quarter, and we are still very much a start-up outside the United States. But now we have our leadership team in place and are beginning to establish a strong basis for future growth. As a reminder, in the past 12 months we have hired four new commercial leaders for Latin America, Asia Pacific, Canada and Europe.","Now let's turn to divisional performance in the first quarter. Surgical remained our growth leader, and posted its eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth globally. Let me emphasize that's two years of double-digit revenue growth -- not to mention high profitability -- from a division that many people thought we should sell three years ago.","In the first quarter, which is seasonally strong for Surgical, sales were $114.8 million, an increase of 17.2%. MyoSure led the way by posting sales of $48.3 million and growth of 32.1%. We are achieving exceptional growth for MyoSure as our commercial teams continue to expand the market and capitalize on our new MyoSure Reach line extension.","As a side note, MyoSure Reach was the biggest sales contributor in the basket of new products that we track regularly. Last quarter we said these products exceeded $10 million in quarterly sales for the first time, and this quarter they showed good growth on a sequential basis.","NovaSure sales of $66.4 million grew 8.6%, as we continued to capture market share based on a competitive withdrawal. We should point out, however, that we have almost completely annualized this benefit, so NovaSure growth rates are expected to slow going forward, as we previously forecast.","Before we leave Surgical, let me mention that we recently received FDA approval for our new NovaSure Advanced line extension. We are pleased that in GYN Surgical, like the rest of our divisions, R&D is becoming an integral part of our growth strategy. For example, over the last few quarters, we have been able to gain U.S. approval for two new products that will extend our leadership position in the field.","Moving to Diagnostics, we posted sales of $325.4 million in the first quarter, and 5.5% growth.","In molecular diagnostics, sales of $139.9 million grew 8.8% -- despite the discontinued products headwind-- based on share gains and increased utilization of women's health assays on the fully automated Panther instrument. Of note, international sales grew 25.8% as we continue to see the benefits of new leadership, record Panther placements, and increasing assay pull-through on those instruments. Specifically, revenue from our three viral load assays is increasing nicely in Europe, although admittedly off a small base.","And in the United States this quarter, we were pleased to receive FDA approval of our first viral load assay, for HIV-1. This is a highly complex assay that required a prospective clinical trial and a Pre-Market Approval from the FDA, so the approval is a testament to the quality of our Diagnostics R&D and clinical teams. Building on the HIV approval, we hope to gain clearance for our hepatitis C test later this fiscal year, and our hepatitis B assay in 2018. Once we have all three viral assays approved in the U.S., we are optimistic that they will begin contributing to domestic revenue growth.","Elsewhere in Diagnostics, blood screening sales of $65.2 million exceeded our expectations and grew 7.4%. Most of the upside came from initial sales to support investigational testing for the Zika virus, and from international ordering by our partner Grifols that rebounded from very low levels a year ago. Overall, blood screening sales declined in the United States, but increased significantly in international markets, so keep that in mind as you're analyzing the performance of our core businesses by geography.","Finally, cytology and perinatal sales were $120.3 million in the quarter, with modest global growth of 1.1%, as domestic share gains by our ThinPrep liquid Pap test continued to offset headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening intervals. It's worth mentioning that while cytology products comprise more than 85% of this revenue line, the perinatal portion of the business has started to perform better as well. This will be an area to watch in the future as we revitalize our new product development efforts.","Now let's move on to Breast Health, where global sales of $273.3 million grew 4.6%. Domestic placements of our innovative, market-leading Genius 3D mammography systems again increased modestly, and orders remain healthy. We continue to gain market share while maintaining price discipline, based on our superior product profile and strong customer relationships. And we still have significant conversion runway ahead of us, as less than 45% of our domestic installed base has upgraded to our Genius platform thus far.","Importantly, other supplemental growth drivers have begun to emerge in Breast Health, as we very deliberately planned. Specifically, in the mammography segment, strong growth in service revenues from a growing installed base of Genius systems, combined with sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system, drove a 5.5% increase in domestic sales.","Outside the United States, Breast Health sales were basically flat, as we continue to work, on a country-by-country basis, to optimize our channel strategy and build our commercial capabilities. With each passing quarter we feel better about our prospects here. But as we have said before, it will take time to fully realize the considerable opportunity in front of us.","To round out the revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $20.9 million decreased 10.7%. Although this is a small business for us, this performance is clearly unacceptable. As a result, we have refocused our commercial efforts, and are beginning to see an increase in DXA bookings that bodes well for improved performance later this year.","Now let me shift gears and touch briefly on our blood screening divestiture, which closed yesterday.","As a reminder, we sold our stake in our blood screening business to our former commercial partner, Grifols, for a purchase price of $1.85 billion in cash. Blood screening was a non-strategic business for us, as our partner managed sales and marketing, and we lacked the ability to control our own commercial destiny. We believe this deal makes Hologic a fundamentally stronger company in 2017 and beyond.","We are receiving excellent value for our blood screening assets. The $1.85 billion purchase price represented a premium to our own, internal valuation on an after-tax basis, and is particularly attractive when you consider the underlying headwinds facing the blood screening market, both declining unit volumes and increased price competition. By monetizing the business today, we have significantly derisked our portfolio going forward.","In addition, divesting the blood screening business removes a drag on our growth, which will enable us to increase both revenues and EPS at a faster rate. And as competitive pressures intensify, this benefit will likely increase over time.","And finally, the deal markedly strengthens our balance sheet and increases our financial flexibility to grow through acquisitions. As mentioned earlier, we continue to believe that M&A -- as a supplement to internal innovation, commercial execution and international expansion-- will be an important part of our future growth strategy.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me summarize by saying that Hologic is off to a good start in 2017. In the first quarter, our domestic commercial organization continued to drive growth of our market-leading products. At the same time, the next chapter of our growth story began to emerge, as new products and international started to contribute. As a result, both revenue and EPS exceeded our guidance. And we significantly increased our financial flexibility by divesting our blood screening business for an attractive price.","Now I will turn the call over to Bob.","Bob McMahon","Thank you Steve, and good afternoon everyone.","I'm going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, the balance sheet, and our updated financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results.","As Steve described, our first quarter was a quarter of solid execution, and this began on the top line with revenue growing 6.3% in constant currency. In addition, non-GAAP EPS finished at $0.52, a reported increase of 13%, as we continue to show good leverage down to the bottom line of the income statement.","Now, let's start by discussing how we accomplished this.","Gross margins of 65.2% were flat compared to a year ago, as favorable product mix was offset by increasing international sales and the negative effects of a stronger U.S. dollar.","Total operating expenses of $231.1 million increased 4.6% in the first quarter, mainly due to the extra days in our fiscal calendar and the timing of marketing expenses. As Steve mentioned, we are pleased with the returns that we are beginning to see from research and development, and expect to continue investing there to generate sustainable growth. Even while accommodating these investments, our operating margin of 33.7% improved by 30 basis points in the first quarter.","Below the line, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31% was 175 basis points lower than a year ago. And while we have no special insight into the prospects for corporate tax reform, we do believe we would benefit significantly from most of the changes being discussed in Washington.","And to wrap up the discussion of the income statement, EPS of $0.52 grew 13% compared to a year ago, more than double the rate of sales and ahead of our guidance. Please note, we estimate that our blood screening business contributed $0.10 of EPS in the first quarter, flat versus the prior year period. You'll see that we included in our press release the historical contributions of blood screening to quarterly EPS, to help you with an apples-to-apples comparisons going forward.","Now let's turn to cash flows and the balance sheet.","In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $269.1 million improved 6.8%. We continued efforts to reduce our convertible debt by calling what was left of our 2037 notes. Once the administrative procedures are complete, we will have eliminated from our balance sheet this most dilutive tranche of notes, which originally totaled $450 million in principal. And as you know, the remaining two tranches of our converts are callable in December of this year and March of 2018, just over a year from now.","We continue to generate strong cash flows, with operating cash flows of $169.6 million in the quarter. We spent only $24.7 million on capital, leading to free cash flow of $144.9 million.","And turning to the balance sheet, we closed out the quarter with $646 million in cash and $3.3 billion in total debt outstanding, resulting in $2.7 billion of net debt. This represents a reduction of $0.3 billion versus a year ago. And based on this, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, stood at 2.6x at the end of the quarter, a much healthier level than just a few years ago.","To wrap up the discussion of results, we have steadily improved our return on invested capital through consistent profit growth coupled with lower debt. At the end of our first quarter, ROIC was 13.1% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 180 basis point increase over the prior year.","Now I'd like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and the second quarter.","We are updating our guidance based on our good first quarter results, the divestiture of our blood screening business, and the stronger U.S. dollar, which is affecting all multinational companies. With the divestiture and FX changes, it's important to understand that our expectations for our ongoing, base business are consistent with our initial constant currency guidance. We remain on track for a good year with mid-single-digit sales growth for our core business.","Now, let's start with that updated revenue guidance for the full year 2017. Given the number of moving pieces, I'm going to take a minute to walk everyone from our previous guidance to our current guidance. As a reminder, we previously guided to reported sales of $2.94 billion to $2.98 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 4% and 5.5%. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened materially since we gave our initial guidance back in November. Given our relatively higher proportion of U.S. sales, currency represents less of a headwind for us than most of our peers. Nonetheless, based on recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency fluctuations are driving an incremental reduction of just over $20 million to our previous revenue guidance. This applies to our core business, excluding blood.","Now let's fold in the much larger impact of the blood screening divestiture. Since the deal closed yesterday, at the end of January, we are essentially removing from our full-year forecast eight months of regular blood screening sales. But we do expect some trailing, low-margin revenue, mainly related to raw material and instrument supply that we will continue providing. We forecast this trailing revenue to total $15 million to $25 million for February through the remainder of the year. So taking into account our first quarter actuals and relative to our last blood screening revenue forecast of $240 million, the net impact of the divestiture is a revenue reduction of between $130 million and $140 million.","Said another way, we now expect to record blood screening revenue of between $100 and $110 million this fiscal year, with the majority of it in the first and second quarters. Factoring in a few other minor adjustments, this leads to our new revenue guidance of $2.785 billion to $2.825 billion. Underlying this, our base business remains healthy. For example, if you were to exclude at the midpoint $105 million of blood screening sales from 2017, and also remove blood from last year's results, our new guidance would imply constant currency growth for our core business of between 4.2% and 5.8% on an apples-to-apples comparisons.","Now, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect sales of between $675 million and $685 million. Again, this includes one month of regular blood screening sales, plus a portion of the trailing revenue related to raw material and instrument supply that I mentioned before. So in total, we expect blood screening to contribute between $25 million and $30 million to our second quarter reported results.","To give you a sense of guidance for our underlying core business, if you were to back out $27 million of blood screening sales at the midpoint, and also remove blood screening revenue from last year, our quarterly guidance implies constant currency growth rates for our core business of between 3.6% and 5.3% on an apples-to-apples basis. As part of this, let me remind you that Surgical sales are somewhat seasonal, so we expect them to decline sequentially from our first quarter to our second quarter, like in prior years.","Now let\u2019s move on to our revised EPS guidance. As a reminder, we previously guided to earnings per share between $2.12 and $2.16. Using the same logic as before, we are essentially removing eight months of regular blood screening EPS from our previous forecast. Then we add back a small amount of earnings from the $15 million to $25 million of trailing revenue that I mentioned. These sales will come in at lower-than-normal margins, so relative to our initial guidance, we forecast the net reduction in EPS from the blood screening divestiture will be about $0.21 for the full year in 2017.","Factoring in a slight headwind from currency, we arrive at our new, non-GAAP EPS guidance of between $1.90 and $1.94, which includes roughly $0.13 related to blood screening. Again by way of illustration, if you were to back out blood screening EPS from this year's forecast and last year's results, our forecast implies reported EPS growth rates for our core business of between 11.3% and 13.8% on an apples-to-apples basis.","Now, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.46, which includes roughly $0.03 of regular earnings from our blood business that was just divested. Using the same methodology as before, this implies reported EPS growth rates for our core business of between 13.5% and 16.2% on an apples-to-apples basis.","Our new guidance assumes a full-year tax rate of approximately 31%, and diluted shares outstanding of between 287 million and 289 million for the year. Our guidance does not assume any additional capital deployment, although we do intend to explore repurchasing some of our remaining convertible notes, and our common stock. We're not incorporating any potential benefit into our guidance for two reasons. First, the magnitude and timing depend on market and other conditions. And second, since we're already four months into the year, the 2017 impact is likely to be very small.","As you update your forecasts, we would again encourage you to model around the middle of our guidance ranges. Not only have we incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecast, we also have some added uncertainty around the trailing blood screening revenue.","Now, before we open the call for questions, I'd like to conclude by saying that we are off to a good start in 2017. We began our fiscal year with quarterly revenues that exceeded expectations, encouraging results from key future growth drivers including new products and international, and earnings that grew at a multiple of sales. Finally, we completed a divestiture that strengthens our balance sheet while accelerating the company\u2019s growth rates.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard","Hello. Thank you. So, first off, I'm curious. If you can comment on whether or not your M&A pipeline has built since you announced the blood divestiture.","Steve MacMillan","We've had a lot more calls from bankers, but I would say we are pursuing the same plan. We've got a lot more people that we meet with -- at various conferences. But, at the end of the day Dan, we are keeping very focused, very disciplined and going about things to see where we've always been.","Dan Leonard","Okay. Thank you for that. And not an entirely related follow-up, but can you comment on as it relates to your order book for Tomo, may be any thoughts on the hospital capital spending environment and whether any of your customers have shown any more uncertainty given all the changes, potential ACA and what we have here?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Dan. We continue to be in very close touch with our sales folks around, are they sensing anything changes in the environment, we are not hearing much or anything. And I will tell you, I think we continue to feel very good about the bookings that are still coming in on the business. So, that can always change. But, nothing at all at this point.","Operator","We will hear next from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the molecular franchise maybe start with sexual health and just anything worth pointing out in terms of the trends with some of the protest you have there?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think at a high level when you see the 8.8% global growth in molecular, we continue to feel very good both domestically and really internationally and a lot of that is -- frankly, it's all the core business. It's the women's health assays. Internationally the virals are starting to contribute Jack, but there is still a very small and we've got a few ancillary assays here and there. But, for the most part, it is our core women's health assays driving the growth.","Bob McMahon","Yes. I think Jack just add to that. If I look at the core assays that we have both on a domestic and global basis, I would say we grew faster than market. We gained share and the three key assays that we have and we are already looking for number one share in CTGC, HPV and [indiscernible]. And I think we continue to feel very good about continued piece of our Panther placements as well. So, I think that bodes well for the future.","Jack Meehan","Great. That's helpful. And then, just want to follow-up Bob on the share repurchase, I was surprised that just with the upcoming proceeds from blood screening that you weren't a little bit more active in the quarter, you thought about putting it to work. Just your philosophy there and any update thoughts, would be great? Thanks.","Bob McMahon","First, obviously with that, we weren't able to even if we wanted to because we were in blackout for the large majority of the time. But, that being said, I think our priorities continue to be Jack that we want to clean up the balance sheet. We talked about the converts, we have taken now the first tranche in those converts by doing that it also helps with the dilution.","So we will continue to look at that and then also be very disciplined that's around M&A and growth and augmenting our R&D activities and be opportunistic with the share repurchase. And that's kind of the order of priority. So, we are looking at all of those levers throughout the course of the year, timing is always difficult to predict on those things. But, rest assure that we plan to utilize those capital -- those proceeds in a various ways.","Operator","We will hear now from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Bill Quirk","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Bill.","Bob McMahon","Hey, Bill.","Bill Quirk","So, I guess the first question is on [NovaSeek] [ph] kind of continues to surprise the upside despite kind of lapping some of the competitive dynamics. Can you just talk maybe a little bit about what's your expectations are for, I guess surgical broadly and [NovaSeek] [ph] in particular here as we think about 2017?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Bill. I think we have been very pleased with what our team had already done by stopping the declines of NovaSure and trying to get into a modest growth business before the competitive withdrawal. We have clearly benefited for the last almost four quarters from a competitive withdraw that's inflated those growth rates. But, we still think it can be a growth business. And MyoSure as well continues to probably defy a lot of expectation. So, we continue to be very, very encouraged by what this business can do. Now, after eight straight quarters of double-digit growth, certainly that the comps and the stacked comps and everything else continue to get tougher and tougher. But, we feel good about where the business is going and good about the international opportunity and good about the fact that we are just launching NovaSure Advance that will bring some new life into the franchise.","Having said all of that, we are clearly assuming a return to single-digit growth here as we go into the second half of the year and probably a more modest growth rate from what we have been able to achieve.","Bob McMahon","I was going to say Bill if you -- if you recall the competitive product was first recalled at the end of the -- our fiscal first quarter and then was permanently taken off the market in our second quarter. So we would expect Q3 and Q4 to be at a more normalized growth rate to Steve's point.","Bill Quirk","Okay. Got it. I appreciate the color on NovaSure, no question. And then, just secondly for me, I guess thinking a little longer range, it's more of a housekeeping question, I guess. That the raw material supply going to Grifols that's not a one time or a one year phenomenon, all right? That's presumably something that should continue albeit at low margins in 2018 and beyond. Thanks.","Bob McMahon","Yes, Bill. That's right. I mean, it's a combination of a couple of things. Probably the biggest piece is actually the Panther systems. And the spare parts associated with those, so we will continue to be a partner there for a period of time as well as that raw material that we just talked about. But, that is a -- we would expect that to continue on into beyond 2017 for a period of time, yes.","Operator","And from Evercore ISI, we will hear from Vijay Kumar.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, thanks Vijay.","Vijay Kumar","Steve maybe going back to that M&A question on -- if I think about -- you have the proceeds, right? If you think about pause the uncertainty whether it's from water tax or from a corporate tax reform, is that an impediment or hurdle when you think about available asset?","Steve MacMillan","Not really. I think we are going to continue to look at the assets. There is so much uncertainty now certainly around whether it's tax rates around everything else. We are going to continue to look at everything on its own merits and continue to be very disciplined in what we are looking at. But, we have the money, it doesn't mean we are going to rush out and spend it.","Vijay Kumar","And just a follow-up for that. is that the net impact of water tax and corporate tax, is that a -- in general that's a positive benefit for Hologic, somewhere around 500 bps of production tax rate, is that how should we be thinking about it?","Bob McMahon","Yes, Vijay. This is Bob. It is a positive for us when you think about our manufacturing and obviously our revenues are largely U.S. based but also when you look at our COGS, it's roughly 70:30 U.S. international. So we would expect to be benefiting. It's hard to put a number on that because we don't know what the actual base rate is. But, rest assured we would expect to be a net beneficiary associated with any kind of border tax adjustments.","Operator","We will hear next from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. Steve, can you talk a little bit about international breast health flat in the quarter but presumably you got a timeline for that to start to grow, is there right management team there. So can you just talk a little bit about when you think that may start growing again?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Tycho. As we said, earlier on diagnostics and surgical probably leading the growth internationally given the fact they are more direct than dealer. Having said that, we are seeing some pockets of building and even our European Breast Health business, where we have put a new leader in place nine or ten months ago we are starting to see some better results there. But you also have other businesses like Latin America that are little more fluctuating. So I think as we look fundamentally, we feel the business getting stronger and I think it will slowly start to tick up over the course of this year.","Yes, it's probably going to be more 2018, 2019 before it can hit more of a stride. And again, just as we work through dealer issues and other things. But, feel we are definitely on the right path and making good progress.","Tycho Peterson","And then, from my follow-up on skeletal health, you had a tough quarter there last quarter as well. It sounds like things have turned, can you maybe talk what's driven the softness and what you can really do to -- from that business?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think we probably took our eye off of the ball just a little bit. We have been continuing to evolve the sales organization in the U.S. And frankly, it sold in conjunction in a lot of cases with our Breast Health portfolio. As we launch our firm and have the managers focused on other new products, I think we would probably took our eye a little bit off the ball on staying as focused is also a little bit of competitive activity in the see arm space. But, in general I think just we reported as a segment but it is managed more as a product line to some degree and a relatively small one and just didn't -- haven't delivered for the last couple of quarters. So, but we feel good, the order trends were starting to pick up here.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Thanks Tycho.","Operator","We will hear next from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Hey, good afternoon guys. Thank you. How are you?","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Isaac.","Isaac Ro","Yes. One question on molecular and maybe a follow up on business development. On the molecular side, I think between yourselves and Roche, there has been pretty good growth trend from a couple of the major players this quarter. Curious, if there is a market share dynamic that you think is meaningful or is it really just market growth, we obviously don't have good visibility into every player, but certainly seems like you guys are holding your own against some of the bigger companies?","Steve MacMillan","Isaac, our first assumption whenever we are doing reasonably well is always that the market is doing well. Sometimes after the fact that it actually looks like share has been -- has helped. I mean clearly Roche continues to do well. They are a very strong player. We think we have certainly done okay. But the market was probably half of this in last quarter, we don't have complete visibility but I would always rather assume, it was that then be taking credit for share.","Bob McMahon","Having said that, I mean just -- I think the market dynamic has been healthy, but if you look at the major products that we track the three big ones, we definitely believe we are a share gainer over time in all three.","Isaac Ro","I think it's helpful. Thank you. And then, just a follow-up on --","Steve MacMillan","I always look to come out after the fact as you know, the same with Genius 3D.","Isaac Ro","You got it. Thank you. And then on the business development side, you guys talked a little bit about your plan to invest time in resources there. How do you feel about your ability to execute on M&A to be sent that -- interesting deals you want to flow across your radar tomorrow? Did you feel like you will be able to go ahead and execute on them given the balance sheet? And really I\u2019m just talking about the team from the senior level, do you have all the people in place and will appreciate to the extent that you can comment just remind us the metrics that you guys typically tried it to apply on ROIC versus the EPS accretion when you are evaluating these deals? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, the highest level I put the \u2013 that we do have the team in place now we added our final addition was a Head of Corporate Business Development and I liking it a lot of what we've done internationally with our leaders that over the course of the last year, we put the foundations in place, we put the right people in place. That I do think we\u2019re in good place to execute on deals now. Each division has a very good business development lead and then we\u2019ve got the resource at corporate. So we\u2019ve quietly been building that up and we\u2019ve looked at a lot of deals and I\u2019ve learned long ago from my mentor at Stryker, John Brown.","In most cases, the best decision on business development is no, and we'll continue to be very disciplined, but the flow and the amount of time that certainly Bob and I've spent on deals over the last six months much, much better. And I think as we sit here, I probably will be surprised if 12 months from now if we haven't some something, but continuing to stay focused.","And to your second point, ROIC is going to continue to be the key part and then ultimately we\u2019ll launch something that is top-line and bottom-line accretive in growth rate for the company. So we'll be looking at things that could accelerate our top and bottom-line growth, not just up for example that would make us bigger. But at the end of the day, it's going to be about both growth rate and ROIC will be the big things we will be looking at as well as obviously being able to leverage our existing channels is always going to be kind of the first port of call.","Operator","We'll hear next from Jon Groberg with UBS.","Jon Groberg","Great. Thanks a million. Just two related questions for you if you don't mind. The first is if you could maybe give a little bit of more detailed update on the firm and some of the other new products how that did. And then, more broadly I'm curious one of the question works around logic has been some of the assets whether all kind of women's health don't necessarily fit together. I'm wondering if you can just talk about, are you finding synergies or finding ways to better find revenue synergies whether it would be to the OB\/GYN channel across all the different products. I'm just kind of curious how that sales development is going with your existing assets and kind of what opportunities you might think in the future. Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Jon. I think the first part in terms of our firm, I think we feel very good about each of our products continuing to build momentum. And I think as we said about things like a firm, the firms going to add to our growth here in 2017. It will be bigger in 2018 than it will be in 2017, it will be probably even bigger in 2019 than it is in 2018. So I think we're in the early stages of all of these launches like virals like a firm and then things that will be coming on behind these. So feeling good about that.","In terms of the leverage, I think one of the more obvious paths we\u2019ve been able to leverage is in Genius 3D mammography for example where we\u2019ve been able to detail to OB\/GYNs that we have this technology. And in the past all we did is call on radiology. So we are looking and there are opportunities where sales forces are at least talking about some of the other products in our portfolio. And we're looking for them where they opportunistically exist. We\u2019re not forcing synergies where they don't exist.","Bob McMahon","And that said even though there is not a tremendous amount of cost synergies. We're still a very profitable business as you know, Jon.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. What we also like to as you look forward in terms of our diagnostics business, which is on the molecular side and also the cytology side and then you've got an imaging side. As we look at where science is going the ability to have people that have some general expertise in different modalities of diagnostics across women's health, we think ultimately there are some opportunities that may play out deeper into the future.","Jon Groberg","Thanks.","Operator","And from Cowen & Company, we'll move to Doug Schenkel.","Doug Schenkel","Hi guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Both things I want to talk about are specific to diagnostics. In the U.S. and the quarter with some extra days we might have expected a bit more growth. I was just hoping that you might be able to provide a little more color on how things broke out between blood, cytology and U.S. molecular specifically.","And then on a more positive note, international sales was strong in diagnostics. I know it's early to say too much about how things are progressing with the international sales force and how they are progressing, but it would just be good to hear a little bit more about whether this is driven largely by instrument placements or whether utilization is also ramping up. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Doug. I think the highest level in terms of the U.S., lot of our customers we actually have sort of standing orders every month and the extra days didn't have as much of an impact as we probably would have thought. We traditionally do very little business in that week between Christmas and New Year. So, it helped a little bit. It would have been nice to help more maybe, but again I think a fairly light week. Internationally, Panther placements I think continue to be probably the single biggest driver, utilization is starting to get up, but we're definitely getting some new customer wins that's starting to drive that.","Bob McMahon","Yes. I was going to say Doug a couple of other things to think about we had mentioned the -- one the headwind of the cystic fibrosis product that we are going against. So if you actually strip that out that was couple of million dollars in the quarter last year that didn\u2019t happen this year. That would add at least the 0.5 of growth. In addition to your point around blood actually declined in the U.S., high single-digit. And so despite the sales of the Zika and so forth, it was still down and so that is actually depressing the overall diagnostics business and if you strip that out the business would be a lot better in the U.S.","Operator","We'll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Steve MacMillan","Hi David.","Scott Lange","Hi, guys. This is actually Scott Lange asking for David. Two quick ones from me, Steve or Bob, the 2Q revenue guidance adjusted for blood screening and the [stud] [[ph]] sales seems a little light versus our assumptions. Are there any timing related dynamics to consider in the second quarter or pull forward into the first quarter?","Steve MacMillan","There is not pull forward I can promise you that. I think it's our toughest comp. I think we're going to easier comps in the third and fourth quarters. So it's a little bit below our annual guidance, but\u2026","Bob McMahon","Yes. And the other thing is Scott, when you're looking at -- when you're modeling our surgical business typically the fourth quarter -- calendar quarter, which is our first quarter is the largest quarter there and you'll have a sequential decline for our second quarter that happened last year we're anticipating it happening in this year. So when you look quarter-to-quarter that's when you would see that core business sequential decline largely because of the surgical business. Now versus a year ago, we still expected to grow, but you do see that kind of step down.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. That business is becoming a bigger chunk. It probably is a little bit more pronounced.","Scott Lange","Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up for Bob, regarding the dilution from blood screening, does an ASR not make sense to lock -- in order to lock-in some dilution offsets and can you also comment quickly on the margin dilution you expect from the overall blood screening divesture? Thank you.","Bob McMahon","Yes. Every company has -- each indication or instances is different around whether an ASR is appropriate or not. What I would say is we have -- we still look at our balance sheet and say hey, we can clean it up with the converts and simplify our balance sheet there. And I think given the short-term nature of those things getting ready to be callable. I think that's probably our first priority versus an ASR.","And then, again, as Steve was talking about we're really looking at opportunities for growth as well. And so I think those would probably take priority over the share repurchase and we think that there maybe some opportunities as Steve said between now and the end of the year or year from now we would expect to be doing something in both of those cases, so that's kind of how we're thinking about that.","On the margin perspective to your point, we do -- blood was a very profitable business as you know, our margins will decline. Again on a core apples-to-apples basis, we expect margin to increase year-over-year, but you would see a slight decline versus year ago on an actual reported basis. Less than probably 100 basis points given that we do have still at 4 plus months worth of blood in our business, but that kind of -- should give you a kind of a perspective.","Operator","We'll hear next from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. Question on OUS infrastructure, you talked about some of the heads that you have in place now in kind of the four territories that you decided, but could you talk about any added investments that are needed to either people or infrastructure over the next several quarters and how you think about profitability OUS versus U.S.?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. We've got the right leaders in place. We're investing in people -- adding sales people were needed and all of that, but we're all self funding effectively that and just being rigorous like we are in every decision we make add few, so we're not coming out and saying hey, we're going to take a quarter or a year half while we make investments. We're self funding those as things take off in one market, we'll add some reps for example in another market and build it that way.","So, I think we feel good, overall to your second part of that question, profitability internationally is lower. We typically on a margin basis, we typically have a combination of factors from some lower selling prices, we're also by the way because we produced a lot of our products in the U.S, the strong dollar is not \u2013 not our friend as it relates to international margin. And also going through dealers particularly in the Breast Health, all of those serve to depress the gross margin, which therefore as our business continues to grow and international picks up, the ability for that much more expansion of gross margin starts to moderate.","Bob McMahon","Yes. Couple of follow-on things on that Brian, I think one of the things that's really exciting is the opportunity now that we do have these regional heads and they are going to be able to prioritize the investments across the regions rather than having the spread them across the globe and that's what those teams are doing right now and I think that actually-- we\u2019re actually increased the productivity of the spend that's there.","And then on the second piece while international is lower -- lower margin than the U.S., year-over-year, we do expect margins to expand on a global basis. So we're compensating for that.","Brian Weinstein","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","We'll go now to Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe couple on Breast Health and then two quick tax questions. Just on Genius installed base, I'm not sure you\u2019ve given at the end of the quarter, but if that's available that would be helpful. And Steve you mentioned share gains -- continued share gains in the U.S. driving Breast Health, I'm just wondering what the outlook is going forward for ongoing share gains.","And then on tax, I'm just wondering what the political environment. It looks like a logic could be a big beneficiary as it relates to both border tax adjustment, but also the reduction in statutory tax rate, so any thoughts around that would be helpful. Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Anthony. On the Genius placements, we only provide the numbers on an annualized basis, so we did that at the end of last quarter. We don't provide quarterly numbers. Having said that, it grew modestly in the U.S. this quarter versus the same quarter last year, so continuing to grow. And on the share front, I think we continue to feel good that we are probably punching above our weight and continue to feel good about what we're doing in terms of market share gains there.","Bob McMahon","Yes. Steve, let me add in a shadow out to our Breast Health team here in the U.S. is just doing a fantastic job around price and price discipline. So despite two competitors at a lower price, our pricing continues to now only be stable, it was actually up slight in this last quarter. I think that speaks to the value of our products that competitive differentiation that we have in the ongoing clinical and technical support that we have with our product. So I think that's one of the hidden gems that are helping to continue to drive that business.","And then on tax, as you rightly assume, we do think that we will be a beneficiary of whether it would be kind of the border tax or more -- any type of corporate tax reform. There is still a lot of details to be kind of figured out there. But one thing, I think we're probably in pretty good shape given not only our geographic footprint from a revenue perspective probably even more so. So, our geographic footprint from a manufacturing essentially all of our -- almost all of our Breast Health business and diagnostics business has produced here in the U.S -- our surgical business outside the U.S., but that's obviously our smallest piece and as I said before roughly 70% of all of our COGS, M&A is out of the U.S. So I think we would benefit nicely given the potential for corporate tax reform.","Operator","And from Leerink Partners, we'll move to Richard Newitter.","Ravi Misra","Hi, this is actually Ravi in for Rich, can you hear me okay?","Steve MacMillan","Yes, Ravi.","Ravi Misra","Hi, great. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe one on the capital deployment areas, is there any sort of limit to how much of the converts that you guys can refer just or sort of any covenants loaning the amounts that you will be able to call back? And then, I just kind of sneaking a follow-up on sort of portfolio management and strategy with the underperformance in the skeletal health business. Are you guys for now, what's your take on whether the portfolio needs to be where is that or are you continuing to evaluate the businesses for additional sales or not? And then I'm trying to get one last one in, some of our checks here are talking about strong flu season, any commentary there would be appreciated. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. We'll take the last one first and our flu related assets are very small, so that's our -- not a real impact for us. I would say I guess on the converts, there are certain limitations if you would go out and privately negotiate those creeping tender rolls and so forth it depends on. It also depends on whether the -- the holders are willing to sell. So that would happen overtime, but again within 12 months those things are all going to be callable.","And the last one I think was around skeletal and underperformance there. When I can't sell a business because it had one or two quarters of underperformance we think -- first thing is, let's fix it, we're not going to sell it in that. And the other thing is, it does have -- it's fairly integrated into our breast and skeletal -- our breast business especially around the service component and so we've got a large installed base as well as the service tax out in the field that can service both our products. So it's probably more integrated actually than even the blood business that we do just recently divested.","Bob McMahon","Callianna, I think we're coming up on 5.30 Eastern, so I think we've got time for maybe one more question.","Operator","And that will be from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik de Bruin","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Steve MacMillan","Hi, Derik.","Derik de Bruin","Hey, thanks. Couple of questions. So the cytology markets has been very tough, obviously some changes in protocol and such, is there anything that you see that can potentially sort of revitalize the business. And then also along those lines, you mentioned some of the products in the perinatal market, are you looking like pre-eclampsia or some other things in that area, can you sort of elaborate on that?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Derik. I think as it relates to cytology, the way we think about it is, flattish in the U.S. is probably about as good as, as we could expect for sometime here and as we continue to offset the extension of the intervals with our own share gains. We still do think there is opportunities outside the United States, significant opportunities that is going to be a longer term build. But when you look at the presence of liquid base cytology outside the U.S. it's still underdeveloped. So there we think we do have some opportunities.","On the perinatal piece, I would say we've got our own clinical programs and it maybe more indication related or other things that we're looking at, but we realized we've got a nice little perinatal business and a dedicated sales team there. So there are maybe some opportunities to try to drive that business, that's one of the smaller businesses that we've quietly refocused on a little bit internally so you don't forget about it and starting to feel there are maybe some opportunities for us in the coming years.","Operator","And thank you everyone.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Deb Gordon, VP of Investor Relations, Hologic. Please go ahead.","Deborah R. Gordon","Thank you, Nicole, and good morning. My name is Deborah Gordon, Vice President of Investor Relations at Hologic, and let me start by thanking you for joining us on short notice for this morning's conference call. On this call, we will briefly discuss Hologic's second quarter fiscal 2012 and Gen-Probe's first quarter 2012 results. We will then spend a majority of our time discussing the very exciting news announced in a separate press release this morning about the combination of Hologic and Gen-Probe. Please note, the replay of this call will be archived on Hologic's and Gen-Probe's respective websites through Friday, May 18. In addition, please note that the press releases and the presentations we will be reviewing on today's call are available in the Investor Relations sections of each company's website.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Hologic and Gen-Probe during the course of this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in Hologic's and Gen-Probe's safe harbor statements in their respective quarterly earnings releases and the joint announcement, all issued this morning and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also note, during this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures can also be found in both Hologic's and Gen-Probe's earnings releases, including the financial tables in the releases.","[Operator Instructions] On the call today is Rob Cascella, Hologic's President and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Muir, Hologic's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carl Hull, Gen-Probe's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. I would now like to turn the call over to Rob Cascella. Rob?","Robert A. Cascella","Well, thank you, Deb. Good morning and thank you, all, for joining us on our call to discuss the combination of Hologic and Gen-Probe. As you have seen, this morning, we announced Hologic will be acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Gen-Probe for $82.75 per share in cash. The combination was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and will create a leading Diagnostics franchise focused on women's health. As you know, Gen-Probe is a leader in Molecular Diagnostic products and services that are used to diagnose human diseases, screen donated human blood, ensure transplant compatibility and aid in biomedical research. We believe Gen-Probe is an ideal partner and strategic fit to Hologic's existing Diagnostics business and that this combination complements our focus on women's health and adds diversification to our portfolio of leading products.","I'm very pleased to be joined by Carl Hull, Gen-Probe's CEO, to discuss the rationale and exciting opportunities resulting from this transaction. Before we get into the details of the transaction, Glenn Muir is going to briefly take you through our Q2 results, which were separately announced this morning. Carl will then walk through Gen-Probe's quarterly results as well, which were also announced this morning. We will then turn to the details of the transaction. Glenn?","Glenn P. Muir","Thanks, Rob. Consolidated revenues of $471.2 million in the quarter increased $32.5 million or 7.4% from last year and were within our guidance range. We saw growth in all 4 operating segments, marking the fourth consecutive quarter in which all business segments have contributed to year-over-year growth. The FX impact this quarter was immaterial.","Turning to our operating segments, Breast Health revenues increased $12.8 million or 6.2% from last year. Product revenue growth this quarter continued to benefit from the ongoing shift to our Dimensions mammography product line from the existing installed base, the Selenia system. Our Dimensions line continues to gain traction and represented 67% of digital mammography revenue and 57% of units this quarter. Tomosynthesis upgrades represented approximately 20% of total tomo unit sales in Q2. Our target continues to be to ship 500 to 700 tomo systems in the U.S. within the first 2 years of our approval. We are well on our way after one year. We are now at 35% of our goal, and we continue to expect that we will be at 60% of the way there by the end of this fiscal year.","Our Diagnostics segment was the largest contributor to consolidated revenue growth, with an increase of $13.6 million or 9.8%. Approximately 55% of segment growth this quarter came from our core Diagnostics businesses, primarily our ThinPrep pap test, with the balance coming from our Molecular Diagnostics product line. Diagnostic sales growth benefited from our acquisition of TCT in China last year. This is the third full fiscal quarter we have owned TCT and results remain ahead of our original internal projection. We continue to expect close to 20% annual revenue growth from TCT in fiscal 2012.","Our molecular business, specifically our Cervista HPV line, increased close to 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 1\/4 of the segment's total organic growth this quarter. Our GYN Surgical segment contributed nicely to results, with year-over-year revenue growth of $5.7 million or 8%, driven by strong sales of our Myosure line, which grew 45% on a sequential quarterly basis, helped to offset slight weakness in both our NovaSure and Adiana lines.","And now for a brief review of second quarter performance on the rest of the P&L, gross margins on a non-GAAP basis were 61.2%, up 30 basis points year-over-year and below the low end of our guidance range. Despite improved margins year-over-year in 3 of our 4 operating segments this quarter, overall results relative to our expectations were pressured by the mix shift, capital equipment sales. However, we did make up with this with our operating leverage. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased $9.8 million or 7.1%. This is below our guidance range of $150 million to $155 million. We continue to target opportunities to limit the growth in operating expenses to improve our margins. And the fully diluted non-GAAP EPS was $0.33 this quarter, up 10% from $0.30 in Q2 of last year and in line with our guidance. We continue to generate strong free cash flows and ended our quarter with cash of $855 million, an increase of $142 million from the end of fiscal 2011 and up $61 million sequentially. We generated approximately $82 million in free cash this quarter, a slight decline from $97 million last quarter, mainly due to the timing of tax payment. Working capital improvement continues to be a main focus of ours. In particular, we are pleased with the improvement on our inventory turns and with our overall accounts collection this quarter, which resulted in worldwide DSOs decreasing one day from last quarter.","Now moving onto guidance. For Q3, our June quarter, we expect revenues of $475 million to $480 million, representing growth of 5% to 6% year-over-year. Our guidance assumes constant foreign currency rates with the end of this last quarter Q2. On a noncash basis, we expect gross margins of 62% to 62.5%, operating expenses of $150 million to $155 million, interest expense of approximately $10 million and an effective tax rate at 34%. All of this results in an expected non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.34. On a standalone basis for fiscal 2012, we are reaffirming total revenue guidance in a range of $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion, which represents growth of approximately 6% to 8%. We are also reaffirming the margin and expense guidance we provided last quarter and which is highlighted in our investor presentation. For EPS, we continue to expect $1.36 to $1.38 per share, which implies growth of 8% to 10% year-over-year. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Carl for a review of Gen-Probe's first quarter '12 financial results. Carl?","Carl W. Hull","Well, thank you, Glenn, and thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Before moving to our financial results, I would like first to say that this is an exciting day for Gen-Probe, our employees and our customers. The all-cash transaction announced this morning with Hologic delivers immediate value for our shareholders and represents an outstanding opportunity for our business. The Gen-Probe Board of Directors unanimously determined that this transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders and offers compelling cash value at a premium to their shares. Together, Gen-Probe and Hologic will be well positioned to offer a broad range of Diagnostic products in women's health, with an even stronger focus on the dynamic molecular diagnostics market.","As Rob will discuss, this transaction provides compelling benefits for the customers of the combined company and all employees will benefit as part of a larger diversified organization, with the necessary scale and resources to be a leader in today's rapidly evolving global health care marketplace.","As for the first quarter 2012 financial results, I'm pleased to report that Gen-Probe is off to a strong start. Both revenues and earnings in the first quarter exceeded our guidance. I will discuss our first quarter results on a non-GAAP basis. Product sales were $150.1 million in the quarter, up 9% compared to the prior year period. This solid growth in product sales led to total revenues of $153.4 million in the quarter, which exceeded the forecast of $148 million to $152 million that we provided in our last call in February. The strong top line performance during the quarter resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55, which also exceeded our last guidance range, which was $0.48 to $0.52. Clinical diagnostic sales were $94.9 million, up 7% compared to the prior year period. Our APTIMA Combo 2 assay for detecting Chlamydia and Gonorrhea, continued its long record of strong performance, growing at a low teens rate worldwide compared with the prior year period, once again, as a result of market share gains. With APTIMA Combo 2 serving as a solid foundation for our women's health franchise, we are excited to be in the early stages of commercializing 2 newer products we expect to drive the long-term growth of the business.","During the quarter, we saw accelerating adoption of our APTIMA Trichomonas assay, the only amplified molecular test on the market for this parasitic STD. As you will recall, our Trichomonas assay can test the same samples collected for the APTIMA Combo 2 assay and runs on the same TIGRIS systems. Although we are still in the early days of launch, we are also optimistic about the prospects for APTIMA HPV to be a significant growth driver in the future. We believe our message of best-in-class specificity, coupled with best-in-class automation, is generating significant interest among our lab customers. This month, we submitted a PMA for our APTIMA HPV genotyping assay. We expect the launch of this product in 2013 as a complement to our screening assay for those physicians and labs interested in identifying genotypes 16 and 18\/45. Rounding out our discussion of clinical diagnostics, we mentioned on our last call that Prodesse revenues were impacted by a mild flu season, and that was also the case in the first quarter. Revenues were down a few million dollars year-over-year, and you will likely notice the effect on product gross margins as our influenza products are highly profitable. Turning to the Diagnostics pipeline, we are preparing to build on the success of our well-established TIGRIS system with the launch of our automated, fully integrated PANTHER in the U.S., which is pending FDA approval. We believe we're in the very last stage of the FDA review and are optimistic that PANTHER will be approved in the first half of 2012, although there obviously can be no guarantees. And we believe [ph] we expect to launch PANTHER with our APTIMA Combo 2 assay for detection of Chlamydia and Gonorrhea, and we have programs underway to expand the menu aggressively.","Now let's turn to blood screening revenue in the first quarter. Sales were $52.5 million, up 12% compared to the prior year period. This resulted primarily from increased shipments of both assays and instruments to Novartis, our [indiscernible] partner in blood screening. Compared to the prior year period, almost half the growth this quarter came from increased instrument orders. We believe the fundamentals of our blood screening business remains strong, and we are encouraged by potential growth opportunities in emerging markets, especially Asia. With a strong start to the year overall, multiple new assay launches and the anticipated approval of our PANTHER system, we are excited about our prospects for sustaining growth in 2012 and beyond.","Now let me turn to quarterly expenses, which I will discuss on a non-GAAP basis. The corresponding GAAP results are in our press release. Gross margin on product sales was 65.1% in the first quarter compared to 69.7% in the prior year period. This decrease was attributable to a few things: including increased sales of the low margin instruments to our blood screening partner, Novartis; some onetime manufacturing variances; and lower sales of our high-margin Prodesse influenza products. Research and development expenses for the first quarter were $28.6 million, down 1% compared to the prior year period. Marketing and sales expenses in the first quarter were $19 million, up 15% compared to the prior year period, due mainly to expansion of our women's health commercial infrastructure to support anticipated sales growth. General and administrative expenses were $17.8 million in the first quarter, 6% higher than in the prior year period, mainly due to increased litigation expenses. Total other income in the first quarter was $2.1 million, an increase of $1.7 million, primarily attributable to higher net realized gains on sales of marketable securities.","So altogether on the bottom line, we posted $0.55 of non-GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter, which was comfortably ahead of the guidance we gave in our last call.","Now I'd like to turn to a brief discussion of our 2012 financial guidance, which we are simplifying due to our pending acquisition by Hologic. As a reminder, our guidance is on a non-GAAP basis. We remain on track to achieve the 2012 full year revenue and earnings goals that we outlined in our February call. As a reminder, these targets calls for total revenues of between $630 million and $655 million and fully diluted earnings per share of between $2.50 and $2.68 on a non-GAAP basis. For the second quarter of 2012 specifically, we forecast the revenues will increase by a couple of million dollars sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2012, and that earnings per share will total between $0.55 and $0.58 on a non-GAAP basis.","Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Rob.","Robert A. Cascella","Thank you, Carl. Well, this is truly an exciting day for all of us at Hologic and Gen-Probe. As you can see from our agenda, on Slide 4, the remainder of today's call will focus on the transaction summary, strategic rationale, financial highlights and next steps for our companies. We will then open up the line for questions.","Turning to Slide 5. Hologic and Gen-Probe are a compelling combination, driving enhanced growth through strong marketing and distribution, an excellent product portfolio and continued investment in R&D. This is an exciting opportunity for the shareholders, customers and employees of both companies. Specifically, this transaction combines best-in-class technology with strong market presence and global distribution to more effectively target the rapidly growing molecular diagnostics market, strengthen Hologic's Diagnostic business through the addition of Gen-Probe's broad product portfolio and automation platforms. More specifically, this gives Hologic critical mass in the molecular diagnostics market and makes Hologic the largest diagnostic company focused on women's health. It enables Hologic's direct sales and dealer network internationally to further drive adoption of Gen-Probe's tests in both developed and emerging markets around the world. It will deliver compelling economics with a strong growth and margin profile, and it is expected to be $0.20 accretive in Hologic's adjusted earnings per share in the first fiscal year following the close of the transaction and significantly more accretive thereafter. It is also expected to be accretive to top and bottom line growth rates. And finally, to generate significant cash flow, allowing rapid deleveraging of acquisition debt.","Moving to Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, under the terms of the transaction, Hologic will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Gen-Probe for $82.75 per share. The total enterprise value of the transaction is approximately $3.7 billion, including the assumption of debt. This is an all-cash transaction that will be funded through available cash and additional financing through term loans and high yield securities. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2012, subject to approval by Gen-Probe's shareholders, as well as other customary closing conditions, including HSR and other necessary foreign clearances. We believe the only jurisdictions to review the transaction are the United States and Germany.","Now for a deeper dive into the compelling strategic rationale for this transaction. Slide 8 demonstrates at a high level how Gen-Probe's portfolio fits very well with Hologic's area of focus in screening and diagnostics, with an emphasis on women's health. The transaction builds upon Hologic's existing capabilities by adding Gen-Probe's portfolio of molecular diagnostic tests for STDs. The transaction allows us to utilize Gen-Probe's superior automation platforms of TIGRIS and PANTHER, as well as the APTIMA line of Chlamydia and Gonorrhea tests, and newer [ph] assays for HPV and Trichomonas testing. In addition, Gen-Probe's PROCLEIX line of HIV, HPV and West Nile Virus blood screening products allows Hologic to participate in a large market with an attractive financial profile and potential for international growth. This transaction also moves Hologic into the adjacent diagnostic markets of organic transplant and infectious disease. These are new markets for Hologic that also offer new opportunities for growth. The combined business will have the ability to accelerate innovation and bring important new products to markets sooner than either company could achieve on its own.","Turning to Slide 9. This transaction enables us to offer a combined class-leading cervical cancer screening solution, with Cervista playing a key role serving lower volume hospitals and cytology labs, while APTIMA HPV running on the TIGRIS and PANTHER platforms will serve high-volume customers benefiting from automation and menu. This bifurcated market approach will also play a valuable role in international markets to address both centralized and decentralized lab models. So how does it all come together?","Turning to Slide 10. We will have a highly complementary combined sales and marketing organization. In addition to merging of laboratory sales promoting our entire portfolio of diagnostic products, Hologic's physician sales team will be instrumental in growing test utilization, driving compliance and communicating screening guidelines, all to increase overall organic growth.","Now to turn to Slide 11. Consistent with Hologic's international expansion strategy, we intend to grow our Gen-Probe's products in markets where training and support infrastructure already exist. Internationally, the sales of Gen-Probe's products will be driven by a sales force with nearly 400 direct representatives and 135 dealers around the world. We believe Hologic's strong presence in China alone represents an outstanding opportunity for future growth.","I will now hand the call back over to Glenn to speak in detail about the financials and then I'll come back and talk about integration. Glenn?","Glenn P. Muir","Thanks, Rob. Turning now to the financial highlights on Slide 13. The transaction is EPS accretive, accelerates our growth, diversifies our revenue, provides significant synergies and enhances our cash flow. Through this transaction, we are poised to create significant long term value for Hologic's shareholder. If you'll turn to Slide 14 with me, I'll walk through each of these in more detail. Gen-Probe employs approximately 1,400 people, with projected revenues for 2012 estimated between $630 million and $655 million. The projected annual pro forma LTM revenue of the combined company is expected to total approximately $2.4 billion, with combined adjusted EBITDA of approximately $822 million. We expect the combination to be $0.20 accretive to Hologic's non-GAAP earnings per share with the first full year after close.","Turning to Slide 15. Gen-Probe has a consistent track record of growth. From 2007 to 2011, Gen-Probe's revenue increased 9.4% on a compounded annual growth rate, and their adjusted EBITDA increased 9.5%. This transaction will accelerate our top and bottom line growth. In addition, we think our combined company will be poised for sustained growth given the strength of our current product portfolio, our international coverage, attractive opportunities for expansion, the incremental upside we expect to achieve from cross-selling opportunities and our continued commitment to investing in R&D in order to drive innovation.","As you can see on Slide 16, the combined company will have a diversified portfolio of products, with the core focus on Diagnostics and women's imaging. On a pro-forma basis, 50% of our revenue will be in Diagnostics, 38% in women's imaging and 12% in surgical. Our Diagnostics business will be focused on the highest volume screening diagnostic tests in the market. As you can see, our emphasis continues to be on women's health, accounting for 86% of the combined company's pro forma revenue.","Turning to Slide 17, we believe this transaction will create compelling synergies. We expect that we'll be generating annual cost synergies of approximately $75 million within 3 years following the close of the transaction, $40 million in cost synergies anticipated in year one. Synergies include cost efficiencies, overhead consolidation and shared resources. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect this transaction to be financially accretive to cash earnings per share within the first 12 months of closing.","Turning now to Slide 18 and taking a look at our balance sheet. As we always have, we are taking a disciplined approach to our balance sheet. Post-transaction, Hologic will continue to be in a strong liquidity position, with over $600 million of cash and pro forma net leverage of 5.3x. By the end of fiscal 2012, this September, we expect net leverage to drop to just under 5x. Looking to the graph, combined company expects to have strong operating cash flow, which will be used primarily to reduce debt. And importantly, we expect Hologic to return to pre-transaction debt levels within 3 years.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Rob.","Robert A. Cascella","Thanks, Glenn. In terms of next steps on Slide 20, our management team is focused on a quick and seamless transition for Hologic, Gen-Probe and our combined customers. Following the close of the transaction, Gen-Probe will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hologic. We also intend to retain Gen-Probe's senior management, maintain a significant presence in San Diego. A dedicated project integration planning team will be put in place, and we expect a smooth transition. Well, in summary, the combination of these 2 companies creates a formidable presence in the molecular diagnostic market, accretive to growth, margins and earnings, this addition to Hologic will create the largest diagnostic company focused on women's health. Hologic will now be a market leader in the testing of STDs, as well as having access to several new adjacent growth markets. Strong synergies will enhance the already attractive earnings and cash flow profile of the combined business.","We will now be pleased to take questions as time permits. We would like to stay focused on the combination of Hologic and Gen-Probe and keep the Q&A session focused on the transaction. If you have questions about the results and outlook announced today, please contact the respective IR departments of Hologic and Gen-Probe after the call. Thank you. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First off, I guess a question would be, I guess, can you elaborate perhaps a little bit on HPV given obviously both companies have a test here. And then also, just kind of what happens to some of the non-PMA products like the LIFECODES business and legacy Prodesse?","Robert A. Cascella","With respect to the HPV product line, as we indicated in the -- in one of our slides, Bill, we really are looking at this as a bifurcation strategy, where we'll approach the higher end high volume segment of the market with the Gen-Probe assays and automation and really use Cervista in the low to mid-tier, where we have had great traction and great success. In addition to that, we believe that the o-U.S. market, those that are decentralized, is a great market opportunity for Cervista. And as those markets consolidate, we see the transition to APTIMA as being appropriate as well. So it is really a combination strategy that allows us to use both assays in a most effective way.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then on the second part of the question?","Robert A. Cascella","On the second part of the question, repeat please?","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","What do you do with some of the non-PMA businesses, Rob, like the LIFECODES HLA business and Prodesse?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, we're going to continue to maintain those. It's early on in the transaction, but we think that there's strong opportunities in those markets and with those technologies, and we view that, although outside of our core focus on women's health, we would like to exercise those to their fullest.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bill Bonello with RBC Capital Markets.","Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question, I guess to both Rob and Carl about the way you see the HPV market playing out and if that influenced this deal at all. Initially, we've been thinking that HPV would be a decision completely left to the labs and then it seems like maybe the big labs are thinking it's going to be a little bit more of a physician preference call, and just curious if you guys are thinking that and if that impacts the value or why you did the deal at all?","Carl W. Hull","Bill, it's Carl. I think it's a great question and obviously, we thought a lot about that. To me, it's the best of both worlds, right? You don't have to take a position on which part of that thesis is correct. Is it the lab driving it? Or is it the physician driving it? We have a unique opportunity now in this combination to cover both ends of the spectrum, and we will do so in ways that meet the needs of both of those important segments of customers. Rob, I don't know if you care to add anything to that?","Robert A. Cascella","I think that's very accurate, and we're very optimistic that we can drive compliance, as well as utilization with our physician sales team and really leverage the already wonderful presence that Gen-Probe has at the lab front.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two quick questions. Glenn, you talked a lot about accretion on the call, but I wonder if you could help us understand how you see the return on invested capital and IRR of this transaction at years 3 and 5 would be helpful. A little more granularity versus accretion. And the second question is maybe for Carl and Rob. In terms of the blood screening business, which obviously drives a vast majority or significant portion of Gen-Probe's profitability, could you just help us understand how that business is strategic to Hologic?","Glenn P. Muir","David, let me start off with that question if I could then. I think accretion is an important part of the component here. We've really focused, I think, initially on how quickly we become accretive with this combination, which is in part, exciting to us. But it doesn't just stop at the first year. It becomes even more accretive as the companies work together going into years 2 and 3. So there's a lot of effort around that area. When it comes to our return on invested capital, I mean we haven't really changed our focus on what's important to us as far as ensuring we have very positive NPV deals that we look at, the desired return, and we've talked a little bit about that before. It might be too early to get into that on this call. But this fits all the parameters that we normally look at, and in addition, provides all the strategic benefits of kind of enhancing our growth profile. So for us, we're pretty excited about the financial return.","Robert A. Cascella","And David, with respect to the blood screening business, absolutely, not a part of the women's health focus, but a very stable, very profitable business from a U.S. perspective, and we truly believe that on an o-U.S. perspective, as national screening programs begin to emerge in some of the, the now developing markets, we think there's opportunity for strong growth in that area as well. So over time, we believe that it will be a strong contributor to both top line and bottom line.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Glenn, I'm sorry, I just want to come back again to returns. So can this transaction get, let's say, a 10% return back to shareholders in 3 to 5 years or are we just too early to think about returns to shareholders?","Glenn P. Muir","Yes. I'm going to defer that one a little bit, David. The returns that we're looking for, I think, and what we're able to enhance the growth profile of Hologic would lead one to believe we could get into those territories, but we're way too early to really spend any time on that, if we could.","Operator","Your next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Carl, you've been pretty consistent in asserting that even after a series of recent product approvals, that Gen-Probe is still in a period where you need to continue to invest. On the R&D side, you've talked about the need to continue building out the menu and on the SG&A side, you've talked about the need to support the rollout of new products. And I think you've specifically said appropriately that you'll only get the chance at an initial launch once. So with that in mind, what's the right way to think about Gen-Probe's spend in the near term and then after the deal? And in the meantime, what steps are you taking to make sure that no one at Gen-Probe is taking their eye off the ball in the early innings of these new launches?","Carl W. Hull","You bet. And very good questions. I'll try to cover them all. First of all, with respect to both menu and R&D opportunities, I think it's very clear that those opportunities remain in front of the combined company, and I know that we will pursue them as aggressively as possible. You heard Glenn mention a focus on NPV positive projects, and that has been the driver for Gen-Probe as well. So I think our approaches to the management of our R&D spend will be consistent and similar. There may be some opportunities for synergies and as we think about R&D, especially as we look at sample types and how we get sample types approved for our new products, and we'll address those as we come to it. I think on SG&A, the story is probably a little bit different, right? We were pursuing a path as an independent company with very limited presence outside of the United States and Europe, as you know. This transaction gives us access to a very well established network of Hologic's distribution capabilities across the world. I think the number that was mentioned earlier, about 150 countries in operations. That's going to be a huge benefit for us and will of course result in us post the integration, not having to make those incremental investments. We will clearly manage the business up and to the time of closing with a focus on doing everything we need to do to maximize our returns short term. And I can assure you that my management team will be incredibly tightly focused and continuing to do what they've been doing, which is launch the new products successfully. We began that process with a call last evening and that is the central point in all of our employee communications on a go-forward basis.","Operator","Our next question will come from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you guys maybe address going forward how you guys look at distribution in regions where both companies had limited reach, specifically in emerging markets? And then secondly, if we could talk a little bit about the strategy for -- actually, let's leave it at that for now. Sorry, I lost the second question.","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, Isaac, thanks a lot. Really what we intend to do is leverage the products of Gen-Probe with the existing distribution that Hologic currently has. I mean, we have 500 people in China today and a direct sales operation, we are direct throughout all of Europe and have an infrastructure of training, applications and support people around the world. So the rationalization is a very simple one. Gen-Probe's early on in that development. So what this does is really accelerate the market penetration of their products with a ready-made distribution channel and an infrastructure to support them.","Carl W. Hull","And to put a finer point on Rob's observation. In China, Gen-Probe now has 2 people. So you can see the immediate opportunity.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. Second question was just you guys have made a sizable investment here in Diagnostics. If we look at the other parts of the portfolio, specifically surgical, I always thought of that as being one where there was lots of opportunity. How does this transaction impact the timing or pace with which you might pursue other opportunities just given the leverage you guys will have coming out of this transaction?","Robert A. Cascella","It's a bit early to talk about other things at this point. Obviously, we think we have strong organic growth profiles in all of our businesses today. And obviously, we'll at some point when it's appropriate, keep an open eye for new technologies. But for the time being, it's really all hands on deck to complete the integration of this business and rationalization of resources in product lines.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question is for Rob. Rob, can you just take a step back a second and just talk about the state of the underlying Hologic business today and why the need to do the transaction today? And just compare it and contrast it to the past large transaction, the Cytyc deal. So if you could touch on those, that would be helpful.","Robert A. Cascella","A great point. Look, I think what we have said in the past was that we wanted to build a Diagnostic business that had the same growth profile as our Breast Health business. And what this transaction does is really enable that. We think the Breast Health business is poised for explosive growth as a result of tomosynthesis, and what we are trying to do is get all 3 of our major segments on that same trajectory. So with the addition of this product line and these products, we feel that we're positioned to now have a high-growth molecular business and overall Diagnostic business as well. Differently than the Cytyc transaction entirely in that Cytyc was about creating a new vertical and a vertical that allowed us to have a diversification platform. What Gen-Probe brings, and I don't want to state this in a reckless way at all, is that this a large tuck-in. This is very consistent with our Diagnostic business. It is a major acquisition, but it is absolutely in line with the products and the infrastructure that we've already created. All that this simply does is give us the automation and menu that we need in order to grow that market more quickly. And that, in summary, is the benefit of it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you maybe kind of recap, when did the 2 of you begin talking? And then Carl, we're getting questions about, are there other suitors? Were there other suitors as you were looking at all the options?","Carl W. Hull","Yes, Quin, look, Rob and I have known each other for a long time now, and we have looked for opportunities to work together in the past. I would just tell you that Rob reached out, and we had a discussion -- really that began this spring. So it's come together very rapidly. With respect to other speculation, I can't possibly go there. I can just tell you that we are extremely happy with this transaction, and the board feels that we've delivered a full and fair value to our shareholders. So that's one of the reasons that we're here today.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rich Newitter with Leerink Swann.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just if you could, Glenn, maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the cost synergies. Can you give us a little bit better picture of where exactly the initiatives are going to be upfront to drive first, that $40 million in the first fiscal year post-acquisition? And then to get to that $75 million number. Is it more in the cost infrastructure, consolidation, should we expect more of it in SG&A?","Glenn P. Muir","Rich, let me try to help. I mean, we've done a very careful review of all the synergies between the 2 companies, and I'm afraid we're probably not going to be able to be very specific at this time. But the cost efficiencies that we're thinking about are in a number of different areas. I mean, some of them are -- could be fairly obvious, with cost efficiencies between the companies, overhead consolidation and all of these areas will be looked at. But I do want to point out that the $40 million, especially for the first year, we're extremely comfortable with where that's coming from. And that's on the cost side. And I think in addition to the cost synergies, we can't lose sight of the many revenue synergies that are out there today as well. As we go into some of these new territories that'll provide higher growth with the combined operation. And we really, for purposes of that synergy calculation, they were not factored in. So I think when we get beyond the first year, I think we'll probably begin to see more powerful synergies flow through.","Operator","Our next question will come from Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Rob, maybe to begin with, obviously the path in HPV complementarity are key to this transaction. Just wondering how that infrastructure looks like on a combined basis and how Gen-Probe's STD business, the CT\/NG, the Trichomonas piece has sort of fit in there. How does that division look, that specific slice of the division?","Robert A. Cascella","I think that it's -- obviously we believe that it's an excellent fit. We think that what we now have is a complete portfolio or menu in STDs. We get to utilize Cervista, as I said earlier, in a segment of the market that we think it is best served and move to the upper end of the market with a complete portfolio of products in addition to our ThinPrep pap test. So at the end of the day, it is about automation and menu that is ideally targeted for the profile of a given customer, and we have the complete spectrum of products now to be able to satisfy whatever the individual customer need is and whatever stage of either market centralization or decentralization we approach. So we feel, ideally, that this product gives us a little bit more horsepower and diversification to be able to meet customer needs.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess I meant more sort of the go-to-market strategy, the sales forces on a combined basis, the touch points, et cetera, like how does that access to market change? Because that's obviously a key portion of the synergies between the 2?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes. We think that the real advantage is the combination of our laboratory sales force. So we'll have greater numbers with very, very experienced people in both molecular and cytology calling on labs. But more importantly, we sincerely believe that the addition of our physician sales force, which is something that Gen-Probe did not have, and that's 90 people in the United States alone, will drive practice patterns. We believe if we can drive utilization, we can drive compliance. When you think about the CT\/NG market, it's 38% penetrated as a result of really not a lot of activity encouraging physicians to promote compliance. So we think that the strategy overall, is to take a physician sales team, our physician sales team, and drive growth organically in the existing markets that we have and drive preference to some of our new assays like Trichomonas and our HPV assays.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And on the labs side, I imagine Gen-Probe's infrastructure is really the more developed and mature one?","Carl W. Hull","Well certainly, Nandita. We've been in the molecular lab for now some 25-plus years. Our customer-facing resources, which include the salespeople and the technical support and field service engineers are incredibly well experienced in the molecular laboratory and are able to serve the needs of those customers, we believe, in a fashion that's unequaled in the marketplace today. So we're very pleased to be able to expand their reach as Rob indicated and support their efforts with physician-driven demand.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Kind of going back to maybe what was touched on a little bit ago, but I'm curious, to Rob and Glenn, with the process that was allegedly in place a year ago, were you guys there a year looking at it? If not, why not? And if so, what changed that got you to the point where you guys could get to agreement now?","Glenn P. Muir","Brian, we're going to have to hold back. We really can't comment on last year. But I think through our discussions and as we look at the marketplace that we're in, I think this fits into our overall strategic profile of what we've talked about as far as trying to expand within the women's health franchise and really builds upon that platform Rob talked about that we almost 5 years ago set up with Cytyc and now trying to expand to get the synergies. And , it just so happened that all this -- much like 5 years ago, all the stars were aligned to make this happen as it did today.","Operator","Sara Michelmore with Brean Murray has our next question.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Maybe a question for Rob, you kind of talked around it. But I understand the strategic rationale behind building up the Diagnostic business. But you still have a really good opportunity on the Breast Health business, and I'm just wondering, in terms of timing of the transaction, why this made sense to diversify the revenue base now as you're kind of heading into the sweet spot of Breast Health tomo therapy cycle?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, and good question. It goes without saying, we're very, very bullish about our Breast Health segment. I feel, as if I have an obligation to grow the entire business. And as a result of that, we have been looking at ways to accelerate the Diagnostic franchise so that it had the same kind of growth profile as the breast business. This is not to take away anything from the significance and the potential of that business to again have explosive growth. And I keep saying that, and I hope that message is clear. We feel very, very optimistic about meeting or exceeding that 60% goal that we talked about at the beginning of the year relative to tomo penetration, that the clinical adoption of the product has been phenomenal. The response in the marketplace is better than any of us could expect and clinical papers are emerging and will be available towards the end of this year as we expected. So view this as we now, wanting to draw our attention to another one of our business segments and brought on the Gen-Probe business as really one of the elements in building Diagnostic so that it performs like Breast Health, not so that it makes up for Breast Health.","Operator","Our next question will come from Peter Lawson, Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Rob, just thinking about the portfolio, what should we be thinking about as the right balance between hospital CapEx, surgical, Diagnostics, medical imaging over the next 5 years?","Robert A. Cascella","It's a great question, and I'll comment on first, why we think this is so important in terms of what this business also brings and that is that the emphasis here is that we have a very strong annuitized revenue stream. That's something that we don't have in capital equipment. So with the capital equipment at its current point in time, where we're at the beginnings of a technological succession, we think that, that will drive growth in that segment of the business. What this business will do is provide the continuity of a longer term annuitized revenue stream. So when we look at the mix of our products, we think that 75% to 80% of the business ends up being some level of annuitized revenue, either our service revenue, our devices or now, our Diagnostics. And the remainder of the business will be capital equipment. And that's simply, I think, good business for us. Higher gross margins, much more stable, insulated from some of the market dynamics both here and abroad. And again, I want to keep reminding the group, that is not to take anything away from Breast Health, which we think is going to be the leading product in the company over the years to come.","Thank you very much. We're very, very excited about this transaction, and we certainly would invite you to call our IR groups so that we can answer more questions in a far more detailed manner. We look forward to reporting in the future and are very, very excited to move forward on this transaction. Thank you.","Carl W.

Good afternoon. And welcome to the Hologic Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Don, and I am your operator for today's conference. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call.","Mike Watts","Thank you, Don. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","If you didn't already see our third quarter press release, a copy is available in the Investor section of our website along with a supplemental financial presentation for today's call. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through August 28.","Before we start, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call maybe forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement, included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release or in the supplemental presentation.","With that, I will turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Steve MacMillan","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re very pleased to discuss Hologic\u2019s financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We\u2019ll frame these results today in the context of our annual strategic planning process, which we recently completed.","To give away the punch line, we had an extremely strong quarter. We posted double-digit revenue growth both domestically and internationally on a constant currency basis, with 12.2% topline growth overall.","Our Breast Health business led the charge, as expected, but our Diagnostics and Surgical businesses contributed significantly as well, so the strength was again broad-based. In fact, in the important U.S. market, every business grew as fast or faster than last quarter, with total domestic revenues up a very strong 12.7%.","Equally encouraging, the growth and stabilization of some of our key franchises in the United States, combined with solid pricing discipline and early returns from our productivity initiatives, led to very strong gross margins, 65.2% on a non-GAAP basis.","This drove a material improvement in our operating margin and a 16.2% increase in diluted earnings per share even as we made significant investments in our commercial activities.","Based on all these factors, we are again raising our financial guidance for fiscal 2015, reflecting confidence in the sustainability of our results. In fact, sustainable growth was the focus of our annual strategic planning process, which we completed this quarter. While we can\u2019t provide all the details of our strategic plan, I would like to give you a little color on how we\u2019re thinking about the business at a high level.","Shortly after I joined the company in late 2013, we made four strategic choices that have driven our turnaround thus far. First, we decided to keep the company essentially intact, but try to run it better. While we divested some small businesses, we believed then and continue to believe now that we can create the most value for our shareholders by optimizing the outstanding product and service assets that we have.","Second, we recognized the need for a major overhaul of our leadership, our structure and our culture. We are focusing relentlessly on upgrading talent and increasing engagement, and have boosted accountability and performance in part by moving to a divisional structure.","Third, we wanted to grow organically, rather than relying on acquisitions as we had in the past. We have doubled down on our key brands, stabilized previous sales declines, and in some cases returned these products to growth.","And fourth, closely connected to our focus on organic growth, we have overhauled our approach to capital allocation by reducing and restructuring debt, and increasing return on invested capital.","The positive results of these strategic choices were clearly reflected in our financial performance this quarter. Now let\u2019s discuss those results in more detail. I will take you through revenue then Bob will focus on expenses and the balance sheet.","Compared to the prior year period, third quarter revenues of $693.9 million grew 12.2% on a constant currency basis. Breast Health was the clear growth standout in the quarter, driven by accelerating uptake of our Genius 3D mammography systems. Total Breast Health sales were $279.5 million, up 20.2% in constant currency.","Digging a little deeper, breast imaging sales significantly exceeded our expectations, growing 24.2% in constant currency terms. We should point out that imaging sales included about $5 million of non-recurring revenue related to our divested Sentinelle business. But even without this, sales were exceptionally strong.","We shipped a record number of 3D tomosynthesis units to domestic customers in the quarter and are encouraged to see a substantial runway still ahead of us. As expected, most of the new placements replace our existing 2D systems, but we are winning competitive business as well.","As we discussed last quarter, our Genius 3D marketing efforts are making a difference and some of you may have seen that we expanded our media campaign in June with actress Kristin Chenoweth, who is encouraging women to request a Genius exam from their provider.","While Breast Health was the growth leader in the third quarter, our other businesses also performed very well, highlighting the unique value that our portfolio of market-leading products provides.","Our biggest business, Diagnostics, posted sales of $306.9 million in the quarter, a very healthy growth rate of 7.0% in constant currency terms. The story in cytology and blood screening was similar to previous quarters, while the molecular business outperformed.","First, global sales of cytology and perinatal products totaled $118.1 million. Consistent with recent quarterly trends, sales were basically flat on a constant currency basis, as domestic market share gains and slight international growth offset continued pressure from longer screening intervals in the United States. Although, we are managing well against this headwind, we do not think it is behind us, as overall Pap volumes in the U.S. continue to decline.","Second, worldwide blood screening sales were $64.2 million, up 18.5% on a constant currency basis, compared to a relatively weak prior year comparable that resulted from normal inventory fluctuations.","Blood screening growth continued to benefit from the business our partner Grifols won with the Japanese Red Cross, which more than offset a continuing slow decline in U.S. blood donation levels. As you know, the growth benefits of the JRC contract will annualize in our fiscal fourth quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn to Molecular Diagnostics, where quarterly sales of $124.6 million increased 8.9% on a constant currency basis. This growth rate accelerated for the third consecutive quarter and included stellar domestic growth of 12.6%.","All of our key women\u2019s health assays for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV and trichomonas grew solidly in the quarter, and all won important new competitive accounts. Much of this success was due to continued adoption of our fully automated Panther instrument.","Placements of new Panthers were robust in the quarter and we have now shipped well over 1,000 units to clinical diagnostic and blood screening customers. In addition, utilization per instrument continues to grow.","To round out the revenue discussion, let me mention that we remain pleased with the turnaround in Surgical sales. As you might recall, Surgical was a standout last quarter, but admittedly versus a softer prior year comparable.","This quarter, our Surgical team achieved a second straight quarter of double-digit constant currency growth, but against a much more challenging comp, as we continue to see benefits from more effective pricing strategies and the new clinical specialists we have hired.","Although, we do not yet view this business as a double-digit grower over the long-term, we were pleased that global sales of our NovaSure product were flat on a constant currency basis this quarter and MyoSure sales again increased by more than 30%.","Finally, worldwide Skeletal sales were $22 million in the quarter, down 1.4% on a constant currency basis. Sales increased solidly in the United States based on continued strength of our new Horizon bone density scanner, but declined internationally due to fluctuations in distributor ordering patterns.","We are not concerned about this single quarterly result, although Skeletal was our only business that didn\u2019t grow this quarter. On the positive side, we\u2019ll have something to shoot for as we close out our fiscal year.","We have lots of aspirational goals over the long-term, as well. Hologic has been mainly a turnaround story for the last year or so, but we don\u2019t want to be perceived that way forever.","Instead, our goal is to build a sustainable growth company. To do that, we are focused on adding new drivers to the tool box we already have, which contributed to our strong third quarter results.","For example, we are focusing on creating an international growth engine for the long-term. We have the right leader in place and Claus Egstrand is building a high-performance team around him. We have identified several attractive growth opportunities, and are building the capabilities to capitalize on that, but we are in the very early innings of this effort.","Second, we are boosting the level of innovation and productivity in our research and development activities. This is a multi-faceted effort that involves new leadership, better market insights, more efficient processes, and greater accountability. This will not be a quick effort either, but it can have a significant long-term pay-off.","So while it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve accomplished a lot so far, it\u2019s just as clear that we have a lot of work ahead of us. There are many chapters still to be written in the growth story of Hologic. And we view that as very good news for our shareholders, as our longer-term initiatives will make us an even stronger company.","Now I will hand the call over to Bob.","Bob McMahon","Thank you Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through our third quarter income statement and performance, describe improvements we've made to our balance sheet, then discuss our financial guidance which we're increasing for the third time this year. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis.","As Steve said, momentum has been building steadily in all of our businesses. And this trend continued in the third quarter as our topline grew at double-digit rates both domestically and internationally on a constant currency basis. At the same time, we showed sold leverage on the gross operating and net profit lines.","So despite a currency headwind, earnings per share increased by 16.2%, significantly faster than revenues and ahead of our most recent guidance. I should point out that net income grew at an even faster rate but the translation to EPS was diluted by higher share count resulting from the convertible notes on our balance sheet and our rising stock price.","One of the highlights for the quarter was our strong gross margin of 65.2%, an improvement of 230 basis points compared to the prior year period. Several factors contributed to this result. First, we benefited from the 12.7% revenue growth in the U.S., where margins are generally higher. Second, in terms of product mix, stabilization of both our ThinPrep and NovaSure product lines, continued growth of our Aptima women's health assays and the acceleration of Genius 3D sales and service, all boosted gross margins. And third we benefited from both the efficiencies that come with higher volumes and very early returns from our productivity initiatives.","Total operating expenses of $222.4 million, increased by 12.2% in the quarter. The biggest contributor to this increase was variable compensation as higher performance-based compensation resulted from the strong financial performance we\u2019ve seen this year. We also made additional investments in a few high return areas as we foreshadowed last quarter.","For example, non-GAAP research and development expenses increased 8% and sales and marketing spending grew 13.9% as we boost to support for our genius 3-D mammography efforts based on early positive returns. Net-net, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 33.2% in the quarter, up a very healthy 170 basis points from last year.","We remain one of the most profitable companies in our sector and are committed to remaining so even as we invest appropriately to generate sustainable growth. To round out the income statement, interest expense declined by 11.8% due to continued debt repayment. Our tax rate of 34.25% was in line with expectations and improved slightly compared to last year.","And finally, our diluted share count for the quarter was 292.6 million shares, an increase of 4.8% that resulted mainly from our strong stock performance pushing convertible notes further into money.","Before turning to our updated guidance, I want to highlight a few other metrics that demonstrate our commitment to operational excellence and our focus on improving financial efficiency. Total debt outstanding was $3.9 billion, a decrease of $0.3 billion compared to a year ago. We generated operating cash flow of $242.3 million in the quarter, a very healthy increase of 53% compared to the prior year.","The significant increase was driven by higher net income combined with working capital improvements primarily from better inventory management. Based on this excellent cash flow generation, we ended the quarter with $888.8 million in cash and equivalents and the net debt position of $3.053 billion, an improvement of $579 million compared to the prior year period.","Adjusted EBITDA was $249.7 million in the third quarter, up 12.6% and tracking to a $ 1 billion annual run rate. With the strong EBITDA growth and debt reduction, our leverage ratio -- net debt over EBITDA has improved further to 3.2 times. And we are well on our way to our target of 2.5 times by 2017.","The combination of growing topline, improving productivity and lower debt have contributed to a significant improvement in ROIC, which was 10.6% in the quarter on a trailing 12 month basis, an increase of 230 basis points compared to the prior year period. Improving business prospects and strong cash flow also enabled us to continue the transformation of our balance sheet in the third quarter. We refinanced both our bank loans as well as our senior notes, providing us with greater flexibility and lower interest rate.","In May, we established a new, five-year secured credit agreement that consisted of a $1.5 billion senior term loan and upsized $1 billion revolver. We pay interest on this new debt at LIBOR plus 1.75% saving more than $8 million in interest annually based on recent interest rates.","We used the proceeds to pay off our previous term loans. So our total debt remains substantially unchanged. But importantly, we extended the maturity on the debt to 2020 and gained additional flexibility to retire our convertible notes when they become callable.","Then in early July, we completed a private offering of $billion of senior notes at par with an interest rate of 5.25%. The proceeds will be used to pay off existing senior notes, reducing interest expense by $10 million annually and pushing out the maturity two years to 2022. All told, we significantly improve the quality of our balance sheet in the third quarter and gained flexibility to further enhance shareholder value in the future.","We are making excellent progress and we still have more work to do to achieve our long-term capital deployment goals. Specifically, we recognized that a capital structure containing such high levels of convertible debt is unusual for a company our size and we\u2019re committed to normalizing this over time.","Now I\u2019d like to provide an update on our financial guidance for the full fiscal year in the fourth quarter. Based on our strong third quarter performance, we are pleased to be raising guidance again. As always, this guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates.","For the 2015 fiscal year and on a reported basis, we now expect total revenues of $2.687 billion to $2.697 billion. Compared to the prior year, this equates to reported revenue growth of between 7% and 7.4% and constant currency growth of between 9.1% and 9.5%.","We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year of between $1.65 and a $1.66. This translates to reported EPS growth of between 13% and 13.7% or 17.1% to 17.8% on a constant currency basis. As noted in the release, these percentage changes for the prior year exclude the one-time benefit associated with amending the Roka license agreement, which added $20.1 million of revenue and $0.05 of EPS to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.","As we alluded to last quarter, our increased EPS guidance incorporates some incremental investments to accelerate and extend our growth prospects, especially in breast health and diagnostics. It assumes a tax rate of 34.25% for the full year and a higher diluted share count of $291 million -- 291 million for year, as a higher stock price has pushed some of our convertible notes deeper in the money.","Obviously this implies that our shared count for the fourth quarter will be higher, probably around 299 million shares. And looking at fiscal 2016, we expect our share count to be close to 305 million based on current market conditions. We note that this share count is higher than what we see in most sell-side models.","With only one quarter left in our fiscal year, the math on our fourth quarter guidance is straightforward. We expect revenue of between $685 million and $695 million. Compared to the prior year, this guidance reflects reported revenue growth of 6.9% to 8.5% and constant currency growth of 9.3% to 10.9%.","We anticipate that this revenue performance will drive diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.42 in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 7.9% to 10.5% on a reported basis or roughly 13.2% to 15.8% in constant currency. Again these percentages exclude the one-time benefit associated with amending the Roka license agreement.","If we recall whether the company was, when we gave our initial 2015 financial guidance last November, less than a year ago, we\u2019ve clearly come a long way. And in fact, our performance has turned around more significantly and more rapidly than even we thought possible.","In the third quarter, specifically, our top line grew at 12.2% in constant currency terms and we showed that material operating leverage that drove EPS growth of 16.2%. While we don\u2019t expect these kinds of growth rates to continue forever, especially as the comps get tougher, our strategic planning process does give us confidence in our future trajectory.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll now go to Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. Great quarter, guys. Maybe just starting with breast health at 20% constant currency growth. Can you maybe just talk about what you are seeing in the field? Are you seeing faster conversion, presumably, than maybe you had anticipated and where do you think we are in the tomo upgrade cycle?","Steve MacMillan","Yeah. We\u2019re clearly seeing an increase. I think what we\u2019re starting to see is the impact of our marketing efforts and frankly a lot of patient demand actually starting to drive hospitals to really accelerate further. And I think it\u2019s clearly a big uptick and faster than what we would've anticipated but we\u2019re hearing a lot of pressure, certainly from the hospital systems and I think, based on incoming orders continuing to feel good.","We then remind you that we\u2019re still in the early to early mid-innings of the potential left just to the United States. So we\u2019re still well less than half of the way at all -- even nearly through our installed base. There is still a lot of runway ahead of us.","Tycho Peterson","And then onto molecular, 9% constant currency growth is great. We saw Roche put up good numbers for their HPV business as well. Can you maybe talk about the market dynamics that you're seeing in molecular? And obviously, you don't have the primary screen yet. So maybe just talk about competitive dynamics as well?","Steve MacMillan","Yeah. I think we continue to feel really good certainly about our position at HPV and our Panther system. So again as you will know, there have been so much attention paid to the Quest Contract, say, a year ago. But what we\u2019ve really been focused on over the last year or even during that time is additional Panther replacements. And as those Panthers come online, we have more machines in the field and then as people get experienced with them, they start to put more of our assays on them and just builds over time.","So we\u2019re feeling very good. There is probably some positive market, overall market dynamics here. So that we don\u2019t want to take all the credit for it but clearly I think if we look throughout the molecular diagnostics industry right now, volumes probably looking pretty good.","Bob McMahon","Yeah. And Tycho, I would add. This is Bob. Specific to HPV while we don\u2019t disclose that, we feel really good about our performance in HPV. Believe it, it was that faster than the market and we believe we\u2019re number one in that market place in the U.S.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Alex Nowak","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. This is actually Alex filling in for Bill. So first one for me, any update on the timing for NAT testing in China?","Steve MacMillan","It's rolling out sporadically across the country.","Alex Nowak","Okay. Great. And then, where are we with the virology launch in Europe and when should we expect these assays to make it Stateside? And then, somewhat related, what\u2019s the potential impact on the business following CMS\u2019s five-year recommended interval for combined HPV and Pap screens? Thanks.","Mike Watts","Hey, Alex, it\u2019s Mike. Let me take the question on virology timeline. As you know, we introduced not too long ago, our HIV product with the CE Mark in Europe. We will probably look to the next calendar year to flesh out the menu with additional HCV and HPV assays, and then probably in the \u201817 calendar year to bring the first product to the U.S., which would be HIV as well.","Steve MacMillan","And on the question of the five year screening and I think we continue to see as we referenced in the script, an extension of the interval as it relates to Pap. I think in the long run, we frankly think the science is clocked to go to five years and I think that will continue to play out. People will understand that it maybe a little too far but in the meantime, we are dealing with that.","Operator","We'll go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. So, Steve, I'm just curious on -- given sort of that massive, massive showing within breast health, any comments around where we are -- you know, what the penetration levels are within 3D tomo? And I'm more curious on the potential for share gains here, right? Clearly, it looks like your customer base, they are believing in the new technology, right? So does this sort of provide a longer tail for you to sort of gain share against competition? Thank you","Steve MacMillan","Yeah. Thanks, Vijay. Good to hear from you. The way we look at it, in terms of our installed base, we are not giving the exact numbers. But we feel very good on both our conversions, but also the fact that we are well under, well under only halfway there. So, we're not even close to halfway through our base. This should continue to run really for several years in terms of the momentum and so the competitive piece, we are definitely winning competitive customers. And I think we are certainly, I think it is fair to say we are winning more competitive ones than we are losing.","And I think people really are seeing the combination of our proven technology. We have the best clinical data out there with the study published in JAMA. We have the best label. We have the fastest scan time. This really is -- frankly, we are more differentiated in the 3D world than we probably ever were in the 2D world. And I think our sales teams are doing a tremendous job of educating customers that way, combined with some patient demand and our marketing efforts, all of which clearly led to an inflection in the quarter, the one that we feel good about sustaining here for ways.","Vijay Kumar","Great. And maybe one quick one for Bob. Great margin pull-through. I'm just curious, sort of how much of this was driven by volume uplift, given the top-line performance, versus some of the structural things that you've been talking about, Bob? Can we expect sort of margin upside here as people look over the next few years?","Bob McMahon","Yeah. I think we\u2019ve talked about the productivity initiatives that are starting to be put in place. I would say that those are still in the early stages. And as we think about this, certainly the U.S., we benefited from the U.S. growth being much faster than we had anticipated, which really helps from a geography and a gross margin perspective. Our guidance going forward, we anticipate a slight decline sequentially in our gross margin but still up versus prior year.","And the way we are thinking about it is, as we are looking to grow our international business longer-term, that\u2019s going to put downward pressure on our margins. We generally see slightly lower margins outside the U.S. and inside the U.S. And I think what\u2019s happening is actually some of the higher volume in the U.S., coupled with some of these initiatives, we are actually seeing some of that benefit before the international growth kind of kicks in. So, we feel good about where we are and the progress we are making. Not ready to say that we are going to continue to see margin improvement enhancements to the level that we have this quarter.","Operator","We will go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good afternoon.","Steve MacMillan","Hey Dave.","David Lewis","Steve, you talked about sustainability of the tendon and the strap plan that you just concluded and obviously given this tremendous quarter. You talked about these two major drivers sustainability if I\u2019m catching it right. One was international. The other was you said, innovation, Am I kind of calling at the pipeline. So, just taking the second one here for a second, when do you expect to start seeing material productivity coming out of the pipeline? And when you start thinking that innovation for this business, how heavily do you think you are going to have to rely on M&A?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Great question, David. I think on the pipeline, truthfully, we are still a few years away. I think as you probably wrote shortly after I started. There is investments in cultural shifts that have to happen and I think the way we are thinking of that are high level is those -- the impact of what we are doing today is probably more in \u201918 and beyond event. We\u2019ve been perfectly candid. I think we kind of said that the pipeline was not rich. In the meantime, I think there is so much more opportunity in the shorter term with the products we have to help us bridge through what is probably a longer gap than we would prefer. So, I think we feel pretty good. And I think clearly on the M&A front, we\u2019ve refocused our organic growth. We will certainly start to recrank up what I call small-scale bite size kinds of things. But even nothing in the very short-term on that, as we continue to paydown the debt. Having said that, I think is where -- with the performance we are generating, we are running at a very good pace relative to our debt to EBITDA goals by the end of 2017. We are clearly running ahead of that, which will probably give us a little chance to maybe do some more tuck-ins to help us even bridge a gap if there was one before the pipeline really kicks in. But we are still not returning to the old days of big acquisitions and any of that stuff.","David Lewis","That\u2019s very helpful, Steven. And Bob, just a quick question on -- you\u2019ve given the topline performance that I think most would have expected, greater drop throughs. So, obviously, you are balancing significant topline performance and reinvestments in the business, which is the right thing to be doing. So as you think about SG&A, it seems like that was the real reinvestment this quarter. Can you just give us a flavor about where some of those investments in SG&A are going and should we expect those investments to continue here, obviously heading into \u201916? Thank you.","Bob McMahon","Yeah. Thanks, Dave. Good question. One of the areas that we really focus and is really helping, I think drive the topline is really the investments around our sales and marketing. So that\u2019s probably one of the areas that we will continue to look to generate incremental investment that is driving the topline. We\u2019ve seen a nice ROI. Principally behind our breast health business is the ramping up of the 3D adoption, continues to go. Even with that incremental investment, we still had a nice operating income leverage of approximately 170 basis points versus prior year.","We are probably one of the leading profitability companies in our sector. We will continue to grow and invest appropriately to drive that topline. That\u2019s probably the biggest area as we also talked about there was variable compensation that was really a result of the topline as well, that kind of goes with the investment but the incremental investment was really our sales and marketing investment.","Operator","For next question, we will go to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I wanted to focus on tomo for a minute, putting some of your earlier comments into context here. If we think about what the adoption curve should look like for tomo this time versus what 2D looked like, I noted that you said that you felt like you had a stronger competition this time around than last. So should we assume that to mean that you guys are aiming to perhaps increase your overall market share in this business, even though you have some pretty sizable competitors?","Steve MacMillan","I think we always go against formidable competitors. I think we think our product is even more differentiated, which our goal, clearly is to take what is already a strong leadership position but go even higher. So, our goal is not just to replace what we have. We think we ought to be able to win and so hopefully that does give us a little bit more runway.","Bob McMahon","Maybe I will just add on that. I think one of the things that we talked about is this cultural shift. I will tell you, the organization, breast health, diagnostics or the surgical business -- they are not satisfied, which is replacing our installed base. Our goal is to grow faster than the market and gain share.","Isaac Ro","Great. That's helpful. And then just maybe another question on diagnostics. Obviously, you are doing a pretty good job holding the line in the core Pap business. Wondering when we might get a better sense of your expectations and plans to sort of drive some innovation on the molecular side, given all the assets you have. You clearly have a lot of things to work with. But just curious about when we might know more about pipeline and kind of the longer-term plan to accelerate growth? Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. I think at this point, what we are really seeing on the molecular side, we\u2019ve got the virology program coming first as Mike referenced earlier, certainly outside the U.S. and then inside the U.S. We\u2019ve disclosed that we are working on an upgrade to Panther as well, which will allow the PCR capability and that will then allow us to do more assays in the PCA world.","Those are still a few years away. We are in the earlier stages there. But you can imagine, we are going to be doing a lot of the standard menu expansion and those kinds of things that other folks are working on and building off of the strong base we have and really this is a business that every additional Panther we place today will be beneficial down the road.","Operator","Next, we will go to Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just first start talking about kind of pricing throughout the organization? Maybe talk about -- is tomo pricing holding where it has been? Is there any kind of price reduction from competitors coming online? Also, what's going on as far as pricing on the molecular side? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Yeah. Brian, I will take this. Blood pressure is kind of a way of life and healthcare. And certainly, we see that in our markets. But what I would tell you is the good news is our products, we are selling on the benefits of our products. And I would tell you that the pricing that we\u2019ve seen over the last year has been relatively flat across all of our major product lines.","And I think some of that is incentivizing our reps for margin improvement, forming them with the benefits of our products and then also more pricing discipline that we have. I think if you look at it, just looking at our gross margins certainly, they have gone up despite the price pressure. Some of that is a result of the mix and so forth. But I feel good about kind of where our pricing is and our ability to continue to grow despite some of the pricing pressures.","Brian Weinstein","Got it. Got it. And then for the fourth-quarter guidance, it implies basically down sequentially from the Q3 levels, except for the very, very high end of the range. Is there anything in particular in the fourth quarter? Was there anything that was pulled forward into the third quarter that is causing that fourth quarter to be down sequentially in your guide? Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","There was nothing pulled forward. Let\u2019s be really clear about that. The couple of things, we mentioned there was a $5 million extra, basically from the divestiture, which was us providing basically a trailing agreement there. There is a also a little bit of seasonality and I think what we\u2019ve really done over the last year is starting to normalize this business more so and we are going into the summer months. So, things like surgical procedures for our surgical business were little bit more down in that July, August timeframe I think as we see around the world. So it\u2019s really right along those fronts.","Bill Bonello","Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Mike. I would just add on the bottomline, obviously as the share price continues to do well, the share count increases and that weighs a little bit on EPS as well.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Hi. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter. I just want to start and ask about the better results in molecular. How much of an improvement in the quarter was related to Panther replacements versus instrument pull-through? And then just how would -- as you look through the end of the year, how do replacements look as you look out?","Steve MacMillan","We continue to place Panther. The growth is really, it\u2019s multivariate. It\u2019s both more machines out there than it\u2019s ones that we placed previously started to be used a little bit more Jack and we continue to feel good about the pace of placements.","Bob McMahon","Yes. I would say we -- to build on what Steve just said, we feel very good about the placements, so actually had the strongest placements in the third quarter of Panther\u2019s. And then it\u2019s really kind of a three-pronged approach. So it\u2019s placing more boxes, the revenue per box continues to grow which said that there is more assays going through those boxes.","And that\u2019s also our sales organization has done a great job of also working with the physicians and clinics to drive utilization versus guidelines. So it\u2019s really kind of that three-pronged approach really living on the benefits of strong workflow and automation at the Panther brands.","Jack Meehan","Got it. And just want to follow up on the last question as well. Just as you bridge into the fourth quarter guidance, can you maybe just tell us in the past quarter how the pacing of the growth went through the quarter, especially in Breast Health just how you expect the momentum to continue into the next quarter? Thanks.","Bob McMahon","Jack, we are not going to get into that level of specificity. What we will say overall we feel good about the overall momentum.","Operator","Take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Doug.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So subsequent to the completion of the recent strategic review, I was wondering if you would have mind providing us with an update on really where Claus and the rest of the OUS team is in the context of building out the OUS infrastructure. And I guess related to that, does some of the recent strength give you an opportunity to specifically maybe accelerate some of the timing of investment related to the OUS build-out?","Steve MacMillan","It\u2019s a great question I tell you. I think we are legitimately in the first inning of the international build up because if you really and Bob and I spent fair amount of time over there recently. We are halfway between the startup and real company. When you look franchise by franchise outside the US that some of these businesses were just barely getting going and it is -- it would be a perfect time to invest even more. We would tell you right now we are pacing it based on where we stand. It\u2019s things like I would love to add more sales people around the world and our surgical business tomorrow. The reality is we don\u2019t necessary have reimbursement in place in all the key markets.","So it\u2019s going to be a longer build and if I could, I think we would dump a lot of money there right now. But we would be throwing money that\u2019s not as efficient. And with the Bob at might side, he was incredibly good at making sure we are every investment we make we think about ROIC. It\u2019s going to be more paced, which will give us more longevity as we really go forward.","Doug Schenkel","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just another follow-up on Panther. For the last few quarters you\u2019ve talked about a robust pick up in the pace of placements in response to a question before you indicated that utilization per box is trending up. Assuming that very few of these are replacements and assuming that the vast majority are regional rentals. Is it right to conclude that you probably feel a little bit better about sustainably growing MDX at least in the mid-single digit range given the predictability associated with these placements?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. That\u2019s there.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jon Groberg with UBS.","Jon Groberg","Just to be clear, even you don\u2019t feel like providing your exact clinic placement number.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Jon, we are barely hearing you.","Bob McMahon","Jon, can you try that again?","Jon Groberg","Yes. Can you hear me okay now?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. Perfect. Sorry.","Jon Groberg","Sorry. I was just -- one was the clarification, you have been providing kind of updates on gene displacements, I mean I missed that it sounded like maybe you weren\u2019t going to be providing those anymore, just wanted to be clear?","Mike Watts","Jon, it\u2019s Mike. We want to give you the color that you guys need, obviously to build your models and such. I mean, honestly, we talked a little bit about it internally and we don\u2019t really want to get in the habit of providing that number on a quarterly basis. I think that lots of factors, some of them beyond our control can affect placements or sales in an individual quarter. And frankly, we want to discourage a little bit of that over infatuation with the quarterly numbers. We had a record quarter this quarter of placements, very, very strong demand, but if you could bear with us, we will probably not to give that out every quarter.","Jon Groberg","Okay. In the context of your international comment, is it most to say most of that was U.S. the growth in Genius?","Mike Watts","Yes.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. Though we did have some reasonable growth internationally in our Breast Health business as well, combination of a 2D and 3D, but clearly the strength was the US.","Operator","We will go next to Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard Newitter","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter.","Steve MacMillan","Thanks, Rich.","Richard Newitter","So just two quick ones both on tomo. First in the US, I was wondering I know that for period of time you guys have had placed 2D systems that were kind of 3D enabled, but just hadn\u2019t necessarily been lid up. And I was wondering if you can provide any color on whether or not there are many kind of 2D, 3D enabled systems in your US installed base last. Have those kind of all lid up subsequent to the January 1 reimbursement?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. So we still have a portion of our 2D systems that are upgradable that are in our installed base, although it\u2019s approximately 15% to 20% of the installed base. So the vast majority of that will require a full gantry system upgrade to 3D.","Richard Newitter","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe outside the US as one of the initiatives I think for kind of investment and where there is opportunity. I would imagine it\u2019s kind of improving the market share and performance on the 2D, 3D side. Can you talk a little bit about what steps you are taking there, what initiatives we can expect going forward to kind of improve performance there and it\u2019s really capitalizing that opportunity? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Rich. It\u2019s really reengaging and assessing our dealer network outside the US, mostly we got through dealers outside the US and I think what Claus and his team had been doing is building stronger relationships with those dealers to really get them driving the opportunity bigger. I would tell you I think as we look back at our history, we\u2019ve probably been more transactional just trying to get orders when we can. And we are building more much of a partnership that includes better pricing, discipline on our part which part of it\u2019s helping the margin structure overall and things like that.","So I think it\u2019s reengaging that, it\u2019s getting into the tenders, it\u2019s a longer-term process, and making sure that we\u2019ve got the best dealer market by market to really build the business around the world. So it\u2019s a refocus, it\u2019s also recognizing. In some cases, we should be focusing on 2D, in some of the markets depending on where those markets are and not necessarily just trying to jam 3D everywhere. So it\u2019s really market by market and the heavy lifting of executional excellence, that\u2019s going to drive that business over time. And again we are early stages what we can really be there.","Mike Watts","Yes. I think just to build on that. I think one of the other areas focusing on those dealer markets in also looking at what countries we can win and drive success in. And so it\u2019s really a focus on 10 to 12 countries in a much deeper and significant way as opposed to spreading our resources has been.","Richard Newitter","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone","Good evening. And congratulations on the quarter. Maybe in what the Breast Health and then a couple for Bob on the financials. Maybe just a contribution from service in the quarter. I know that there has been increasing pretty significantly as well and you have a number of 3D systems that are likely off warranty at this point. So maybe the contribution from service as opposed to sales and upgrades. And then maybe Steve anything on the task force guidelines, I know the commentary you closed in mid May. I am just wondering if there is any update there on how you think that plays out and I will follow up with some questions for Bob.","Bob McMahon","Okay. Let me just quickly answer the service question and then I will turn over to Steve on the guidelines. The service was a strong growth driver for us as well, actually group up 7%, total company for the quarter actually close to 9.6% on an constant currency basis. So that\u2019s a lot of that is on the back of installed, the acceleration of the installed placements on 3D and the higher service revenue associated with those installations.","Steve MacMillan","Yes. And no update really on the preventive services task force guidelines.","Anthony Petrone","All right, helpful there. And then just on the Bob on the balance sheet and tax leverage, I think my math is coming up with the debt ratio of little over 4, maybe just kind of update on what the target is and timing on that? And then also just an update on tax and the strategies going forward and what do you think for tax leverage over time? Thanks again.","Bob McMahon","Yes. So just quickly the distinction between 4 and now probably 3.2 is net debt versus gross debt and we have been talking about a net debt target of 2.5 by 2017. In terms of the tax, we are still working through some of the foundational elements of that and actually some of the refinancings were much for providing us with obviously pushing up uncertainties and providing us with interest savings. And so it\u2019s as much also helping us with the tax and providing us some operational flexibility, better covenant profile that allows us to move IT around as we are looking at our manufacturing. The way that you should think about tax is really we\u2019re still building that foundation in '16 and start to see some of those savings in leverage on the tax line in fiscal '17 timeframe.","Operator","We will take our next question from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum.","Bill Bonello","Hey, good afternoon. And just a question on the outlook for continued clinical data and other sort of external catalyst that would push tomo like option. Obviously you had kind of a banner here with big studies capital with the reimbursement decision as we look forward beyond your own sales efforts. What external types of things may we anticipate that would continue to drive conversion in the market?","Steve MacMillan","Bill, I don\u2019t know if we see any real major external events coming. I do think we feel very good about our ability to continue to drive the business. And as you maybe go on partially we might be going. As you think about '16 for us, fuller, we are not ready to give guidance or anything else, but I think for the total company as you think about some mid single-digit growth on top of the exceptional performance this year in revenue and obviously, we\u2019re going to be looking to have that leveraged on to the bottomline across the total company. But, I guess, no real external events probably expected on the Breast Health piece.","Bill Bonello","Okay. And then just one truly related follow-up on that, in terms of the conversion that you are seeing, at one time there was some discussion as to the extent that individual centers were converting their systems whether they were going completely to 3D or whether they were adding a couple 3D instruments and keeping the bulk of 2D? What are you kind of seeing on that front right now, are you seeing a complete the conversion across customers, is this everywhere across the Board and any color on that?","Steve MacMillan","We are seeing, probably, a faster adoption rate of institutions that has one or two systems and it\u2019s really being driven by two things, one is the radiologist experience. Now we continue to hear and every time I\u2019ve been on the field, we continue to hear from the radiologist, they don't feel good anymore giving 2D exams to people, once they\u2019ve seen the 3D results. They know they are detecting more cancers with 3D and they know they are preventing more false positives and therefore basically reducing biopsies.","So, I think, there's a passionate belief among the radiology community that as they\u2019ve got an experience with 3D, it\u2019s the best patient care they should be offering. And so what you have is in these institutions where they had several, they're probably going back and seeking funding for a more full-scale conversion, faster than we might have imagine. It\u2019s also been partially driven I think by greater patient awareness, some of are on marketing and PR campaigns.","As well as, frankly, just a lot of a popular media that's out there, even some of that the mainstream media reacting negatively to the USPSTF guidelines. So you\u2019ve got all these things eating together that are encouraging probably a faster adoption.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill.","Derik de Bruin","Hi. Good afternoon.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Derik.","Derik de Bruin","So, lot of my questions has been answered but just a couple to follow-up here. So, $56 million, 8% growth in R&D this quarter, is that a reasonable run rate to think about it over the next few quarters?","Bob McMahon","Yeah. I mean, I think, the way we kind of think about it is that, we look at -- when we look at R&D at around 8% of our revenue, we think that that\u2019s about right. On a quarterly basis you\u2019ll see some puts and takes depending on what that -- the investments for the development programs, but that\u2019s a reasonable approximate, yes.","Derik de Bruin","Great. And then just one quick Panther question, you have said record placements in the quarter. Could you just give us some idea, how many new customers, are there any swaps -- people swapping out Tigris for Panthers, competitive wins, just a little bit more dynamic on that market?","Mike Watts","Hey, Derik. It\u2019s Mike. So just to clarify that comment, the reference to record Panther placements, certainly it was a record for this year.","Derik de Bruin","Yeah.","Mike Watts","But it would not has been a record of all time, so don\u2019t want anyone to think that. Very healthy placements this quarter, best of the year but not the best all time. And we\u2019re seeing, I think we had a particularly good quarter of competitive wins. Certainly, still some customers upgrading, but a good percentage of the placement this quarter were in fact competitive takeaway, so we\u2019re please with that.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity.","Mark Massaro","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. As we look out at the Breast Health business, it looks to me like there's at least two more quarters of relatively easy comps. Steve, can you just talk about the positive sources of upside as you look out with respect to comps. And maybe can you comment on seasonality in this summer quarter coming up?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Obviously, as we start to go into next fiscal year, the comps start to really change. And hence, we\u2019re not going to be growing our breast health business 20% on top of 20% growth. So, I think the comps get harder and yet we feel good about the underlying trajectory really for all of our businesses. So, I think we are feeling pretty good. But obviously, as we start to think about guidance for next year and everything else going to be more tempered relative to the kind of numbers we\u2019re putting up right now.","Mark Massaro","Okay. Great. And then with respect to the organizational structure, I know you've done a great job bringing in new leadership. Are you done there, are there additional adds you\u2019re contemplating. And then can you also comment on expanding internationally as well? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Yeah. I think, I\u2019d say we are in the later innings of any major personnel change. We\u2019ve got most of the key leaders in place, still a few opportunities here and there. But for the most part, we\u2019ve really just about made all of the key changes. As you point out the exception -- internationally, we\u2019re still building the team.","Bob and I were over in Europe couple weeks ago and Claus had three new leaders literally just started in June. So, I think they are probably a year behind. Internationally what we've done in the U.S. in terms of building up the team, so there are earlier innings there.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson Bedford","Good afternoon.","Steve MacMillan","Hey, Jayson.","Jayson Bedford","Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations. You guys have done a nice job with the business. Tough to poke holes here, but I wanted to ask about the non-U.S. molecular business, which seemed a little bit weaker. And I just wanted to give you -- if you can give us some expanded thoughts on your molecular business outside the U.S.","Steve MacMillan","I don\u2019t have to expand it too much. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s weak. It\u2019s a big opportunity for us and one of the leaders I just referenced and we just brought onboard a couple weeks ago is our new leader of international diagnostics sales. So it is a clear source of upside and now one of our prouder moments -- for prouder businesses at the moment.","Jayson Bedford","Okay. That's fair. And maybe just for Bob. You mentioned the early returns on the gross margin line from the productivity initiatives. To the extent you can, can you just give us a little bit more detail on what the initiatives are? How long will they take to fully implement? And maybe, again, if you can, the ultimate impact of these initiatives on the gross margin line?","Bob McMahon","Yes. So, Jayson, I\u2019m not going to give you, kind of what the ultimate game plan and what our targets are. But what I would say is these are both near-term and then we have medium-term and longer term. And some of the near-term are just the cost improvement opportunities of driving more efficiencies through the plans. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about in previous calls around sourcing.","We\u2019ve seen some early initiatives there that are driving some cost improvements. I still think that these opportunities continue to drive, sourcing savings as we look to centralize that organization and drive. And then longer-term, as we look to streamline our processes within the factories and get more of a lean kind of mentality. I think that there's a big opportunity there. So we\u2019ve got short-term, medium-term and longer-term opportunities.","Steve MacMillan","Operator, I think we\u2019ve got time for probably two more questions.","Operator","All right. We\u2019ll go next to Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. First one, Steve, for you, back in the day was the move from film to digital in mammo. There were some metrics where facilities with film were literally seeing lost volumes at their practice. And I'm just curious; you mentioned your marketing spend. Are your reps currently armed with any similar or hard data on the move from 2D to 3D, which is arguably helping accelerate 3D demand or is it mostly media-driven phenomenon at this point and some of that data might still be on the come?","Steve MacMillan","There is great clinical data, there is our label and there is consumer demand, so I\u2019d say, its multi-variant.","Jon Block","Okay. And then the other one just a little bit more big picture. I think one of the concerns when you took over was, did op margins peak out here at 30%, 31%? Clearly that was the wrong thought. You are 33%. You are plowing significant investments in the business. Can you just talk to us structurally anything that would prevent those op margins from moving to 35% over time?","And I guess, Bob, maybe if you want to weigh in here, is it something where the international growth in the margins that company that won't allow you to get there or anything where you just see so many opportunities in front of you where you just won't allow that level of profitability to drop through in the near-term? Thanks, guys.","Bob McMahon","Yeah. I think that that\u2019s the way you\u2019re thinking about that in the later part of the question is kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. So as the international business grows, certainly that\u2019s at a lower margin, which is going to put some pressure on it. We talked about kind of balancing those lower prices. But then also I think as we are we are digging under the covers, so to speak, we\u2019ve still got a relatively new management team across.","We do see a lot of opportunities, not only for streamlining but also growth opportunities that we want to appropriately invest in. So that\u2019s one thing I think as we think about not only investing in a relative to ROIC but also to top and bottom lines. We\u2019re not going to be afraid of reinvesting into the business to have that sustainable growth that Steve talked about before.","Steve MacMillan","And I wouldn\u2019t see as getting the 35 but the 33 range that we\u2019re at is probably a healthy level.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham and Company.","Brad Mas","Hi. It's actually Brad in for Mike. Just two quick ones for me to finish up. Just wondering with the strength in surgical, can you give an update on the sales force? Have you guys been adding reps? Is that kind of what's driving it? And if so, how many?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. What we really done there is we\u2019ve added some clinical specialists to help support some of the caseload, particularly with our MyoSure procedure. So what it's done its allowed the sales reps to really focus on hunting and building out the customer base. While we have the clinical specialist serving a lot of the case coverage and that really has helped.","Brad Mas","Perfect. And then just wondering how you guys are thinking about the growth profile of blood screening in Q4 and then going forward, just as you guys lap the Red Cross agreement in Japan?","Steve MacMillan","Yeah. Great question Brad. I think we\u2019ve had four good quarters of growth clearly from the JRC and that\u2019s now behind us. This was the fourth quarter. So I think we see this pretty flat now. Probably return into a basic market, I think the global blood screening business is probably a flattish to even slightly down. And unfortunately for us, we\u2019ll probably be much closer to those numbers now going forward. I think that is all the time we have.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have questions today. This now concludes Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. Have a good evening."],"10939":["Hologic, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOLX) Q4 2019 Results Conference Call November  6, 2019  4:30 PM ET","Company Participants","Mike Watts - Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Steve MacMillan - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Karleen Oberton - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray","Jack Meehan - Barclays","Ivy Ma - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Chris Lin - Cowen","Mason Austen - Morgan Stanley","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies","Andrew Brackmann - William Blair","Dan Brennan - UBS","Operator","Good afternoon. And welcome to the Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cody, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call. ","Mike Watts","Thank you, Cody. Good afternoon. And thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks today, and then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our Web site. We also will post our prepared remarks to our Web site shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through November 29th.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency unless otherwise noted.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Steve MacMillan","Thank you, Mike. And good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, our sixth consecutive quarter of good consistent results.","Total revenue came in very strong at $865.8 million, a 7.3% growth rate in constant currency that exceeded our guidance. Improving operating and net margins drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, an increase of 12.1% and in-line with our expectations.","We wrapped up fiscal 2019 with our best revenue growth of the year. This growth was balanced, with sales increasing in each of our divisions, both domestically and outside the United States. In addition to very good results in our largest businesses, Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, we were excited by the continued strengthening of Surgical, which posted its best growth in 10 quarters.","Before we discuss the quarterly details, let me step back and give a status report on the company as a whole since we're marking the end of our fiscal year. We have clearly made a lot of progress over the last six quarters. In the first half of fiscal 2018, our overall growth rate was about 2%, if you strip out the divested Blood Screening business and the inorganic benefits of Cynosure.","We restructured our leadership team around that time. And by the second half of last year, growth had improved to the 4% range. And for the full year of fiscal 2019, growth was 5.7%, well ahead of our initial guidance as we added two tuck-in acquisitions to solid underlying organic growth of about 4%. This organic performance, which excludes currency movements, blood screening and Faxitron and Focal, is impressive when you consider that we operate in several flat or declining markets, where our leading market shares make it challenging to grow. In short, we had executed well over the last year and a half and expect to do the same in fiscal 2020.","Now, let me break down our performance further by providing a brief snapshot of how we're doing each of our major franchises. In U.S. Breast Health, which grew 9.1% for all of 2019, we are using internal R&D and external acquisitions to build on an incredibly strong domestic leadership position in 3D Mammography. By leveraging our install base, we are creating a steadier, more diversified growth engine across the continuum of breast healthcare.","In domestic diagnostics, which grew 4.5% for the full year, we are partnering with our customers to drive market growth and leveraging our install base of fully automated Panther instruments, with the broadest assay menu in the mid to high volume molecular space. In U.S. surgical, which grew 2.8% for the fiscal year, we have revitalized our sales force and our R&D engine to drive steadily improving growth.","In domestic medical aesthetics, which declined 9.9% for all of 2019, we have stabilized our U.S. sales force as we await internally developed and externally licensed new products to drive growth. Outside the United States, where revenue grew 8.2% in 2019, we have transformed what was effectively a startup a few short years ago into a consistent growth driver, with much opportunity ahead for both revenue growth and profit improvement.","With that introduction, let's discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail. Revenue of $865.8 million exceeded our guidance and grew robust 7.3%. Within this, the acquired Faxitron and Focal businesses contributed $14.6 million to revenue. We were off to a good start with these deals with low-teens growth for the full year on a pro forma basis.","Excluding sales from our divested Blood Screening business, which increase in the fourth quarter revenue of $849.1 million grew 6.9% still our best overall growth rate of the year. In terms of geography, domestic sales of $656.2 million increase a very healthy 6.7% in the quarter. Excluding Blood Screening again, U.S. growth was 6.2%, accelerating for the fifth consecutive quarter. Outside the United States, sales of $209.6 million increased 9.2% in constant currency, a nice rebound compared to the third quarter.","Now, let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. In our biggest division, Breast Health, our core 3D Mammography business remains rock solid and we are building on it with an increasingly diversified product portfolio that spans the continuum of breast healthcare. Based on internal R&D productivity and strategic acquisitions, we have established ourselves as the trusted experts in Breast Health. We offer innovative products that deliver better clinical outcomes for patients and workflows that make life easier for customers. Together, these translated to steadier, more predictable revenue.","In the fourth quarter, underlying trends in Breast Health remained strong. Global sales totaled $342.6 million, an increase of 7.1% against the tough prior year comparable. In terms of geography, domestic Breast Health revenue grew a healthy 6.4%. Outside the United States, we were pleased to post sales growth of 9.4%, accelerating compared to the third quarter. In terms of breast sub segments, imaging sales grew 6.5% while interventional sales increased 10.2%, as we focused on selling our growing portfolio. Imaging benefited from about $10.4 million of Faxitron sales while Interventional included $4.2 million of Focal revenue.","In Imaging, sales of our Genius 3D systems increased strongly, establishing a new quarterly record some eight years after the domestic launch life, an impressive accomplishment by our commercial teams. On a cumulative basis, we have shipped about 6,900 3D systems in the United States, giving us a tremendous install base onto which we can layer additional revenue streams. We have converted more than 70% of our installed base to 3D. Yet, there are still more than 5,000 Hologic and competitive 2D systems in the United States, providing us multiple years of conversion runway at our current pace, especially as we continue to gain market share.","As in recent quarters, Imaging growth was driven by our new 3D performance and 3Dimensions gantries, demonstrating how innovative R&D is contributing to our growth strategy. Other new products, including Intelligent 2D, Clarity HD and SmartCurve, also added nicely to Imaging growth. We have a long-term opportunity to further enhance our existing 3D install base with upgrades like these, as well as the new artificial intelligence tools that we are developing and expect to launch this year. In Interventional, our fourth quarter results benefited from strong growth from biopsy disposables, which more than offset a headwind from lower Brevera capital sales due to the supply constraints we have previously discussed.","Before I turn to Diagnostics, let me update you on our pending acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine, or SSI, a French innovator in cart-based ultrasound technology. As a reminder, this tuck-in deal leverages our existing call points and is expected to be accretive to our revenue growth rate, albeit with some slight dilution to EPS in the near-term.","In early August, we acquired 46% of SSI's shares and have now opened a cash tender offer to purchase the rest of the company. Because we haven't finalized the acquisition yet, we recorded SSI's fourth quarter results under the equity method of accounting for investments. This means we booked no revenue or expense from SSI, but did record our share of their non-GAAP net loss, $1.8 million on a non-GAAP basis in other expense. We expect to close the deal by the end of our first fiscal quarter, and Karleen will tell you more about this.","Now let's turn to diagnostics, where revenue of $306.8 million increased 7.1% in the fourth quarter. Excluding sales from the divested Blood Screening business, diagnostics revenue grew 6.1%, still a very strong performance. Molecular remains the growth driver here, based on the productivity of our R&D team, which achieves 19 global clearances in fiscal 2019 and the sophistication of our lab and physician based sales teams.","In the fourth quarter, worldwide molecular sales of $172.1 million grew a very healthy 9.8%. Internationally, molecular grew 14.1%, well into the double-digit for the 13th time in last 14 quarters, against a very difficult prior year comp. And, in the U.S., although, we already enjoy higher market shares in key assay categories, molecular sales still grew 8.8%. This reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers to drive volumes and better patient care in established markets.","Molecular growth was again broad based in the quarter, as customers consolidated testing on our large install base of fully automated Panther instruments. Sales of our largest Aptima women's health assays, including chlamydia gonorrhea, HPV and trichomonas, increased at an impressive high single-digit rate overall.","Sales over many new products also added to growth, led by our quantitative viral load tests Panther Fusion and early contributions from our Aptima vaginosis assays. Panther has carved out a unique highly defensible leadership position in molecular diagnostics, just as our Genius 3D Mammography systems have in Breast Health. Over the course of 2019, our global install base of Panther's grew by more than 200, about the same amount as the year before. This brought our cumulative total to more than 1,700 units, 45% of which are outside the United States.","Importantly, utilization of these instruments has continued to grow as new assays emerge from our R&D pipeline, and as we partner with customers to drive overall testing volume. Average revenue for Panther is now about $240,000 a year on a global basis, and grew at a high single-digit rate in fiscal 2019.","Moving on, Cytology and Perinatal sales were $118 million in the fourth quarter, a small increase of 1%. Cytology sales increased slightly, all outside the United States, while Perinatal sales declined.","decline. Domestic growth in the cytology market remains challenged due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals. Elsewhere in Diagnostics, revenue related to our divested blood screening business was higher than expected at $16.7 million, an increase of 29.7% compared to last year. As a reminder, this revenue reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements with Grifols. So the outperformance here hurt our gross margin percentage for the quarter.","Now let's turn to GYN Surgical, our most profitable division where growth has been consistently accelerating behind the re-energized sales force and a revitalized R&D pipeline. In the fourth quarter, sales of $114.5 million increased 7.3%, our fastest growth in 10 quarters.","We want to spend a little time highlighting the tremendous progress we've made in surgical, under the leadership of Sean Doherty, who's been named division President a little more than two years ago. Under Sean's leadership, U.S. revenue growth has increased sequentially in six of the last seven quarters against progressively more difficult comps. Underpinning this performance, we have made significant changes in the talent, structure and incentives of our domestic sales team. And these changes are paying off. At the same time, our surgical business outside the United States, while still small, has been growing rapidly and we've only scratched the surface of this opportunity.","From a product perspective MyoSure and NovaSure remain leaders in the fibroid removal and endometrial ablation categories, respectively. MyoSure remains a healthy grower with significant runway ahead as we launch line extensions and supporting products, and replace more antiquated methods. As for NovaSure, we believe our market share is stable, and in many cases, we are winning customers back, although, we need to slow category declines.","Finally, new products have begun to contribute materially to surgical growth. Most notably, our Fluent Fluid Management System and our Omni Hysteroscope, and we just launched our Omni Lok cervical seal and new Definity cervical dilator. So like Breast Health, Surgical is becoming much more diverse, enabling us to better leverage a large and strengthening sales force and we intend to add more new products in the future through both internal development and acquisitions.","Now let's turn to Medical Aesthetics where global sales of $76.9 million represented about 9% of consolidated revenue and increased 10.3%. As a reminder, we had an easy comparable in the prior year period as we booked a revenue reversal of $6.8 million associated with refunds and rebates of TempSure Vitalia in the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding this, Cynosure sales would have been basically flat, reflecting a business environment that hasn't changed much. Specifically, our skin-related products continue to do well, while our lasers for body contouring in woman's health continue to struggle a bit as we await new products, both in-licensed and internally developed, to drive future growth.","To round out the revenue discussion briefly, skeletal sales of $25 million grew 3.7% based on growth of our DXA systems for bone density and body composition testing.","To wrap up, our fourth quarter results represent our sixth consecutive quarter of strong execution. Building on our market leading brands and large installed bases in the United States, especially in Breast Health and Diagnostics, we are expanding international internationally, churning out new products from our revitalized R&D pipelines and effectively integrating tuck-in acquisitions, while looking for more.","Now let me turn the call over to Karleen.","Karleen Oberton","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then finished with our initial financial guidance for 2020. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency.","As Steve described, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results, as revenue $865.8 million exceeded our guidance and EPS of $0.65 finished in line with our expectations. Our performance was balanced and strong with sales growth in each of our businesses, both domestically and internationally. In addition, operating and net margins improved as we continue to manage the business for leveraged profitable growth.","With that introduction, let me start by reviewing our P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margins of 61.7% decreased slightly by 10 basis points compared to the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, the stronger U.S. dollar, trade tariffs in China and product sales mix. However, it's worth noting that gross margins did improve sequentially for the third straight quarter and we expect this trend to continue in 2020.","Total operating expenses of $279.3 million increased 5% in the fourth quarter. But excluding Faxitron and Focal, operating expenses increased just 2.7%, reflecting strong expense discipline, especially in G&A. We continue to balance growth investments with our goal to drive operating leverage, and our R&D pipeline has never been more productive than it is today. Based on improvements in the top line and strong operating discipline, operating margins of 29.4% increased 30 basis points. Operating margin also improved sequentially to our best level since the fourth quarter of 2017.","Other expenses net totaled $33 million in the fourth quarter. As Steve explained, this line included our share of SSI results, specifically a loss of $1.8 million, which was not contemplated in our most recent guidance. Other expenses also benefited from gains from our currency hedges. As a reminder, these hedges reset back to zero in 2020, assuming currency stay flat.","Finally, net margins of 20.2% increased 70 basis points compared to the prior year period, our best result since the third quarter of 2016. In addition to better operating margins, we had slightly lower effective tax rate, which effectively offset the loss from SSI. Overall, our net profitability remained very healthy. All this led to non-GAAP net income of $175 million in the fourth quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, in line with our forecast.","On a GAAP basis, we posted EPS of $0.15, lower than expected due to non-cash impairment charges, totaling $79.2 million related to Medical Aesthetics. As Steve noted, not much has changed in this business, but we've looked at these charges as part of our normal year end accounting process of reviewing long lived assets for impairment.","Before we move on to our initial 2020 guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics. Our leverage ratio stood at 2.3 times at the end of the fourth quarter. We remain comfortable around this level, recognizing that the ratio could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity. The combination of strong profit growth and net debt improved our return on invested capital. As of year-end, ROIC was 13% on a trailing 12 month basis, an increase of 40 basis points over the prior year. Finally, in the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA improved to $277.7 million, an increase of 5.5%.","Now, I'd like to discuss our initial non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2020. Before I do, let me remind you that, as usual, there are several puts and takes in comparing 2020 to 2019. In terms of headwinds, revenues from our divested Blood Screening business is expected to decline significantly in 2020, and in foreign exchange rates at recent levels will be a drag on reported results of about $70 million, or roughly 50 basis points on the company overall.","On the positive side, the acquisition of SuperSonic Imagine will represent a tailwind to reported revenue growth in 2020. Our guidance assumes that SSI's revenue and operating results will be consolidated into Hologic's financials at the beginning of the second quarter with revenues totaling $25 million to $30 million for the nine months. Current Street estimates include a wide range of timing scenarios. So hopefully, this guidance will help with modeling.","For the first quarter, we have assumed our portion of SSI's loss, and as a reminder, SSI will be slightly diluted to non-GAAP EPS for the full year as we said when we announced the deal. As you update your forecast, we encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges at this early stage as we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate, both potential upsides and downsides.","We anticipate that fiscal 2020 will be a good year for Hologic overall. Specifically, we anticipate constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4.5%, in line with our improved organic performance in 2019. If we meet the high end of this range or exceed it, organic revenue growth should accelerate compared to 2019. Based on recent exchange rates, our top line guidance translates into reported growth rates between 2.5% and 3.9% and sales of $3.45 billion to $3.5 billion.","We expect tuck-in acquisitions to continue being an important part of Hologic story going forward, and believe that additional deals will boost revenue in 2020. But as we think about our organic growth rate, I would point out that the blood screen headwind and the SSI tailwind that I previously discussed basically offset each other next year. Said another way, our organic growth rate should be similar to the constant currency growth rate of 3% to 4.5% in 2020, depending on how you model the various components.","In terms of global division, our guidance contemplates similar growth rates in diagnostics, excluding Blood Screening, Breast and Surgical in the lower part of mid single-digits. We forecast less growth in Skeletal and Medical Aesthetics. Within these estimates, international revenue should grow in the high single-digits on a constant currency basis, in line with 2019, as we continue to see opportunities to drive sustainable growth in multiple markets across all our businesses.","In Diagnostics, Molecular should continue to lead the charge in 2020 behind Panther Fusion and increased utilization of more than 15 women's health virology and respiratory assays. We anticipate $30 million to $35 million of revenue from the divested Blood Screening business, much lower than in 2019.","In Breast Health, growth will be driven by multiple new products, accretive growth from Faxitron and Focal, our International business, three quarters of SSI results, and a large service annuity that now totaled well over $450 million annually. In Surgical, we expect growth from the continued expansion of MyoSure, the stabilization of NovaSure, the new products Steve discussed and International. In Medical Aesthetics, we expect growth from an increasingly productive sales force and new products, including TempSure Affirm and StimSure, which we've recently launched in Europe.","In terms of profitability, we forecast gross margins to improve to 61.6% in the full year 2019. We expect better margins due to lower manufacturing cost, improved product mix, absorption benefits, the ramp of new product sales and our ongoing cost reduction efforts. These benefits will be partially offset by the expansion of our international business, which adds gross margin dollars but pressures our gross margin percentage.","In terms of the quarter, we forecast that gross margin percentage will increase sequentially as the year goes on, based on the mixed benefits from newly launched products and higher overall revenues. In terms of operating expenses, we expect to continue showing strong leverage that helps drive healthy growth and operating margin percentage and ultimately EPS, even as we absorb an incremental $8 million in costs related to the new European MDR and IVDR regulations.","Our guidance does not, however, include a re-instatement of the medical device excise tax, consistent with Street's current modeling and our expectations that it will be suspended again. Below the line, we expect other expenses net to be greater in fiscal than the roughly $130 million we recorded in 2019, primarily due to the absence of foreign currency hedge gains based on recent exchange rates.","All this leads to forecasted earnings per share between $2.60 and $2.65 in 2020. This represents reported growth of between 7% and 9.1%, about double the rate of revenue growth, despite EPS headwind from currency and diminishing contributions from our divested Blood Screening business. We expect quarterly EPS to ramp up sequentially as the year progresses as it did in 2019. This guidance assumes a full-year tax rate of approximately 21.75%, flat to 2019 and diluted shares outstanding of about $272 million for the year. We also expect to continue generating robust free cash flow in 2020 in the mid $600 million range, excluding one-time items.","Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect revenues of $835 million to $850 million in the quarter. This reflects constant currency growth of 1% to 3% and reported growth of 0.5% to 2.3%. As a reminder, our Breast Health business performed exceptionally in the first quarter of, 2019 which contributes to lower growth rate this year. And most years, Breast Health is seasonally weaker in the December quarter due to RSNA and the holidays. We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.61 in the first quarter, representing 1.7% to 5.2% growth on a reported basis.","Before we open the call up for questions, let me conclude by saying our fourth quarter capped off as successful year for the company. Our largest businesses, Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, led the way and Surgical continued to improve, driving revenue outperformance overall. We are encouraged by the continued strong commercial execution, the progress in our international franchises, the productivity of our R&D pipeline and the deals we have completed. We continue to exercise tight expense controls and strategically redeploy capital. Overall, we feel confident in our foundation heading into 2020, and have the leverage to deliver healthy revenue and EPS growth.","With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow up. Then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And we'll hear first from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho Peterson","I'll start with guidance. Steve, you haven't really backed up the notion that you can be a mid single digit growth company. Obviously, you're getting a little bit below that. But given the kind of state of new product launches that you highlighted on the call, it seems like the bias would be maybe towards the higher end of guidance. So are there things that are actually going to be a little bit of a drag on growth as we think about next year. And then can you talk a little bit about which of the new product launches could be most incremental for next year?","Steve MacMillan","Tycho, make no mistake, we feel really good about the zip code or getting into here in terms of organic growth. And certainly if you look in this most recent quarter, the number was well above where we've been. We just don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. It's kind of like we had a great first quarter to the year 13%. We're about to go against 13.5% comp in Breast Health and 11% in Molecular Diagnostics as we start the year. So we just don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. But don't mistake that for confidence in the underlying growth in the business, all the new products coming through, building quarter-upon-quarter Surgical bouncing back and getting stronger. So I think we feel very good. We're just this is coming out of the gates. It's certainly an uncertain global economy and everything else right now, there's no sense with us being too far ahead of ourselves. But don't mistake the guidance for how we feel about the business.","Tycho Peterson","And then from the follow-up question on margin leverage, first of all, Karleen, you called that the tariffs hit on gross margins. I'm wondering if you can kind of quantify that. And as we think about 2020, just curious where you see the operating margin levers from your perspective?","Karleen Oberton","So I think the first part of your question, Tycho, that we've quantified the China tariffs around $10 million annually as the headwind. And as we look at operating margins into 2020, we do expect leverage when we expect gross margins to improve, we expect higher revenue. And we do believe there's still opportunities in the middle of the P&L, especially as we integrate recent acquisitions to contribute to the margin growth.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Bill Quirk","So I guess first question, Steve, kind of bigger picture. I appreciate that that the capital exposure in the model is much less than it once was. And we're still hearing some pockets of potential capital softness, typically in the U.S. I'm just curious what your thoughts are at present?","Steve MacMillan","I think as one of the few people who is running a company through the last major economic meltdown, as you know, [Bill Moyers] can be a little more cautious. And having said that, I think we feel better and better about the sustainability of our business. First off, we're so much less dependent on capital. Our diagnostics business, our surgical businesses, these are all recurring revenue and increasingly, our Breast Health business, between the gantries are a smaller and smaller portion of that.","The service business is big, the additional product upgrades and those kinds of things that are smaller outlays, that can be funded out of operating expenses from the hospital budgets. I think we feel very, very good about the likelihood of continued growth within the businesses. And the fact that we've really transformed what the company looked like certainly going into the last downturn.","Bill Quirk","And then as a follow-up, just following up rather on one of the diagnostic comments you made about the average utilization for Panther. Can you remind us where you are in percentage terms on average? I seem to recall that we were at something like 40% to 50% utilization on the systems. And then just briefly, kind of how high can that go? Is about 80% as good as it gets and then you're looking at a second system? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Not to get too granular with it, Bill. I would say in the U.S., we're certainly seeing numbers probably above that, and outside the U.S. still below that 40-ish percent number. So we still have a lot of runway ahead of us. And I think part of what we feel really good about is the continued placing of the Panthers. And the way we keep thinking about this is, keep placing more and more Panthers each year, another 200-ish last year. And then as you know, we're putting more and more menu onto each Panther, both domestically and internationally.","So there's still a long way to go without us having to place an enormous amount of additional Panther. So a lot of the capital has already been made. That's been part of the gross margin issue even internationally as we've been placing more of the Panthers, and then that will recoup and it will be part of our margin expansion story in the years ahead.","Karleen Oberton","Just to add to that, we look at certain key international markets. We only have one or two assays approved on the Panther. And as we peruse additional regulatory approvals, that will drive that increased utilization and the margin expansion that Steve mentioned.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","I wanted to just focus on Diagnostics business. Obviously, pretty strong in molecular. I was just curious what you thought the runway was like for placements in the U.S. just based on the math around 1,700 in the overall 45% U.S., last year was 1,500 about 40 -- I'm sorry, that was international, 40% international was last year. It just seems like a lot of the placements were international over last year. So what's the runway for placements in U.S.? And maybe just more broadly, are you seeing any signs of consolidation amongst labs and how might that impact kind of the runway for Panther?","Steve MacMillan","Jack, I think highest level we're probably in the 7th-ish inning in the United States, so a little earlier internationally. But I think still some significant opportunities, particularly with our largest customers. To your second point, lab consolidation, I think, that's an inevitable that we expect to continue to see. I think part where we feel great about the relationships that we've cultivated very deep relationships, obviously, with the largest players in the United States. We continue to work very closely with them to help both drive categories, volumes. And as they are really the consolidators, you know, we will benefit certainly from a volume standpoint going forth.","Mike Watts","Jack, this is Mike. If I can just add one thing to that about the U.S. market. As Steve said, we have placed a lot of Panthers in the U.S. But we have, I think 15, 16 different tests approved on Panther domestically and only about half of our customers use more than two assays. So there's lots more room on board those systems to layer additional menu as it gets approved and it's already approved.","Jack Meehan","And that was going to be my follow-up question is, I think I caught sexual health grew high single digits overall. So I wondering if you could just give us some mark-to-market in terms of what the virology versus Fusion slits, you know how just looking at 2019 what the total was for the year and what the balance within the molecular forecast assumes for those continuing to expand?","Steve MacMillan","Yes, I mean that's a lot of detail there, Jack. We probably aren't going to go quite that far. I mean, I think we talked about virology a year ago being in the $20 million range. I don't think it quite double, but kind of close to that in the most recent 2019. Fusion is off to a good start, ramping off of base but that base is much smaller than that.","Operator","Thank you. We will hear now from Ivy Maa with Bank of America.","Ivy Maa","I guess just a broad question to start off. Can you talk more about the OUS trend? You're talking about investing more in OUS to extend the base, which might have some impact on the margin. So wanted to see what the opportunity there, what still out there untapped or still was the largest opportunities out there? Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Ivy, I think as we look at it, we see tremendous opportunities for all of our franchises in all of the major geographies. I think we really put more of a footprint down in Western Europe over the last few years where we now have -- we've gone direct in the Breast Health business, really in the UK and in Portugal, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, we still use dealers in most of the rest of Europe. But I think we've really built a competency there.","Our Diagnostics business, we've gone more and more direct in those businesses. And Surgical, we're really just getting started. We're really only had a few countries in Europe and starting to build that business out as well. Shifting over Asia Pac, it's really a fairly similar story. The biggest underdevelopment, candidly, is Japan, that will take longer certainly to build out just given the fundamental dynamics, particularly in the Breast Health space there. But I think we're seeing very nice progress across the diagnostics business, including Cytology, and big opportunities in Breast Health in diagnostics and surgical certainly over time as well.","So I think the way we think about it is, each year we're building a few more competencies and it's not going to be something you're going to see an inflection point, but consistently growing at an creative rate to the overall company.","Karleen Oberton","I would just add some comments I made early. The opportunity is clearly expanding the assay menu in key countries internationally is going to drive growth. And as well as on the Breast Health business compared to the U.S., we are still converting from analog to 2D, not just 2D to 3D, so continued long runway for our key products.","Ivy Maa","And just to follow up on that. Karleen, you talked about the margins, there're lot of puts and takes in the margin trends for next year. Can you provide any sort of constitution if you can for those myriad of sectors? Thanks.","Karleen Oberton","So I think maybe you're referring to gross margins. There was a lot of puts and takes in the results, more takes I think than we expected. As we look to 2020, I think we're thinking about a range of gross margin expansion of about 50 basis points to 100 basis points. And as I talked about, we believe that will build as the year goes on in that from an operating margin perspective probably a little bit from that.","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear now from Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Chris Lin","This is Chris on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to start with another question on Europe. Given the mixed macro backdrop in Europe, curious if you have seen any order softness, especially for the more capital oriented businesses?","Steve MacMillan","We are not seeing any softness in Europe at the moment. I'm always a little nervous between Brexit, between everything else you have going on there, but we've been planning, and preparing. And I think for us we just continue to feel like our teams are getting stronger and stronger there. So feel good about our outlook. And really, I can't tell you how excited we are by our team in Europe. They have just come so far in the last few years.","Chris Lin","And then maybe a question on Breast Health, I think you've been tracking 250 to 300 placements in the U.S. Sounds like maybe it was above down in Q4. Maybe just help us think about the right way to model the gantry placements in 2020 for U.S.","Steve MacMillan","I think, we see it pretty much in that range. And we go back to four years ago or so when we said we were intent on breaking the cycle, and the job Pete Valenti and our U.S. team has done has been truly breakthrough and breaking that cycle. And I think what we've gotten into is much more of a steady cadence of replacement cycle that we had articulated we saw coming years ago, and it was our attempt to doing. So I think it's kind of settling into that range, which works out pretty well because the positive for that is it still gives us years ahead, I think everybody can see from the MQSA data that's available. We're clearly gaining far more in the competitive set than just upgrading our -- so I think still gives us years of runway ahead of us here, plus then being able to go back and get additional revenue from mining the install base further. But I think that's a rough way to think about it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move on to next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Luke] on for the Doc. Just quick on Breast Health, so you guys had a great quarter there. And just thinking about it and as just talked about the place coming in a bit ahead and the overall macro uncertainty in the 2020. Do you guys see any pull forwards there on the CapEx side?","Steve MacMillan","We have not, Luke. I think we kind of wondered about that a little bit in our fiscal first quarter of last year when Breast Health was really strong, but haven't really seen much to that effect at this point in time.","Unidentified Analyst","And then I guess Cynosure, the next one, the Aesthetics business, returning to flat to growth ex the items in '18. So the outlook in there for '20 you guys are expecting that to kind of accelerate. How should we think about that in Q1? And is that something that's going to build over the quarters, or should that be pretty stable?","Steve MacMillan","Keep the expectations down there. I think it'll build over the year because of the way the product pipeline is shaping up. We've got some things coming that probably won't quite hit in our fiscal first quarter, but should hopefully start to hit as we go into frankly the new calendar year. So I think we feel certainly better about the build on that business through the year.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. ","Mason Austen","This is Mason on for David today, thanks for taking my question. You referenced stabilization of NovaSure in fiscal '20. Does that mean you're expecting this business to grow next year? And any updates on the competitive environment you can provide?","Steve MacMillan","We're not declaring that we see that business, that NovaSure itself growing necessarily next year. We do feel great about the trajectory of the surgical business.","Mason Austen","And your share count guidance doesn't incorporate any significant amount of buybacks, it looks like. But over the past couple of years, you've repurchased about 5 million to 7 million shares a year. Does this mean we should signal an uptick in M&A activity this year, or how should we think about capital deployment balancing? Thank you.","Karleen Oberton","So I don't think anything's changed capital deployment strategy really between tuck-in M&A and share repurchase. I think from a guidance perspective, we just assumed a minimal share repurchase to manage dilution. As we just sit here today it's early and where the deal flow will play out.","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear now from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Q - Anthony Petrone","This is Anthony for Raj. Just quick one on guidance and then a couple on Breast Health. Just on guidance, SuperSonic image SSI. I'm just wondering what's baked in there for 2020 at the guidance line and just follow up on Brest Health? Thanks.","Karleen Oberton","Sure, Anthony, this is Karleen. So what we've said is as you know, we don't own a 100% of that today. We're tender offer process. So what our guidance assumes is that we will have revenue from SSI for the three quarters Q2 to Q4 in a range of $25 million to $30 million. We also assume that for Q1 we'll have our portion of their loss as well in Q1, but no revenue or expenses.","Anthony Petrone","And just on Breast Health. Just wondering if there is an update on the FDA proposal around dense breast screening. Just when do you think the timing would be for final rule? And what do you think really that means for 2020 within Breast Health should the final rule call for more imaging robust imaging and screening for dense breast patients? Thanks again.","Steve MacMillan","Sure Anthony. I'm probably owed for my lifetime on exactly predicting those kind of things out of FDA. I think what we do feel great about is what we control, which is we are the only 3D with the dense breasts indication, that is helping us when new business all of the time as people see that we're the ones that have that. Whether that guideline comes through from FDA in 2020 or not, exactly when it comes through, we don't see it as having necessarily a material uptick in our business, other than a further reinforcement of where the business is going.","Mike Watts","And as a reminder, Anthony, that's been going on at the state level in a bunch of states for quite some time, so that contributes to what we're seeing as well.","Steve MacMillan","It's clearly a net positive for us.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair","Andrew Brackmann","This is actually Andrew Brackmann on for Brian. Brian wanted to be on the call, Steve, but he's out celebrating Bears win over the Eagles in the second half of that game. Maybe just on\u2026","Steve MacMillan","I thought Brian was actually going to be at the open tryouts at the Bears that they're having.","Andrew Brackmann","His leg's not too good. I heard they need a kicker.","Steve MacMillan","Well, then he can math every other kickers. All right. Back to our regular scheduled program\u2026","Andrew Brackmann","Yes, exactly. On Breast Health, Steve, you mentioned the artificial intelligence product sort of rolling out through 2020. Any additional detail you can provide on what sort of impact that might have this year and then sort of the lever you think it can provide to the company over the next several years?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. I think it will be less in terms of meaningful acceleration or anything like that. I'd just be more of the products where we're starting to sell, like Clarity HD, our SmartCurve paddle we were able to start to monetize additional software into the gantries and into our sales. But over time, we think it's going to help establish that much more of a moat around our business by being the leaders to leverage the largest base install base in the business.","So I don't think you'll be able to meaningfully break out that AI products are going to add ex million of growth, but they will start to dribble in here later on in 2020 and then start to contribute more in 2021 and beyond.","Andrew Brackmann","And then just a clean-up question on the Brevera issue, I may have missed it. But any update on when that when that might be behind you guys? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","I think it'll likely be later this year. Our expectation is we will be back on the market with new capital, probably in our fiscal fourth quarter. So we should be there so. so, give Brian our best.","Operator"," [Operator instructions] We'll now hear from Dan Brennan with UBS. ","Dan Brennan","I just wanted to ask a question first, Steve, on molecular. So what's baked in for 2020 growth? Is the high single digit consumable sustainable? And can you comment on kind of the competitive dynamics in that market?","Steve MacMillan","I think as we think about the growth rate for molecular next year, probably smart to think about it is in the mid singles and then gaining pushing upwards towards high singles. Certainly, we're going to be going against some really tough comps, especially the first three quarters this year against global double digit numbers. So I think it will still be very strong growth in that space.","I think for the competitive environment, we feel pretty good that we continue to innovate. And as we are rolling out more and more assays, that business should certainly be good. So we've guided our overall diagnostics businesses, as Karleen said, probably in at least the low mid single digits. So Molecular will clearly be leading above that.","Dan Brennan","And then maybe to follow up just on M&A, the tuck-in strategy has been working well. It sounds like there will be more to come. So can you just give us some color on the appetite to maybe do anything bigger, kind of, how should we think about kind of the level of maybe the size of deals that we should expect going forward now that you've successfully executed a bunch of these? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure Dan. Actually really glad you asked that, because probably what's been under appreciated is, we've really shifted from a, what's been a corporate led business development strategy for what had been most of the 2000s and frankly up, even up to the Cynosure deal. But over the last few years, we've really built the divisional lead tuck-in capabilities. And I think we're just starting to really see what we'll be able to do there.","In terms of magnitude, would not expect us to exceed, for example, our annual cash flow in terms of rough amount of deals. So, I think we're definitely in the tuck-in mode. There will certainly probably be a few that could be bigger than $100-ish million deals that we've done to-date, but nothing that's going to blow the mind or anything. I think we like really frankly being able to both do some acquisitions and do some stock buybacks within each year. And while not a formal policy, it's something we've discussed quite a bit as a management team and our board of really being able to use the natural cash flow that we have each year as opposed to needing to lever up or take on something more.

My name is Kelsey, and I'm your operator for today's conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the conference. Please go ahead, Ms. Gordon.","Deborah R. Gordon","Thank you, Kelsey. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Call. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Friday, February 22, and a copy of our press release discussing our first quarter results as well as our second quarter and fiscal 2013 guidance is available in the Overview section of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also in that section is a PowerPoint presentation related to the comments that will be made during today's opening remarks.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Hologic during the course of this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement in our first quarter earnings release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Also during this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures can also be found in our first quarter earnings release, including the financial tables in that release.","Please note, today's call will consist of opening remarks from management followed by a 30-minute question-and-answer session. So we do ask that you please limit your question to just one and, as the time permits, we'll be more than happy to take your questions at that time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Rob Cascella, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Robert A. Cascella","Thanks, Deb. Good afternoon and thank you for dialing in to Hologic's first quarter call. Joining me on today's call are Glenn Muir, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Peter Soltani, our Senior Vice President and General Manager of Breast Health.","Today, we have a full agenda and a lot of things to comment on. I'd like to first start up by summarizing our first quarter performance; discuss the recent publication of the Oslo study and its implications on reimbursement; review the market adoption of our 3D tomo product; update you on the progress we're making in the integration of Gen-Probe, including recently announced organizational changes; discuss the sale of LIFECODES; review key products in our diagnostic franchise, including an update on the PANTHER rollout; and provide a brief review of some of the other key businesses. I'll then turn the call over to Glenn who will discuss financial results and provide an update on our guidance. We'll then open the call up for Q&A.","So about the quarter, we believe we're off to a solid start for '13. We grew our adjusted revenues by 36.4% to $644.6 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Our 3 largest business units, Diagnostic, Breast Health and Surgical, all experienced year-over-year growth.","Adjusted earnings-per-share were up 11% from a year ago to $0.38, which was $0.01 higher than our guidance. Importantly, these results were achieved despite continuing macroeconomic headwinds, as well as challenges posed by Hurricane Sandy, which we estimate impacted our total revenue by about $5 million during the quarter.","We made great progress integrating Gen-Probe, which allowed us to accelerate planned organizational changes. We had a very, very successful RSNA with stronger customer interest in tomo, and we subsequently saw key clinical studies published, most notably the Oslo study.","Finally, we received FDA approval for our APTIMA HPV genotyping test and later received FDA clearance of our APTIMA Trichomonas test to run on PANTHER. In addition, we received approval for our contrast-enhanced digital mammography which we intend to release later this year.","A little bit more detail about Oslo. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we achieved a significant milestone with the publishing of the Oslo tomosynthesis screening trial in the journal Radiology.","Oslo is the first large-scale, with nearly 13,000 patients on an interim reporting basis, prospective breast cancer screening study investigating the use of tomo in combination with conventional 2D digital mammography and comparing it to 2D digital alone. Researchers at Oslo University Hospital led by Dr. Per Skaane found that the use of tomo in combination with 2D resulted in a statistically significant increase in cancer detection. This is compelling in that not only did the overall detection of cancers increased 27%, but the study found a 40% increase in the detection of invasive cancers otherwise missed in 2D. These are exactly the type of cancers that we need to detect and treat early. Additionally, there was no increase in the detection of DCIS, which are exactly the type of cancers you would be concerned about over-diagnosing.","These outstanding improvements in cancer detection were achieved while also reducing false positives by 15%. Remarkable because 2D recall rates in Oslo are already extremely low.","The study also demonstrated the use of 3D tomosynthesis improved cancer detection across all types of breast from dense to fatty. In summary, the Oslo study demonstrates that tomo overcomes the limitations of 2D mammography by improving invasive cancer detection while simultaneously reducing false positives and overdiagnosis. These are terrific results. And really, quite frankly, we couldn't be more pleased.","From a reimbursement perspective, on our last earnings call we indicated we were waiting for publication of key studies. With those now published, we are preparing to execute the next stage of our reimbursement strategy. There are 3 components to our reimbursement efforts. The first is we continue to work with professional societies to secure a permanent CPT code, which is a fairly long process. We're also initiating discussions with CMS to secure an alternate code, which is potentially a more near- and midterm process. In addition, we're engaging with private payors directly to establish payment in the absence of a formal code. We're hopeful we can confirm a meeting with CMS this quarter, and believe we are on track to achieve our goal of establishing reimbursement by the end of calendar 2013.","I want to talk a little bit about our tomo adoption. We had what we believe to be a very successful RSNA in November that again highlighted our 3D tomo as the leading technology in breast imaging. Tomo was the subject of 15 clinical presentations in over 50 workshops. We were very pleased with customer interest at RSNA, which contributed to a 10% sequential increase in our backlog during the quarter. It remains too early to measure the full commercial impact of the Oslo study, so soon after its publication. But we are already seeing a significant increase in interest as compared to levels experienced in 2012. We are optimistic Oslo will help drive demand.","We believe all of these is very exciting, but the reality is we are still extremely early in the adoption cycle of tomo, and at this point, we are seeing the 2D digital mammography market as being saturated. So as we have explained in the past, there may be quarters where the decline in the rate of 2D sales outpaces the uptake of 3D tomo, simply for reasons of budget approval requirements, longer sales cycles and, obviously, the lack of reimbursement.","The very positive news is the market is moving away from 2D and more and more customers are realizing they will need 3D in order to provide their patients with the best available technology and to remain competitive within their local communities. We continue to feel strongly that once reimbursement is secured, we will be well-positioned to realize the benefits of increased tomo adoption.","All this said, we remain on track with original estimates and continue to expect that we will at least double our U.S. installed base of 3D tomosynthesis systems this year despite these challenges.","Now I'd like to discuss some of the other business units, and I'll start with Diagnostic. First, an update on the success of our ongoing integration of Gen-Probe, which we closed on August 1 of last year. The integration is proceeding extremely well. We are on track to exceed our target of $40 million in cost synergies in the first year and $75 million within 3 years. As we said earlier, we believe that these targets were very conservative.","As we announced in January, our strong integration progress has enabled us to accelerate the timing of a number of planned strategic organizational changes. Based upon our progress, the timeline for Carl Hull to retire from his role as General Manager of Diagnostics was expedited. The reasons for acceleration of this timing are all related to positive factors and the achievement of key internal integration milestones including: a complete sales force training and integration program; our facility relocation plans progressing superbly at this point; the completion of organizational restructuring and customer hand-offs; and finally, the approval of PANTHER, HPV genotyping and Trich coming sooner than expected.","Having surpassed these critical milestones, the senior management team, including Carl, are confident that now is the right time to move forward with the planned management transition in the Diagnostics segment. As we announced, Carl will remain a consultant to Hologic through mid-August and this transition period. We can't thank him enough for his contributions to the organization, and he leaves the segment well-positioned to drive growth over the long term.","Finally, we have a deep bench of talent at Hologic and the legacy Gen-Probe organization. We are excited to offer our team opportunities to assume greater levels of responsibility within the company. We are confident we have the right team in place to help take our Diagnostics segment to the next level and continue to create value for our stakeholders.","Now just a bit about LIFECODES. In early January, we announced an agreement to sell our LIFECODES business to Immucor. Glenn will give you more the details of that, but the sale of LIFECODES allows us to focus on the areas of our Diagnostics franchise that are better aligned with our strong presence in women's health and in infectious disease. We are pleased to have found a strong partner for the LIFECODES asset and look forward to closing this transaction during the fiscal second quarter. While we are always evaluating our portfolio of assets and how best to maximize their value for our shareholders, our guidance for the current year does not assume disposition of any additional business lines.","Now for a brief update on ThinPrep. We continue to see the same underlying trends we have previously discussed; a modest decline in U.S. volumes related to interval expansion, which is always expected; and a solid double-digit growth internationally, especially in China. Were it not for the effects of Hurricane Sandy, we believe our worldwide ThinPrep business would have grown in the low-single-digits, consistent with our previously communicated expectations.","Overall, our women's health Molecular Diagnostics franchise delivered strong growth of 12% on a year-over-year basis in Q1. This is primarily comprised of APTIMA Combo 2, which continued its strong market leadership position in CT\/GC testing and grew mid-to-high single digits year-over-year after adjusting for the impact of Sandy. Our HPV franchise which continues to perform well, posting strong growth of 27% on a year-over-year basis. Both Cervista and APTIMA HPV posted solid growth in the quarter, each with double-digit year-over-year increases. Overall, our HPV franchise remains on track to exceed 20% growth through the year, just as it did in the first quarter.","The PANTHER launch continues to proceed quite well and is also according to plan. Our initial focus has been on upgrading existing DTS customers to PANTHER systems. We are now shifting our emphasis to new PANTHER placements. As we move into this phase of our launch, we expect to see benefits from incremental CT\/GC volumes and, over time, increase in our AUPs.","As we indicated last summer, we expect to place 1,000 PANTHERs by the end of fiscal '15. The recent clearance of APTIMA Trich on PANTHER in the U.S. makes it even more attractive to mid-tier labs, especially those looking to offer some differentiation in the form of test menu.","We will next look to offer HPV and HPV genotyping as part of the PANTHER menu and expect those to be released by the end of calendar 2013. I want to reiterate, the PANTHER remains the premium automated solution for mid-tier labs and is fundamental to our socket strategy. As menu expands on the system, we believe we provide powerful efficiencies and revenue benefits to our lab partners. Operationally, we're pleased we posted solid results in Diagnostics despite the revenue headwinds encountered in the quarter.","Now just a bit about our GYN Surgical business. Surgical grew a healthy 11% on a year-over-year basis after adjusting for the discontinuance of Adiana. On a geographic basis, Europe was quite strong in the quarter, growing in the midteens on year-over-year. MyoSure was once again the driver, with sales more than doubling year-over-year and posting double-digit growth on a sequential basis as well.","We are pleased with the reception of the limited release of our recent additions to MyoSure line, which is MyoSure Light and MyoSure XL. These offerings broaden the types of uterine pathology we can treat, which ultimately expands the market.","Overall, NovaSure sales were essentially flat on a sequential and year-over-year basis. NovaSure remains the market leader in endometrial oblation. However, high deductibles and lower-cost non-GA alternatives have created some obstacles for this product line. Looking ahead, we see growth in NovaSure coming from OUS opportunities in untapped markets, as well as increasing adoption in newer markets for us like China.","We are pleased with the performance in growth trajectory of our Surgical business. With NovaSure stabilized, we see strong growth being fueled by the broader adoption of MyoSure.","In summary, our fiscal year is off to a solid start. And with the substantial progress we have made ahead of schedule with the integration of Gen-Probe, the publication of the Oslo study and the recent FDA approvals and clearances of several products, we are poised to continue delivering strong results. Our new product cycles in tomo and PANTHER have tremendous promise and give us further confidence in our long-term growth outlook.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Glenn Muir.","Glenn P. Muir","Thank you, Rob. First quarter non-GAAP consolidated revenues increased to $644 million and include a net adjustment of $13.3 million, primarily related to our collaboration agreement with Novartis, reflecting the cash that was received for our share of product Novartis shipped to end-use customers in the quarter.","As we discussed in detail on last quarter's earnings call, we believe adjusting revenues provides a more meaningful measure of our true sales in the quarter since if not for the purchase accounting adjustments, we would have recognized revenue on these cash receipts during the quarter. This treatment is consistent with our historical practice. Foreign currency had a negligible impact on consolidated revenues.","And to provide a bit more color on an apples-to-apples basis, pro forma revenue growth was 3% when adjusted to include Gen-Probe for the full quarter of last year and to exclude discontinued businesses such as LIFECODES and Adiana in both quarters. In addition, we estimate that without the impact of Hurricane Sandy, revenues would have grown an additional 75 basis points.","Turning to our operating segments, our Diagnostics revenues represented 49% of total company revenues this quarter, increasing $165 million or 107%. On a pro-forma basis, including Gen-Probe revenues from a year ago and excluding revenues from our discontinued businesses, the Diagnostics segment revenues increased low-single-digits in the current quarter. This was another good quarter for our Diagnostics segment as revenue growth was ahead of the guidance we shared on last quarter's call. Specifically, we forecasted that total Diagnostic revenues would double as compared to legacy Diagnostic revenues in the first quarter of last year. Our legacy Diagnostics business was driven by strong Molecular Diagnostics performance and the continued strength of our ThinPrep franchise in international markets. Legacy Molecular Diagnostics products revenue grew double-digit, driven by our HPV product lines which posted double-digit revenue and 20%-plus volume increases worldwide.","Our ThinPrep business posted strong results in international markets with volume and AFP increases, driving its high single-digit revenue growth. Importantly, this growth offset the mid-single digit decline we saw in the U.S. of which 1\/2, we believe, was due to canceled visits related to Hurricane Sandy.","Turning to the highlights from Gen-Probe's primary product lines, we saw its solid results from clinical diagnostic products which were up 9% from Gen-Probe's reported results a year ago. Separately, blood screening revenues declined slightly due to the timing of instrument sales to Novartis as assay revenues were up. Our APTIMA STD products remain the largest contributor to clinical Diagnostics, led by APTIMA Combo 2 for CT\/GC, with increasing contributions from newer portfolio additions to Trichomonas and the HPV. The trends we saw in the first quarter from these primary business lines were positive and support our long-term expectations of the Gen-Probe business lines.","Our Breast Health revenues increased $5.5 million or 2.5% and represented 3 -- 34% of total sales. Total segment revenue growth was driven by an increase in service revenues, partially offset by a 2% decrease in product revenue. As Rob discussed, the modest decline in mammography product revenues reflects the ongoing mix shift to our Dimensions product lines from our legacy Selenia. Even though 3D tomo system revenues were up 72%, it wasn't enough to offset the 29% decline in 2D-only system sales. This is to be expected as the market shifts to 3D, especially here in the United States.","Our Dimensions product line represented 75% of worldwide digital mammography product revenues and 62% of units sold this quarter and were significantly higher than 1 year ago. First quarter sales benefited from the strong 3D tomo backlog at the beginning of the quarter, and ordered growth during the period drove a 10% increase in backlog at quarter end, both in units and dollars. Worldwide 3D upgrade units increased 32% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, representing almost 25% of 3D tomo unit sales and 10% of tomo revenues. We are very pleased with the growth and increasing adoption of our Dimensions product lines, including our 3D tomo offering, which remain on track with our expectations.","Our GYN Surgical segment reported a $2.4 million or a 3% increase in revenues, driven by triple-digit growth in sales of MyoSure. Excluding Adiana revenues in both periods, GYN Surgical sales increased $7 million or 10%. International sales of NovaSure increased 6%, while domestic declined slightly. Overall, we are quite pleased with the double-digit pro forma revenue growth in the Surgical business.","And finally, our international business achieved positive growth. We experienced mid- to high single-digit growth in each of our Breast Health, Surgical and Skeletal business segments and triple-digit growth within Diagnostics. Diagnostics' growth was driven primarily by the inclusion of the Gen-Probe products over last year, most notably blood screening and APTIMA, and to a lesser extent by 20% growth in Legacy Diagnostics which I discussed a few minutes ago.","Now for a brief review of some of the first quarter non-GAAP performance and the rest of the P&L. If we look at gross margins, they were 62.5% which was flat with the prior year and up 30 basis points sequentially and within our guidance range. Breast Health and Diagnostics posted lower margins year-over-year while GYN Surgical posted another quarter of sharp improvement, up 450 basis points to over 80% due to the favorable mix shift from Adiana to our MyoSure products. Total diagnostic gross margins did decline 550 basis points. This is primarily due to higher international sales and, to a lesser degree, from the contribution of Gen-Probe since close.","Despite an increase in mammography gross margins driven by the shift away from Selenia 2D towards our higher-priced, more profitable Dimensions line, overall Breast Health margins decreased 100 basis points. The margin decrease was in our biopsy line and was primarily caused by the transition of product from our Indianapolis facility, which is being closed to Costa Rica and Massachusetts.","Our operating expenses increased $46.9 million or 31% to $198.3 million, representing 31% of sales compared to 32% last year. This performance was in line with our guidance range. Our net income increased $11.7 million or 13% to $101.8 million. And this quarter EPS was $0.38, $0.01 higher than our guidance of $0.37.","Our non-GAAP EPS this quarter included a benefit of a $0.01 related to the legislative changes associated with the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit. On January 2, legislation was passed to retroactively extend the federal research tax credit for 2 years. We will record this cumulative adjustment in our GAAP results in our second fiscal quarter of 2013. For non-GAAP purposes, we apply this 32% tax rate beginning in our first fiscal quarter.","As of December 29, our cash and equivalents totaled $721 million, up $154 million from the end of fiscal 2012, reflecting another quarter of focused working capital management and solid operational results, both of which contributed to strong free cash flow generation. We continue to focus on improving our cash collection and day sales outstanding. This quarter alone marked an improvement of 4 days, which we were very pleased with, especially given current economic challenges that often result in delayed payments.","One item to note that added positively to our cash inflow this quarter was a $60 million cash receipt from K-V Pharmaceutical in full satisfaction and discharge of our claim. The gain of approximately $54 million, net of related costs, was recorded in our GAAP statement of operations. However, we excluded both the gain and cash inflow from our non-GAAP results and free cash flow guidance for the year. This is consistent with our treatment of all the prior payments received from K-V.","Our total debt obligations stand at $5 billion, resulting in a ratio of total debt to EBITDA of approximately 4.5, down from 5.1 in September. We remain committed to reducing this ratio to 2.5 by the end of fiscal 2015. Debt reduction will be funded by a strong operating free cash flow, which we continue to expect will be approximately $600 million this fiscal year. As a reminder, our initial focus for debt paydown during fiscal '13 is on the $775 million tranche of our convertible notes that are expected to be put to the company in December, as well as $65 million in scheduled principal payments for tranche A and B of our term loans. This obviously requires a substantial amount of cash, so we plan to build our cash balance through fiscal '13 and into fiscal '14 and to focus on starting to pay down the remaining $3.5 billion in debt we borrowed to fund the Gen-Probe acquisition.","In addition, consistent with prior years, our second quarter will include a higher cash outflows as compared to our first quarter as a result of the timing of tax payments, which we expect to approximate $95 million in Q2 as compared to less than $10 million in Q1. In addition, we will have higher interest payments as a result of the semiannual due dates on our $1 billion unsecured note payable.","Another transaction that will add positively to our GAAP cash inflows during our second quarter is our expected sale of our LIFECODES business to Immucor, as Rob discussed. We expect $85 million in cash at closing, subject to certain adjustments. As we did with the payment received from K-V, we have excluded this cash inflow from the anticipated $600 million and annual non-GAAP free cash flow guidance we provided and is therefore incremental.","Our guidance expectations are fully detailed in our Q1 '13 earnings release and our supplementary PowerPoint presentation, both of which are posted on our IR website. Note, our guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and reflects current operations, including revenues from approved and cleared products and recently acquired businesses. It also contemplates the expected sale of LIFECODES during our second quarter. All comparisons are provided on a year-over-year basis.","For Q2 '13 ending on March 30, we expect revenues of $635 million to $640 million, representing year-over-year growth of 35% and 36%. And on a pro-forma basis, excluding the discontinued businesses, growth of approximately 4%. This guidance excludes an expected purchase accounting reduction of $5.2 million related to our Novartis collaboration. Our guidance assumes currency rates consistent with Q1, the continued ramp-up of new products, including the Dimensions, PANTHER and MyoSure systems, and an overall strengthening in each of our operating segments. These increases are partially offset by a reduction in revenues related to our Adiana product, which generated approximately $4.5 million in revenues last year in Q2 and our LIFECODES business, which generated almost $11 million in revenues last year in Q2.","This guidance on a pro-forma basis reflects our expectations that Diagnostics revenues will grow in the low- to mid-single digits, and our Breast Health and GYN Surgical will grow in the mid-single digits. Continuing, we expect our gross margins of approximately 62.5% to 63% and operating expenses at $205 million to $210 million or approximately 32% to 33% of revenues, primarily due to the inclusion of Gen-Probe's operating results and, to a lesser extent, a general ramp-up in anticipation of increasing revenues. In addition, Q2 '12 operating expenses include approximately -- I'm sorry, Q2 '13 operating expenses include approximately $8 million in additional G&A expense related to the medical device excise tax that went into effect on January 1.","Interest expense of approximately $56 million and an effective tax rate of 32%, with approximately 271 million diluted shares outstanding for the quarter. All of these results in EPS of approximately $0.33 to $0.34. The medical device excise tax was expected to be $0.02 dilutive to EPS, partially offset by the federal research tax credit which is expected to add $0.01.","For fiscal 2013, which ends on September 28, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP revenue guidance of $2.61 billion to $2.64 billion. This represents an increase of 30% to 31% over fiscal 2012 revenues of $2.01 billion. This guidance excludes an expected purchase accounting reduction of $22 million related to our Novartis collaboration. In addition, it reflects an increase in revenues related to our acquisition of Gen-Probe resulting in our expectation that Diagnostics revenues will increase in the mid-single digits on a pro-forma basis, excluding LIFECODES, over fiscal 2012. Our guidance also reflects our expectations of high single-digit growth coming from our Breast Health and GYN Surgical segments.","For gross margins, we are increasing our guidance to approximately 63%, the high end of our previous guidance. The key drivers of future margin improvement are expected revenue increases and the addition of the higher-margin Gen-Probe Molecular Diagnostics products.","In addition, we are slightly increasing our operating expense guidance by $10 million to now $785 million to $810 million, which is approximately 30% to 31% of revenue. This reflects, in part, having LIFECODE-related expenses in the quarter which were not anticipated and, in addition, the acceleration and increase in certain marketing and product launch programs in response to recent regulatory approvals and clinical data releases. We continue to expect to incur an additional $25 million of G&A expenses in FY '13 related to the medical device excise tax. Our interest expense will be approximately $220 million, and our diluted shares outstanding will be 272 million.","We are updating our guidance for our annual effective tax rate and EPS as a result of the reinstated research tax credit. We expect the credit to positively impact our effective tax rate, and therefore, we now estimate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 32%, an improvement of 2 percentage points from the guidance of 34% we provided on November 12. And we now expect adjusted EPS of $1.58 to $1.60. This is $0.02 higher than previous guidance due to the income tax benefit, which is partially offset by a slight increase in operating expenses. As a reminder, this EPS guidance includes the impact of the medical device excise tax which we expect to be $0.06 dilutive.","In closing, we are pleased overall with our financial and operating results during the first quarter and look forward to continued progress over the balance of fiscal 2013. The organization responded well to the challenge of driving continuous growth across our business segments while officially executing our integration plans.","As we continue to execute operationally, we also will remain focused on further strengthening our balance sheet. As we've demonstrated in the first quarter, we are taking steps necessary to improve working capital and free cash flow while paying down debt.","And with that, let me turn the call back to Rob.","Robert A. Cascella","Many thanks, Glenn. Well, we believe that there were several important accomplishments in the quarter, and we attribute all of those to truly the breadth and value of our diverse family of products and, obviously, the dedication of our associates. Although the environment remains challenging for all companies in our field, we are more confident than ever that Hologic has the right strategy, product portfolio and leadership to continue growing this company, strengthening our balance sheet and building shareholder value.","I want to thank you all for participating on this call, and we'll now open the call up for questioning. So thank you, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, you had called out a couple of things, Sandy and the ongoing kind of headwinds from the end of film to digital transitions. Can you just talk more specifically about the outlook for Breast Health though? Where are we in the cycle and what are some of the underlying trends in particular for the 2D business?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, well, I think the good news, as we indicated, is that the market seems to be rapidly gravitating towards 3D. What that does in the short term is put certainly some headwinds on the 2D business relative to the normal replacement cycle. I think customers are waiting to buy 3D. And I think that things like the Oslo study are giving them the kind of ammunition that they need to go get budget approvals. And I also believe that the further we penetrate into that market, the competitive dynamic that's being created by the broader adoption of tomo is causing more and more customers to buy the products. So what we're seeing is that as we talked about, even last quarter, there may be some lumpiness in this early period of the rollout of this new piece of capital equipment. But all of the indicators appear very, very positive. And as a matter of fact, we, in our last call, said that we would nearly double the installed base in this fiscal year and we are saying today that we will, at a minimum, double our installed base of tomo products in the U.S. because we feel much more confident about the rollout of the product.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then maybe just a quick follow-up. Can you talk about service dynamics there? Obviously, you're installing or upgrading the installed base. How do we think about the service business? Does that begin to slow once you move past the bolus of upgrades?","Robert A. Cascella","I think what happens with services, as long as the installed base continues to grow, the service revenue continues to grow as well. I think that you may see, and as we have said in the past, a slowing in the growth percent as more and more tomo units are installed because in fact, the tomo units will carry a 1-year warranty and the existing Selenias that are being decommissioned would come off of service contract. But that's actually the kind of trend that we would want to see, right? We would have a significant spike in equipment revenue and a tapering of the growth in services as a result of that.","Operator","Moving onto Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just the first one, if you could maybe touch again with a little more color on the dynamic that you saw in the quarter, with customers holding off on tomo. Is that the way you quantify -- just as you look at conversations with your customers, some of the bigger ones that have bigger capital budgets, do you get a sense that there are sort of earmarks being held out over the next 12 to 18 months if clarity on reimbursement plays out?","Peter K. Soltani","So Isaac, this is Peter. So I think you have a number of questions there. So just a couple of observations. Again, as was noted earlier, our backlog of 3D product did increase quarter-over-quarter. So when you see just the -- and certainly the continuation of the general positive trends, certainly with the sort of the clinical data that was presented in RSNA along with Oslo. That's probably accelerated people not wanting to purchase 2D and, in fact, sort of deferring their decision until they can submit for additional budget dollars to go right to tomo. So all of those dynamics are a little bit complicated. But certainly, it's the kind of thing that we would expect to see. I think you had another question towards the end there, if you'd like to repeat that?","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. Just wondering if you'll offer any color commentary on -- especially with your larger customers, you said to which some of those customers have earmarked dollars if and when they have more clarity on reimbursement. Just trying to get a sense of how your visibility compares now than maybe then prior to Oslo?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I think what Peter's indication was of a backlog increase and more interest from an orders activity perspective is a strong indicator for us. I believe, and I think we believe very strongly, that this product is moving forward from a growth perspective with or without reimbursement. However, the broader adoption of this product, a year down the road or 2 years down the road is certainly going to be highly dependent on that. But we're not seeing any indication today nor have we backed away from the numbers that we gave earlier on about the amount of increase to our installed base because of the momentum that we see being developed in the market. It just simply takes longer to buy a tomo unit than it does to buy a 2D Digital Mammography unit for the reasons that we gave. It's a higher dollar amount, there is no reimbursement. So people are buying for budget dollars that we see happening as is evidenced by the fact that we have a 10% growth on our backlog.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the Diagnostics side of business. Can you maybe comment on the pricing and market share environment, especially for HPV and CT\/NG? Just wondering, what you guys are seeing for pricing on both products and how you feel about market share?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I think on CT\/GC, we have not seen an erosion in pricing. And in fact, we have not lost customers. We believe that our market share is stable. We're still market leaders by a substantial margin here in the United States. I think on the new accounts that we see for HPV, it's a much more competitive market. And I think that because it's incremental business for us, it is at a lower price than some of our earlier HPV wins, but it is business that we did not have in the past. So we're certainly not going to enjoy the days of $18 or $20 a test, and I think that the pricing is much, much lower than that. But as I said, we came from a relatively small installed base and market share to now grow into over 20% and those incremental customers had a lower AUP.","Operator","We're going to move next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions here. Rob, obviously, you've got a few questions here on the breast business. It sounds like the inflection for tomo may be happening sort of earlier, the enthusiasm is happening earlier which is sort of pressuring the 2D business. Now it gives you more confidence in your -- in the tomo business and the backlog, maybe in the back half of the year. But you maintained guidance for breast, so I think the real question I think investors are going to push you on is does this dynamic you're seeing play out here in the first and second quarter increase your visibility as it relates to kind of the breast outlook for the year? Do you feel sort of the same about it, better about it, or incrementally worse about it when you think about the balance of these 2 dynamics?","Robert A. Cascella","We feel better about it. I don't think we're prepared to raise our number other than with the words that I shared in terms of at least doubling versus nearly doubling our installed base. But we feel better about it, we felt much better after RSNA even though the order trend didn't result in revenue that was enough to cover the shortfall in 2D. The backlog activity and the quoting activity that we're seeing is very, very encouraging for the year.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that is very clear. And just one more follow-up question. As it relates to operating expenses, I think the thought heading into this year was there's significant cushion on operating expenses. You had a release out before the quarter talking about ahead of your plan on operating expenses. So as you think about this reinvestment, how should we sort of think about that? Should we think about it, you're ahead of plans so you're choosing to reinvest, or were there expenses this year that you didn't think you're going to see that you are seeing? Or is this simply some of the product approvals are hitting earlier on the year and you expected them more in the back half of the year?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I think it's the latter. We really are very encouraged that we got the product approvals that we did. And then, in fact, they materialized earlier than expectations. So we believe that in order to successfully roll those products out, we are going to pull up some marketing spend as a result of it. So between that and just this hang over on some LIFECODES expenses in this quarter that were not anticipated led to we having to up our OpEx number. And we're talking about $10 million, of course, on a significant number. So we felt that it was probably well justified.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Rob, is it safe to say that if you take the timing of the acquisition and now several months in the acquisition, you still feel better about the level of synergies you're going to be able to achieve?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, absolutely. And I say that without question or without hesitation. It is not now -- we talk about these things happening over a 3-year period of time and we thought that the first tranche was conservative and we still believe that, and we clearly believe that over the 3-year period of time, the $75 million is not at all a challenge.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I apologize if I missed this, but if I just look at the implied first half guidance versus the second half guidance, it implies that a pretty big step-up from first half to second half. Kind of what drives the better growth in the second half?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, there's a lot of things, Jayson, that we've been talking about that we need to be more specific with you, so it's a very fair question. And that is that all of the things that had to do with both our HPV business and our CT\/GC business on PANTHER, particularly, are things that are now being focused on new account closures versus equipment replacements. We believe that generates incremental revenue for us in the mid-tier lab market. In addition, on the Breast Health side, the news about increased backlog, the news about broader adoption of tomo, are certainly outpacing now what -- where we originally thought with respect the customer interest. All of those things were in our plan and are in our plan. So yes, they were -- they are second half loaded, but they are within the expectations that we had when we originally put our budgets together.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just second one for me, the thought of potential distribution synergies, meaning marrying the Gen-Probe portfolio with the larger Hologic sales force always appealed to me. When can you start seeing the benefit or the potential benefit of that marriage?","Robert A. Cascella","I think we're really starting to see it. I mean, you know how lab sales is. It's very time-consuming, it's not transactional, there's a lot of time that goes into education, there's a lot of time that goes into equipment validation assuming that you've won the account. So I mean, it could be anywhere from 60 to 90 days, from an order win or placement before you even start to see dollar one of revenue. So there's a lot of activity that's going on with the combined teams today and driven by both the physician sales team as well as our laboratory sales team. And I think that, again, when we think about the second half, that's when we start seeing -- believing that we start seeing the fruits of a lot of these efforts. And even early on, last quarter, when we suggested to you that we thought we would see a pickup in the CT\/G business but it would happen in the second half of the year because of our physician sales team, because of new PANTHER placements and so on and so forth.","Operator","Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets has the next question.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Brandon on for Glenn. First question, can you just discuss what you're seeing with tomo ASPs on a year-over-year basis? Is it pretty stable or is it declining?","Peter K. Soltani","Brandon, it's Peter. Yes, they're fairly stable I would say. We did introduce another platform last year. It's called the Dimensions 5000. So that provides a different slightly lower price point with some defeatured components on it. But ASPs are holding very steady.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then second question, I might have missed this, but can you discuss your breast biopsy performance in the quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year?","Peter K. Soltani","The breast biopsy business did extremely well. We continue to maintain very strong, and in fact grow our market share, we're very, very pleased with that business and we do certainly expect that business to continue to grow for the rest of the year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move onto Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just want to go over gross margin real quickly. Can you just confirm, I think I heard you guys say that Diagnostics was down about 550 basis points. Was that -- did I say that correctly? And can you guys just address kind of what's going on there? I think you said an increasing OUS sales. But can we dig into that a little bit?","Glenn P. Muir","Right, Brian, it's Glenn. That was in the diagnostics area itself. So if we look year-over-year, back to a point in time where it was Hologic-only with Gen-Probe, we're looking at a slightly different product lineup than we had a year ago. With the ThinPrep and the Hologic products, we were already at a slightly higher gross margin than some of the Gen-Probe products. They were in the mid-to-high '60s, we were in the 60%, almost 70% range. So there's a little bit of an effective of combining the historical Gen-Probe into our mix. But I think even more so, it really is an increase on the international side, especially for the things like ThinPrep where we are getting lower pricing.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","How much more pricing do you guys get outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S.?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I think we're looking at pretty substantial differences, I mean, it's a -- depending on whether it's dealer or direct, would add a different layer. But let's assume it's direct to direct, we're probably 25% lower with respect to OUS pricing. If you layer on dealer sales, there's probably another 10% below that. So and a lot of that depends on the market, right? We're particularly aggressive and succeeding quite well in China, but the pricing in China is much different than the pricing in a market like the U.K., for instance.","Operator","Moving on to Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Do you -- I apologize if I missed this, but was there any update provided on timelines for HPV genotyping and any other menu expansion on PANTHER? And then related to that, and I guess probably just qualitatively, how do you think the -- I know PANTHER is going well but you have a somewhat limited test menu at this point, recognizing how well PANTHER's going, do you actually think you could be doing a lot better now if the menu were expanded? I guess I'd say that because some of the recent checks we've done suggest that while there's a lot of interest in PANTHER, there are at least a handful of folks that are holding back, anticipating an HPV launch later this calendar year.","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I think, to the first question, the HPV and HPV genotyping were due out at the end of the calendar year, this calendar year. I think it's a fair statement. Obviously, there's a lot of enthusiasm over PANTHER but what PANTHER really brings to bear is a very diverse menu and the capabilities for random sampling. So now, with Trich on it, I think we answered part of that requirement. But clearly, our goal is to get a socket locked in with now a CT\/GC and Trich and growing to HPV and to genotyping. What that will probably do this is, on an interim basis, cause us to use our Cervista and HTA. It's kind of a bridging technology until we're ready to convert over to PANTHER. But it is a -- it certainly is both a demand and a requirement from our customers that we are growing menu on that product, and that is our full intention. And by the end of this year, I think we'll fulfill the initial requirement.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one follow-up, I believe you indicated that your guidance assumes no additional divestitures. It still seems like there's still some non-core assets related to some recent M&A that exist within the broader portfolio? Could you talk about the criteria by which you're using in considering future divestitures, and how likely is it that you might pursue additional spinoffs this year?","Robert A. Cascella","And look, we are currently studying the product portfolios of both Gen-Probe and our own legacy Diagnostic business and really looking at what do we think the future holds for many of those businesses. Clearly, we talked about being in virology so we know that we are investing heavily, and we being in viral load testing. But as we look beyond the next 3 to 5 years, what do we want to be? And is there an oncology play that we should be investing in today, and is PCA3 one opportunity to do so? So to be very specific about it, it's products like that will take a little bit longer for us to really get comfortable with and to research the broader implications of we investing in not just that particular application but in that field in general. So why I said what I did during the call is I don't think we're going to get a point where we're going to be comfortable enough to do anything like that this year. I think what we're doing this year is really studying what we think the opportunities are around each of those businesses.","Operator","Vijay Kumar with ISI Group has the next question.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My first one was just a quick housekeeping. So what was the Gen-Probe contribution in the quarter and what's the sort pull-through run rate on the PANTHER?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, I think what we did on Gen-Probe was give you -- each of the product lines and what their growth was in the quarter. But I don't know if we gave a...","Glenn P. Muir","We don't really carve out Gen-Probe because their product lines have all been simulated into the Diagnostics group. So I don't have a real single number. We tried to back into Gen-Probe's clinical diagnostic products as an example of some of the traction. So I did say that the clinical Diagnostics, so 2\/3 of their old business, was up 9% and the other 1\/3 is the blood screening.","Brandon Henry - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I think I can back in the numbers on that. So just maybe on the pull-through for PANTHER, I know that you have the Trichomonas assay approved. Can you provide some color?","Robert A. Cascella","We're not giving units other than to reconfirm that the 1,000-unit target that we had by 2015 is certainly well underway. I mean, I can say with a level of certainty that we are ahead of expectations relative to PF replacements. I think what we're focused on today is now that we think we've fulfilled our DTS replacements, or at least are getting to a point where we're fulfilling the DTS replacement, we're now pointing those sales efforts at new account wins, and we believe that will be a much stronger opportunity for incremental revenues. So I think that from a unit perspective, we seem to be on or ahead of placement plans. I think the difference over the next half of the year will be a much stronger emphasis on new account closures which would result in incremental revenue.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on Breast Health, you did mention backlog was up 10%. And can you just comment on maybe the pacing in the quarter? What happened before and after RSNA, maybe after the publication of Oslo?","Peter K. Soltani","Vijay, this is Peter. Yes, I mean, basically what happened is that -- a couple of things. One is that the quote activity increased significantly and many folks who were sort of on the fence waiting for the clinical data to sort of validate the clinical marriage of the technology, they kind of moved off the fence, so we see just an overall pickup and interest in the quote activity and presentations and so forth.","Operator","Rich Newitter with Leerink Swann has the next question.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I just was wondering, just going back to a prior question earlier on Breast Health, as we think about the remainder of the year and the dynamics playing out between kind of the declining 2D and what sounds like a better outlook for your 3D adoption, is it right to assume, basically, that you see the 3D accelerating to a level that should more than offset whatever declines play out in 2D? Or is there still the potential for lumpiness to possibly outweigh the 3D adoption in the back half?","Robert A. Cascella","I think that there is lumpiness in any new capital rollout. What we believe, however, is that 3D placements start to outpace 2D erosion and just by the sheer fact that their ASPs are higher. But what I mean by lumpiness is that I think until we get to a point where there is a broader and thicker backlog on tomosynthesis, I think you're going to see some lumpiness because of the fact that it's a piece of capital equipment and there's a lot of things that go into an account closure. But having said that, the optimism is there relative to we showing an ongoing trajectory and acceleration of a product over the next -- the second half of the year.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And on your -- your reiteration of your cost synergies in Gen-Probe integration, I'm just curious, is that something -- I think last quarter, you said that your guidance was not fully reflecting the achievement of even those conservative synergy assumptions. Is it correct to assume that current guidance is still not necessarily maybe leaving a little cushion in there and that the incremental OpEx you're calling out is incremental, but again there could be incremental offsets to the extent that you're not fully forecasting the synergies in guidance?","Glenn P. Muir","Rich, it's Glenn. I think if we think about the cost synergies that we identify for Gen-Probe, nothing has changed. We still feel very confident of where we are on achieving well over that $40 million target that we kind of pegged in the first year in $75 million. So yes, we feel good about that, but those expenses and the actions that we took at the beginning of the fiscal year to enable those cost synergies to come through, those changes have been made. So we'll begin seeing those as the year plays out. The OpEx $10 million increase that we identified or upped our guidance for this quarter wasn't related to Gen-Probe or cost synergies. That was really related to other parts of the business other than, I guess, the little LIFECODE piece that we hadn't anticipated. In our thinking about fiscal year '13, we were expecting to close LIFECODES at the very end of the first quarter. So we've got a little bit of a spillover of expenses into Q2 because of that.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. But just to -- am I right in thinking that your prior guidance was not necessarily fully baking in that full benefit of potential cost synergy?","Glenn P. Muir","Yes. No, no, that's correct. I meant to say yes to that. Very clearly, yes.","Operator","We'll now move onto Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Unknown Analyst","This is Nick Nolan [ph] in for Amit. Quick question on the basis in 2D. How do we think of this going forward in the pacing of this? Do we see similar declines over the next few quarters, similar to what we're seeing this quarter? How do we think about that going forward?","Peter K. Soltani","Yes, I mean, it's -- I mean, if you think about things globally from a 2D demand standpoint, I mean, there are certainly parts of the world that are just not ready for 3D and the demand for 2D will continue to stay fairly stable. But I would certainly say that in the mature markets such as North America and Europe, there's certainly going to be downward decreases in 2D. Anybody needing to get 2D, it would certainly be, frankly, an obsolete product. So you kind of have to add the 2 together to get a sense of where things are going to go. But I would certainly say that we're probably see, again, decreases in 2D adoption in the U.S.","Operator","Moving on to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First, I have a couple of questions. In terms of additional assets on PANTHER, obviously this subject has come up a couple of times today. But I guess I'm curious, because you gave us timing for Trich and HPV, how do we think about alternative sample specimens, things like urine, that sort of thing, for chlamydia, gonorrhea as well as Trich?","Robert A. Cascella","Yes, so I think relative to our sample types for PANTHER, and particularly for CT\/GC, I think any of the voids that we have, particularly in male urine, I think that will be completed by the end of the year. We're also completing female urine, but we don't feel that's critical, and that will probably be in the middle of the following year. So we think by the end of the year, we will fulfill the critical sample typing for CT\/GC and Panther as well as menu fulfillment of HPV as well.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time that we have today for questions. I'll turn the conference back to our speakers for closing or additional remarks.","Robert A. Cascella","I think that's really all that we have.

My name is Matt, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Michael J. Watts - Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications","Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic's third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them today. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through August 26.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known as well as unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC.","Also, during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our results were very solid and illustrate how far we've come and how quickly we're progressing on our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company.","Revenues of $717.4 million exceeded expectations as all four of our businesses grew on a global basis, despite a difficult comparison resulting from very strong results in the prior year period. In our last call, we focused on the emergence of our Surgical business as a growth driver. This quarter, Surgical led the way with exceptional performance, but we're also pleased with how our breast imaging, molecular diagnostics and cytology businesses performed and we made progress in strengthening our international franchises, which we believe will be important contributors to future growth.","Our performance this quarter highlighted the breadth of our top-line growth drivers, which is often overlooked even as performance has improved ahead of schedule in many areas, new drivers are beginning to emerge thanks to the deliberate and proactive efforts of our team. And while this quarter is only a single data point, our results do give us increased confidence that revenue growth can continue at a healthy pace in the future.","Our third quarter results also demonstrated once again our ability to increase profitability above and beyond already high levels. We boosted both gross and operating margins even while reinvesting aggressively to drive future growth. We've been pleasantly surprised at our ability to achieve productivity gains and enjoying many other levers to drive earnings growth. For example, strategies that we had expected to play out over the longer-term horizon are materializing sooner than expected. Various internal restructuring yielded a lower tax rate in the quarter and the combination of strong cash flows and market volatility enabled us to buyback more shares. Together, all these efforts led to a very robust net margin of 20.2% in the quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 and excellent EPS growth of 18.6% on a non-GAAP basis.","Based on the strong earnings performance, we are raising our financial guidance for the year and now expect non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and a $1.94. As a reminder, the midpoint of this new guidance is roughly $0.12 above our guidance at the beginning of the year. We're clearly exceeding our own expectations for a sustainable bottom line growth, and feel good about our future prospects in this regard as well.","With that introduction out of the way, I'd like to walk through our revenue highlights in the balance of my remarks then Bob will discuss expenses, the rest of our financials and our updated guidance. Unless otherwise noted, percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis.","Starting with the big picture, total revenues were $717.4 million in the third quarter, an increase of 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.6% in constant currency terms. These figures include roughly $8 million headwind from divested and discontinued products, such as Sentinelle breast coils and the molecular test for cystic fibrosis. If we were to back out this headwind, total revenues would have been grown 4.8% in constant currency terms.","These growth rates are stacked on top of a very difficult comp from the prior year. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2015, total revenues increased 12.2% in constant currency. So our ability to jump over a high bar this quarter, gives us increasing confidence in the ability of our commercial organization to drive solid growth next year and beyond.","In terms of geography, U.S. sales grew 4.7% in the third quarter, continuing a string of good results and indicating the improvements we've made in commercial execution. We continue to enjoy strong leadership positions and good momentum in the domestic marketplace.","International sales declined 1.2% on a reported basis, driven primarily by blood screening as expected. In constant currency, international sales declined 0.4%, essentially flat, and we were to normalize for divested and discontinued products, international sales would have increased slightly. It's also worth mentioning that international sales increased sequentially as well, an encouraging sign. Overall, we believe, our international results in the third quarter show we are building a foundation for strong and consistent growth over time.","Toward that end, our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton, has made good progress in filling out our international leadership team in recent months. In last quarter's call, we highlighted new executives in-charge of European Breast Health and Service, as well as marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory. More recently, we have added new geographic sales leaders to run Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific, so our efforts to upgrade talent are coming together nicely.","Shifting to the types of revenue we generate, I want to emphasize it for all the attention our mammography systems received capital equipment represented just 23.4% of revenue in the third quarter. Said another way, more than 76% of our sales were recurring. More specifically, disposables such as our diagnostic assays and surgical tools represented 60.4% of sales, while service and other totaled 16.2% of sales.","Now, let me discuss divisional revenues in the third quarter. I will start with the growth leader in the quarter, our GYN Surgical business. A couple of years ago, no one would have said those words in the same sentence but today our team has achieved what others thought impossible. Worldwide, Surgical sales were a $102 million surpassing $100 million on a quarterly basis for the first time. Sales grew, 19.8%, in constant currency, the fastest growth rate for this division in recent memory. In the United States, the team delivered double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. And internationally, the business grew by nearly 40% albeit of a very small base.","As many of you know, a competitor recently withdrew its endometrial ablation product from the market and to capitalize on this, we increased marketing and sales activities in the quarter. As a result, global sales of our NovaSure product totaled $61 million, an increase of 14.6% in constant currency. Not to be overlooked, sales from our MyoSure products for uterine fibroid removal, also continue to show strength. Global MyoSure sales of $40.8 million increased 29.8% in constant currency.","Now let's turn to Breast Health, which has received a lot of attention in recent months. While this is understandable and appropriate, it's just as important to appreciate that Hologic is much more than a mammography company today. Hopefully our results this quarter help illustrate that point, and provide confidences that the entire company can continue to grow revenue solidly and EPS much faster even as growth from 3D adoption naturally slows. We're very pleased with our Breast Health performance in the quarter. Global sales of $282.5 million increased 1.1%. Breast imaging sales totaled $239.3 million, up 2.3% in constant currency driven by continued adoption of our Genius 3D mammography systems.","Domestic imaging sales grew more rapidly and exceeded our internal expectations based on Genius placements, which increased both sequentially and year-over-year. We estimate that Genius systems are continuing to gain market share, while our investments in customer marketing help us maintain stable prices, amid fierce competition.","We still have lots to look forward to in Breast Health. Genius systems represent less than 40% of our own mammography installed base today and by our estimate, less than 25% of the market as a whole and we remain confident in the long-term conversion opportunity, as evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologic's Genius exams for patients and physicians and as we differentiate ourselves competitively.","As evidence of this, mammography customers recently surveyed by the independent market research firm KLAS scored Hologic highest in overall product satisfaction. One Director of Radiology said, \"Hologic seems to be the only company that really understands the tomosynthesis market. It was clear from our implementation and our usage of their system that they are a full generation ahead of other vendors. Everybody else is playing catch-up.\" This is only one anecdotal comment, but it's consistent with the customer feedback we receive everyday and validates our leadership position.","As our installed base of Genius 3D systems grows, our sales and marketing programs are focusing on ways to leverage this leadership position. For example, service revenue is becoming increasingly important and represents an annuity that complements and smoothes out our capital sales. Some of you may not appreciate the size of our service business in Breast Health. To frame it for you, service revenue in this business exceeded $100 million in the quarter for the first time and grew at a mid-single digit rate.","Similarly, we have revamped our research and development efforts to capitalize on our growing Genius footprint and generate a more continuous stream of product innovations. For example, we recently launched our new Affirm Prone Biopsy System, which provides a better patient experience and enables doctors to capitalize on the increased sensitivity of 3D technology. Although it's still early days, customer feedback on the system has been positive both in the United States and internationally.","Another component of future growth in Breast Health will be our international business. While we still have a lot of work to do here, we are making good progress and are optimistic that the business is becoming healthier and more predictable as we create the foundation for solid growth in 2017 and beyond.","In the third quarter, international Breast Health sales declined 2.9% in constant currency. But if we back out the headwind from divested and discontinued products, sales would have been flat, and on a sequential basis, sales increased slightly. With this in mind, I want to remind everyone that last year's international Breast Health number was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter and as a result, we anticipate a year-over-year decline in the coming quarter before the business returns to growth in 2017.","As we move into 2017, we do believe that the combination of multiple tailwinds: a still underpenetrated 3D opportunity, growing service revenue, a revitalized R&D effort, and international expansion, will enable Breast Health to be an important contributor to corporate growth.","Now, let's cover Diagnostics, which is our largest business and greatest source of non-GAAP operating profit. Diagnostics reported sales of $309.9 million in the third quarter, growing 1.2% in constant currency. Within Diagnostics, our cytology and molecular businesses performed well, while our blood screening business declined as expected. Global sales of cytology and perinatal products totaled $122.2 million, growing 3.9% on a constant currency basis. Breaking this down a little further, both our ThinPrep and fetal fibronectin franchises grew in the United States and internationally. Despite lingering headwinds from Pap interval expansion domestically.","Turning to molecular diagnostics, we posted global sales of $131.8 million, up 6.0% in constant currency. Excluding sales of our discontinued cystic fibrosis product, molecular sales would've grown at a high-single-digit range rate. Our domestic business was solid, as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins and as utilization of our assays for trichomonas, HPV and chlamydia\/gonorrhea continues to grow.","But the real standout here, was our international business. Over the last couple quarters, international molecular sales had turned slightly positive under new leadership. And we had added viral load assays to the Panther menu. Building on this, the business took a significant step ahead in the third quarter with constant currency growth exceeding 20%. In addition, we had a record quarter of Panther placements outside the United States coupled with a significant step up in per instrument utilization. All these data points have us feeling good about the potential for international molecular diagnostics to become a new driver of growth for the company over time.","Shifting back to the United States for a moment, during the third quarter we gained an emergency use authorization for our Zika virus test for diagnostic use. In addition, blood banks began testing donated blood for Zika with our Procleix assay under an Investigational New Drug protocol. While we do not expect significant sales from these two new products, both of which run on the Panther system, our ability to rapidly develop these tests, shows we can react quickly to public health emergencies in close cooperation with regulators and customers. In addition, should the Zika virus spread in United States, we will be well positioned in the marketplace.","Apart from the highlight of the Zika IND, our blood screening business declined in the quarter as expected. Worldwide sales of blood screening products were $55.9 million down 12.9%, with all the decline coming outside the United States. As in the second quarter, this decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior-year period to support testing at the Japanese Red Cross combined with continued trends toward lower blood utilization.","Before I turn the call over to Bob. Let me wrap up the review of product sales by mentioning that our Skeletal Health division posted revenues of $23.0 million in the quarter. This represented a constant currency increase of 4.8% with growth both domestically and overseas primarily driven by our Horizon bone density scanner.","So, in conclusion, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and with the progress we've made towards building a sustainable growth company. Despite very challenging prior year comps, all four of our businesses grew in the quarter reflecting the many growth drivers at our disposal. Sales growth in the U.S. Breast Health slowed due to a challenging prior year comp, but remained healthy. At the same time, strong results in Surgical, molecular diagnostics, and cytology demonstrated that Hologic is much more than a mammography company. We continue to execute well in the United States and made good progress in building a foundation for international growth. We once again expanded profit margins and redeployed capital contributing to EPS growth at the highest rate in many years.","Now, I'll hand the call over to Bob.","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I am going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, and then wrap up with updated financial guidance for 2016.","As a reminder, I will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.","As Steve discussed, our revenue performance in the third quarter exceeded expectations, highlighted by global growth in all four business segments. This growth, coupled with favorable product mix and productivity gains, again drove improvements in gross and operating margins. At the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives that position us for long-term, sustainable growth. Net-net, we delivered EPS growth well in excess of sales, reflecting the impact of operational improvements, capital deployment and a lower effective tax rate.","Now let's dive deeper into the third quarter income statement. Gross margin of 65.7% increased 50 basis points, and benefited from the growth of our Surgical, cytology and perinatal, and Aptima franchises. We continue to manage pricing well, as we focus on commercial excellence and our marketing initiatives highlight the clinical and economic value of our products. In addition, our operations teams continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs across our supply chain.","Total operating expenses of $229.2 million increased 3.1% in the third quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense, which increased 15.5%. Given our gross margin expansion, we have invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where we see a good return. These include our Genius marketing campaign in Breast Health, our cervical cancer co-testing initiatives in Diagnostics, and efforts to gain competitive market share with NovaSure. These strategic initiatives are paying off through increased brand awareness, market share gains, and price stability, all of which contribute to higher sales.","Despite the increased sales and marketing spending, operating margins improved 60 basis points in the quarter, slightly more than gross margins, based primarily on leverage in general and administrative expenses.","Moving down the P&L, interest expense of $33.9 million was 12% lower than in prior year due to our efforts to both reduce and restructure our debt. And in addition, our tax rate is improving earlier than expected, based on changes in our income mix and internal restructurings implemented this year and last. We now estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 32% for the full-year 2016. We trued up to this rate in the third quarter, reducing our effective rate to 30.6%, but we expect the rate to normalize back to 32% in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our tax rate was 34.25% just last year, so we are making good progress.","We are pleased that all these efforts have enabled us to grow net profits even faster than operating profit. Our net margin was 20.2% in the quarter, a very strong level, and an improvement of 190 basis points over the prior year.","To wrap up the income statement review, diluted shares outstanding were 282 million in the third quarter, roughly 10 million lower than a year ago. Over the course of this year, we have worked to pay down a portion of in-the-money converts to reduce their dilutive effects. And more recently, we have taken advantage of market volatility to repurchase our common stock.","In the third quarter, we bought back 3 million shares of stock for $101.2 million, which exhausted our prior, $250 million repurchase authorization. Recently, our board of directors has approved an additional $500 million repurchase program, and we're very pleased to have that arrow in our quiver going forward.","While we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far in improving our capital structure and achieving a more competitive tax rate compared to other medtech companies, we know we can continue to improve. And we believe these improvements will help us deliver EPS growth much faster than revenue over an extended period of time.","Now I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, beginning with inventory. Inventory decreased by $14.5 million, or 4.9%, compared to a year ago, despite a 3.4% increase in sales. This speaks to strong alignment between the operations and sales teams, who know that every dollar saved in inventory serves as dry powder for debt reduction, acquisitions or share repurchase.","And speaking of our debt, at the end of the third quarter, total debt outstanding was $3.4 billion, a decrease of more than $0.5 billion from a year ago. During the quarter, we paid off $175 million that had been outstanding on our $1 billion revolving line of credit using proceeds borrowed at a lower interest rate under a new, $200 million accounts receivable securitization program.","Adjusted non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, totaled $262.5 million in the third quarter, an increase of 5.1%. Based on EBITDA of more than $1 billion over the last 12 months, our leverage ratio, calculated as net principal debt over EBITDA, stands at 2.97, the first time this ratio has fallen below 3 since the Gen-Probe acquisition. In addition, we are well on the way to achieving our target leverage ratio of 2.5 times by the end of fiscal 2017.","Strong profit growth and lower debt have continued to improve our return on invested capital, or ROIC, which was 12.3% on a trailing 12 months basis, a 170 basis point increase over the prior year. Robust cash flows and minimal capital expenditures continue to be hallmarks of Hologic's financial performance. Operating cash flow was $246.2 million in the third quarter, an increase of 1.6%. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $225.1 million. Notably, free cash flow was 55.1% higher than non-GAAP net income. Our financial health clearly extends well beyond our P&L as we continue to focus on working capital, and control our capital expenditures.","Now let's turn to our updated financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. At the midpoint, we are raising both revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the company's strong performance in the third quarter. Let's cover the revenue guidance first.","For the full year, we are increasing our previous guidance by $10 million at the low end, and now expect total revenues of between $2.82 billion and $2.83 billion for fiscal 2016. This represents solid, mid-single-digit growth of 4.3% to 4.6% on a reported basis, or 5% to 5.3% in constant currency terms, despite the headwind from divested and discontinued products.","With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance obviously implies revenues of $714 million to $724 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period, which is another tough comp. This range reflects revenue growth of 1.6% to 3.0% on a reported basis, or 2.1% to 3.6% in constant currency terms. In addition, our guidance includes an expected headwind of roughly $4.5 million from divested and discontinued products, which depresses our constant currency guidance by about 60 basis points.","Based on our revenue range, our fourth quarter guidance implies that revenues will be about the same, or slightly above our third quarter actuals. We no longer expect the significant sequential step-up implied by our prior guidance, as some revenue that we originally forecasted for the fourth quarter materialized a little earlier than expected. In addition, we forecast another quarter of incremental softness in blood screening sales, as inventory levels and ordering patterns continue to normalize.","Turning to our updated bottom-line guidance, we now forecast non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and $1.94 for the full year. This translates to reported growth between 15.6% and 16.2%, and constant currency growth between 16.9% and 17.5%. This earnings guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, a full-year tax rate of 32%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 288 million for the full year.","This full-year guidance translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.50 in the fourth quarter. This represents growth of 14% to 16.3% on a reported basis, or 15% to 17.3% in constant currency terms. Implicit in our fourth quarter guidance is a sequential increase in operating expenses, several million dollars of which relate to a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan that will make it more consistent with our peers.","Before opening up the call for questions, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the financial results we have achieved so far in fiscal 2016. From a revenue perspective, our Surgical business continues to exceed expectations. We still enjoy momentum with Genius 3D mammography, remain pleased with our molecular diagnostics and ThinPrep businesses, and are turning the corner internationally. And from an earnings perspective, we continue to generate tremendous growth through gross and operating margin improvement, a lower tax rate, and capital deployment.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll move to our first question, which is from Jonathan Groberg with UBS.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a million and congratulations on another solid quarter and raise. Can you maybe talk a little bit, Steve, about international and Diagnostics. I think, you said that was up 20% currency neutral, record Panther placements. Was there anything beyond new management, better execution, that benefit from the Zika that you mentioned. I'm just kind of curious if there was any \u2013 if you can \u2013 any other color you can provide on that?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jon. Thank you. It's really, to be very clear it is the new management that we put in place. We actually hired a new leader for our European Diagnostics business, really just about a year ago, last summer and he has been revamping the team getting up to speed. And then, we did launch, we got the clearance if you recall early this year \u2013 really early this calendar year to the viral loads. We got the HCV, HPV and HIV. So they're rolling out in conjunction with the new leadership team and the Panther placements and those things are really driving it.","Zika by the way is not in those numbers, so that's really just our core women's health assays plus the viral load. So I think what we are excited about as we started to look forward in Diagnostics. Molecular has effectively been non-existent outside the U.S., I mean, not non-existent but pretty small. And now, we're really getting that footprint and as we're placing these Panthers starting to feel like okay, this is the beginning of something that really is sustainable and has some good growth ahead of it. As well, the cytology business continues to tick along as well with some modest growth outside the U.S. also. So I think (33:07)","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","I was going to say \u2013 hey, Jonathan, this is Bob. Just to build on what Steve was saying. I mean, I think, really what we're seeing right now is a very competitive assay menu when we are going up against the competitive nature with the viral loads and the STD. And so I think, we've got as competitive of a menu as anyone else does. But I think what we have seen is a series of strong quarterly placements for the last several quarters and we are starting to get those back on. They are up and running in that test of record. And so I think, we are seeing that pull through and seeing the benefits of the Panther system, which we've seen here in the U.S. around benefits of automation and so forth, which I think will really play well, particularly in Europe.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","I guess, if I can just follow up, the basis for my question is, is there anything that you can learn from kind of the new management and how long it took and what you are seeing that is it all applicable to what you may be able to achieve in Breast Health or are they just two different businesses?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","They are different businesses but there is a lot to learn. I think, Jonathan, probably the way to think about it is, as we started to describe, really about this time last year, we really are moving in \u2013 we are really a start-up company outside the U.S. franchise-by-franchise. I think, what we've seen, the new leader within the European Diagnostics business, he is bringing a level of focus, he is building out a team. There were some people there, he has changed some out, gotten the others to operate up, but he really is starting to build it up. And I think that's what Eric Compton has really been driving, especially this year is getting the right people in place for the longer-term. I'd give, just anecdotally, Bob and I happened to be in Japan last week and again, half of our employees in Japan have been with us less than a year.","So it truly is \u2013 we look at a company of our size from the outside and think okay, they just have to get it going and turnaround what's there, this really is building it out. So I think, we've seen some emerging signs in Diagnostics over the last couple of quarters, didn't want to quite say yet until we thought okay, this is now sustainable. And I think we're in the same infrastructure building in Breast Health and other stuff. Breast Health because more dealers involved, will probably take a little bit longer. But I will tell you underneath the surface we're feeling very good where as I always say, the infrastructure gets better before the numbers show it, and I think that's kind of the stages that we're in right now.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Congratulations again.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","We'll move now to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Steve, wondering if you could talk about the sustainability of GYN Surg. Obviously you've seen some good strength there, particular on NovaSure, are you able to disaggregate how much of that's coming from the Thermochoice recall and maybe picking up some share there?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Great question, Tycho. I think the way we should think about it right now is we're clearly benefiting and most of the NovaSure growth I think we should say is candidly coming from the competitive recall, of which we still have another, call like it quarter, quarter-and-a-half-ish ahead of us with that.","Having said that, I'd remind everybody, as we said, this was our sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth both domestically and globally for our GYN Surg business. So that business had turned it around and strengthened dramatically and was then well poised when the competitive issue happened. So, we're taking advantage of it. MyoSure continues to grow. And I think the way we think about our GYN Surg business here is, we're not ready to declare it a sustainable double-digit grower, but it's clearly a very solid grower. And again, this is one where internationally we're just in a very early stages as well. So, again, it's moved from what I'd call an appendage on the company a couple years ago to something that can actually start to meaningfully contribute to our total growth. It's also hugely accretive to our gross margin, operating margin. It's a great cash generator. There's a lot of good things and it's helping on our tax rate, frankly.","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Hey, Tycho, this is Bob. Just to build on that, we actually referenced some of the exceeding expectations. We actually think that some of the share gains materialized a little earlier in the third quarter than what we were expecting in the fourth quarter really on the back of the work that the team has done there and the investments we've made in sales and marketing. So, that's some of the \u2013 we think that there still is legs there, as Steve said, but that ramp has actually happened nicely for us in the third quarter.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, and then just a follow-up to the question earlier on Diagnostics, it's early days for viral load. I don't know if you can put any metrics around how that business has tracked relative to your expectations but can you also talk about whether that's a good proxy for when you ultimately do roll out in the U.S. and what's the latest thinking on timing. Could you have viral load here by the end of next year or is that more of a 2018 event?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. It's still pretty small within Europe. It's not yet material to the company but I think the initial signs are pretty good. And what's I think very encouraging to us is in Europe, we're launching from a much weaker base than where we are when we bring the viral loads to the United States. So, when we bring the viral loads, which to the second part of your question is really in 2018, a fiscal 2018 and probably, really second halfish of 2018 by the time we have all three. So, we will have likely one much sooner but by the time we have HPV, HCV and HIV, it will be later on in 2018, and by that point we will be launching in the U.S. from our much bigger install base, much stronger position overall. So I think the fact we are able to even have some success in Europe in other people's backyards is already an increasingly, encouraging sign for it, when we do come to these States.","Operator","At this time, we will move to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Bill.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good afternoon everyone. So, Steve, just start off on tomo here, I think your tomo was little more positive perhaps than last quarter and I am curious if we can dig into why? I mean, does this have anything to do with the competitive dynamic? I mean, it strikes me that, there is potentially an opportunity here over several years to take some incremental share from your two principal competitors in the mammography space domestically.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Bill. Probably, because I just met with our Breast Health sales leadership team earlier today but no, aside from that, we continue to feel very good about where that business is going. I think some of the comments \u2013 one of my comments on the last call might have been more misinterpreted. I think what we are really seeing fundamentally in the Breast Health business is our ability to take more market share than I ever would have imagined call it two years, two-and-a-half years ago.","But I think the business is also very encouraging. It's going to be stronger for longer and while there has been so much obsession from the outside of what I call the peak followed by the cliff, we still see \u2013 we are still, as we said in the script, we are less than 40% even into our own install base. We are less than 25% even into the installed base in the market place. And as we are gaining market share it says there is still a lot of runway ahead of us. What I have been trying to signal all along is don't expect the kind of growth rates we'd had historically, but the business fundamentally has a lot of great quarters still ahead of it.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Fantastic. Separately on Surgical, just spend a couple of minutes here on the Bovie Medical deal. Is this a sort of, I guess deal we should be expecting or deals we should be expecting in Surgical going forward, kind of a try it before you buy it sort of deal, Steve, or are you still looking around at additional products for the bag?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks. As we've said, we are clearly looking for additional products for Surgical. Having said that, right now, I'm really glad we don't have much more because we've been handed this opportunity to permanently increase our market share, obviously with a competitive situation.","And I think as we go forward, we are just beginning the business development efforts, and I think you'll see a series of things, whether it's a very limited distribution deal like this one where we are trying it with a few reps and that were, two, outright right acquisitions. I would say on the business development front, everybody should know, we've gotten much more active. We said no to a number of things over the last quarter or two. And, I think a lot of that has been our teams getting very much more disciplined about what we are looking at and more active.","And I think frankly getting to the stage where you're saying no to deals and why is the no, and what you should we be looking for, I think, as we go into 2017 feeling better and better that we'll be finding some things that we will be saying yes to. But certainly some maybe distribution, some will be outright acquisition. I wouldn't view that as the model of what we'll necessarily be doing, we'll just be flexible.","Operator","At this time, we'll move to Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Maybe first question for Steve, second question for Bob. Steve, in the third quarter there were a number of nice developments. Molecular is better than expected, particularly OUS, and Surgical growth was quite strong. You remain enthused about a firm in Brevera. Recognizing one quarter usually doesn't make a trend, would it be fair to say you feel a bit better about your ability to power through the impact of US 3D growth plateauing than you did maybe even a quarter ago? And then for Bob, you beat the midpoint of guidance by I think it is $17 million this quarter. You're increasing full-year guidance to midpoint by only $5 million. I was hoping you could provide a bridge between the quarter and the full-year guide. Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Doug. I would say I feel a little bit better. I think the truth is, I've always felt a lot better than I probably communicated on the last call. I truly believe it was a complete overreaction. And my strength does continue or my confidence continues to build as I watch each quarter play out. We were going up against a monster comp this quarter. And our team is still really, call it two years old or less for the most part, and wanting to make sure that we can deliver before we get out ahead of ourselves. So I think I feel a little bit better, but I think overall I feel very confident about where we're headed. I felt more confident than came off last time. So it's not a dramatic shift in how I feel, but it's clearly probably a dramatic shift in the perception and I own that, but feeling very good about a lot of things we've going on.","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Doug. Hey, this is Bob. Just to follow-up on the second part of your question. Yeah, as you mentioned, we did raise the guidance by $5 million at the midpoint versus the $17 million beat. If you recall our previous guidance included a fairly sharp sequential increase in Q4 revenue and some of that revenue as I mentioned actually earlier materialized a little earlier than expected places like our Surgical business.","And then beyond that, we do see potential for incremental kind of sequential weakness within our blood screening businesses as that business continues to normalize from an inventory perspective. So that said, our fourth quarter guidance still implies solid year-over-year growth despite another challenging comparison and a headwind of about 60 basis points from those divested in discontinued products. So we feel good about the guidance and just as importantly, maybe more importantly, our EPS guidance is even stronger, multiple \u2013 a series of multiples above that for the fourth quarter growing at 14% to 16% on an as reported basis.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","We'll move along to Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks, and congrats on the quarter. I want to start with some of the commentary around the service contracts in Breast Health. And I think I caught this was the first quarter over $100 million. I know there is some moving parts around warranty and just how that's rolled through since you hit the inflection at this point last year in terms of the instruments replacements. Could you walk us through what you think the sustainable rate for that is and whether you're seeing better attachment with 3D placement?","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Jack, this is Bob. I think from an attachment rate perspective, we continue to feel very good about our attachment rate. We haven't seen any incremental change either up or down and have continued to be very strong in excess of 85%. And so, I think that's a real testament to our sales teams and more importantly our service teams and the customer satisfaction that we have with our products. So, I don't see any change there and I think what you would expect to see is a continued \u2013 the nice part about that is it's a nice solid annuity in that probably mid-single digit growth rate area going forward. Some of this is we are actually transitioning from a 2D system to a 3D system where you'll get the incremental benefit associated with the higher service contract and then the beauty of actually the competitive share gains is you get the full benefit of the service contract on that. And we are seeing both of those as well. So, we think that that has a lot of legs, not only for the rest of this year but certainly into 2017 and beyond.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And one on the early success with viral load in Europe. Just where you are seeing some wins \u2013 where do you think you're differentiated in the market? Could you just walk us through the value proposition for the Panther? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think it's the same benefits largely we have here which is workflow automation and the Panther system, the footprint is a very nice addition for Europe.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","We'll take a question now from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Steve, I was hoping you could \u2013 it's hard to miss this qualitative commentary around stronger for longer. You just said it so much this call, I thought maybe you would make it the new Hologic tag line. But the reality is, I would like you to maybe take that qualitative commentary and I wonder if you could make it quantitative for us next year. I know it is too early to give guidance, but I think about the fourth quarter, there is stability. Your guidance for the fourth quarter suggests that stability continues. So, as you think about next year, low-single digits versus mid-single digit revenue growth for the business. Are you comfortable in more of a mid-single digit outlook?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey David. Based on the market reaction following our last call, I think we'll stick to giving the guidance in our fourth quarter call rather than commenting on a number before we formally approve the budget. Having said that, we do believe we'll have a solid year in 2017, and we'd clearly be disappointed with the low-single digit 3% number that was mentioned last time. So wherever \u2013 and I think the bigger point I was trying to make last time is \u2013 by the way wherever revenue guidance ends up, we believe we'll deliver EPS growth at a multiple of that. I think that was the broader point I was trying to make that how better we're feeling about the earnings growth, but do feel incrementally better about the sales growth.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I think that resonated. Thank you, Steve. And then a couple points, maybe one for Steve and one for Bob. The first thing, Steve, M&A has not been a part of the story here since you arrived. But given Bob's comments about the leverage and where you will be by the end of 2017, I wonder, is 2017 a hunting period for M&A and sort of 2018 is when we should expect more action or given what you see on cash flow and what Bob said about the levels of debt by the end of 2017, is next year a year where M&A can become more active in terms of deal consummation? And could you give us any sense, if that is true, kind of size of those transactions?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, as you know it's really hard to predict on exact timing. I'd say we're looking at stuff right now, so it could be any time. Having said that, just given the pragmatic realities of where we stand in our current fiscal year 2017, I would expect we'll probably actually execute something in the 2017 timeframe. Our hunting activity is clearly ramped up in I'd say the last three months to six months in our activities. And I think 2017 will be likely that certainly would contribute as well to 2018 growth, some of that. But again, we will \u2013 as you know, we will pounce when the opportunities are right, and feel like we are in a position that we could today. We are going to continue, as we are talking about, bolt on, bite size kinds of things. We are not looking at billion dollar deals.","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","And I think, David, just to build on that, I mean, I think, what we feel, we are very comfortable is that we have plenty of capacity to be able to do things when we want to and we will look at many more than we will ever do, and we will be very disciplined in our approach to do deals. And so, I mean, just in this last quarter, free cash flow of $225 million gives us a lot of flexibility, and we continue to use all levers to continue to drive that higher.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we do, and David, I think you know from a couple of years back looking at it \u2013 and talk about our exec comp plan, we are very focused on ROIC, and given the history of this company and where we've been and that's still been part of a decision to say no to a few of the things we've been looking at. So, we'll continue to be very disciplined on that.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I think investors will certainly appreciate that, Steve. And then, lastly, Bob, just looking at the fourth quarter guidance, as I mentioned the revenue trends look stable with the third quarter. Is there any reason why margins in the fourth quarter wouldn't show the kind of year-on-year improvement you've been showing through the prior three quarters? Just our back of the envelope math suggest the fourth quarter margin won't be as robust year-on-year relative to the prior three quarters? And I'll jump back in queue. Thanks, guys.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Thanks. Just quickly, we talked about \u2013 we anticipate continued commercial investments that are going to drive incrementally or sequentially from Q3 to Q4, and probably more importantly the change in our retirement plan that I mentioned before will be effective in our fourth quarter, that's roughly a $0.01 impact to the quarter.","Operator","Moving along to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a bunch, guys. Bob, just a question on tax rate, to start. You mentioned in your prepared comments some of the internal restructuring initiatives you've got. Curious if that's an ongoing process that could carry through to next year. As I look back on your prior comments on tax rate in general, you characterized 2016 as a foundational year with leverage to show up next year. So, given that you said things are moving a little faster, just curious if a lot of the leverage that you had hoped for next year has already played out or if we're still kind of in process?","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So we feel very good about the progress that we've been making, Isaac, and have been working very hard. As you know, our tax rate is much higher than any of our med-tech peers. And so that is one of the big focus areas that my team has got.","What I would say is it's too early to tell you specifically what our number in 2017 is. We actually have been able to pull forward but what I will tell you is over time we continue to have opportunities there and expect that effective tax rate to go down.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just the last one, coming back to mammography, you covered a lot of ground there. But if I look at what is going on broadly in capital equipment in med-tech, there's been pretty good pockets of strength across various categories. And I think yourselves and your competitors have talked about maybe a little less growth in mammo than you would have otherwise guessed given where we are in the adoption curve for tomo. So, I'm just curious if you could put any more color on the feedback you're getting, at least in the US, with regards to customer appetite for mammography equipment. Is there anything out there that's kind of causing a temporary slowdown in the adoption process that might explain the trend here versus other categories of equipment?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, Isaac, we're not seeing any real slowdown or pushback from the customer. It's as much a capacity issue of the hospitals to take what they have and natural replacement cycles more than anything. And I'd say, if anything we've had more customers pull stuff a little bit forward because they wanted to compete and offer it, so we're not seeing that. There is just \u2013 I kind of remind people, there is a fundamental limitation to how many systems can be installed and used. The auto industry is an example, right? If every company launched a new product next year, auto sales don't suddenly jump up from 16 million to 20 million. There is just a natural rate of replacement that is still happening here and I think that's what lead us back to the stronger for longer that the market is not going to grow by 25% this year but it's going to be there and it's there for us as we keep converting.","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Hey, Isaac, this is Bob. Just one of the things that we look at that that we continue to feel good about and pleased with is the actual bookings as well, those continue to meet and exceed our expectations.","Operator","We'll move now to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys, congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe I'll start with a big-picture question, Steve. I know you said that you wouldn't comment on the 2017 outlook, but just maybe if I think out loud on some of the moving parts for next year, right, so it looks like Diagnostics international has to come in better. We're feeling better about Breast Health. And when we really think about next year, you have blood coming, declining maybe for the first half of next year but offsetting that you have GYN. Is that sort of the mix of when you talk about balance, is that how we're supposed to think about growth for next year?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Vijay, I'd love to give you a better answer but I really want to get the budget nailed but I think we're feeling good about the trajectory of where we are headed. And sorry I can't be specific at this point but...","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","No, no fair enough and...","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It didn't serve me well last time to \u2013 pre-talk about the next year. Fundamentally, we're feeling good about where this company is headed.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","That's fantastic and maybe one question on breast imaging or interventional breast, I guess. I know you guys launched a table launch and it maybe looked \u2013 a tad little softer on the interventional side. We don't talk a whole lot about it. I'm just trying to understand is this a function of \u2013 does this allow you to bundle your table along with mammo systems. Is there an opportunity in that area?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. What's really in the interventional today is mostly the disposable activity and that has been under a little bit of pressure. I think as we do launch the table, whether it's bundling per se or just the fact that we've got probably the best product and we've got a great sales team I think we have good hopes for the Affirm table and that'll really be \u2013 we're in the very early stages right now of getting the quotes and getting the orders, basically the sales process. We think that will be a nice contributor to start to kick in here in 2017 for us and it will help just the overall Breast Health business.","Michael J. Watts - Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications","Operator, I think we have time for one or two more quick questions.","Operator","Okay. Next question is from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks. So maybe just staying on Breast Imaging for a minute. There is still lack of insurance coverage for I think most women in United States for 3D imaging. Is there any progress on expanded coverage at this point or anything we can look forward to over the next few quarters?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think Raj, we are deeply engaged in a lot of discussions. And I think, I've said historically that was not \u2013 the private pay competency was not something we had as much in our company but our team has really made a lot of progress just in the last \u2013 I'd say, last six months or so. It's hard to predict timing and I candidly for any modeling or whatever, I wouldn't assume we necessarily have anything this calendar year.","Having said that, we are getting a couple of state mandates. And if you saw recently both the State of Illinois and the State of Connecticut have now mandated coverage, and we're probably overall in the 40% to 45-ish percent coverage, maybe up to 50% in terms of covered lives but the private pay piece will be probably the next step up for us. And having said that, just like prior to getting the incremental reimbursement from CMS, we're not sitting there waiting for this to come to sell our systems.","Operator","We'll take the final question from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks. Just a quick one. I wasn't sure if you provided it, but the OUS Breast Health growth rate, did you guys give that number and can you remind us what it was last quarter and what the trend was?","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Oh yeah, go ahead Bob.","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Down in constant currency 2.9% and if you adjust it for the divested and discontinued, it's roughly flat.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","And what was it last...?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And sequentially it was about flattish...","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Right.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As well","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Right.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","And the year-over-year rate (01:00:27) last quarter?","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Sorry, you faded out.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We just got a garble.","Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC","I was just looking for the trend, what was that year-over-year growth rate trend from last quarter to the current quarter?","Robert W. McMahon - Chief Financial Officer","Improved. (01:00:44) Yes.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. This quarter versus same quarter last of last year net of divestitures was about flat yeah.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today.

All lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call.","Mike Watts","Thank you, Dory. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Hologic\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call.","With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Karleen both have some prepared remarks, then we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. ","Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them today. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived through May 24.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.","Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic\u2019s CEO.","Steve MacMillan","Thank you Mike, and good afternoon, everyone.","We\u2019re pleased to discuss Hologic\u2019s financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we posted strong results overall, as total revenue of $818.4 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, both finished ahead of our guidance ranges. Like in recent periods, growth was driven by our largest businesses, Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, and our international franchises continue to perform well. This quarter we also benefited from improved performance in our Surgical division.","These strong revenue results continue the positive momentum that started to build in the second half of 2018, after we reorganized our leadership team earlier in the year. This momentum is based on some familiar strategies that we have discussed in the past. We continue to focus on accelerating growth by leveraging our core strengths and market-leading products, especially our large installed bases of Genius 3D mammography systems and Panther instruments, which in turn create tremendous recurring revenue streams. We are also increasing our penetration into international markets and broadening our product portfolios through both internal R&D and external business development. And we saw all these strategies pay off this quarter.","With that brief introduction, let\u2019s discuss our second quarter results in more detail now. Revenue of $818.4 million grew 3.7% on a reported basis, or 5.2% in constant currency, ahead of our expectations. Within this, the acquired Faxitron and Focal businesses also exceeded plan, contributing $14.6 million to revenue, so we are off to a great start with these acquisitions.","In terms of geography, domestic sales accelerated in the second quarter, posting growth of 4.6%, our best growth rate in six quarters. This was led by Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, with improvement in Surgical as well. From a commercial perspective, we are executing better in our largest market, with a drive to continuously improve.","Our legacy international franchises also performed well, recording our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth excluding blood screening and Cynosure. This strong, sustained performance clearly reflects the results of the significant leadership changes we put in place a few years ago. Molecular and Surgical had the highest growth rates on a percentage basis, and our Breast Health business also performed well. Including international sales of Cynosure products, which declined significantly in the period, total international sales were $202.9 million, still a solid increase of 6.9%.","Now, let me provide some more detail on our divisional revenue results. Let\u2019s start with our biggest business, Breast Health, where sales exceeded expectations and underlying trends remain strong. Global Breast Health sales totaled $321.5 million in the second quarter, a robust increase of 8.4%. If we look at the division on a pro forma basis, as if we owned Faxitron and Focal in the prior year period, Breast Health growth would have been about 4.9%.","Breast Health growth was balanced geographically, with U.S. revenues increasing 8.8% and OUS sales rising 6.9%, as our commercial capabilities continue to strengthen around the world. Growth was also balanced between our breast imaging and interventional products, as our sales team focused on selling our growing portfolio. Our breast imaging segment grew 7.5%, while interventional sales increased a very strong 12.9%.","As we have discussed, our Breast Health division today is much steadier and more diversified than it ever has been, with innovative, market-leading products across the continuum of patient care and across the globe. Our second quarter results illustrated this in several ways.","First, our competitive position in our core mammography market remains very strong, based on clinically differentiated products and excellent customer relationships. We continue to install a consistent number of new 3D systems in the U.S., while maintaining premium pricing and high market shares. And proposed changes to the MQSA, which emphasize the importance of breast density, should drive further 3D conversion and prove to be an incremental positive for us if implemented. As a reminder, our Genius 3D mammograms are the only ones proven to be superior to traditional 2D mammography for women with dense breasts. As we\u2019ve been saying for some time, and as virtually all radiologists understand, all 3Ds are not created equal; we have indications in our label and published trials that demonstrate our differentiated performance.","Second, new products are contributing more and more to Breast Health growth. Our new 3Dimensions and 3D Performance gantries, which help us segment our customer base better, again grew strongly and represented the majority of systems sold in the quarter. And other new products, including Intelligent 2D, Clarity HD, SmartCurve and the Affirm prone biopsy system, continue to be well-received by customers, with significant runway still ahead. Finally, sales of our Brevera biopsy system contributed slightly to growth in the quarter, although we expect to continue facing supply constraints over the medium term.","And third, Focal and Faxitron, which we have combined into our new breast surgery franchise, are performing well. Combined sales in the quarter were $14.6 million, a robust pro forma increase of 40.4% that reflects our successful integration efforts and the power of Hologic\u2019s broader reach and resources. And we continue to be on the lookout for similar tuck-in acquisitions.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Diagnostics, where revenue of $296.7 million increased a very strong 7.8%. Despite the external concerns around pricing in this market, this represents a material acceleration from recent quarters, although admittedly versus an easy prior-year comparable.","Molecular remains the growth driver in this division. Based on the productivity of our R&D team and the sophistication of our commercial organization, we are emerging as a broad-based molecular diagnostics leader with strong customer partnerships. In the second quarter, worldwide molecular sales of $167.8 million grew 12.8%, an acceleration compared to recent periods and the highest growth rate in six quarters.","Internationally, molecular grew 22.8%, well into the double-digits for the 11th time in 12 quarters. Although international is a small piece of our total molecular franchise, we are seeing very strong performance there. And in the U.S., although we already enjoy high market shares in key assay categories, molecular grew at a low-double-digit rate. This was better than in recent periods and reflects how we work collaboratively with our customers, especially our largest ones, to drive volumes and better patient care in established testing categories.","Molecular growth was broad-based in the quarter as we leveraged the razor-razor blade business model built around the fully automated Panther and Panther Fusion systems. We continue to place more Panthers and drive increased utilization by helping customers consolidate testing on our systems. In the second quarter specifically, revenue growth was driven by strong global sales of our legacy women\u2019s health assays for chlamydia\/gonorrhea, HPV and trichomonas, as well as new quantitative viral load tests.","And thanks to our outstanding R&D and regulatory teams, which have now earned U.S. clearances in 10 consecutive quarters, we have many more assays and indications in development for markets around the world. So, we expect our Panther menu, which is already the broadest in the mid- to high-volume molecular space, to get even stronger.","Moving on, cytology and perinatal sales were $115.5 million in the second quarter, a slight increase of 0.3%. Like last quarter, cytology sales increased fractionally, while perinatal sales declined. In the United States, growth in the cytology market remains challenged due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals. However, ThinPrep remains a core strength for us given the key role it plays in women\u2019s health, and the ability to run several of our molecular assays out of its collection vial. With this in mind, we are pleased to have recently earned FDA clearance for our ThinPrep Genesis Imager, which improves workflow for customers and facilitates co-testing with ThinPrep and our APTIMA HPV assay. And we expect more innovation in cytology over the next couple of years.","Elsewhere in diagnostics, revenue related to our divested blood screening business was higher than expected at $13.4 million, an increase of 19% compared to last year. As a reminder, this revenue mainly reflects low-margin products and services under transition agreements we have with Grifols. We expect this revenue stream to decline from second quarter levels in the balance of this year and into 2020.","Now, let\u2019s shift gears and cover GYN Surgical, where sales of $102.2 million grew 4.1%, our highest growth rate in seven quarters. While one quarter does not make a trend here, we are pleased to see our U.S. sales force strengthening, which is driving improvement in underlying business trends as well as our competitive position. In addition, it\u2019s important to note that new products such as our Fluent fluid management system and our Omni hysteroscope have begun contributing to growth. As a result, MyoSure-related sales grew at a low-double-digit rate in the second quarter. NovaSure sales declined again, but less than in recent periods.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Medical Aesthetics, where sales of $73.8 million represented about 9% of consolidated revenue and declined 12.1%. Domestic revenue finished in line with our expectations, but sales outside the United States were weak, driven mainly by challenges in Asia. By product category, sales of women\u2019s health and other products declined low-double-digits in the quarter, while sales of our skin-related products declined in the high-single-digit range. And as we have previously discussed, increased competition in the non-invasive fat reduction category negatively affected sales of lasers as well as high-margin, consumable PAC keys. As a result, revenue in our body sub-category declined by a little more than 30%, and the long-term implications of this weakness contributed to our writing down the value of certain intangibles in the quarter. Karleen will talk about this more.","Despite these challenges, there were some encouraging signs in Medical Aesthetics in the quarter. For example, in the United States, our sales force continues to come up to speed, with several regions showing good performance and growth. In fact, U.S. revenue increased slightly sequentially, bucking the trend in what is usually a seasonally weaker quarter. In addition, we are encouraged that initial customer feedback to our new partnership with Brooke Shields has been positive, and optimistic that our new marketing campaign will improve the performance of SculpSure in the future.","To round out the revenue discussion briefly, Skeletal sales of $24.2 million grew 0.8%. Although our revenue base is small here, we remain enthusiastic about the potential of our DXA systems to assess body composition in athletes.","So, to wrap up, the major storylines at Hologic haven\u2019t changed much over the last three months. In simple terms, our key strategy of leveraging our core technologies and leadership positions, especially in Breast Health and Diagnostics, to expand our offerings both geographically and in adjacent product categories is paying off. For the last four quarters, this strategy has led to very good financial results, which gives us the confidence to increase our guidance for 2019.","Karleen will discuss that guidance in a moment. So, now, let me turn the call over to her.","Karleen Oberton","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.","In my remarks today, I\u2019m going to walk through the rest of the income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, and then finish up with our updated financial guidance for 2019, as well as the third quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis in constant currency.","As Steve described, we are pleased with our second quarter results, as revenue of $818.4 million and EPS of $0.58 exceeded our guidance. We benefited from strong performances by our largest businesses, Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics, as well as improved results in our Surgical division. And our international franchises continued to grow solidly. Our overall performance has been very solid through the first half of our fiscal year, and we are again raising our financial guidance as a result.","Although 90% of our business is doing well, our Medical Aesthetics business continues to lag, as everyone knows. As Steve said, we did see some positive signs in the quarter, but as we kicked off our annual strategic planning process, it became clear that from an accounting perspective, we needed to lower the carrying value of our intangible assets and equipment associated with key products like SculpSure, MonaLisa Touch and TempSure Vitalia. As a result, we booked a significant GAAP write-down of $443.8 million this quarter, which hit COGS primarily but also other operating expenses. This action, which is non-cash, is in addition to the write-down we recorded a year ago, which related to goodwill and in-process R&D. So, while this write-down is disappointing, I want to emphasize that it primarily reflects negative trends that we have previously discussed, and which we expect to improve based on the strategies we have in place.","Now, I\u2019d like to switch gears and review our P&L for the second quarter. Gross margins of 61% decreased 170 basis points compared to the prior year period. Let me provide some color to help illustrate why we expect gross margins to improve in the back half of the year. Several one-time items contributed to the decline in gross margin percentage this quarter, including inventory reserves, scrap charges and other adjustments, especially in Medical Aesthetics as we integrate our international locations. Together with foreign exchange and Chinese tariffs, these non-recurring items reduced gross margin percentage by approximately 110 basis points this quarter. The rest of the gross margin decline resulted from factors we have discussed in the past such as product mix, especially Cynosure\u2019s performance, and higher blood screening revenue. So, as we look toward the back half of the year, we expect better margins due to the absence of these one-time charges, improved product mix, absorption benefits, the ramp-up of new product sales, and our ongoing cost reduction efforts.","Moving on, total operating expenses of $272.8 million increased 2.2% in the second quarter. This increase was mainly driven by the impact of the Faxitron and Focal acquisitions, which contributed roughly $6.6 million of expense. Excluding Faxitron and Focal, operating expenses actually declined 0.3%, reflecting a balance between tight cost controls and funding of our investments for future growth.","Operating margin of 27.7% declined 120 basis points in the second quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to the negative gross margin effects that I discussed. I do want to point out, however, that when you analyze the full geography of our income statement, the currency and compensation hedges we have in place below the line offset much of this operating margin decline. So, for example, if you look at adjusted EBITDA of $254.1 million, you\u2019ll see that it increased 2.4% compared to the prior year period. And EBITDA margin declined only slightly, to 31.0% this year versus 31.4% last year. Overall, our profitability remains healthy, and our updated guidance implies that operating margin will increase in the back half of the year, mainly due to the expected gross margin improvements I mentioned.","Finally, net margins of 19.0% increased 30 basis points compared with the prior year period, primarily due to benefits associated with an improvement in our effective tax rate. Our tax rate is lower than our previous guidance primarily because the U.S. Treasury has clarified certain provisions of federal tax reform through proposed regulations. All this led to non-GAAP net income of $155.9 million in the second quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, exceeding our guidance range.","Before we cover our revised 2019 guidance, I\u2019ll quickly touch on a few other financial metrics. At the end of the second quarter, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, stood at 2.6 times. We remain comfortable around this level, recognizing that the ratio could fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and buyback activity.","Finally, we generated $104.2 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We continue to generate strong cash flows, which enable us to pursue tuck-in acquisitions such as Faxitron and Focal while also acting on our share repurchase authorization as we see opportunities in the market.","Now, I\u2019d like to shift gears and discuss our non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and third quarter.","At a high level, we are updating our full-year guidance based on our good second quarter results and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by increased investments we plan to make over the next two quarters. More specifically, we are increasing our constant currency revenue guidance and raising our EPS forecast.","Let\u2019s start with revenue. As a reminder, we previously guided to sales of $3.305 billion to $3.335 billion, which represented constant currency growth of between 3.8% and 4.7%. Based on our second quarter results, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $3.325 billion to $3.345 billion, which includes approximately $45 million of revenue from our divested blood screening business.","Based on recent exchange rates, our new revenue guidance translates to constant currency growth of 4.3% to 4.9%, better than our prior 2019 forecast. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened materially compared to our prior fiscal year. And based on recent exchange rates, we estimate that currency fluctuations are driving roughly $30 million of headwind in fiscal 2019. Despite this foreign exchange headwind, we feel confident about our growth in our core businesses, our ability to control expenses, and the lower effective tax rate. As a result, we are increasing our EPS guidance to a range of $2.41 to $2.44, which represents reported growth of between 8.1% and 9.4%, roughly double a rate of revenue growth. I should point out that EPS growth would be higher if not for diminishing contributions from our divested blood screening business and a small residual impact from currency.","The updated full-year guidance is based on diluted shares outstanding of approximately 272 million for the full year, and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%, a 1% improvement compared to our prior guidance.","Now, let\u2019s turn to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue of between $825 million and $840 million, which represents growth of 1.2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, our guidance reflects revenue growth of 0.1% to 1.9%. Since we only have two quarters left in our fiscal year, our revised annual guidance implies that as usual, revenues will be bigger in the fourth quarter than the third, based on seasonality and new products making increasing contributions. On the bottom line, we expect EPS of $0.60 to $0.62 in the third quarter, which implies growth rates of between 3.4% and 6.9%, continuing to outpace revenue growth.","As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges, as we\u2019ve tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides. This is particularly important after the dollar strengthened further last week.","Before we open up the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with our performance through the first half of 2019, with our Breast Health, Molecular Diagnostic and international businesses driving solid growth. We are also encouraged by improved performance in our Surgical division. These businesses are well-positioned to drive further growth, given the strategies we have in place. Lastly, we continue to generate industry-leading cash flows and put that cash to good use, with a focus on tuck-in acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases. Based on all this, we are raising our annual financial guidance.","With that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. I'll start with Breast Health, Steve, obviously putting up good numbers there. Can you maybe talk about the replacement cycle? How much is the legacy installed 3D base you're starting to upgrade with 3Dimensions in 3D Performance. And then, Faxitron and Focal are obviously adding a lot, how much cross-selling and bundling are you doing there too?","Steve MacMillan","In terms of the existing base versus the new, the vast majority of our revenue is still coming from selling new 3Ds to both competitive customers, as well as upgrading our existing 3Ds. I think, as we mentioned, we still got, 3,000 to 6,000 installed 2Ds left in the U.S. So, we\u2019ve still got years worth of replacements. and that's still the primary driver of our Breast Health business, which makes us feel so good about the sustainability, while we're starting to get certainly some of the grades, but they clearly are much smaller percentages of total on the upgrades.","As it relates to Faxitron and Focal, it's been very nice and that we've been able to merge the sales forces, put them together and off to a very nice start as we really start to sell the breast conserving surgery line, as well as a couple of our own legacy products that are in there. And, I would say, we're still deep down in the earlier stages. This was really the first quarter that the combined selling organizations were on the street together. And we feel really good about the initial starts there.","Tycho Peterson","And then, one follow-up on guidance. So, you do have a new competitor for NovaSure [indiscernible]. Just curious how you think about competitive positioning, and if you've seen any kind of impact at this point.","Steve MacMillan","We are always mindful of new competitors coming into the space. Having said that, at this point, NovaSure has been safely and effectively used in 3 million patients at this point, and has a very strong, proven history and loyal base. We're out there telling that story every day. We've not yet seen any real impact from commercialization of anything. We certainly would expect some over time. But frankly, we feel really good about particularly the total efficacy of our product relative to any comers.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. So, I want to ask a couple on the molecular business. First, Steve, can you confirm that any price adjustments with large customers were in the numbers for the full quarter? And any color you can give on maybe how pricing and volume dynamics contributed to that double-digit growth rate you reported in molecular?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, Dan. As we had said, we did finalize those contracts last year, virtually all of any of the pricing changes were in the quarter. So, this is, I want to say, quite a new run rate, but from a pricing standpoint, basically reflected in there. And I think what we feel really good, I know there was so much concern last summer with PAMA and with the renegotiations and everything else. We feel great about the relationships we've got with our largest customers. We are driving volume is really the big driver. And we ended up with pricing that really makes sense for both our customers, but particularly for us and feeling particularly on the molecular side very good about the runway ahead.","Dan Leonard","And then, it's interesting that you\u2019re flagging your legacy women's health assays as the big contributor here. Can you update us on how fast do you think that category is growing in the market? And how much faster are you growing compared to the category to your share gain?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. I don't think we have great data on the full category. But, we think it continues to grow part of our whole messaging. And it's what's helped us so much, frankly, with our largest customers is our physician sales force that continues to help educate the physicians and particularly our Yes Means Test campaign of trying to make sure that younger sexually active women are getting tested, we do think continues to drive the overall category. So, this is one of these categories we looked at a few years ago and thought maybe not much growth left, but realizing that actually the true incidence of testing is, while we don't have a great feel, is clearly less than what should be done. And so, we've been really helping to drive that category. And I think as the predominant share player, probably actually still growing faster than the category itself. And, Mike?","Mike Watts","Yes, Dan, it\u2019s Mike. I might just add one thing. And obviously, those tests are all not alike, right? So, a like trichomonas is still fairly underpenetrated. Obviously, the growth rates there would be much higher than for the base chlamydia\/gonorrhea business. And we would expect the same thing to happen with the new test like MGen over time as well.","Operator","And we'll be taking our next question from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Lin","Hey, this is Chris on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on the previous question. I know you don't to be too granular with molecular diagnostics performance, but could you just help us assess sustainability or the double-digit growth rate for the segment? I mean, you have introduced a number of assays and you're still pretty early with the viral load opportunity. So, is it right to think that molecular diagnostics could at least grow double digits for the balance of the year?","Steve MacMillan","We would not guide to double-digit for the rest of the year. We did mention we had an easier comp. I think we had a very good first quarter, we had an easier comp this quarter. I think, we feel very good about strong sustainable rates but would not model for sustained double-digit. I think outside the U.S., yes; inside the U.S., I\u2019d probably be modeling more mid to maybe slightly higher single-digit growth. But, I think we\u2019d like the overall trajectory.","Chris Lin","Okay. And then, for the follow-up question, could you just help us dissect the gross and operating margin performance, a bit more detail? I appreciate the commentary on some of the onetime charges but even if we back out those costs, margins would have been a bit below Street expectation, despite the strong revenue contribution from the high-margin businesses of Molecular Diagnostics and Cytology. So, I\u2019m just curios what are those some of the other headwinds for margins.","Karleen Oberton","Hi. This is Karleen. So, let me take a stab at that. I think beyond the onetime items, we clearly had higher blood screening revenue than we anticipated. And to remind everyone, there\u2019s virtually no gross margin on that revenue. Coupled with some of the products mix that we had in the quarter, specifically in the Cynosure business, contributed to the margin headwind.","Operator","We will be taking our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Maybe a couple on guidance here. Just, Karleen, on the gross margins here, the one timers as you called, what is the visibility that you have in gross margin stepping up? When you talk gross margins improving in the back half, is this all gross margin driven, and I guess the implications that the revenue mix in the back half it should be similar to what we saw in 2Q?","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So, I think what gives us confidence in the back half is that we don\u2019t pursue those onetime items again and again. Majority of those related to the Cynosure business and some of the integration activities that are now substantially complete for the international locations. I think when we look at the back half of the year, our normal cadence is that revenues increase as well as volumes increase which are going to drive favorable absorption just as well as overall larger gross margin dollars. From a planning perspective, the teams have cost reduction efforts that kind of kick off at the beginning of the fiscal year and start to really contribute as we get to the back of to the year.","Vijay Kumar","And then, one follow-up on the guidance here. You beat EPS by same. [Ph] You look at the tax rate lower, it almost looks like most of the guidance range came from the lowering of tax rate. I\u2019m just curious, is there anything happening below the line in the back half on the FX hedges and how should we be thinking of some of those items?","Karleen Oberton","Yes. I don\u2019t think there is anything unusual in the bank half below the line that we\u2019ve anticipated in the guidance. I think, as we think about the guidance, yes, there is definitely beat in the quarter, there is some benefit from lower tax rate. But we'd really like to -- what we also want to do is allow the R&D teams to invest some more in the back half to accelerate some projects.","Vijay Kumar","FX hedges should be gained in the back half?","Karleen Oberton","In theory, yes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will be taking our next question from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead, sir.","Jack Meehan","I was hoping on the GYN Surgical business. Could you break out the contributions from NovaSure and MyoSure? And Steve, I was curious, just given the growth rates for MyoSure, how much runway you think there is left to drive adoption to get up to the NovaSure level?","Karleen Oberton","So, let me start off with the contribution. So, on a worldwide basis, total Surgical division was about $102 million with a little over 40% of that comes from NovaSure and the balance from MyoSure.","Steve MacMillan","So, to pick up on it, MyoSure has become the bigger part, and it's defied our expectations for a long time, and seems to continue to grow. We still see opportunities, frankly, to grow the overall category, and continue to feel good as that being a major driver for Surgical, particularly as the U.S. sales force has gotten back up to speed and in a strong place today.","Mike Watts","Yes. I think, Jack, in the prepared remarks we mentioned that MyoSure in aggregate grew very low-double-digits in the quarter and NovaSure was consistent with recent quarters, it didn't go down as much kind of in that low to mid-single-digit decline range. And Dory, for you. It\u2019s fine to allow folks to ask one follow-up question to. So, Jack, if you have a follow-up, go ahead. ","Steve MacMillan","Got to be related, though, Jack. Got to be related.","Jack Meehan","Well, maybe on the NovaSure point then. I\u2019d just be curious, as you look at the back half and then the 2020, do you think that this can get back to growth or are you thinking that kind of stabilization is the right way to be thinking about this business for you?","Steve MacMillan","I think stabilization is probably about the best we can do just given how penetrated we are in a category that's probably not really going -- growing and may have some competitors emerge. So, I think, we continue to keep that flat as probably a pretty good performance.","Operator","And we will be taking our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Quirk","So first question is going back to the molecular franchise. And I was hoping, Steve, maybe get a little color on -- helping us think about the incremental growth. How much of this is kind of new accounts versus existing accounts adding some of the new menu that you\u2019ve had approved? And then, as a related question, a couple of your large customers were just added to the UnitedHealth Preferred Lab Network, and would be curious about how you're thinking about that incrementally driving some performance here over the next couple years?","Steve MacMillan","Sure. I think, we don't have the exact breakout as to new customers versus existing because sometimes as they consolidate and things like that. I'd say that the simple way to think about it is, we are getting more business with our existing customers. We're clearly seeing frankly some nice increases with our two largest customers. We continue also to place Panthers across the network. And so we see ongoing growth there. But, I think it's particularly we feel really good about our position with the two biggest customers. And especially to your point, as they pick up a little more business in the quarters and years ahead with United Health and some of their various contracts, we like our position with them and think that's going to continue to help drive some good strength.","Anything else, Bill?","Bill Quirk","Oh, sure, absolutely. So, a related follow-up question to the total business that is. Just help us think little bit about, I guess, one, sustainability of OUS Breast Health? And then, secondly, could you just revisit the topic of kind of how 3D adoption is going, specifically in Europe? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","That was a clever related that you worked -- one follow-up related into two different ones. Good Job, Bill. So, I'm sorry, the sustainability of Breast Health...","Karleen Oberton","Yes. I think, first was the international sustainability. And I think, we feel really good about that. I think there's a lot of runway. It\u2019s early days on the overall conversion to 3D there internationally, coupled with still opportunities to go direct in key markets.","Operator","And we will be taking our next question from Dan Brennan with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Brennan","Great, thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Steve, I wanted to ask you a question. Given the growing signs of success of your strategy in imaging via more expanded product sets to meet the needs of the different sized customers, what's the realistic runway you think as we look out for that U.S. breast imaging business, now that you\u2019ve potentially mitigated some of the more cyclicality inherent in that business?","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think, Dan, overall, we always want to be too careful to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of longer term outlooks. I think, if you look at the pure mammography business in the U.S., it's probably not grown all that much. The number of gantries is going to be relatively flat probably five years from now as it is today. So, as we had seen that all along, we thought, okay, it's all about broadening the portfolio, figuring out other ways to bring value to it. So, I\u2019d probably still think about it as a low to mid single digit kind of business. And I think our ability to take share and find new avenues above that are what can take us to outperform what is probably much more of a lower single digit market. And obviously we\u2019re very focused on outperforming it.","Dan Brennan","Great. Thank you for that, Steve. And then, maybe this is correlated. So, basically, you made the mention in the prepared remarks regarding the dense breast proposals out of the FDA. I'm just wondering, to the extent those get implemented, could you help us think about giving your superior label there? And this is the question we've gotten numerous times to investors like, how should we think about the opportunity for you to kind of market that and how that would translate into and impact on the business? Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. This could sound flippant, but I\u2019d basically consider anybody that would use anybody other than our system would be malpractice. But having said that, I think what it does is, you guys know the market shares, which we don't talk about a lot, but we're by far the dominant player in the space, particularly in the U.S. And I think our ability to continue to keep growing our market share off a very high levels, should continue to be there, given the dense breast indication that we have.","Operator","And our next question will be coming from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.","David Lewis","Steve, maybe start with you for a second on investments and work maybe one follow-up. Just quickly on investments, Steve, just as you think about capital deployment, at this point with the Aesthetics business. Is there any consideration now with the write-down that you look to divest that business or sell that business? And related to that is, right now as you think about the balance sheet, what is your interest in deploying capital for M&A and sort of where do you think the key strategic areas are for the business?","Steve MacMillan","Sure, David. We continue to manage the Company for the long haul. And obviously not every decision we\u2019ve made has been perfect. But we continue to strengthen the business. And frankly, we are excited about some of what we have going on, even in Medical Aesthetics right now. So, we have some great sales people, Brooke Shields joining on as a partner, we feel really good about that. Having said that the broader piece of capital deployment, I think as you\u2019re really seeing, really focused more on a lot of our core businesses and particularly the biggest divisions. So, the two that we\u2019ve done in Breast Health, we feel great about. And I think we really are to a stage that we weren\u2019t a few years ago, which is truly just tuck-ins. And so, the broader capital deployment that can refine good tuck-ins that fit our existing businesses, no need to open additional legs, invest in the businesses that are delivering and executing, and from that also continuing to do with cash left over, both ongoing share repurchases, debt paydown and being very prudent at this point in time with our capital. Karleen, do you want to add anything to that.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. No, I would just say, clearly, we view M&A as a priority from a tuck-in perspective, but the teams are bring really critical at the targets we evaluate here. But there\u2019s an activity that\u2019s ongoing.","David Lewis","Just a quick follow-up, Steve. This is a very balanced quarter relative to last quarter, we saw very significant Breast growth, Breast growth still above market this quarter. Last quarter, you gave us a lot of color in terms of gantry outlook and the pipeline and the transition to that pipeline. So, can you just update on sort of where -- how you feel about the gantry backlog kind of mid part of the year? That\u2019d be very helpful. Thank you.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. We continue to feel very good about the backlog and the ongoing order rates that we track obviously on a very regular basis, but feel good about the ongoing orders growth in the gantry business.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Please go ahead sir.","Brian Weinstein","Steve, on the breastsoftware upgrades that I recognize it\u2019s early, but can you talk to us a little bit about what you're seeing there and what this potentially could become for you, longer term? I think, in the past you\u2019ve given us some revenue numbers in the quarter, and any thought on that would be welcome as well.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. We\u2019re still in the early stages of starting to upgrade our existing 3Ds, but between Clarity HD, Intelligent -- the Intelligent software and the SmartCurve paddles. So, they are relatively small but starting to be somewhat meaningful within that division, but still very early stages. And I think it provides just long-term runway. So, it\u2019s -- I would say the way we're thinking about it day-to-day, Brian, the organization is very focused on continuing to convert 2Ds to 3Ds, but also going back and circling and seeing the opportunities, clearly things like the SmartCurve paddle, and the Clarity HD, very nice add-ons to our existing business and a lot of runway ahead.","Brian Weinstein","On the follow-up there, when we think about OUS, can you just give us a little bit more color on specific countries and areas where you\u2019ve seen particular strength? And Karleen, your comment about opportunities to go direct in key markets, can you expand on that and the likelihood that we would see something there at some point this year?","Karleen Oberton","So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be specific, countries that we\u2019re looking to go direct, but just that there are opportunities that we're considering in certain of our key markets as not all distributors are actionable either. So, weighing all the characters of the targets. ","Steve MacMillan","Yes. I think, Brian, we do feel good about obviously over the last 5, 6, 7 years, even we\u2019d gone direct in the UK before. I arrived and we\u2019ve obviously done great acquisitions in Germany, in Portugal and Spain. So, we\u2019re now directing three of the biggest countries, certainly in Europe and continuing to look at how to strengthen our capabilities there, and also doing well in the countries where we\u2019ve now converted from dealer to direct. So, like the foundation of the building over there.","Karleen Oberton","I\u2019d just also add Brian just from an international perspective in the Breast Health, that we talked to just a lot about Europe, but obviously Asia Pacific, there\u2019s a lot of got good momentum and opportunity there moving forward.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.","Anthony Petrone","The first question I\u2019ll have is on Breast Health and then I\u2019ll shift to GYN Surgical [technical difficulty] in diagnostics the first question. My question there is on OUS molecular, the number jumps off the page, 22% growth, and I think it comes with the clearance from a competitor. I think Abbott announced CE mark clearance for Alinity in certain essays. So, just kind of trying to get a sense of the sustainability of OUS molecular just given the competitive landscape and a follow-up will be on surgical. Thanks.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. I think, we continue to feel really good about our OUS molecular business. The growth rate is 11 out of 12 quarters in a row, we had double-digit growth rates. And we\u2019re still relatively underdeveloped. So, even though there are competitors out there, we\u2019re still in our earlier stages of growth. So, it\u2019s still a relatively smaller business for us. And yes, there is competitors there but I think we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to grow at certainly healthy rates.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. And I would just add that in key countries we don\u2019t have the full menu approved that we have here in the U.S. So, we have focused strategies on trying to get the menus expanded in key countries that will drive higher utilization. So, a lot of good stuff there as well.","Anthony Petrone","And a quick follow-up in surgical would just be the litigation front there and endometrial ablation and gave us an update a few weeks ago. Does that have an impact going forward, or is it more just similar competitive dynamics we should see over the next 12 months, two years? Thanks.","Mike Watts","Yes. Anthony, it\u2019s Mike. I think, the competitive dynamics there are very stable. We believe we are maintaining share and in some cases, winning customers back, which I think is a testament to the work that's going on in the field. And, obviously, don't want to get too much into an open legal process, but the normal, kind of appeals and all that stuff continues to go on. And, we'll just give you an update when we have one.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","JaimeMorgan","Hi. This is Jaime on for Rich. So, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on Medical Aesthetics. I guess, the first being, you guys are saying U.S. was in line, OUS was a little bit weaker driven by Asia. So, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the dynamics that you're seeing in that market that's impacting growth, and then I'll have a follow-up.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So, I think, given the international markets, I think, as I had mentioned, we are kind of ongoing and integrating into our leadership, our regional leadership structure. And so, as we make some of those changes, we've had some disruption on the cadence of sales there. I think as we integrate, we kind of looked at some policies and procedures and had some accounting adjustments that we made as well, but feel good over the longer term that as our leaders take control this business we\u2019ll have nice cadence of growth.","Jaime Morgan","Okay. And then, I guess, my follow-up would just be, are you seeing anything more within the competitive -- from a competitive perspective across some of the different units, specifically body? And kind of what is the expectation for the remainder of the year, given some of these new strategies that you talked about with Brooke Shields? And any other potential color that you can give around, strategies you are rolling out would be helpful. Thank you.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So, what I would say is that clearly, we've talked about we have seen competitive factors in the Medical Aesthetics business, specifically in the body sub-segment. Now, we are excited about the Brooke Shields campaign and what that will be able to do, but don't know how meaningful it will be, at this point. I think what I would focus on is what our key strategy is, in-license additional products, to put more in the bag of our sales team to create that cadence of new products, excitement for that sales team, what we think will contribute to turnaround in the U.S. business.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I'll probably just go for a clarification and then a small question on Breast. So, Karleen, the onetime color was very helpful with gross margin. I just want to make sure, when you say higher and fiscal 2H, just to be clear, is that off the 61% non-GAAP or is that off this adjusted, call it 62? And then maybe, what are your thoughts longer term for gross margin? And then I\u2019ll ask a quick follow-up?","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So, I would say, it's off the adjusted 62, is what we expect in the back half. And I think, as we said, we're not giving longer term guidance. But, I think looking at gross margin in that low-60s is the right way to think about them.","Jon Block","Okay. So, just as we think about an exit rate or a run rate, pay more attention to the fiscal 2H 2019 there.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. I think there is some noise in the first half.","Steve MacMillan","Yes.","Jon Block","Okay. And then, Steve, I\u2019ll pivot. I think, Medical Aesthetics has sort of been asked and answered for the most part. But just over to Brevera, can you just talk about the timing for supply to get back on track there? And then what are the actual plans itself? In other words, is that something you're going take in house from a manufacturing standpoint, or will you continue to outsource that? Thanks, guys.","Steve MacMillan","Sure. Thanks, Jon. I think, we\u2019re probably -- before we\u2019re in really great shape on supply is probably well into next fiscal year because we do have a partner and we're obviously working with that partner right now to resolve the longer term piece. But, we're making some product enhancements to it to make it simpler to make and get beyond the short-term situations we\u2019ve been in.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Mark Massaro","Given the dynamics in Medical Aesthetics, should we be thinking about pro forma run rate in the negative double digits or do you think that\u2019s the initiative with Brookfield can potentially move you up into the right?","Karleen Oberton","So, I think as we think about when started the fiscal year we thought this would be a low single grower. I think that\u2019s based on the performance in the last two quarter, as we think about fiscal \u201819, it\u2019s probably low to mid single digit decliner. But, I think what we see is improvements in each quarter as we move through the year.","Mark Massaro","Okay. And then, related to that I guess could you give us a little bit of help about thinking about the cost of the clinical trials with Vitalia and MonaLisa Touch? I don\u2019t think the Brooke Shields marketing would be all that expensive. But I guess my question is, when you factor in the clinical trials costs, the marketing costs, why do you think that keeping the Medical Aesthetics business is worth more than divesting it? ","Steve MacMillan","Obviously, we\u2019re continuing to focus and thinking smartly about where we go for the future, and investing prudently in the business. So, we're being smart about how we gauge the spending at this point in time. It\u2019s clearly not making the kind of money that we would like, and in fact losing a little bit in the short-term. And we\u2019re in that process of putting together our longer term plans.","Mike Watts","And, I would say, -- Mark, it\u2019s Mike, I would just add to that. I mean, products like MonaLisa Touch I mean really are very valuable, clinically differentiated products that provide a lot of value to women. So, we definitely want to proceed those indications that will enable us to differentiate ourselves in the market.","Mark Massaro","Okay. Thank you.","Mike Watts","Dory, I think, we\u2019ve got time for one more question.","Operator","And we will be taking our final question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","This is Ivy [ph] on for Derik today. Thank you for squeezing me in. Congrats on quarter. So, just one clarification question on the Breast Health. It sounds like the momentum of Breast health should continue. So, given updated guide, are there any changes on the growth perspective for the sector, particularly given the given the tough comp in first half of the year? Just any additional color would be helpful. Thank you.","Karleen Oberton","Yes. So, I think as we started the fiscal year for Breast Health, we had talked about it being mid-single-digit grower. I would say that based on the performance of the last two quarters for the full year, maybe it's mid to high-single-digit growth. So, yes, you're right the comp\u2019s definitely get harder in the back half of the year and so the growth might come down a bit.","Unidentified Analyst","And one follow-up. So, this quarter, the acquisitions Focal and Faxitron was better than expected. Is that something we should base of estimates for the rest of the year? Looking for just any additional color. Thank you.","Karleen Oberton","So, they had meaningful growth in this quarter. I would say that we expect high-double-digit from them moving forward, but I don't know that it would be in the 40% range. It should be come down.","Steve MacMillan","Great. Thank you, everyone.","Mike Watts","I think, that's all the time we have. Thanks everybody very much.","Operator","This now concludes the Hologic\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call.

These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.","Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency, unless otherwise noted.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you Mike, and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We posted strong results overall, with both total revenue and earnings per share finishing above our guidance ranges. Breast Health outperformed, our core international franchises continued to grow at a robust pace, and our molecular diagnostics franchise accelerated from last quarter. In addition, both our Surgical and Medical Aesthetics divisions, which had struggled recently, showed solid sequential improvement, in line with our expectations. And just today, we closed a tuck-in acquisition that will further strengthen and expand our Breast Health franchise. We'll discuss that more in a moment, but first, let me provide an overview of our top-line results.","In the third quarter, revenue of $824 million grew 2.2% on a reported basis, or 1.1% in constant currency. Although we're not satisfied with this growth rate, we believe we are making encouraging progress in several areas of the company. Before we discuss that progress, let me point out that like many others, we had a tailwind from the weaker dollar compared to the prior year period. This benefit, however, was less than we forecast three months ago, since the dollar has strengthened since then. In addition, please note that we have now annualized the effects of the Cynosure acquisition and the blood screening divestiture, both of which occurred in the second quarter of last year.","Now let's get into the details. Breast Health, our biggest business, led the way in the third quarter, as U.S. revenue accelerated while international sales remained strong. Diagnostics improved from a soft second quarter, with upside from the divested blood screening business. Surgical was basically flat on a global basis, and as we predicted, is showing steady improvement over the last three quarters. Cynosure also finished in line with our expectations, declining compared to a tough comp in the prior year period, but increasing sequentially.","In terms of geography, our legacy international franchises again demonstrated robust growth in the third quarter. Excluding Cynosure, OUS revenue increased 14.5%. This performance was once again led by Breast Health, but our other businesses also contributed strong growth, reflecting the significant, broad-based improvements we have made in talent and capabilities in recent years.","Including OUS sales of Cynosure products, which declined in the period, total international sales were $207.2 million, an increase of 5.5%. On the subject of international, and in response to recent news, let me mention that while China represents only about 3.5% of our total sales, several of our products are included on the expanded list of potential Chinese tariffs. So while we do not think these potential tariffs would have a significant impact on the company, we are keeping a close eye on the situation.","In the United States, total revenue of $616.8 million was basically flat in the third quarter, down 30 basis points. Underpinning this, however, we saw positive momentum in our legacy franchises, as growth rates improved sequentially in Breast Health, Diagnostics and Surgical. Cynosure sales declined materially compared to the tough comp in the prior year period, as expected, but increased on a sequential basis, reflecting a strengthening commercial organization in the United States.","Now let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results in the third quarter. As mentioned, Breast Health outperformed again in the period. Global Breast Health sales totaled $307.9 million, a robust increase of 7.4%. International continued to lead the way, with sales growth of just over 20% for the fourth consecutive quarter, despite annualizing the first of our two European distributor acquisitions. In addition, the much larger U.S. breast business strengthened in the quarter and posted growth of 4.4%, a testament to our team, the strategies they have put in place, and solid commercial execution.","Within Breast Health, sales of imaging products increased 6.5% globally, our best growth rate since the second quarter of 2016. We continue to gain market share behind our clinically differentiated Genius 3D mammography systems, and have bolstered growth by revitalizing our R&D pipeline and introducing new products. These include our 3Dimensions and 3D Performance Systems, and our Affirm prone biopsy system, all of which are performing well.","At the same time, sales of interventional products continued their recent hot streak, increasing 12.4% globally. With this third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, interventional is emerging as another important growth platform. New products played a role here as well, especially our revolutionary new Brevera biopsy system, which improves biopsy workflow and the patient experience.","Our Breast Health business gets even stronger with the acquisition of Faxitron, which we announced today. Before I discuss the details, I'd like to take this opportunity to publicly welcome nearly 70 Faxitron employees to Hologic.","This transaction broadens our product portfolio and expands the role we play in the clinical continuum of care for breast cancer patients. Faxitron's market-leading products, which span from digital specimen radiography to breast lesion localization to sentinel lymph node biopsy solutions, are sold via a strong distribution channel that focuses on breast surgeons and pathologists. So Faxitron will complement our strengths in the mammography suite and enable us to play a larger role in breast conserving surgery, an adjacent growth market.","From a financial perspective, acquiring Faxitron is consistent with our capital deployment goals. It's a great tuck-in acquisition that leverages our expertise in the breast health channel, while providing attractive growth and return on invested capital. We are seeing increased business development activity across our divisions, and hope that acquisitions like Faxitron will become a more regular part of our story in coming quarters.","Faxitron also reinforces a theme that we discussed in our last call, that our Breast Health division is much more than mammography machines today. We have built a diversified, increasingly global business around the core of our Genius 3D platform. And increasingly, growth is coming from new products, software, and service, even as capital placements in the mature U.S. market level out. In fact, domestic 3D gantries represented only about 20% of global Breast Health sales this quarter, as our sales force gets better and better at understanding customers' needs and selling our full portfolio.","The energy and excitement in our Breast Health division has never been stronger than it is today, based on a clinically differentiated core of mammography systems, multiple new products built around this core, and now a complementary tuck-in acquisition.","Before we move on, let me mention that we are also pleased with the favorable initial ruling issued by the International Trade Commission in our patent infringement complaint against Fuji. The judge recommended an exclusion order that prevents the importation of infringing Fuji products into the United States, and a cease and desist order that prevents the further sale of those products here. We look forward to a final ruling by the ITC in November.","Moving on to Diagnostics, revenue of $294.3 million grew 2.3%. The growth driver here continues to be molecular, where global sales of $154.5 million grew 6.3% and also accelerated sequentially. Internationally, molecular grew in the mid-teens, marking the eighth time in the last nine quarters we have achieved double-digit growth, and reflecting a steady cadence of new product introductions into global markets.","In the U.S., where we already enjoy high market shares in our key assay categories, molecular still grew at a healthy mid-single-digit rate, improving from a tough second quarter that we believe was negatively affected by a bad flu season.","Our Aptima women's health assays on the Panther system remain the primary growth drivers in dollar terms, but we're also seeing nice adoption of our virology menu at a variety of labs. Although the base remains small, sales of our quantitative HIV, HCV and HPV tests more than doubled again versus the prior year period. And we are optimistic that the Global Access Initiative we announced last week will lead to further growth of viral testing in resource-limited countries.","Elsewhere in Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal sales of $121.1 million declined 1.8%. Cytology growth remains challenged in the United States due to our high market shares and longer cervical cancer testing intervals, but a solid quarter internationally enabled global cytology sales to finish roughly flat. On the other hand, sales of our fetal fibronectin test declined, dragging down this sub-segment.","Finally on Diagnostics, revenue related to our divested blood screening business totaled $18.6 million. Although this represented a decline of 2.1%, it was roughly double what we forecast. Nonetheless, we have now annualized the financial impact of the blood screening divestiture, and expect a significant reduction in quarterly blood screening revenue going forward.","Now let's cover our GYN Surgical division. Consistent with our expectations, global revenues of $107.7 million increased fractionally after posting two disappointing quarters of declines. Underpinning this, we are encouraged to see signs of stabilization in NovaSure. As we discussed in our last call, our new leadership team is changing the culture of the Surgical sales force, investing more in the endometrial ablation category, and emphasizing the benefits of our product relative to competitors. As a result, while NovaSure sales declined 7.6% on a global basis, this rate of decline was much less than in recent quarters. At the same time, MyoSure continues to perform well, with growth of 9.6% in the quarter. As our Surgical team continues to execute better, we do expect the total business to return to better growth in the fourth quarter.","Before we leave Surgical, let me mention that we're very gratified by our victory in the patent infringement lawsuit we initiated against Minerva. As you probably know, last week a jury awarded us $4.8 million in damages for Minerva's infringement of two of our NovaSure patents. As the legal process continues to play out, we intend to seek a permanent injunction prohibiting Minerva from selling the infringing device in the United States.","Now let's discuss Medical Aesthetics, which posted sales of $91.7 million, down 18% versus a large comp in the prior year period. Coming off a disappointing reset last quarter, we believe these results represent a step in the right direction. While we still have a lot of work to do at Cynosure, we are encouraged that revenue finished in line with expectations in the third quarter, and increased sequentially.","Aesthetics markets remain healthy, and our revamped domestic sales force is settling in and gaining confidence. This helps us strengthen relationships with customers, and also gives us strategic flexibility. For example, we recently signed an agreement with Porter Instrument, a business unit of Parker Hannifin Corporation, to distribute their Nitronox nitrous oxide system, which physicians are increasingly using to reduce pain and anxiety during aesthetic procedures. In addition, we have agreed to distribute another El.En laser in the United States, this one for hair removal. These deals show how we can supplement organic innovation with small transactions that capitalize on our commercial strength, scale and stability, with the ultimate goal of building sustainable competitive advantage in a fragmented industry.","We are beginning to see other signs of progress from the changes our new leadership team is implementing at Cynosure. For example, our new TempSure radiofrequency platform is off to a good start. Encouragingly, most TempSure systems are being purchased by customers who are new to Cynosure, broadening our customer base and opening up long-term opportunities for additional placements and upgrades.","SculpSure also posted solid growth sequentially, above what we would have anticipated from normal seasonality, as our efforts to strengthen this brand in the underpenetrated noninvasive fat reduction market are beginning to pay off. For example, SculpSure ratings on RealSelf, an influential website for the aesthetics industry, have increased dramatically, and are now better than our primary competitors. Patient interest and referrals have increased significantly based on our DTC efforts and better post-sale support, and customers are noticing.","And finally, in another sign that the health of the business is improving, recurring revenue from customer service and disposables increased almost 10% in the quarter, and represented more than a quarter of total sales. This despite the decline in overall Cynosure sales.","So while we are still very much in prove it mode with Cynosure, we are learning how to win the right way in aesthetics, and forecast that Cynosure will become a consistent growth engine starting next quarter, as the prior-year comps normalize.","Before we leave Cynosure, let me say that just yesterday we received the FDA letter regarding MonaLisa Touch, which represents less than 10% of Cynosure's sales. We are still analyzing the FDA's specific concerns, but acknowledge that this may create some market uncertainty around MLT in the short term. Having said that, we obviously agree that these products need to be marketed appropriately. Given our strength in Women's Health, the studies we have already done for MLT, and our efforts to demonstrate the clinical value of all our products, we believe we can be a leader here over the long-term, especially relative to competitors that may not have our compliance and regulatory capabilities.","I want to be very clear here, we believe a higher level of scrutiny from regulatory authorities will benefit us over time, since we share the same goals as FDA \u2013 clinically strong products that improve lives and are marketed responsibly. We are all about supporting technology with science and clinical evidence, so we welcome the more level playing field that this action signals.","To wrap up the revenue discussion briefly, Skeletal Health revenues of $22.5 million grew 2.1% due to strong international sales and continued solid adoption of our bone density systems, which are used both for osteoporosis screening and human performance management.","So to wrap up, our financial results were strong in the third quarter, with both revenue and EPS exceeding our guidance. While Breast Health and international led the way from a growth perspective, we are also pleased with the progress we are making in Surgical and at Cynosure. And we are excited about today's acquisition of Faxitron to boost our breast business.","Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me take this opportunity to thank him for four outstanding years as our CFO. As we announced separately today, Bob will be leaving the company to join Agilent. Since coming to Hologic in 2014, Bob has played a key role in our success. He has been a terrific leader in the organization, and a great partner to me. He helped our businesses return to growth, which in turn, enabled us to improve our cash flows and strengthen our balance sheet by paying off debt. And he built strong relationships with many of you on this call.","While we are sorry to see Bob leave, we are also excited to promote Karleen Oberton, our Chief Accounting Officer, to replace him. A 12-year Hologic veteran, Karleen has a deep knowledge of our businesses, our markets, and our people. She was already a member of our Global Leadership Team, and has long been a valued partner for our divisions, as well as an expert on financial planning and accounting matters. She is ideally qualified to both continue and expand the financial progress we have made, and Mike and I look forward to introducing her to many of you soon.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Thanks Steve, and good afternoon everyone. Before I begin, let me just say thank you, Steve, our Board of Directors, and the entire Hologic team, for the honor and privilege of working with you over the last four years. I am immensely proud of what we've achieved, not just from a financial perspective, but also in terms of building a sustainable growth business and making a huge difference for Women's Health. I will miss many things about Hologic, but I leave optimistic about the company's future, and confident that Karleen will take the finance team and the organization to even greater heights. I also look forward to staying in touch with many of the investors and analysts on this call in my new role.","Now let's get to our third-quarter results. In my remarks today, I'm going to walk through our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics, then finish with our updated financial guidance for 2018. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis.","As Steve mentioned, we posted strong results in the third quarter that exceeded both our revenue and EPS guidance. Breast Health and international drove our growth, while Cynosure and Surgical improved sequentially as well. This top-line performance, combined with solid expense control, a lower effective tax rate, and our share repurchase program, enabled us to post non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, 16% higher than a year ago.","Moving down the P&L, gross margin of 62.6% decreased 50 basis points compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to product and geographic mix, as our international sales carry a lower gross margin percentage than sales in the United States.","Total operating expenses of $279 million were up 1.5%, as we balanced our efforts to drive leverage within the operating expense line with our desire to increase funding for key growth initiatives, as well as to protect our intellectual property through legal activities.","Operating margin of 28.8% was down 20 basis points compared to a year ago, primarily due to the effect of geographic mix on gross margins. Now to round out the discussion of the income statement. Net margins of 19.3% increased 130 basis points compared to a year ago, due mainly to a lower effective tax rate.","We also took advantage of volatility in our share price to opportunistically repurchase our common stock in the third quarter. Specifically, we bought back 2.2 million shares for a total of $80.8 million. In addition, we're pleased to announce that the board has approved a new, $500 million share repurchase authorization to replace our old plan.","So as I mentioned previously, all these activities led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58 in the third quarter, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year. So even as the international grows more rapidly than our U.S. business, we continue to increase EPS at a rate well above sales.","Before we talk about our updated guidance, I'll quickly touch on a few other key financial metrics. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently stands at 2.6 times, and we remain comfortable around this level, recognizing that it could fluctuate a little based on the timing of transactions like Faxitron.","One reason we are comfortable with our debt level is we continue to generate strong cash flow. This quarter, free cash flow was $209 million, and we have generated $472 million of free cash year-to-date, when you exclude the non-recurring tax recapture payments associated with retiring our convertible notes. Our strong cash flow and the revamping of our debt structure provide us with plenty of capacity to continue to pursue small tuck-in acquisitions like Faxitron, while also acting opportunistically on our $500 million share repurchase authorization. Finally, adjusted EBITDA of $261.7 million increased slightly compared to the prior year.","Now let's turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter, beginning with our full-year revenue guidance. We are increasing our full-year guidance due to our strong performance in the third quarter. We now expect reported revenue of $3.205 billion to $3.22 billion in fiscal 2018, representing reported growth of 4.8% to 5.3%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to constant currency growth of between 3.9% and 4.4%, higher than our guidance from last quarter.","With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenues of $800 million to $815 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year period, this reflects revenue ranging from a decline of 0.4% to growth of 1.5% on a reported basis, or growth of 0.1% to 1.9% in constant currency terms.","Underlying this forecast, we are incorporating recent FX rates, as the dollar has strengthened since we last guided. We now expect currency to be a headwind in the fourth quarter and into 2019 as well. Also from a divisional perspective, let me remind you that in last year's fourth quarter, Diagnostics benefited from roughly $9.5 million in royalty payments that will not recur this year. Also in Diagnostics, as Steve mentioned, we expect blood screening to decline to a little more than half of the third quarter level. We forecast that Surgical growth will improve in the fourth quarter, while Cynosure will grow year-over-year, but decline on a sequential basis due to normal seasonality and the potential near-term impact of the FDA letter on MonaLisa Touch.","Now let's move on to our revised EPS forecast. We are tightening our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year to a range of $2.24 to $2.26, or roughly $2.25, which implies reported growth of about 10.8% despite absorbing incremental FX headwind I discussed. So we are growing our non-GAAP earnings at a double-digit rate despite having a material EPS contribution from blood screening in the prior year.","This earnings guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, a full-year tax rate of about 23%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 278 million to 279 million for the full year.","Our full-year EPS guidance translates to non-GAAP earnings per share range for the fourth quarter of $0.58 to $0.60, or roughly $0.59, which would represent an increase of about 18% on a reported basis. As you update your estimates, we would again encourage you to model around these midpoints, as we've incorporated both upsides and downsides into our forecast.","Before opening the call for questions, let me summarize by saying we exceeded our revenue and EPS commitments in the third quarter. Our results highlight the progress we've made, and the opportunities ahead of us, for both Breast Health and international. At the same time, we're encouraged by the progress we're making in Surgical and at Cynosure, and remain bullish that these efforts will begin to pay off with better growth for these divisions starting in the fourth quarter.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go now to Doug Schenkel with Cowen.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. I'll just ask the two of them and then I'll listen to your answers, both are on Molecular Diagnostics. So first you've recently launched a number of new molecular diagnostic assays, including but not limited to virology. In your prepared remarks, you've talked about strong virology growth while acknowledging it was off of a small base.","Do you expect these assays to have an impact on system placements and overall Molecular revenue growth in a more meaningful broader way in fiscal 2019? And then the second question is really on the pricing environment for U.S. molecular products. I'm wondering if pricing erosion has accelerated as your new reagent rental contracts. And related to that your contract with a large reference lab has now passed the five year mark, I'm wondering if you could provide an update on where you are on renewing that contract. So I guess that was actually three questions instead of two. Sorry about that. Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","I was going to say Doug that was very clever of the way you \u2013 two questions and it was clearly three. Let's, we will try to take them all. I think in terms of the Molecular Diagnostics piece, we are seeing continued growth in Panther placements, driven both by just our sales activities but the enhanced menu is definitely helping on that. And, so again, I think it's all incrementally strengthening that will pay off and continue.","We expect continued Panther placements into 2019. We're probably seeing a little bit more of an uptick in some of our international Panther placements in the last couple of quarters, which we think also bodes well to continue that growth going forward.","In terms of pricing pressures, nothing significantly different in the quarter, pretty flattish. And the final piece in terms of discussions about any particular contracts, as we said in the past, we're not going to comment on any specific customer negotiations, but we'll share more of that as we go into next year's guidance and everything else that will be factored in.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe I'll start the first one on that...","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Just when you thought Vijay that we hit you with all the news we could in the last few days.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Yes, you did Steve. It's certainly been a lot to digest, and maybe, and maybe I'll start with the management transition here. Bob, congrats on the move. But I'm just curious because just from a Hologic perspective, a lot of us who've looked at the story for a number of years we've thought the business was on its path to being a sustainable top line grower. I'm just curious on the timing and maybe some -- if you could provide some background on the transition I think that would be helpful?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Vijay. And what I would say is in many ways I'm very sad to leave Hologic. I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished and of the talented team that we have here in place, and quite honestly the opportunities the business has ahead of it. My experience here was a big stepping stone in kind of my professional career that actually gave me the opportunity to have the opportunity at Agilent which is a more global company or slightly bigger.","And what I would say is I leave knowing that the company is in better shape than certainly when I got here. And I leave it in very capable hands with Karleen. I know she will be a great partner to Steve and the rest of the leadership team here and will continue the great work that we've been doing.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon and thank you. Congrats to Bob. But just maybe on the Faxitron acquisition. Could you just give us a little bit of detail on the nature of the business? And in particular just curious about the impact it will have to gross margins. I took a quick look at the website and it seems like there's a combination of equipment and disposables. So just interested in sort of the profitability contribution that business will have at the gross margin level.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Isaac, it's Bob. This business generated roughly $27 million in its last fiscal year. So it's not going to have a material impact on the total company. We do believe that there's opportunities to improve gross margins over time, obviously leveraging the scale that we have. They're slightly lower than where we are today but we do see that that has an opportunity to improve. As we think about the business probably not going to have any impact in 2018 and it will be EPS neutral in 2019 but then accretive thereafter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats to both Bob as well as Karleen. Let's see, staying at Faxitron for a second, if I may. I guess just a couple of follow-up questions off of Isaac's. So I guess tell us how quickly can you get the Breast Health team trained in on the product line? And then U.S., OUS revenue split? And then lastly looks like we probably should have about $4.5 million dialed in for the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Bill this is Bob. We're probably not going to give you the international OUS split right now. What I would say is it's \u2013 although I would say the majority of the revenue is in the U.S. as we think about it they do have a strong distribution channel already, so what we are going to be able to do is leverage that as well as then bring our what I'll call discipline to it and improve. So we bring a channel. We bring some expertise and that actually expands our offerings within the radiology and then the breast biopsy suite. So we think about it as an adjacency that they already have a strong \u2013 they have a leading position in the products that they provide. I think we'll be able to utilize our resources and expertise to actually grow that business even beyond what they were able to do.","Operator","We'll go now to Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking...","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Brian, before you jump in, operator if I could just ask. Make sure you allow a follow-up question too. That would be great.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. So Steve, throw one out to see how you react to it.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","(35:47).","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. So you talked about not being satisfied with 1.1% growth this quarter. I'm just curious what do you think is the satisfying level of growth for the company at this point, given the makeup of the business is? Longer term, how do you think about where you want to be there on growth? 1.1%, clearly not where you want to be. Q4, maybe more in that 4% range, but how do you think about what is satisfying here?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Clearly, given the nature of the businesses, Brian, we want to be in the mid single digit business. And I think, obviously, our goal is to get back there. As you well know, we've got a couple of large businesses that are going to be below that and then it's getting the rest to be going above it. So I think as we transition into next year and certainly we're going to avoid giving 2019 guidance at this point in time, but certainly want to be accelerating as we come out of the year.","Brian David Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then for follow-up, you talked about the recurring revenues within Cyno and the customer service and disposables piece there. I think you said, was up 10% and more than 25% of total sales. Can you talk specifically how you're doing that at this point and any other kind of targets that you would have for where you think that that should be in the near term?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. The simple goal is, we're starting to see some very nice uptick in the PAC key revenue. So still not enormous, but it's moving very nicely in the directions, as the SculpSure machines that are out there are starting to get more usage. And so I think it's all part of the broader play of getting our marketing efforts, driving people in to get SculpSure treatments, getting the PAC keys going.","And certainly, over time, as we've talked about, new products that will bring more of a disposable element in addition to just a pure capital sale. We think over time that's going to become a much bigger part of the business, but that's going to be a multi-year journey, certainly.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Congrats to Bob. I look forward to working with him at Agilent. Maybe just starting out on Cyno. I want to understand the range of outcomes here for MonaLisa. I know it's only 10% of Cyno sales, but it looked like the FDA only really had kind of two requests in their letter. So can you talk about maybe timelines to get back to them and how you see this playing out?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. You know what, our timeline will be get back to them within the 30-day window that they've requested. And let me give you a much bigger picture perspective on this as to why I think this is going to be a huge net positive for us over time. And this quarter, does it put a little damper on things we'll see, may very well be.","But over time this is going to be very good. And Tycho, I think, you were around long enough to know my early days at Stryker, when the DOJ and Chris Christie came in and looked at the orthopedic industry practices and I will tell you, I remember standing in front of my first sales meeting as CEO at Stryker, where people thought I had my head in the sand, because a lot of our competitors were pursuing sales practices that we were not going to go down that path. And at the end of the day when the DOJ came and looked into the orthopedic industry and while it was painful to go through that, if you remember, the five major companies were looked at, and early on Stryker was losing market share when I took over. When we got a level playing field and the regulations got clearer and the scrutiny got better, in a level playing field, the best teams with the best products are going to win. And when Chris Christie settled that and you may recall the other four companies all got fined and all got deferred prosecution agreements and Stryker did not.","And that started for the next 10 years, Stryker gaining market share. And that's exactly what we think will happen in this industry. So frankly, having a little scrutiny, while it can be a little bit of short term pain, we absolutely welcome it because I believe it will allow the cream to rise to the top, and that's fully where we expect to be. We are investing in the clinical trials. We're investing in the right people. We're building the right teams and really think it'll play well to us over time.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Jonathan Block with Stifel.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Two, probably, relatively quick questions. So the first one Bob maybe for you, looks like constant currency came up by roughly 100 bps or $30 million. So, fair to say is that approximately half attributable to blood screening and maybe the remaining Breast Health, I'm just curious on how you guys are viewing the upside guidance today versus three months ago? And then I've got a follow-up.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yes. I think you're thinking about it the right way, Jon.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then Steve maybe this one for you. It sounds like both Surgical and Medical Aesthetics are set to return to growth, I believe you said starting next quarter. You're adding some products to the bag in Medical Aesthetics. Can you talk about a rough growth profile that you expect these divisions to recapture and I just ask that because at one point these were both hyper growth assets, they've fallen on hard times. It seems like you got them back on track. So maybe you can talk about what you should expect, what we should expect near term and then maybe longer term? Thanks guys.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. I think let's take Surgical, which by the way if you recall, 4.5 years ago Surgical was a declining business. And then it got into some good solid mid-single digit growth, became hyper growth frankly when we had a competitive withdrawal in the category. I think that inflated it. The longer term growth rate for those categories, if you play it out, endometrial ablation is probably a flattish category truthfully, and then fibroid removal is probably a high singles.","So the blended average of our Surgical business is probably a mid singles. And we ought to be every bit, as you know, we expect ourselves to grow faster than the categories we compete in. So I think Surgical getting back into the mid singles is where we feel good. We'd love it to be even better than that. And I think you'll see in the U.S., certainly in this coming quarter it will be a return to growth.","We returned globally to growth or call it flattish this quarter. The U.S. has been sequentially getting stronger each over the last few quarters but it still declined less. We don't want to be talking about declining less. So we feel fully confident that team will return to growth. And then we look at Medical Aesthetics, we do believe we're on the verge of starting to turn that business into a market to better than market grower at what is probably right around the 10%-ish number. So we're not going to be satisfied unless we're going for a double digit growth on that as we come out of the year.","Operator","We'll go to our next questioner who is Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. This is Jaime Morgan on for Rich. A quick question just to kind of follow-up on the Medical Aesthetics business. Where are you guys in terms of the sales organization? I know you said reps are in the midst of getting settling in and gaining confidence. So just looking for an update on the hiring progress, and any sort of commentary you can kind of give around what we should be expecting for total rep head count and the rep productivity and kind of the cadence of increases there?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, Jaime. Yeah, I'd say for the first time we are probably at about a normal level since over a year ago. So we've got a couple of openings here and there but it's now kind of in that standard range where you've always got a few openings and a little bit. And I think it's really the first time that we've been at that level. Now we still have people coming up to speed because the average tenure of many of the reps are still pretty junior in a lot of cases. But I think we feel really good about the progress we've made.","And I think the part that's very encouraging is a lot of our legacy team, the folks who've been here, they are just not going to cover off the ball. So we have people really, really putting up very strong growth rates while they've been offset by some of the vacancies and everything else. So I think as we come into the fourth quarter, starting to feel better and better. Are we operating at 100% effectiveness yet? No. But do we have most of the positions filled with good people? Yes.","Jaime L. Morgan - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on the TempSure product. I think you've indicated in the past that you guys are looking into expanded indications in both Surgical and Women's Health. I was wondering kind of if you could give us an update on your progress on either of those indications and potentially how much this could expand your market opportunity with this product? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. I think what we continue to be excited about is TempSure is probably one of the first, what I'll call, real platform technologies that we have gotten into. And we basically have a Surgical offshoot of that product that should be coming next year. So very excited by the initial sales of TempSure and then we have stuff coming behind it as we'll go into next year.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, Jaime, we just launched the Women's Health product literally in the last several weeks.","Operator","We'll now go to a question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Congrats again Bob on the move. Steve, just want to think about Cynosure and into the fourth quarter there. Three different things kind of going on here. You've got traditional seasonality in the core Cynosure business. You've got improving momentum as you talked about on this call and you've got some MonaLisa headwind. But if you think about that business down quarter-over-quarter, can you just walk us through sort of the three components. How should we be thinking about sort of fourth quarter down sequentially in light of the sort of three interlocking dynamics going on?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, I think David, the way I would think about it is July and August typically in this industry are pretty light. So you do have a clear step down. I think our hope would be that the improved sales force and everything else could almost offset that. But you've also got the international component of that which will also be a little softer. And candidly MonaLisa is probably a slight little curveball.","I think what it will probably do is put a pause on potentially some sales here in the short term and that might be the difference between deep down wanting to actually see it go up in the quarter or not. But I think being cautious while we are still getting out from \u2013 getting this business back on track I would assume that that's probably a slight more of a headwind this quarter that will play out well over the long term for us.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And Steve just two small quick ones, kind of, follow up. First is MonaLisa from a data perspective. There are a couple of studies ongoing for MonaLisa. I think one was suspended last year. I'm not sure what the other one is. But where are you on the clinical data front on MonaLisa? And then you mentioned Fuji in your prepared remarks. I wonder any thoughts on sort of expectations for 3D Performance in the low end of the market to the extent that they are in some way enjoined? Thanks so much.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. Another magical ability to get three questions into two, David. On the Fuji piece, I think, we feel good that competitively, frankly, even without the legal win our teams are being very aggressive and we continue to get a lot of wins. Certainly, they were going incredibly deep on pricing and does that create some opportunities for us? Frankly, there were some of the accounts that we're just not going to go that low. So it may allow us to pick up some additional business in that arena here as we go forward. And there's \u2013 the first one is really momentum in Breast Health. There's a lot of momentum in our Breast Health business right now that we really like what's going on there.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Steve, can I add just something to that. David, to that point, the two newest gantries that we launched just recently, the 3Dimensions and 3D Performance is just at the lower end, represented roughly 50% of all the 3D gantries that we launched or that we sold in the quarter. And we still continue to have a very high capture rate of new opportunities.","So when we look at the U.S. we believe that when we look at new placements, we're still getting in excess of eight out of every ten of those. And so, we feel very good, to Steve's point, around the competitive nature and really not beyond by price, but it's the clinical benefits and the features that these products provide. And I think that that's what's been a hallmark of that team and it will continue to do so, and I think we feel very good about what they are doing as they expand their offering beyond just gantries.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","And to the other question on MonaLisa. We're actually fairly deep in discussions with FDA about deeper studies for MonaLisa Touch, things that we haven't discussed exactly but very deep into the discussions. And frankly, it's why we extended the partnership.","As we announced, I think, on the last quarterly call, we see this being a great product over time, but we have that more modest expectations because we have been limited, as you know, in terms of where we've been selling it. And we wanted to generate additional clinical data for the product to strengthen the claim structure around it. So we're actually been deep in discussions with them on that.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Steve and Bob I was hoping you could give us some color on operating margins as we look into 2019, and what are some of the puts and takes that we should be thinking about heading into the new year?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Jack, I think we want to be careful not to get into 2019 guidance, but I think on a high level, you know what, gross margins probably not going to move dramatically, because of the international business continues to grow at a lower gross margin, probably not going to be seeing the huge wins that we had in the previous years.","They're also \u2013 depending on what happens with the tariffs that could be a slight headwind to gross margin that we would seek to try to make up as much as we can, but dealing with that. I think we'll get a little bit of OpEx leverage. So whereas \u2013 that as we grow that's got to be the ability to start to drive a little bit more operating margin expansion.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thank you. And I was hoping you could just elaborate on your commentary around some of the increased deal activity you're seeing in the space. Does that stand across all of your businesses? And related to that, how does the Faxitron acquisition fit into how you think you can broaden the Breast Health segment over time?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yes, great question. We are seeing much -- many more deals that I'd say have the profile of a Faxitron. And I think as you know we made an organizational change really at the end of last calendar year where we eliminated the Chief Operating Officer. Me having direct access to the Presidents now of the divisions they're really starting to ramp up the activity and just our whole corporate team supporting that it's just, it's a very different outlook. And I think they're starting to see some things and we're looking at a lot more things in the flow that are what I'd call much more the true tuck-ins that supplement our existing businesses. As it relates to Breast Health we've been looking at the continuum of patient care and how we continue to build out from the strength we have in mammography.","And we've been seeing the growth of the breast conserving surgery area and it's such an adjacency. It's right for us to be able to go in and have a bigger play. We have a very small product in that space today, so we've got the knowledge, we've got the presence. But this will allow us to build out. And that -- these are the kind of tuck-ins that we really want to be doing. And I would say frankly in each division right now we're starting to see some of them and we've got them coming forth. So I'm not going to say we're going to have one ready to go every quarter or whatever else. It's never that linear or clean. But I can tell you the teams are really starting to surface some good things. And two years ago or even a year ago we just want to bring many good ideas forth.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Anthony for Raj. Hello, sorry I was on mute. Anthony for Raj. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just back to MonaLisa a bit. There's a little bit of revenue mix in there. I'm just wondering expectations into the second half and then maybe a little bit more detail on maybe the contents of the FDA inquiries, I mean it looks like they were certainly, there's a focus on marketing practices but is there a chance that this actually bifurcates going forward in favor of Cynosure? That will be my first question.","And then just on Breast Health, it looks like there was a patent suit win specifically against Fuji. So just an update on sort of share shifts within Breast Health and maybe how that particular situation with Fuji plays out. Is that a tailwind as you go forward here in the second half? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. I think on the MonaLisa piece, it's really very early to know how it will play out for the other companies and everything else. We're just going to focus on ourselves. I think we continue to feel good about MonaLisa. We are very willing to invest in the clinical studies. And by the way none of us are perfect. I'm sure between legacy stuff (54:50) have you slightly over promoted here or there. We'll clean anything like that up just as I did earlier in my Stryker days, and then we'll move forward. And again feel really good about the product and our commitment to the clinical expertise.","As it relates to Fuji, frankly they haven't been that big of a competitor. Most of what we're competing with day-to-day is really GE and Siemens institutions. And I think we continue to feel really good about the wins we're continuing to get. You don't grow our Breast Health business the way we have been doing now for a number of years, post all the concerns about the cliff without continuing to take market share.","So I think, Fuji, I put in the nuisance category. And they are certainly there and we hope to have them permanently withdrawn from the products that are infringing our patents and that'll certainly help. But day-in day-out we're also still competing against some very formidable competitors in GE and Siemens. But we like our chances.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello and good afternoon.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Derik.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Hey. So I'm going to see if I can sneak in three like Doug. Number one, can you \u2013 how fast was Faxitron growing? And did you bless Quirk's (56:19) $4.5 million number for Q4? Number two, are you still comfortable with sort of the mid-teens growth in the legacy business OUS? And I'm just curious, have you seen any sort of like buying ahead of the tariffs in China? Just wondering if you've seen any unusual dynamics in the market ahead of that. And, yeah, I'll just leave it there.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Great. Hey. I don't think we're going to necessarily disclose the Faxitron growth rates but solid. And we kind of ignored Bill's...","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","And faster than the current company.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. It's accretive to our growth rate. Bill's number was probably slightly high, I would guess, just where we are in the quarter and where they are in terms of, as we take it over. But I think feel good about a full year number.","In terms of the base business growth rates, I would not endorse mid-teens international growth for our base business going forward. I think we've had seven straight quarters of big stuff. But now we're really starting to get against big comps and especially stacked comps.","We still expect our international business clearly to be growth accretive. We also picked up, as you know, a couple of distributor acquisitions. So I think that'll come \u2013 certainly slow down as we've annualized all of that, but continue to feel really good about the growth rate of our international business being accretive to the company.","And finally, I don't \u2013 we have not seen any buying in or stocking in from China. I wish our business was bigger for us to realize that kind of an impact in China. But I think nothing noticeable at this point.","Operator","We'll go now to Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions and congratulations, Bob. Wanted to start with the international Diagnostics business. Steve, you indicated not to expect mid-teens growth next year. Certainly you had a significant benefit from currency in the international business. But I guess just broadly or high level, can you speak about the penetration rates and how you think you're competing across Europe and how much growth you see there, just from a market share perspective?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, Mark. Let me be clear. My comment to Derik, unless I misunderstood his question, was about our total international business growing at mid teens. I think we would expect our Molecular Diagnostics business to continue to be a very healthy grower internationally. And again not ready to give guidance but my comment was more about our total business. I think we feel good about what's going on in Europe. We continue to place Panthers. Our team has gotten a lot stronger there at selling. And as the menu builds out feeling really good about additional opportunities in Europe. And again even though we are going against some very formidable competitors in that part of the world, we are getting some very nice wins and expect that to continue.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Got it.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","So, Mark, to that point I mean when we look at our market shares there, we have a lot of opportunity to gain market share over time in Europe and in Asia as our menus expand.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Got it. And just a two parter follow-up. The Breast Health gantries, would you say that that number of placements is roughly stable or maybe flat sequentially, or are you seeing an uptake there? And then secondly on annuity per analyzer on Panther, I think you guys were looking for maybe high single digit growth there, any update there?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yes. So Mark on the Breast Health gantries, we were up sequentially but it's still within the range that we've had been \u2013 we've been saying between 250 and 300 (01:00:30) per quarter, and it was in that range. For the annuity on the Diagnostics Panther system that continues to increase. That's one of the things that's real strong growth driver for that business going forward. We saw a nice rebound this quarter as we expected. With the additional menu that's coming on we would expect that opportunity to continue to grow.","Operator","We'll now take questions from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, thanks for squeezing me back in. And I just want to go through the fourth quarter maintenance (01:01:10) guidance assumptions. Just Bob, high level, so, what is the FX that's baked into that number for Q4? And if I understood all the different numbers, it's about $9.5 million headwind from the Diagnostics royalty roll-off, which is not going to repeat. There's some contribution, let's call it, $3 million to $5 million from Faxitron. And blood is going to be about $8 million to $9 million in Q4. Is that correct all those numbers I had?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yes. You're in the ballpark, Vijay. And what I would say is when we think about where we were from last guide, the FX is hurting us by roughly $8 million.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","And that's all going to be in Q4 right, that $8 million headwind in Q4?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","That's the Q4 number. That's correct. We had roughly about $3 million in Q3 relative to when we gave guidance and that guidance comprehended \u2013 was impacted roughly by about $8 million in Q4. And we've included that into the latest guidance.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","And got you. And blood is coming much better than expected, right now. Obviously that's been a headwind to margins. I mean if I understood Steve's comments, it looks like maybe very slight margin expansion for 2019. Is that sort of \u2013 it looks like maybe the Street is a little aggressive on margins, op margins for 2019? Thank you.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah. Again, we're probably not going to get into all the details. I think what Steve was talking about was as we look at our business, look the gross margin line is probably not going to see a whole lot of new expansion as we look at our international business growing faster. The impact of tariffs as they come to pass. That being said, we do believe that we have the levers necessary to drive operating margin improvement and we'll give more guidance on the fourth quarter call.","Operator","We will now go to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. And I'll keep it to one and bring the average down. So...","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Jayson.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","You're welcome. Just a bigger picture margin question, specifically on the R&D spend. It's trended lower as a percent of sales over the last few years. In the quarter it was frankly lower than it's been in some time. Steve, is there a point in the life cycle of this business where you have to ramp the R&D spend to fund the organic growth profile, or should we think of 6.5% to 7% of sales as the right level going forward?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. I think, it came down a bit largely because the heavy investment in the virology programs and Diagnostics, which was a huge clinical program came down. I would not expect that to leverage much more. I think it's kind of \u2013 it's almost like the business development stuff.","Now that we're getting \u2013 we've got better people in place and everything else starting to see some other projects that we can work on. And I think that will be an area of probably less leverage going forward, because we don't want to \u2013 we want to make sure we're investing for the future.","And it could even tick up ever sort of slightly probably as we go forward. But again hopefully we're able to keep it at that level and invest for the future, grow the top line, grow the R&D budget, and good things keep happening.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Operator, I think we have time for maybe two more questions.","Operator","We'll now go to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks for letting me get a follow-up in. Steve, I want to...","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, sorry, thought you got cut off earlier.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's okay. The whole notion of getting back to mid single digit growth, I know you don't want to necessarily comment too much on next year. But really the question is, how much is contingent on new product driving the recovery back to mid single digit growth next year?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","They'll certainly play a role. And again we'll talk much more on the next call when we give guidance for next year.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, Tycho I think to Steve's point, I mean without speaking to 2019, I mean one of the things that we talked about and I think it's being shown is the improvement of our R&D pipeline. We launched several new products in the quarter, but when you think about across our product portfolio, the expansion of our R&D, our menu in the Diagnostics business really helping drive growth there, obviously, with what we've been able to do on the Breast Health business with the new gantries but also increasingly some additional products in surround and then even in the Surgical and the Medical Aesthetics area where we're doing some nice distribution deals, and then on Surgical some nice tuck ins.","That is the way I would expect the cadence to continue going forward, those things continue to be a bigger and more important piece, and actually creates vibrancy in our product portfolio. And I would expect you to see that going forward.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our final question from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So I was hoping you could elaborate on the emerging market program you have for your Molecular business. I mean, your competitors in molecular actually do quite a bit of business in emerging markets. And so can you talk about how you'd size that opportunity and what you expect timing would be and when we can start to see some contribution from those efforts? Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, Dan as you well said, a lot of our competitors are much more entrenched there. We're in the early stages. And I'd probably put it as it's going to be not significant probably even as we go into 2019. But we're putting our foot in the door. We're building the relationships. Obviously in the announcement last week with the Clinton Health Care, Health Access Initiative, I think it's going to go a long way to putting us on the map there. It's probably going to yield bigger benefits in call it 2020 and beyond. But I think we feel good about the initial start that we're getting in there.","And we finally have the menu and the system in terms of Panthers that we can make a difference there. It'll be probably lower price and lower margin as we also try to do good but overall feel like that will be a very good place for us to be as well.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","I think the other thing it underscores is the strength of our leadership there. I would tell you two years ago, this was not something that would have been possible within Hologic.","So our EMEA leadership team being able to really work with that in conjunction with our Diagnostics partners hereon in the U.S. I just speak to what Steve has said a long \u2013 a lot and truly believe that leadership makes a difference. And I think that is as much of a symbol as anything else.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","I think a very fitting and final comment for Bob as he signs off. And again a huge thanks to Bob and welcome to Karleen. Many of you will get to know her in the years ahead. We wish Bob, all the best as he moves forth and thank you everybody for listening to our call. And keep watching as we keep making this company better and better. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Kamille and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications to begin the call.","Michael J. Watts - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Kamille. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us for Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the Company's Chairman, President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","Our fourth quarter press release is available now on the investor section of our website. We also will post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. Finally, a replay of this call will be archived on our website through November 25.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the Safe Harbor statement that's included in our earnings release, and in our filings with the SEC.","Also during this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP financial measures can be found in our earnings release. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Mike and good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We once again posted strong results that illustrate the progress we're making toward building a sustainable growth company. In addition, our results capped off a very good fiscal 2016 in which we delivered on our commitments.","Today, I'll first provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results. But since it's the end of our fiscal year, we'd also like to provide a strategic update on the journey we've shared over the last three years. We'll focus on our revenue and financial drivers for the full-year, and provide some color on the behind-the-scenes progress we're making in research and development.","Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $726.8 million grew 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.8% in constant currency; a healthy performance despite a difficult comparison to the prior-year period. We also absorbed a headwind of nearly $4 million from divested and discontinued products. Net of these, total revenues would have grown 4.4% in constant currency.","Our Surgical business again set the pace with its seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth globally. We are also pleased with how our breast imaging and molecular diagnostics businesses performed, and encouraged that new products began to contribute to growth. We'll come back to this point in a minute.","In terms of geography, U.S. sales grew 7.4% in the quarter, continuing a string of strong results. Even if we exclude the $5 million royalty payment from our fourth quarter results, our growth rate accelerated on a sequential basis.","As expected, international sales declined 9.6% as reported or 7.8% in constant currency, versus a difficult comparison in the prior-year period. Apart from this tough comp, international Breast Health was stable sequentially in the quarter. There were also some pockets of strength globally, namely molecular diagnostics and Surgical, both of which posted double-digit growth. Although these businesses are relatively small today outside the U.S., we believe they will be important growth drivers in 2017 and beyond.","Profit margins remained robust in the quarter. Most importantly, non-GAAP net income grew 14.6%, more than three times faster than sales. And our net margin of 20.0% increased by 190 basis points. With the benefit of additional capital deployment, we posted non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 or 20.9% better than in the prior-year period. So all in all, we posted a very strong fourth quarter that exceeded expectations and capped off an excellent year.","Thinking about the year as a whole, we made good progress in our journey from turnaround story to a sustainable growth company. To-date, our successes have been most visible in domestic sales execution, which in turn has driven the improved financial performance of the company.","One of the first goals we established three years ago was to stabilize two highly-profitable products that had been declining sharply, ThinPrep and NovaSure. In 2016, these products were more than stable; they returned to solid growth. Cytology and perinatal sales increased 2.8% on the year in constant currency. Even more impressive, NovaSure sales grew 10% in constant currency, as our team capitalized on the market withdrawal of a competing product.","As we stabilized ThinPrep and NovaSure, we also set out to maximize growth drivers such as our Genius 3D mammography systems and the Panther platform in molecular diagnostics. Both of these products performed well in 2016. Genius drove 5.2% constant currency growth in total Breast Health sales in 2016, and we remain bullish on the opportunity ahead of us.","While there has been lots of debate about a peak in system placements, we have a fundamentally different and more positive view of the future. The 3D curve is very different than the 2D curve for a number of reasons, and we believe Breast Health sales will be stronger for longer than many anticipate.","Although we've placed about 3,600 systems in the United States as of the end of the fiscal year, the market is still under-penetrated. For example, 3D installations represent a little more than 40% of total Hologic mammography systems. And if you look at MQSA statistics, 3D installations represent just a quarter of total systems. We have been placing roughly 300 units per quarter in the U.S. recently, and at this pace should enjoy many more quarters of solid performance. We are also gaining significant market share from our competitors, while our innovative marketing strategies enable us to maintain stable pricing.","As our domestic installed base of 3D units has grown, so has the related service opportunity. Breast Health service revenue again exceeded $100 million in the quarter and increased at a high-single digit rate, boosting overall growth. This increase in service revenue, combined with the potential of new product, gives us confidence that Breast Health can continue to grow even as 3D adoption matures.","Now let's turn to a second major growth driver, the Panther system, our fully-automated diagnostics instrument. Panther helped our molecular business grow 7.8% in constant currency in 2016, behind increased sales of women's health tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV, and trichomonas. By the end of fiscal 2016, we had shipped more than 1,000 Panther units just to diagnostic customers. And we're encouraged that a growing number of these placements are coming internationally. Panther shipments to customers outside the United States grew dramatically in 2016, and we believe we are just scratching the surface of this long-term opportunity.","At the same time, our sales team is partnering with lab and physician customers to ensure that patients are tested according to the best clinical guidelines, providing better care while increasing organic volumes. In fact, on a global basis, the average Panther generated more than $190,000 in assay revenue in 2016, a high-single digit increase in utilization. And we are optimistic that this number will increase further as we roll out viral load assays in Europe and the United States.","As we look back on fiscal 2016, the stabilization of ThinPrep and NovaSure, combined with strong growth from Genius and Panther, drove excellent full-year results. You might recall that 12 months ago, our initial guidance called for revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion for the year. We finished at $2.83 billion; so we delivered on our commitment.","At the same time, we achieved significant margin improvement in 2016. For the year, non-GAAP gross margin was 65.6%, an impressive 140 basis points better than last year. This enabled us to make incremental investments in marketing and R&D to drive future growth, while still delivering operating income of 33.6%, 30 basis points better than in 2015.","Combined with a lower tax rate and repurchases of both convertible debt and common shares, we posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 in 2016. This was 17.4% higher than in the prior year and comfortably ahead of our original guidance.","Looking beyond earnings, we're also very pleased with our cash flow in 2016, which is often under-appreciated. We generated $787.2 million in operating cash, with only $94.5 million in CapEx. And roughly half of this CapEx went toward revenue-generating instruments such as our Panther systems. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $692.7 million, 23.3% higher than non-GAAP net income.","Our operations and finance teams deserve tremendous credit for making this happen. As one measure of their success, inventories at year-end 2016 were $8.4 million less than a year ago, even though product revenues were about a $109 million higher. Taking a step further, inventories are now below the levels of even two years ago, demonstrating tremendous progress by our team.","Obviously, these strong cash flows gave us the flexibility to continue improving our capital structure in 2016. We repurchased $274.2 million of convertible notes for $392.8 million during the year, as well as 7.3 million shares of common stock for $250 million. As a result, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, has fallen to 2.8 times, a little more than half what it was at the time of the Gen-Probe acquisition. In addition, diluted shares outstanding were slightly lower in 2016 than in the prior year, providing a boost to EPS.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to emphasize that strong cash flows also enabled us to invest appropriately and consistently in research and development, which increased about 8% this year. And we are just beginning to see the fruits of our labor.","In the fourth quarter of 2016, sales of key new products exceeded $10 million in revenue for the first time. These new products include viral assays in Diagnostics, the Affirm prone biopsy system in Breast Health, and MyoSure REACH in Surgical. We recognize that $10 million is still small in the context of overall Hologic, but it's a good start and we are optimistic about the potential of these products in 2017.","In addition, our R&D pipeline is building behind the first wave of new products. In Diagnostics, we recently filed for regulatory approval of our Aptima Hepatitis C viral load test in the United States, and anticipate launching it commercially in 2017, following the introduction of our HIV viral load assay. Sales of these products will become more meaningful in 2018, when we also have a Hepatitis B assay available. We also filed recently for U.S. regulatory approval of our herpes test, which will complement our existing portfolio of women's health products on the Panther system. And finally, we are beginning clinical trials for our respiratory assays on the next-generation Panther Fusion system.","In Breast Health, we have fundamentally reshaped our R&D strategy away from the boom and bust approach of the past, toward a model that strives for continuous innovation built around our leadership position in 3D mammography. The Affirm prone biopsy system fits in this vein, as does our upcoming Brevera product, which will provide real-time specimen radiography to improve breast biopsy workflow and the patient experience. We are hopeful that Brevera will begin to contribute to growth late in 2017 and more meaningfully in 2018.","Finally, in Surgical, we are encouraged by the early success of our MyoSure REACH line extension, which is providing new capabilities to customers and therefore helping expand the market. In the same way, we are working to leverage our market-leading position in endometrial ablation by launching internationally a next-generation NovaSure device that will improve patient comfort as well as physician usability.","Compared to the dramatic improvement you've seen in U.S. sales execution, our progress in research and development is just becoming visible. We have a lot of work to do in these areas, but are excited about our early progress. In some ways, domestic sales execution represents the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible here. Below the surface, we are working diligently to boost new product innovation, build our international capabilities, and further enhance profitability.","As our new leadership team settles in, and as talented, engaged employees at all levels of the organization continue to do their thing, we look forward to sharing more successes with you in 2017 and beyond.","Now, I will hand the call over to Bob.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our divisional revenue performance, review the rest of our fourth-quarter financials, and then discuss our financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency.","We closed out our fiscal year with results that surpassed expectations. Revenue grew at a healthy rate, and favorable gross margins allowed us to reinvest opportunistically in the business, while still delivering strong bottom-line growth.","I'll begin by discussing our Surgical division, which remained the growth leader in the quarter with sales of $101.5 million and growth of 17.6%. Fueling this growth was MyoSure, where sales of $42.6 million grew 33.4%, thanks to the outstanding efforts of our commercial team. In addition, NovaSure sales grew 8.7%, as we continued to gain market share and capitalize on a competitive withdrawal.","Now moving to Diagnostics, we posted sales of $311.9 million in the quarter, a solid growth rate of 3.1%. In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $134.3 million increased 9.6%. As Steve noted, we booked a $5 million royalty payment this quarter, but at the same time, we also absorbed a headwind of almost $3 million from our discontinued cystic fibrosis product line. So the underlying trends in the business remained strong, and we continue to gain share and increase utilization of women's health assays on the fully-automated Panther instrument.","In addition, international sales grew at a mid-teens rate, and we posted yet another record quarter of Panther placements outside the U.S., providing a strong platform for future growth. Elsewhere in Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal products posted sales of $121 million and increased slightly compared to the prior-year period. Share gains for our ThinPrep product continue to offset headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening intervals.","And finally, our blood business declined 6% as expected, as we continue to see the impact of lower blood utilization and fluctuating ordering patterns by our partner Grifols. Partially offsetting these headwinds were initial sales of our Zika products. As we enter 2017, we believe macro trends towards lower blood utilization will continue to be a drag on sales growth.","Now moving to Breast Health, we posted global sales of $292.3 million and solid growth of 2.3% over another challenging comp. In the U.S, continued adoption of Genius 3D systems was supplemented by a growing service annuity and our sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system, driving an increase of 7.2% in sales. Over the last two quarters, our U.S. Breast Health results have clearly illustrated a point we've made repeatedly in recent months, that the business can continue to grow despite increasingly challenging comps. And to round out our revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $21.2 million decreased 17.3% in constant currency, due mainly to lower volumes of our Fluoroscan mini C-arm products.","Now moving down the income statement, fourth quarter gross margins of 65.7% increased 110 basis points compared to the prior-year period. Gross margins benefited from both geographic and product mix, as well as continued pricing discipline and operational improvements. Total operating expenses of $235.5 million increased 7.7% in the fourth quarter. We continue to take advantage of improving gross margins to reinvest strategically in the business. For example, quarterly R&D spending increased 16.3%, and we're beginning to see some of the benefits as Steve discussed.","In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan drove an additional $4 million of expense. Despite these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin remained a healthy 33.3% in the quarter.","Below the line, we continue to make good progress in two areas that have been a priority for our finance organizations. Based on lower debt levels, interest expense of $32.9 million in the fourth quarter declined 14.8%. At the same time, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31% in the quarter was more than 300 basis points lower than a year ago. While we are very pleased with the results we've produced in a short amount of time, we are still at the beginning stages of this process and see continued opportunity ahead.","And finally, to wrap up the fourth quarter income statement, non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 grew 20.9% compared to a year ago, much faster than sales growth. The multiple levers used to drive EPS growth in the quarter give us comfort in our ability to continue growing EPS at a multiple of sales.","Now let me turn to cash flows and the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $263.9 million improved 5.2%. We continue to focus on reducing our convertible debt. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $47.6 million in principal of our 2037 notes for $81.3 million, and intend to redeem the remaining $12 million in cash when the notes are callable this December.","Despite retiring a portion of our convertible debt and repurchasing shares over the course of 2016, we ended the year with $548.4 million in cash, an increase of $57.1 million compared to the prior year. We finished the year with total debt of $3.3 billion, a reduction of $0.3 billion compared to the prior year. And our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently sits at 2.8 times, close to our target of 2.5 times.","The combination of strong profit growth and lower debt continues to drive improvements to return on invested capital. As of year-end, ROIC was 12.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of a 180 basis points over the prior year.","Now, I'd like to cover our non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2017. We are forecasting mid-single digit revenue growth in 2017 on top of increasingly challenging comps. We expect an improving operating margin and lower tax rate to drive EPS growth at roughly double the rate of sales growth. Specifically, we anticipate constant currency revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5% in fiscal 2017. At recent exchange rates, this equates to sales of $2.94 billion to $2.98 billion on a reported basis, with reported growth rates between 3.8% and 5.2%.","As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges at this early stage, as we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both potential upsides and downsides.","Our guidance includes the net benefit of three extra selling days based on our fiscal calendar. Compared to the prior-year periods, we will gain four selling days in the first quarter. Although this will be the historically slow week between Christmas and New Years, while we will lose one day in the fourth fiscal quarter. We estimate this benefit to be between 50 and 70 basis points of sales growth, with a negligible effect on EPS.","At the same time, our guidance also includes a roughly $5 million headwind from products that we have either divested or recently decided to discontinue. In other words, our guidance would have been about 20 basis points higher if these products remained in our portfolio.","In terms of divisional growth for 2017, our guidance contemplates low- to mid-single digit growth in Diagnostics and Skeletal, mid-single digit growth in Breast Health, and slightly higher growth in Surgical. In Diagnostics, molecular should lead the charge behind Panther and an expanded international menu including virology assays. We forecast that cytology and perinatal sales will be flat to up slightly and we also expect blood to be flat to up slightly, as new Zika sales offset negative macro trends.","In Breast Health, we expect continued strength in Genius 3D mammography, a growing service annuity, contributions from new products including the Affirm prone biopsy system and Brevera towards the end of the year, as well as a return to growth for our international business.","In Surgical, we expect growth to be driven by MyoSure market expansion efforts and NovaSure share gains, as well as international sales. Geographically, we expect our international business to begin contributing to growth in fiscal 2017, in line with the company's overall growth rate. In terms of profitability, we forecast continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in 2017, but how we get there will be different than last year.","In 2017, we forecast a slight improvement in non-GAAP gross margin percentage, combined with greater leverage from operating expenses, leading to more improvement in operating margin than we saw last year. All this leads us to forecast that earnings per share will be between $2.12 and $2.16 in 2017. This represents growth of 8.5% to 10.6% in constant currency and reported growth of between 8.2% and 10.2%. Again, we'd encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range at this early stage of the year.","This guidance assumes a full-year tax rate of approximately 31% and diluted shares outstanding of between 289 million and 291 million for the year. Our guidance does not assume any capital deployment beyond calling what's left of our 2037 convertible notes in December.","Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenues of $720 million to $730 million, flattish on a sequential basis, as the benefit from extra selling days between Christmas and New Year's is offset by the normal seasonal decline we experienced due to our global sales meeting and the RSNA Conference in Breast Health. Compared to the prior-year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 3.8% to 5.2% on a constant currency basis and reported revenue growth of 3.6% to 5.0%.","We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.51 in the first quarter. This represents anticipated growth of 9.1% to 11.3% in constant currency terms, or 8.7% to 10.9% on a reported basis. Compared to our fourth quarter actuals, please note that operating expenses will increase in the first quarter due to the timing of sales and marketing activities and the extra days.","Before we open up the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that our fourth quarter capped off another good year for the company. Our financial performance demonstrates that we are transforming from a turnaround story to a sustainable growth company. We feel confident about the foundation we have established heading into 2017, and have the levers necessary to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth with EPS growth roughly double that rate.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up and then return to the queue. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for the good written guide. I have enough to worry about tonight like breaking that 108-year curse in a couple of hours, so I appreciate that.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","You're in first here, so you can get ready to focus on, Brian.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","I appreciate that. Thank you very much. So, as we look at your guidance range, you had clearly signaled ahead of time that you were going to give a wider range and you certainly did that. I'm curious, you guided us to the midpoint but not on the high-end of the line there, is that really a function of kind of how you expect new products to contribute? You talked about $10 million from that this quarter and what not. But do you expect that new products are really the differentiating factor between that high-end to low-end and any color on that would be helpful. Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, Brian. The new products will certainly be a piece of it. I think we've all been around long enough to know no matter what we put into our forecast, it always comes out a little differently. And I just think it's a very prudent thing given particularly the environment to have a slightly broader range. I do think we see a little more \u2013 if the new products are doing well, which we fully expect they will, I think it clearly pushes us towards that higher end. I think we get into that 5%-ish range as things take off. We always want to be a little cautious until we start to see the success.","I will tell you, I think Affirm is off to a very nice start. MyoSure REACH off to a very nice start. And these are really the first new products we've launched since we've come on. And also our international molecular diagnostics business is really starting to take off. We had a couple of quarters there of double-digit growth as well. So, there's a lot we feel good about, but again, still very early stages and a lot to play out.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, I think the other thing, Brian, just to build on that is some of these products haven't gotten full approval yet as well. And so there is an estimate of timing to start with, but we certainly feel very good about our path there, but there is some flexibility there as well.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","And you mentioned OUS, specifically in molecular diagnostics. And I think you talked about a return to growth next year somewhere in, I think, maybe mid-single digits or something overall. But can you talk about some of the things more specifically OUS that you guys are focused on, some of the other products that you guys are focused on next year that potentially could add to growth there? Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, I think there's couple of things we're excited about for international. First is the leadership team there Eric Compton has really put in place. As we exit this year, we basically got a completely new leadership team internationally from how we entered the year, other than our leader of the Diagnostics business in Europe, who is already showing and really been leading the way with great growth. But I think as we look to international, the molecular diagnostics business ought to be a real standout for us. I think Surgical continuing off of a smaller base, but continuing to show good growth, and Breast Health will return to some growth, as we're working a lot tighter with our dealers and getting things in place there. So I think we feel incrementally significantly better entering this year than we did at this time last year about international.","Operator","Our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Steve, want to actually focus on margins. Guidance assumes some nice operating margin expansion. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers? I know you've over-invested during the growth boom, so can you maybe talk about some of the levers you can pull for margin expansion in 2017?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, we've clearly invested heavily, Tycho, especially on the marketing and the R&D fronts as this year was coming in well and obviously way hot on the EPS line. We've really \u2013 I would say those, we had expanded and invested more than our rate of sales, we'll probably come back into those being slightly leveragable relative to the rate of sales as we go into the current year.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, as we think about Breast Health, Cigna was obviously the first to move forward with reimbursing Tomo for routine screening. Can you talk a little bit about how that's progressed and where you see other payors along that path?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, we really applaud Cigna. They obviously got on board. I would tell you it's a struggle with both Aetna and United at this point. We're working through it. We would love them to take the same approach towards their patients that Cigna did, but we're working through with them. And we basically have not assumed that they come and that could be an additional source of upside if or when they fall during the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thanks and good afternoon everybody.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Couple of questions on virals, guys. Obviously, glad to hear that everything is on track for the U.S. launches. And if we're doing the math right, I think you should be accretive to the overall Diagnostic gross margins. But, that said, we've also heard about some pricing pressure over in Europe. And so can you help just kind of set the stage for us about what you expect in U.S.? And then maybe just a couple words on what you're seeing in Europe thus far. Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. To be clear, the virals will be a very small contributor in 2017 in the United States. And that's where they're going to be coming at a much better margin. So right now they are contributing to the top line growth, and certainly top- and bottom-line in Europe, but the big pickup for us will really be more in 2018 on the margin side, as it relates to the virals.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, and I think in Europe we're seeing good traction there, Bill. We talked about the Panther placements. 2016 was a very good year in Panther placements, specifically in Europe, but also internationally, in general. I think that's largely on the back of our viral system, our viral load assays. And we'll get the full benefit of that in 2017 as those instruments that were placed get a full year. The other thing is in that we noted that the revenue pull-through per Panther has increased. That's both in the U.S. as well as internationally. So I think that that's a harbinger for good growth going forward.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And just the overall pricing dynamic in Europe?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, pricing is lower in Europe, but it's pretty much as expected based on our models. It's a little lower outside the U.S. than in the U.S., but not anything different than what we had anticipated.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Got it, very good. Thanks, guys.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Next we have Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Vijay.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Thank you.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","I feel like we were all waiting with bated breath and just given what's happened MedTech, we're glad to see this come through. Just maybe one on the guidance on the revenue, what does the guidance assume for OUS growth, international growth for next year? Because I would have thought, just given what happened sequentially 3Q versus 4Q international trends, any color on international would be helpful.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, it basically is in line with the total company growth rate next year. So I'd say we're picturing actually balanced growth for the first time. The last couple of years, it's been way skewed to the U.S., has been generating most of the growth. But I think we see this year really being a rebalancing (37:13). Recall the fourth \u2013 the current quarter is not indicative of a trend, given that last year's fourth quarter turns out \u2013 there was a lot more put into that last year's fourth quarter than we fully understood, just as dealers bought in to maintain their contracts against minimums and things like that. So, I think, again, we feel far better coming into this year and seeing expected growth.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","Great. And then maybe one for \u2013 go ahead, Bob.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, I was just was going to say the other thing to bear in mind there is, we had mentioned that the blood screening business will be roughly flat to slightly up year-on-year. That was a big headwind internationally through all of 2016 as the inventories and ordering patterns of our partner were adjusting. So we expect to kind of lap that. So that gives us help for turning that trajectory around as well.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI","And then maybe one for you, Bob. You did mention that the guidance doesn't assume anything on the capital deployment front. I mean just I think in your prepared remarks, you also highlighted free cash generation, right? I guess my question is what's the focus for cap deployment over the next 12 months?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, we continued to focus on \u2013 we mentioned that in December we plan to call the first tranche of the remaining amount of that first tranche of convertible notes. I think outside of that, we continue to be focused on debt paydown as well as growth in M&A activities, and then finally share repurchase. The latter of those two is hard to predict, and certainly the convertible notes, we've don't those ability to actually call those formally until 2018. And so that's why we've done it. But we will be opportunistic as appropriate within the market.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Again, just to clarify, that would be fiscal 2018.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","That's correct.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","December of 2017.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","That's correct. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys and thank you for taking my question. I guess, I have one question on just assumptions you're baking into guidance. It has a few parts to it. So I'll rattle through these and then I'll get back in the queue. The first part is, for new products, it seems like you might be assuming that new products contribute about 100 basis points to fiscal 2017 growth at the midpoint of guide. Is that about right?","Secondly, what's your view on the sustainability of NovaSure growth, given the benefit from competitive disruptions will annualize over the course of this fiscal year? Third, are there any major blood bank tenders that come up this year that we should be contemplating in our models? And lastly, how do you expect Panther utilization to increase above the $190,000 annualized figure that you provided in fiscal 2017 based on geographic and menu expansion? Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Doug, are you sure you don't want to throw a few more on that.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, I know. One question with 74 parts. Hey, Doug, this is Bob. I'll take the first on the new products. We feel very good about that. We mentioned the $10 million in Q4. We obviously expect that to grow throughout the course of 2017. And I think you had mentioned a 100 basis point, that's probably at the low end, maybe it's a little higher than that, maybe a 105 basis point maybe at the midpoint to think about that, and that's really driven behind the Affirm and Zika. Those are probably the two largest new products. Brevera will happen, but it's in the back-half of the year, and then certainly some of the virals and so forth in the U.S. will play a role, but again, the majority of that will happen in the 2018. So that's the first question.","And I think sustainability of NovaSure, we feel very good about that. But remember the formal withdrawal of the competitive product happened in our second quarter, so we expect to have larger and better growth in first and second quarters than we went out in the back-half the year. We expect growth throughout the course of the year, but the first and second quarters will be bigger than the back-half for NovaSure.","In terms of the major blood banks, you need to ask Grifols, those are their customers, and so we're not going to be able to be in a position to answer to that. And then in terms of Panther utilization, we do expect, that's one of the big areas that we're focused on, that's continuing to not only place Panther systems, but increase the utilization of the installed base. So I do expect that utilization to grow in line with the forecast that we had talked about for our molecular business. Thank you, Doug. Great.","Operator","Next up, we have Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Isaac.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. So, just want to spend a minute talking about innovation. You guys have clearly done a great job restoring consistency in the core business, but maybe a little bit less appreciated has been some of the new products you put out there, both the ones you mentioned and maybe some of the ones you haven't talked about. And so, if I look at the R&D spend here, it's up a good amount year-over-year, and just thinking a little bit about how to frame the way you guys are investing your R&D dollars going forward. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about thematically where you think your best bang for your buck is invested? And as we look over a multiyear period, how should we think about investment across the various divisions?","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, I think if you take a macro view at it, Isaac, we've dramatically overhauled really the R&D organizations at all three businesses and really proud \u2013 it's taken some work and it's all been happening behind the scenes, but really trying to break that grand slam or the boom bust ideas. So what we've got going on now is a lot of folks focused on both substantial innovation, but also incremental innovation.","And if you take our Surgical business as an example, we had launched NovaSure and launched MyoSure and never really did any product upgrades or anything through the years, just threw them out there and then watched eventually price degrade or whatever else. So, launching MyoSure REACH is a classic example of something that we're working on. We also just mentioned, we're actually launching an upgraded NovaSure product outside the United States. You can imagine, we'll be planning on bringing that to the United States once we get that through approval.","Likewise in Breast Health, instead of just focusing on the replacement for 3D Tomo, saying okay what are we going to do in the meantime and how can we leverage 3D? Well, the Affirm prone biopsy system, Brevera, there will be other things that we're looking at in that vein as well. And again, we wanted to put some points on the board before we start talking about the future, just as you know us stylistically.","And then the same as it relates effectively the Diagnostics business, there were things that aren't really in play when we got here. Turbo charged the Fusion, the development of the Fusion platform, which is then opening up that ability to do the same kind of singles and doubles as it relates to future assays and be able to broaden out the menu there. And again, those will be a lot of singles and doubles that will come behind the viral load programs. And we really hunkered down early on to push the viral loads through and across the finish line. Those have kind of been up and down, on and off, and we've really put a sustained commitment and started to feel very, very good about our ability in each of the divisions to be bringing a more steady stream of innovation.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, Isaac, this is Bob. Just to build on what Steve's saying. Steve talks a lot about people make a difference. And so over the last several years, we've really not only focused on rebuilding the commercial teams, but also the R&D teams. And so when I think about the R&D spend, we spend roughly 8% any quarter, it can change. That's probably the right amount. But I think right now what we've done is fundamentally, as Steve mentioned, change the mindset of the organizations and how they're going about actually developing products, linking R&D with marketing, truly having insight-driven innovation and creating that competitive advantage. We spend most money as a percent of sales in our Diagnostics business, less in Breast and our Surgical businesses. I think that is probably going to stay roughly the same, but it's really the makeup of it and the leadership making a big difference in terms of how we evaluate the innovation pipeline.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's really helpful color, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up for Bob on the financial side of the guidance. Can you talk a little bit about tax planning, maybe what's baked into your guidance this year for tax rate? And are there any opportunities that could translate to a lower tax rate that moves the needle this fiscal year or is it maybe still a longer term thing?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's still a longer-term thing, Isaac. If you recall, we didn't anticipate anything actually really starting to happen until 2017 and we were actually able to pull some things forward into 2016. So you saw one of the benefits in 2016 as being having a lower tax rate relative to 2015. And so with that, we still see that kind of steady improvement, but we have actually accelerated some of those efforts, resulted in the lower tax rate in 2016.","Longer term, we continue to evaluate kind of what that looks like. We're roughly on that point per year, I think that that's probably a reasonable way to model going forward, which in this 31% that we're talking about really is roughly a point better than where we were for the full-year 2016. So that's the way I would think about it. Isaac.","Operator","Thank you. And next, we have David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Hey, David.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. How are you doing? So couple of quick ones here. First, for Bob and then I've got \u2013 two for Bob and one for Steve. That'll be fast, I promise. So, Bob, just coming back to international for a second here, if you do the math, you go sort of from mid-single digit declines to mid-single digit growth, where you pick up 10 points of relative on 20% of your business. It's two points of growth. So it's a key driver of the improvement in 2017. Your comp adjusted growth for international though in the fourth quarter actually got worse. So just can you just help us understand why fourth quarter actually slowed comp adjusted, but you're confident you get that reacceleration in 2017?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, if you look at the kind of trends of the business on a sequential basis, that's where we feel confident. We knew that we had kind of an outsized number in Q4 of last year, which resulted in your comp-adjusted numbers looking worse. But when we look at the fundamentals of the business and some of those pockets, things like molecular, Surgical, the trend in the stabilization of our Breast Health business, which is probably is the biggest \u2013 one of biggest changes and then certainly we feel pretty clear about \u2013 we have pretty decent line of sight into the inventory levels now with the blood screening business. I think those are kind of the building blocks that were headwinds last year, that certainly will be our tailwinds going into 2017.","I think, Eric, as Steve mentioned, has done a tremendous job of really focusing the teams on the fundamentals. We've gone to the regional basis. We've brought in a bunch of new leaders there and I think they're just starting to get a hold on things. But I think we've seen good progress and good momentum going into 2017 on those couple of barriers.","David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and then an unfun question for you and a fun question for Steve. Stock-based compensation FASB changes, any impact on your earnings for 2017?","And then for Steve, fiscal 2017 guidance is in line, I think positive, but I think the enthusiasm for Hologic post our conference since September really wasn't about 2017, it was about sort of the view that this business can deliver not just one year of 5% and 10% growth, frankly, but several years of 5% and 10% growth. So I wonder if you could just sort of synthesize for shareholders what are some of those business dynamics you're seeing that give you that confidence that this isn't just one good year, but it's a few good years to come, and I'll jump back into queue. Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure, the stock-based comp piece, there's no impact.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","No material impact.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","And I think, David, each year when on a look out, I'm always far more worried about the year further out just as I was probably more worried about 2017 earlier in 2016. And every year, what I keep seeing is our teams just keep putting more new products in place, better people in place, and I probably feel better about the sustainability of this company at any point since I've been here. Because I think by the time we go into 2018, we're going to have more products hitting. We're going to have the international business that much further along. There's so much of what Eric's focused here during this year. What we've been doing in international this year is really putting the foundation in place that I hoped and wanted to be putting in place sooner, but we really weren't doing it.","So I think just fundamentally, we just keep getting stronger and stronger. The comps will be getting tougher this and that, but overall, feeling very good. We're going to have a lot of stuff hitting in late 2017 and into 2018, and that's one of the pipeline stuff will really be coming through.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, and good afternoon. Maybe one on molecular and an update on Breast Health, OUS specifically. I'm just wondering what the capital utilization rate of Panther is at $190,000? So just kind of looking ahead, and maybe where that could actually go, longer-term not only for 2017? And then on Breast Health, I guess the question really is, Bob, going back in \u2013 I don't know, some meetings, you did speak about the 2D opportunity OUS as being pretty substantial over the next several years. So I'm just wondering if we can get an update on that opportunity specifically.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. So on the molecular utilization at the $190,000, I think we had talked about previously, call it roughly 30%, it's probably a little higher than that now, maybe a third of the capacity and now, which means that there's still plenty of opportunity to grow utilization on the instrumentation. It's never going to get to a 100%, but certainly, we have room to grow. And if we look at Tigris as an example, it's up in the 65% to 75% range in those utilization. So there's still plenty of opportunity there from a molecular standpoint.","In regards to Breast Health, yeah, we are still enthusiastic about the opportunities both in 3D as well as 2D. I think the team has been focused and really looked at country by country, screening guidelines. How we work with not only our dealers, but also starting, more importantly, with governments and so forth and meeting some of the governments where they are. And the beauty of our 2D system is its software upgradeable to 3D. And so we have both the best 2D system as well as the best 3D system. And so that is still a strategy that we feel good about in the markets that we're focused on and an opportunity not only to place both 2D and 3D systems, but have that opportunity for upgrade over time.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC","That's helpful. Just a follow up there would be, is 50% to 60% the goal for Panther in terms of capacity utilization and is there a round number for OUS mammography units that is the target? Thanks.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","I don't know if we have a specific goal. It's really on how confident and comfortable the lab is. At some stage, they're going to want a second Panther as a backup. So rather than focus on a capacity goal, what I would focus on really is we have plenty of opportunity to continue to grow utilization of our assays and our upcoming assays in the pipeline on the existing Panther.","Operator","Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks and congrats on the nice quarter. I wanted to follow up there on Panther. Just was wondering if you could give any updated thoughts the individual sexual health products, how they performed in the quarter. And then, as time goes on, have you seen more cross-selling of the individual products? Maybe just as you look at the labs, how many are using one test or two tests or all three with trich? Any color would be great.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, maybe I'll talk to the last question first. That's one of the reasons that the utilization is growing the way it is, is the team, in particular in the U.S., has done a fantastic job of being able to sell the entire menu, and really done a customer segmentation that says, okay, if they've got chlamydia, gonorrhea, are they testing for trich? Are they testing for HPV? And that has really driven that utilization in the U.S., and it's starting to drive that utilization internationally as well, now that we have the viral loads. I will tell you in terms of growth rates for our major assays, still obviously the largest is our chlamydia, gonorrhea, CTGC assay that grew in the low-single digits. And then HPV and trich continue to grow in excess of market. So those are gaining share. We feel good about our ability to continue to drive growth in 2017 in those markets, as well or those assays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And one more follow-up on Panther. Just in international with the success you've had with viral load, is there a sense that you can say these customers now, a certain percentage are using viral load? And I guess what I'm trying to get to is obviously with the strength of the U.S. fleet, if there's a way that we can think about the commercial strategy here and what percentage we can think would adopt the test over time?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, so we're still in the early days of the viral loads. We just now \u2013 we launched those maybe \u2013 they had the full complement six, nine months ago, obviously with the tender-based contracts in Europe. It takes some time. I think the good news is the leading indicator of that, which is the Panther placements, is happening, but it's probably a number that we expect to grow into 2017 and 2018 for sure, but it's still early days.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. And I'll try to ask two relatively quick ones. So, Bob, the first one, I think the guidance implies about 100 bps of Op margin expansion, and you mentioned somewhat shared between OpEx and gross margin expansion. So that leaves about 50 bps for gross margin, down from roughly 140 bps this year. And I certainly understand the headwinds by international growing faster in 2017 relative to 2016, but still a decent stepdown. So, can you just talk to us about that stepdown in gross margin expansion? And then are you still getting a good gross margin pull from your three major divisions?","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, so certainly, we've got margins that are \u2013 we finished FY 2016 at almost 66% gross margin. That's nothing to be ashamed about. We feel good about that. .","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","I'd rephrase it, that we're still continuing to expand as opposed to a stepdown from (57:53).","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, exactly. And the international business certainly is a lower-margin business, which is going to impact some of that. And then certainly in 2016, we benefited from Surgical being outsized growth. We still expect growth in our Surgical business, but not at the level that it had in 2016. So there's some product mix in there as well. I will tell you that our operations teams are incredibly focused on continuing to improve the operational aspects of their business and we've established good pricing discipline. And I think there's still opportunities to improve margins; I think just perhaps not at the level of 2016, given some of that product mix that with had.","And then in the OpEx margins, it's going to be across the product lines or product areas. As Steve mentioned, we opportunistically look to invest in places like marketing and some of the other areas. We have the ability to kind of to move some of those levers as we need to.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, perfect, very helpful. And then just, Steve, maybe you. Just longer term on that Surgical division, is the right way to think about NovaSure sort of flattish once you cycle through ThermaChoice? And maybe more importantly, just to take a step back, if you could opine upon MyoSure. I mean, rarely do you have 30% sustainable growth and now to the point where you've got a product annualizing at over $150 million. So just maybe talk about the sustainability of why you're seeing that sort of growth rate and just the market opportunity that you see in front of Hologic for that product. Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Sure. I would say MyoSure has been probably our wonderful continued surprise that it's been able to generate, as you just said, two straight years of 30%-plus growth after a year in which it had looked to be slowing in the 20%-ish range, kind of really reaccelerated. We're not sure how high is up yet there. And I almost don't want to call the market, because I think we're finding more and more avenues and more and more opportunities to tap into other procedures and things. So we continue \u2013 even through the year, that growth rate has not yet slowed. We brought some news to it. And I think we see that as still being a real growth driver for us.","NovaSure will clearly come back to earth in terms of growth rates. But again, we're going to be bringing news to that franchise and we've adopted a mindset that we don't accept anything but an expectation of growth, even on older businesses and it's our job to figure out how to grow them. I am confident that team will continue to find ways to keep growing what is a great, great product. But certainly at slower rates, probably, once we get through the big competitive piece.","Operator","Next we have from UBS, Jon Groberg.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. I'll actually just ask one question. Steve, the capital deployment that was brought up earlier, can you maybe just talk about where you're at in terms of your team's ability to do more M&A? Whether or not you would be disappointed if you didn't do something from an M&A standpoint in 2017? I mean, it seems like where you're at as a firm, you seem to have a little bit more confidence internationally. Obviously, the core business in the U.S. is doing well, the M&A piece hasn't really kicked in yet. Thanks.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Jon. I would expect we'll likely do something in 2017. It might be very small. It might be more mid-size, not really sure yet. I think our still relentless focus has been always on keeping the base business growing at a healthy rate. And then I do think there may be come some opportunities. I would tell you, we'd looked at a lot of things, some of which we're patient on and we want to make sure that they make sense. So, I'm seeing a lot more. I would say, if you look at my percentage of my time spent with the divisions on business development deals today versus a year ago, it's a dramatic difference. And we're seeing a lot of good things and a lot of things that may not be making the full hurdle, because we're obviously being very disciplined as we go. But I do feel good that we're going to continue to be smart and sensible in the capabilities, have come a long way.","Robert W. McMahon - Hologic, Inc.","Operator, I think we have time for one more question and then we'll wrap it up.","Operator","Our final question is from Mary Kate Gorman from Canaccord Genuity.","Mary Kate A. Gorman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, Mary Kate on for Mark Massaro. Thanks for taking my question. You know, I was hoping to ask, have you begun to see more favorable reimbursement decisions in 3 Tomo as a result of the updated NCCN guidelines similar to Cigna? And along that line, do you anticipate new payors coming on next quarter as a result of payors revising coverage decisions in the new year? Thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Thanks, Mary Kate. We're certainly using the NCCN guidelines and the additional clinical data to try to drive additional private pay. I would not expect anything necessarily in the next quarter. Hopefully in the coming quarters, we would hope to continue to make progress there. But there's a lot of prickliness. Frankly, there's a lot going not private pay world right now, and this isn't necessarily getting the full attention that we think it should. But we'll continue to drive that and expect that over time we'll knock those barriers down. But I think all of that would be additional upside.","Mary Kate A. Gorman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Stephen P. MacMillan - Hologic, Inc.","Okay, operator, I think that wraps us up.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. This now concludes Hologic's fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. Have a good evening."],"10792":["Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX) Q2 2015 Earnings Call April 29, 2015  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Michael J.

My name is Holly, and I am your operator for today's conference. Please note, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, to begin the call. Mike, you may ago ahead.","Michael J. Watts","Thank you very much, Holly. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob McMahon, our Chief Financial Officer. Steve and Bob both have some prepared remarks today, then we'll have a question-and-answer session.","If you didn't already see our second quarter press release, a copy is available in the Investor section of our website along with a supplemental financial presentation for today's call. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. And finally, a replay of the call will be archived on our website until May 29.","Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that certain statements we make during this call may be forward looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Also during this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our second quarter earnings release or in the supplemental presentation.","With that, I will turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We posted another strong quarter of top line growth with faster growth on the bottom line. As a company, we've come a long way in a short period of time, but we believe the transformation of Hologic is still in its early stages and that we can continue to improve many aspects of our performance.","Now let's dive into the quarter. Compared to the prior year period, revenues of $655 million grew 4.9% on a reported basis and 7.2% on a constant-currency basis. Our growth was, once again, broad based in the quarter. For those of you who have seen the green red dashboard that we use internally, we're happy to report that all 4 of our businesses were comfortably in the green on the constant-currency basis as our commercial execution continues to improve.","In addition to a stronger revenue story, we are generating gross and operating margin improvements, leading to good earnings leverage in the second quarter. Based on mid-single digit revenue growth, non-GAAP net income increased by 15.3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 10.8%. We generated this operating leverage while increasing our investments in future organic growth, especially in Diagnostics R&D and Breast Health marketing. We believe these kinds of intelligent, targeted investments are crucial to the long-term vibrancy of the company and are more productive use of capital than large-scale M&A transactions.","Based on our results in the second quarter, we are again raising our financial guidance for the year. Bob will give you those details in a moment. But first, let me provide some strategic perspective on 3 areas that contributed to growth in the quarter: Genius 3D Mammography, cervical cancer diagnostics and our Surgical business. First, total Breast Health sales growth accelerated to 9.4% in the quarter on a constant-currency basis, a very good performance. Underpinning this, global sales of our breast imaging products, like Genius 3D Mammography systems, grew an even stronger 13.8%.","We had a robust quarter of 3D placements and have now installed roughly 1,800 systems in the key U.S. market. While this is excellent progress, we are equally encouraged that we are still less than 25% penetrated into our existing customer base and less than 15% penetrated into the domestic market as a whole, providing significant opportunity for additional growth. There are many reasons for our recent success with 3D in the U.S., including the JAMA study, CMS reimbursement and a competitor entering the market with an inferior product profile. But another factor is the success of our Genius marketing campaign. More than a branding project, our comprehensive marketing efforts reflect Hologic's overall commitment to the space and to our customers. Radiologists know that by partnering with Hologic, they get a better product with better clinical outcomes. But they also get an online presence with patients, a sales force that educates OB\/GYNs, reimbursement support and health economic analysis. All of these benefits help radiologist centers attract patients and build their businesses. This is the kind of customer alignment we were looking for when we revamped our commercial team in Breast Health, and it's gratifying to see their efforts paying off. We believe these efforts have clearly accelerated our performance.","Before I leave Breast Health, let me mention that we are neither surprised nor concerned about the recent draft guidance issued by the U.S. preventive services task force. By focusing on older data, the task force underestimated the benefits that newer technologies, like 3D mammography, offer women. The good news is that our customers understand these benefits clearly, as evidenced by the immediate reaction of various medical societies and patient groups. Hologic will continue to have a key voice in these discussions, but we do not believe that any potential guidance changes will have a material effect on our business.","Second, I want to highlight the progress we've made in cervical cancer Diagnostics. As you know, this is a highly competitive market, and we still face headwinds from the extension of Pap screening intervals. But despite these factors, our global cytology sales were basically flat this quarter on a constant-currency basis as domestic market share gains and international growth offset lengthening intervals.","We have long been the #1 domestic player in liquid Pap testing, and we believe we are now #1 in U.S. HPV testing as well. Our leadership is based mainly on a strong combination and differentiated benefits of the Aptima HPV assay and automated instruments like Panther and TIGRIS. It's important to note that even as we have gained share in the HPV market, our pricing has remained relatively stable over the last several quarters.","Before I move on, let me say that we were happy to see the publication a few weeks ago of Quest cervical cancer screening data. Quest study was probably the largest retrospective study ever in this field, encompassing roughly 8.6 million women and more than 500 confirmed cancer cases. The Quest study proved what Hologic has always believed, that co-testing with both Pap and HPV tests provides the best care for women. Specifically, the study showed that approximately 19% of women with confirmed cervical cancer received a negative test result from an HPV assay, and that co-testing provided a threefold improvement in the cancer detection rate compared to screening with HPV only. It's clear from the Quest study that both our main cervical cancer products can offer significant benefits for women's health as well as benefits to our shareholders.","The third point I'd like to make relates to our Surgical business. As recently as a year ago, this business was declining at a consistent low single-digit rate, in part because of high turnover in our sales force. Today, we have a full motivated sales team and are even adding clinical resources to support them. As a result, global sales of our NovaSure product, which had been in steady decline, increased slightly in the second quarter on a constant-currency basis. Domestically, NovaSure even grew for the first time since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and sales growth of our newer MyoSure system accelerated to more than 30%, leading to overall surgical growth of nearly 12% on a constant-currency basis. Although this growth rate benefited from an easy prior year comparable, we're still immensely proud of the turnaround that our commercial team has engineered.","So in summary, Hologic has come a long way in a short period of time. Our financial performance has improved more quickly than I ever imagined possible, and we're deeply grateful to our employees for that. In particular, a lot of credit goes to our commercial teams, especially in the United States, who have quickly stabilized declining franchises and begun to optimize our growth drivers. But as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we believe that the transformation of Hologic is still in its early stages, and that we can continue to improve many aspects of our performance.","Our longer-term priorities remain the same as those we outlined at the JPMorgan conference earlier this year. We are defining organic innovation strategies for each of our businesses and identifying the resources needed to achieve our goals. We are building a high-performance organization, one where talented engaged employees, achieved what others believe is impossible. We are developing a long-term international growth and tax strategy, and we continue to pay down debt, both to improve our operational flexibility and to boost our earnings over the long term. In some of these areas, we haven't even begun to put points on the board yet. So while we've made good progress on the commercial front thus far, we have a lot to look forward to in the future as well.","Now I will hand the call over to Bob to discuss the second quarter financials in more detail.","Robert W. McMahon","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to discuss our second quarter results and then provide our updated financial guidance. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis.","Let me begin by reiterating that we are very pleased with the commercial execution we are seeing across the business. This is the second quarter in a row when we've grown revenues faster than the 7% on a constant-currency basis, and this growth was again diversified across all 4 of our business lines. Based on a strong top line and despite the continued effects of currency, we grew EPS at a double-digit rate. Steve already commented on some of our revenue highlights, so I will discuss the other divisional sales drivers.","Starting in Diagnostics. Sales were $296.7 million in the second quarter, up 2% as reported or 4.1% on a constant-currency basis. Like last quarter, blood screening revenues grew strongly, up 8.3% globally based on the new business our partner, Grifols, won with the Japanese Red Cross. As a reminder, this new contract will boost our third quarter results as well, but the growth benefit will annualize in our fourth quarter.","Steve highlighted our strong performance in HPV testing, which contributed to overall molecular diagnostics sales of $119.7 million in the quarter, up 6.4% as reported and 7.9% on a constant-currency basis. Domestic molecular sales were particularly strong as use of our Aptima women's health assays continues to grow on our fully automated Panther system. We had a good quarter of Panther placements and are easily within reach of our year-end goal of 1,000 aggregate placements in diagnostics and blood screening combined. And equally important, we have a tremendous opportunity to increase pull through on these instruments with greater utilization and a growing menu of tests.","Although revenue from cytology and perinatal declined by 5.2% on a reported basis, we're only down 1.5% in constant currency as declines in ThinPrep sales continue to moderate. Our assessment of the cytology market has not changed. While we still expect structural headwinds from lengthening cervical cancer screening intervals, we believe the year-over-year declines can largely be mitigated by domestic market share gains and international growth.","Moving over to our Breast Health division. Sales were $255.5 million, up 7% as reported or 9.4% on a constant-currency basis. We are very pleased with the increase in breast imaging revenue, which was up a reported 11.4% and 13.8% in constant currency. Demand for Hologic 3D mammography continues to strengthen, in part due to our marketing efforts, as Steve noted.","I won't repeat the details on our GYN surgical division, but I will say that Skeletal Health sales were $24.2 million, up 3.3% as reported or 8.1% on a constant-currency basis as growth was driven primarily by our new Horizon bone densitometry scanner.","Now shifting over to expenses and profitability. We demonstrate a strong operating leverage in the quarter. On the bottom line, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.41 were ahead of our last guidance and up 10.8% versus the prior year. This increase was more than double our reported revenue growth despite increased share dilution as well as headwinds from a stronger dollar that reduced EPS by about $0.02 compared to the prior year.","Non-GAAP gross margin was up 90 basis points in the second quarter at 63.4%. Benefits from strong domestic sales, product mix and operational efficiencies more than offset the stronger dollar. Non-GAAP total operating expenses of $195.9 million increased by 4.3%, slightly less than revenue growth.","I want to make a further point here on the components of our study. As you have heard us say many times in the past, we are focused on creating sustainable organic growth for the long term. As a result, non-GAAP research and development expenses increased by 9.1% in the quarter, driven mainly by an increase in Diagnostics product development. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses increased 5.7%, mainly due to increased promotional activities in Breast Health around 3D mammography. Given our recent success in that area, we plan to increase our future investments in order to widen the competitive moat around our business.","In contrast to these strategic investments, non-GAAP G&A expenses declined by 2.8% in the quarter. These savings helped fund increases in R&D in the commercial areas and help deliver operating leverage at the same time. Specifically, non-GAAP operating margin increased by 110 basis points to 33.5%.","To round out the income statement, interest expense declined by 10.4% due to our continued progress in paying down debt. Our tax rate of 33.8% in the quarter was a little better than expected. And finally, our diluted share count increased by 4%, mainly because our share price exceeded the strike price on some of our convertible notes.","Before I turn to our updated guidance, I want to highlight ROIC and a few items from our cash flow statement and balance sheet that illustrates how our operational and finance teams are working together to improve financial efficiency. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $158 million and have generated $311 million in the first half of the year. EBITDA was $239 million in the second quarter, up 7.3%, and $941 million for the last 12 months. This combination of strong cash flow and EBITDA improvement has allowed us to improve our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. This ratio now stands at 3.6, and we remain focused on reducing it further.","In addition, ROIC was 10% in the quarter on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 170 basis points from the same period a year ago. In addition, accounts receivable decreased 3.8% and inventory declined by 9.8%. So good behind-the-scenes progress on multiple fronts.","Now I'd like to turn to our updated financial guidance for the full fiscal year and the third quarter. Based on our strong performance in the second quarter, we are raising our guidance. This guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates with the understanding that currency remains a significant headwind for us and other multinational companies. I'm going to cover a lot of numbers in this discussions, so I would encourage you to refer to our press release for clarity.","For the 2015 fiscal year and on a reported basis, we now expect total revenues of $2.60 billion to $2.62 billion. Compared to the prior year, this equates to reported revenue growth of between 3.6% and 4.4%, and constant-currency growth of between 5.8% and 6.6%.","We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year of between $1.57 and $1.59. This translates to reported EPS growth between 7.5% and 8.9% or 11.6% to 13% on a constant-currency basis. Our increased EPS guidance incorporates some incremental investments both to accelerate and extend our growth prospects, especially in Breast Health and Diagnostics. It assumes a slightly lower tax rate of 34.25% for the full year, but a higher diluted share count of 289 million for the year due mainly to a higher share price making some of our convertible notes in the money.","In addition, we are increasing guidance despite continued currency headwinds. Even since we provided guidance in January, the U.S. dollars has strengthened. So the full year guidance we are providing today incorporates an incremental revenue headwind of approximately $9 million due to foreign exchange and an EPS headwind of roughly $0.01 over our last guidance. Put another way, if foreign exchange rates did not move since January, the updated guidance we are providing today would have been about $9 million higher in revenue and $0.01 higher in EPS.","Now let's focus on guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We expect revenue between $645 million and $655 million for the quarter compared to the prior year period. This guidance reflects reported revenue growth of 2% to 3.5% and constant currency growth of 4.7% to 6.3%. So despite the fact that our comps are getting tougher, we are still projecting solid mid-single-digit growth on the top line for the third quarter.","We anticipate that this revenue performance will drive diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 to $0.39 in the third quarter. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 2.7% to 5.4% on a reported basis or roughly 8.1% to 10.8% on a constant-currency basis.","Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying we are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter of our fiscal 2015. Our top line grew more than 7% on a constant-currency basis, and we showed significant leverage on the bottom line, aided by our ongoing efforts to boost efficiency and control cost. As a result, we are raising our financial guidance for the year with top line expected growth in the mid-single digits and bottom line growth comfortably in the double digits. As Steve said, the company had come a long way in a short period of time, but we're even more excited about the opportunities ahead of us.","With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Maybe my first one is for Steve. Since you've been here, a pretty remarkable turnaround. And if you look at the various moving elements, obviously, 3D is off in a terrific start. It looks like the NovaSure turnaround was particularly impressive. As we look at this company sort of on a medium-term basis, right, how should we think about Hologic from a medium-term perspective? Because clearly, I think on the tomo side, you have the opportunity, it's pretty much greenfield, and I think that 85% opportunity, that leaves you room for growth. I'm more wondering within Diagnostics, HPV just said your #1. Like you said, NovaSure and ThinPrep, it has taken time to turn around. So how should we think about the rest of the portfolio? And what else can you do to sort of firmly put the company on path to mid-single digit growth?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, thanks, Vijay. We are very encouraged. Obviously, as you pointed out, I think, especially that 3D growth driver here now, our degree of confidence is higher than it's been in terms of really looking good for probably the next few years. We've got a superior product in that driving it. I think we are very encouraged, however, on some of the other piece of the business, you look, we said at the start, a little over a year ago, we wanted to stop the declines or slow the declines of the big franchises that were going down, which were especially ThinPrep and NovaSure. I feel very good that our sales focus in the United States, and then starting to look at opportunities outside the U.S. which will ultimately play out more over time, are seeing a visible change in the trajectory of ThinPrep. NovaSure as well, that one bouncing back to positive this quarter, feeling very good. I think what we're seeing is the sales team is really energized, reengaged. And we have leading products in markets that have probably a little bit more potential, still have some headwinds, but I think feeling better about all of the businesses. And the piece I throw in on HPV and really it's probably a broader comment on our molecular business is, I think, everybody was concerned, probably myself included, that once that Quest deal had rolled off and anniversary-ed, that molecular was going to be in for a rougher time period. I think what we've really seen is the incredible success of especially our U.S. molecular sales force that, while we were reaping the benefits of the Quest deal in '14, they were placing a lot of Panther's systems in the mid-sized labs and other labs, and that started to come through now for us, and I think really providing a little bit more of a positive growth engine for us. So I think we're feeling, especially short, medium term, feeling pretty good about the trajectory. Are we going to continue double-digit growth in Surgical? I don't think any of us could count on that, but mid-single-digit growth, I think we're feeling really good about.","Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Great, and maybe one for Bob. Bob, it looks like gross margin came in really strong, and part of this is mix. But as we think about sort of -- how should we think about the various moving parts, right, you have the mix, which is going in the positive direction, but I think what some people have point out was whether pricing pressure is within the Diagnostics piece, whether that could offset some of the gross margin benefit on the mix front. So could you just give us some color on how gross margin could play out?","Robert W. McMahon","Yes. So obviously, with our performance on the top line, that's helping us with the factory pulling more products through that and continue to look at efficiencies there. To your point, though, around continued pressures, we do see that as well as we look longer term for international business to grow, we will see some downward pressure there. So I think the best way to look at that is we've been pleasantly surprised around our gross margin's better performance than last year. I don't see any reason that it will dramatically change from where it is first couple of quarters here for the rest of the year. And I think that we're going to continue to look for ways to drive efficiencies to offset some of those things that you're talking about. So I wouldn't project significant improvement there, but certainly, look for continued kind of that 63.5-ish range kind of flattish GP as we go through -- go forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So on ThinPrep, you guys mentioned, I think, constant currency down about 1% globally. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about the dispersion for that growth rate between the U.S. and ex-U.S., just given that you obviously still early days in growing the ex-U.S. business. I just want to get a sense of how it's doing.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, Isaac. Basically, we were down very low single digits in the U.S. So a much better trajectory than it was a year ago and very modest growth o-U.S. Yes, still the bulk of that business is still U.S. As we start to build that internationally over time we would hope that, that number will get a little bit better.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure, okay. And then as part of that, maybe thinking longer term, if you could help us get a sense of your action plan, I would say over the next 12 or 18 months to expand the ex-U.S. business just across all the portfolio items there. What kind of infrastructure do you think you need to add? I'm just trying to get a sense of your priorities operationally to get the ex-U.S. business going.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, it's a great question, Isaac. Because I would tell you we probably have more -- I'm not going to say rebuilding but actual building to do outside the U.S., particularly as you look at areas like molecular diagnostics and even our ThinPrep business in some of the growth markets that we've identified as well as our Surgical business. So there's a little more building, and I would say really as we're thinking about the business right now, is probably recognizing in the shorter term, we're probably going to get more growth out of the U.S. than we imagined. While the international piece is still going to be, as you talked 12, 18 months, this is still going to be a building process. We're making the investments. Claus Egstrand, our Head of International, has been revamping the team. We still have some muscle building to do on the international front, and I think we'll be continuing to do that over the next year to really set ourselves up for growth. We'll be growing in the meantime, but I think getting to a healthier growth rate probably in '17 and beyond, so I think we've got great carriers in that -- the short term in the U.S. and then international carrying us much more beyond that.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So Steve, it doesn't come up very often but I think there's a pretty good opportunity for 2D in Europe. And maybe can you speak to that and kind of how you guys are trying to help monetize that business? And maybe kind of somewhat piggybacking off of Isaac's second question.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. Good one, Bill. Frankly, we'd probably say we think there's an opportunity for 2D, not only in Europe but frankly, most markets outside the U.S., and it's been one of the first things that Claus and the team have identified as more of a growth opportunity. And ideally, we could get 2D systems in, it would be upgradable down the road. Again, a lot of those are tenders. There's a lot of even looking at our dealer network and getting in place to be able to even better compete. I'd say we compete really well in certain markets, but don't have the full global footprint and strength that we would like. And that will be a nice opportunity for us. There's still a lot of the world that's going from film to -- to try to get them to go from film all the way to 3D tomo is probably a step too far and it's part of what Claus has looked at and said, we got an opportunity to go stepwise, just as you've pointed out. So it is an area of greater focus for us.","Robert W. McMahon","Let me just add, just to give you some perspective. Claus and team have really looked at, call it -- I'll call it top 10 focus markets. In those top 10 focus markets, there's approximately almost double the number of gantries that -- than there are in the U.S. So it talks about the opportunity. Now many of those gantries are still analog. And so Steve's point, transitioning from analog to 2D is the logical step with an upgradable feature that ultimately get to 3D as opposed to trying to leapfrog to a 3D. And so that's what Claus and his team are really focused on working to dealers.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Very good. And then just thinking, you're shifting a little bit to Diagnostics. Taking a look at the fusion system over the weekend, it looks like it could be very impactful in the clinical space certainly with the combination of TMA plus PCR. Candidly, Steve, it looked to us like a lot of the instrument development costs weren't even spent, so maybe you can speak to a little bit the investment and the timetable around the assay side of that.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. We are very excited about what that would bring in terms of the instrumentation. On the assay side, we are early stages in terms of really starting to do the PCR work because, as you know, we've been a TMA shop and our team out in San Diego was really refocusing in building that up. I think we're still at least a few years away in terms of having a legitimate assay menu. We would be thinking '17 and beyond. So again, we're kind of viewing it as we think about longer term. We got some great growth drivers near term, and then started to think about things like that to be providing the medium longer-term growth. I wish we were sooner, by the way, but that's one of those things that had been -- the instrumentation work was well done, and we just haven't followed through on the assay work as much.","Robert W. McMahon","And that's one of the areas, not necessarily just fusion, but when we talk about kind of the investment that we're making in the near term to fortify some of the longer-term activities. Our R&D investment, overall, grew 9% this year -- this quarter, and we would continue to expect to make investments, not only in fusion, but in the assay development portfolio, so that there would be a complement of not only TMA assays that we've talked about in the past, continuing in our virals, but then ultimately having a PCR complement as well.","Operator","And our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So interesting commentary on HPV. Share shifts in that area continue to be a pretty notable, pretty material. You guys are clearly doing well, and there are some successes with some other companies out there as well. Kind of prompts the question, keeping in mind we've seen a lot of progress made in decentralization of molecular, even down to much smaller labs than you guys typically target, and keeping in mind that even Roche has made some investment in areas like lab in a tube systems. Just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on the need to further decentralize within your portfolio? And more specifically, any active efforts to develop anything lower volume in molecular testing?","Stephen P. MacMillan","We really don't have much going on there, to be brutally candid, right now. We think there's still a lot of runway for Panther, but clearly that is one of the key questions we are asking ourselves now. But we don't -- we have not had an active program there.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, this is topical for me because we attended a DxMA meeting earlier today here in Boston. There's a lot of focus on the outlook for increased adoption of nucleic acid testing in China. And some industry experts asserted that they expect adoption to be fairly quick, and again, relatively decentralized in key areas, including HPV, if not especially HPV. There's been a lot of focus on this call about your efforts to improve your positioning o-U.S. I was just wondering if you'd be willing to provide some color on how you feel you're positioned to capitalize on this opportunity in China and what additional investment, strategic collaborations or, I guess, what role bolt-ons might fit in the context of assessing the outlook for that market?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, I think we feel reasonably good about our position in China, particularly as it relates to ThinPrep. We've been doing a pretty nice job there. On the rest of the businesses, we have opportunities. Grifols, our partner, obviously as it relates to the NAT testing and the blood piece, we feel good about Grifols presence and our partnership with them. I would say that I think that piece is going to continue to roll out slower rather than faster. We'd rather be pleasantly surprised if the market develops, so I'd say we're positioned there pretty well. But probably not ready to count on explosive market growth. It's a very decentralized decision-making process. It's not like in Japan, where we got the Japan Red Cross and you get the whole country overnight. China is going to be region by region. So I think we feel good about our position there. On any of the markets outside the U.S., I'd put it as best as good, not great, but with a trajectory of getting better. We feel really good. We brought in a new leader of our China business a little over a year ago, a very experienced leader, doing a great job there and very well tapped into the market.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Bob, Steve, came from a company where the ROIC was much more elevated than Hologic's. And I appreciate you talking about ROIC here and your commitment to it. So I guess the question is, what's an appropriate ROIC for this business? How long does it take to get there? And what is the intermediate target you aspire to? And I have a quick follow-up.","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, thanks, Dave. What I would say is, we're not in a position to project a specific target. But I would say is, we're aiming for higher than it is. But to your point, I mean, I think one of the things that we are benefiting from is a very strong cash flow. And this actually is a pretty efficient -- when the assets are utilized, I think more appropriately, a pretty efficient engine. And to the effect that we can actually drive 170 basis points of ROIC in a year, it speaks pretty well to kind of what we're trying to do going forward. Not to say that it's going to be 170 basis points every quarter -- or every year, excuse me, but we need to improve our return on our capital.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, very clear and fair. And then Steve, obviously, last quarter, we didn't see a dramatic amount of tomo upside versus consensus. This quarter, the highlights obviously is tomo upside. Backlog last quarter was very strong. Can you just comment qualitatively on the backlog you saw sequentially from last quarter to this quarter?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes, it's continuing to get even better, David. It's part of what gives us a lot of confidence in the shorter term going forward. The orders really for the last few quarters really looking strong in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question will come from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Maybe one on ThinPrep. Can you maybe give us a sense of what the tailwind could be from the Quest study? And how long that will take to resonate among OB\\GYNs? And then a follow-up there would just be on ThinPrep pricing. The company still has a dominant share position there. Do you envision at all potentially a price reset on ThinPrep down the road?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, why don't I start. On the Quest data, we're obviously seeing that getting out into the press. I think what we're going to see in the world of HPV and cervical cancer screening, I think, over the next few years, is you're going to have a lot of different data points and a lot of different messaging out there between HPV primary, co-testing, various messages and probably some ebbs and flows in the data. I do think where we feel very good about is when you really start to peel down, we think the science, the long-term science is on our side. As it relates to co-testing is, by far, going to be the superior outcome. We love the way we're positioned there. And by the way, at the end of the day, it's pretty inexpensive testing to test -- co-test versus single test in this space. On your second part of the question. The AUP for ThinPrep is really been flattening and our goal is to try to keep that as flat as we can. Bob?","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, I'll just say if it goes up, we will be pleasantly surprised.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about 3D in other way and maybe just any color commentary on the pacing of the placements throughout the quarter? And then just with the investments you're making in marketing and the higher outlook, what should our expectations be sort of on the ramp through the end of the year?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes. I think we just feel good about the trajectory, Jack. And like what we're seeing in orders, like what we're seeing in placements, and think we've seen a little bit of an uptick this quarter that's probably likely to continue here.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, got it...","Stephen P. MacMillan","I wouldn't expect it accelerating beyond where we are. This is pretty big move up, and we're going to start going to go into much tougher comps and all of that. But I think we feel -- it's a pretty robust business.","Robert W. McMahon","And I think -- yes, the one thing, Jack, on the phasing during the quarter because of the strength that Steve just talked about, we're seeing that in each one of the quarter -- each one of the months continue build working with our -- with the radiologists centers, the hospitals, our customers to place things. And so we're not seeing this huge hockey stick over in the last 2 or 3 weeks of the month -- or of the quarter. We're feeling really good about that business throughout the quarter.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Yes, that makes sense. And then, is there a way just to frame just the margin improvement in the quarter, how much -- and I know you mentioned Breast Health was favorable within that? Just how much of a contribution that was to the overall total?","Robert W. McMahon","Can you repeat the question, Jack?","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just looking at the improvement in gross margin for the overall company in the quarter, just breaking out within that, how Breast Health is?","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, well, I'm not going to get into all the components of detail. What I would say is our Breast Health business gross margin didn't improve appreciably as we are moving to more 3D as you would expect. Our 3D instrumentation has a better gross margin than our 2D. And as we shift principally in the U.S., we're enjoying the benefits of that. We're also driving some cost efficiencies on the actuals service side, which is also helping the breast business have the large piece. So our service business continues to grow at a nice clip, and we're able to manage some of the cost side as well that's helping our gross margin.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to go back to kind of some of the question earlier just about the sustainability of the momentum of the business. And I guess on the R&D spending, can you talk to the degree to which maybe you're pulling forward some incremental R&D? And it sounds like we should assume maybe a similar run rate to what we saw this quarter going forward? And then secondarily to that, you haven't commented on M&A last quarter, Steve, you did say, maybe you'll be looking at deals before the end of this year. So I'm just wondering, if you could comment on the opportunity set, gaps in the portfolio, any ROIC hurdles, things like that as you're looking at potential tuck-ins?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, Tycho. I'll start, and Bob's want to build on that. I think on the R&D front, I wouldn't say we're pulling stuff forward. What we are doing is really revamping the pipeline. If you think about what we had become a little bit as a company, was one that was driven a little bit more by inorganic growth. And so a lot of what we're doing is going back to what really made us great in the early 2000s, and frankly, what have made our legacy companies really great, which was more organic innovation. And I would say we're really rebuilding that DNA in the organization. So we're ramping up the spend and ramping up the capabilities, much of which really won't come through for another few years. So I think at the highest level, the way we're thinking about the company right now is we probably got a short-term pipeline gap. The positive is we got so much opportunity, some great products in the short term to carry us while we get the R&D piece put together. As it does relates to M&A, that will be another way to kind of continue to grow. Our teams candidly because we've got so many new folks, and we've been so focused on executing, I think we're probably still a little further out on the M&A front. And I probably almost would not expect much, if anything, this year. And when we do look at it, it's going to be about looking at things that can help us grow organically once they're brought in to the organization. And probably more what we have said will be tuck-ins. We will be looking at ROIC as well as accretion dilution, but very much focus on ROIC and on growth drivers to supplement what we, frankly, are building with incredibly strong commercial teams.","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, just to build on that. I think -- just to build on that for the R&D question, I think we're probably looking at the third quarter as being one of the biggest R&D spending for the year. We're taking the opportunity as we are probably a little ahead of where we initially had thought on the top line to take some of those investments, not only in R&D but in some marketing. I would say longer term, I wouldn't expect the continued 9% multiple years out, but certainly, we're taking the opportunity to do that. I still think and we've talked about improving R&D productivity, and that's still a core attribute that we're working through right now and actually getting more out with the dollars that we spend. But given that we have some opportunities in the short term, we certainly are building some of those capabilities that Steve talked about.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Steve, one of the earlier things you highlighted when you first came on was potentially the opportunity to take price increases. Can you maybe just talk about the pricing environment? Where are you in the process of potential repricing the portfolio? And maybe also specifically talk about mammography now that you got GE and Siemens coming in the 3D market, what are the pricing dynamics like?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. I'm not sure if I ever really said we'd be taking price increases, but that just we are going to be much more focused on being able to pay attention to pricing. And I think it's probably more not doing deep discounting, which, by definition, is helping us on the realized ASP. And frankly, I give both Bob McMahon and then Eric Compton, our COO, and Claus Egstrand, our Head of International, a lot of credit for starting to put much more rigor and discipline into what effectively and largely been a lot of deep discounting at end of quarters that we're getting rid off. And having said that, on the positive side, we have been able to put through a little bit of a modest price increase in our Surgical business, and we're looking at it kind of the both ways. We're looking at how do we minimize the erosion of discounting and where there are opportunities to take a little price starting to do that. Also, we keep nibbling on the edges here and fundamentally changing the trajectory. As it relates specifically to last piece of your question, Tycho, on mammography, we are seeing certainly our competitors being more aggressive on pricing. We're doing pretty good job in trying to hold the line. We think we got a superior product and don't want to get caught into a deep discount game with a competitor.","Robert W. McMahon","Yes, just to build on that, I mean, just to give you kind of frame or reference with the way you look at some of our major projects. Steve talked about it in his prepared remarks, HPV has been -- that pricing has been steady for several quarters. Same with CT\/GC, and we talked about ThinPrep as well. And so we're seeing that moderation of that the pricing decline, which we have seen in the past. And I think that's through a lot of the hard efforts and really focusing on price realization and value realization in the market. And to the point around 3D, our pricing per gantry is flat year-over-year, despite the entrance of a new competitor.","Operator","And next from UBS, we'll hear from Jon Groberg.","Jonathan P. Groberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So obviously you don't give the exact numbers, but it looks like you're close to a quarterly record in tomo. And I'm just curious, you mentioned you're pretty confident despite the U.S. USPSTF recommendations, you didn't really expect a slowdown there. Can you maybe expand on that just a little bit. We've got a lot of questions once those recommendations came out.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes, as it relates to the USPSTF, first and foremost, they've used a lot of old data. We would also remind you that they're putting it out for guidance. It's still to -- it's in the question basically the public comment period. But at the end of the day, I think we have so many radiologists, so much of the medical community. If you look at ACOG, the America Society of Radiologist, AMA, everybody is looking at, frankly, the more recent data and things like the JAMA study and everything else as well as their own clinical experience. And I think we all know, frankly, women who, if they had waited and followed those guidelines, would not be with us today, people in our own families. And I think those guidelines are pretty far out in terms of what is doing the right thing for human health, and frankly, very small cost to the total system. So I think the users of our equipment, and frankly, if you look at so many in the patient advocate groups and everything else, again, we feel pretty good that they're ultimately all on the same side of better science and a better product, and we happen to be in that space. And for those of you who know me for a long time, no, I'm not one to be dismissive of any potential hurdle on the horizon, and take these any hurdle as very serious. But again, I think we feel really good about our ability to work through this one.","Jonathan P. Groberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to be clear, it was view that regardless of -- I just want to be clear. It is your view that kind of regardless of what the ultimate final recommendation is that you don't think your business will be impacted? Or is it your view that when the final recommendations come in, the 3D will have kind of rightful place in those guidelines?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Regardless of how they come in, we feel fine.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up a little bit on your response to Bill Quirk's question about the molecular business, and you talked about some of the longer-term things, the PCR opportunities being off a few years, but you feel very good that the near-term growth prospects, nonetheless. Can you just maybe elaborate a bit more on what those drivers are? If it's more of the customers using more of the assays? Maybe if everybody was using all of the tests that are out there today, how much of a growth opportunities is that just across your installed base? Just something to frame the opportunity within the existing assay base.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure, Bill. I probably won't give you the numerics that you would like from a modeling standpoint but I'll give you just at a high level. The Panther placements, each time we're placing a Panther, what we love is that's going in today, it starts to come up to speed, there's usually a ramp to that, just as they -- they don't even necessarily go with our full menu upfront, some do, some don't. But oftentimes, they'll go in using just a few of our assays, and then our ability to keep expanding just our existing -- from the existing menu that we have. And then as we add menu over time, so that the utilization of those will continue to build out. But I'd say the core right now is really continued Panther placements. So each of one of these we place today is an annuity down the road and an annuity that will grow as the menu grows.","William Bishop Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","So the growth opportunity right now is still more just getting more hospitals to have to have labs, to have a Panther than it is that you've got a bunch of systems out there that are maybe just doing CT\/NG or just doing HPV but not necessarily doing everything?","Stephen P. MacMillan","It's really a bit of both. We have opportunity to improve the utilization of the ones we have placed, and we see additional opportunities for more placements. And to get more granular than that, if I've learned anything from our own forecasting, I know it's always hard for you guys to do models, is no matter what we forecast, the numbers always come out a little differently. And so to stress one over the other, at this point, I think we'd really see opportunities in both.","Operator","Our next question will come from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners.","Ravi Misra - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","This is Ravi in for Rich. I had one question on the backlog comments that you had made on tomo. In terms of the backlog getting even better in the U.S., are you still sort of winning on existing accounts or do we take that commentary to mean that you're making sort of competitive inroads? And then I have a follow-up.","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. Most of it is still on our existing accounts. As the market leader, we have the most on the existing accounts, and those are the ones, but we are getting the certain wins here and there competitively. The way I think about this market overall is it's probably fairly sticky at all directions, which is beneficial certainly to us, but we are definitely getting some competitive wins in there as well.","Ravi Misra - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And then maybe on MyoSure, that put up another pretty fantastic quarter. Could you may be tease out some of the impacts that you're seeing in the market, if any, from the morcellator warning, the black box issue?","Stephen P. MacMillan","I don't think we really see any impact there, given that that's much more of a laparoscopic morcellation issue and really does not affect our business. We're not indicated to win from that. We're also not hurt by the negatives, nor is anybody that's doing laparoscopic morcellation going to shift over to hysteroscopic morcellation. So they're really 2 independent events. I think really what we're seeing driving our business is we've added some clinical specialist, our sales teams fired up, and we've got a lot of good things going out there.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a question on your comment about Breast Health marketing programs and increasing the investment there. You talked a little bit on the prepared remarks. But can you talk about examples where you're going to be increasing the spending? And some of the examples where you've seen some good success?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Sure. On a high level, Brian, effectively what Pete Valenti, the President of our Breast Health business, as he came in, we've really ramped up the marketing programs, which is really co-marketing with hospitals. And the analogy I draw a little bit is, I think, a lot of the great work intuitive surgical did over the years. We're now both helping hospitals market the procedure, and I think they are feeling in markets, as hospitals start to advertise, it's creating demand from the other hospitals, not in the market. We also are doing a lot of kind of [indiscernible] over the web kind of stuff and using hospital locators and just a lot of I think very smart marketing that our team has developed. It's a competency we did not have in this company 12 months ago, and the team has really put it together and put a great program behind the Genius campaign.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then I might have missed it. But did you guys give what the CT\/GC growth was in the quarter? And if not, is it something that you can please provide?","Stephen P. MacMillan","Yes, we did not. It's low single-digits global.","Robert W. McMahon","Brian, molecular, as a whole, was about -- was up about 8% on a constant-currency basis.","Stephen P. MacMillan","With the U.S. growing faster.","Operator","Our final question will come from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick one and then a follow-up. You mentioned a little earlier, I think it was in reference to Breast Health, that you don't expect to see an acceleration from current levels. Just to get a little context, were you referring to the 9.5% Breast Health growth you saw in the quarter? Or was it more related to 3D specifically?","Stephen P. MacMillan","I'd say the overall number. Yes, we're going to be starting to go up against bigger comps. We feel really good about the basic trajectory of that business, but it's going to be a very solid grower. Demand is very strong, but we probably don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves either.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up on the Breast Health. Obviously, it's tough to poke holes in this quarter, but I guess the one area of softness looked to be international Breast Health, down 2% year-over-year. Can you just give us a little bit more detail as to why that was down? Whether it will be -- it didn't sound like pricing, was it just sluggish capital?","Robert W. McMahon","You can bet, we've poked a lot more than you will on that internal. I would actually say it's 2 things. One is our International business is actually disproportionately affected by the AG high-tech some of the discontinued items from a year ago that are actually still in there. And if you actually take that out, but we don't allow our businesses to do that, it actually grew very modestly in the quarter. The other piece I'd say just in a higher level is there is some lumpiness that happened with the distributors. And I think any quarter-to-quarter variations, we'll probably still see a little bit more of that internationally. And if one quarter pops up really good, and then the next one is down, neither one is yet a trend. It's going to be watching it over time. So I think we feel good about where we're headed, but that is probably the -- actually on our red green charts, that was our only red out of 15 data points that we track. So you found it, good job.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Joyce, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call.","Deborah R. Gordon","Thank you, and good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Call. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Friday, November 29; and a copy of our press release discussing our fourth quarter results, as well as our first quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance, is available on the Overview section of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also in that section is the PowerPoint presentation related to the comments that will be made during today's opening remarks.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Hologic during the course of this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement and our fourth quarter earnings release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures can also be found in our fourth quarter earnings release, including the financial tables in the release. [Operator Instructions]","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Jack Cumming, President and Chief Executive Officer.","John W. Cumming","Thank you, Deb, and thank you, all, for joining us on this Veterans Day today, where we're all thankful and appreciative of the men and women who have served our country over these many years to defend our freedom.","Today, I will first review our fourth quarter highlights then update you on the headway we have made on the initiatives we outlined in our last call. Next, I will share our key operating priorities for 2014 and the dynamics driving our business in this fiscal year and beyond. I will then turn the call over to Glenn for a detailed financial discussion.","Fiscal '13 was a year of significant change at Hologic. While there were many positives to report, we had to confront challenges in some of our businesses and, therefore, have taken the necessary steps to align our resources and position ourselves for the future. Organizational change doesn't happen overnight and fiscal '14 will be a year of transition for the company. The good news is our core products are the technological and market share leaders in their respective segments, which will help us power through a number of secular headwinds in FY '14. It is our objective to leverage our core franchises to drive organic growth and position us for the future.","I'm excited about our prospects, as revenue growth will return in FY '15 and continue on an upward trend. To set the stage for where we stand today, let's take a look at some of the operational highlights for the fourth quarter.","In our Diagnostics group, we continued to make strides in our molecular franchise. During the quarter, we made substantial progress laying the groundwork to capitalize on our agreement with Quest. To date, we have installed almost all the instrumentation required to support conversion through our women's health assays. Our agreement with Quest represents an important example of the strategic fit of Gen-Probe with our legacy cytology business.","In addition to Quest's new business, we added a significant number of new medium and high-volume molecular customers in the U.S. Aptima HPV has been an important driver of new account wins and this trend should continue, following our recent FDA approvals for use on Panther, including last week's announcement of approval of the Aptima HPV 16 18\/45 genotype assay. Based on the strength of our molecular franchise, we are confident about our prospects for additional large laboratory business, which, we believe, will be a mix of new contract wins and growth in existing accounts.","Our Panther launch continues to roll out successfully and, in Q4, was a driver of new customer wins, reflecting our focus on account conversions. For the fiscal year, we more than tripled our installed base of Panthers in the U.S., with our most prolific quarters coming in Q3 and Q4. We now have placed almost 500 Panthers globally and remain on track to achieve our stated goal of installing 1,000 Panthers by the end of 2015.","I'm pleased with our increase in the system placements in FY '13. Our strategy of locking up sockets will not only contribute incremental revenues in '14 but also set the stage for even greater volumes in the long term, as we continue to expand our menu of tests and share of laboratory real estate with our space-saving Panther footprint.","Before moving on to Breast Health, I'd like to comment on the announcement earlier today of Grifols' acquisition of the Novartis diagnostic business and how it relates to our blood screening business. We have been aware of the pending transaction and have had productive conversations with Novartis and Grifols. We have a longstanding direct relationship with Grifols, who has been a respected customer as part of our collaboration with Novartis. We believe Grifols' acquisition has a strong strategic rationale and will make it a powerful and focused player in the blood products and blood safety market. We're confident Grifols will continue the successful commercial execution of our products, as well as provide new opportunities for growth based on their industry experience. This business represents 20% of Grifols' total sales and therefore, we believe their focus and resources on growing this business will improve the long-term prospects.","Turning to our Breast Health group. 3D tomosynthesis continues to gain ground. We were able to build on the third quarter results and grow the business on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis. In fact, we placed a record number of 3D systems worldwide and in the U.S. and posted our highest tomo bookings quarter ever. Clearly, we are seeing the positive impact of recent peer-reviewed publications, which are helping to build both awareness and demand for the technology. We ended the year with the domestic installed base of just over 750 systems, more than achieving our stated goal of doubling our installed base during the fiscal year.","As you know, our success to date has been accomplished despite the absence of a formal reimbursement code. Notwithstanding this, we're focused on securing a code and concurrently are working to secure reimbursement from private payors. We continue to have success obtaining private payor coverage in our highly engaged and encouraging dialogue numerous commercial health plans, and we will look forward to reporting further progress on this in the quarters ahead.","In our Surgical segment, MyoSure remains a strong performer with high double-digit growth over last fiscal year and ample opportunity to maintain an attractive growth trajectory.","Moving forward, I will now review the progress we have made on the key strategic initiatives outlined during our last quarterly call. On August 5, I highlighted 4 initiatives that would represent my initial focus as President and CEO: first, conduct a thorough strategic business review; second, bolster our senior leadership team; third, develop a capital allocation strategy to articulate to The Street; and fourth, work with our board to implement new executive compensation policies.","We have made significant progress with our strategic business review, but we still have work to do. As I said on our third quarter call, our initial emphasis has been on positioning new organization to leverage our leading product platforms. Organizationally, we took steps to implement immediate short-term changes to gain manufacturing and other operating efficiencies. In correlation with this, we're beginning a multiyear program, working with an outside firm specializing in lean manufacturing and service delivery initiatives, which, we believe, will result in millions of dollars of savings, driven by state-of-the-art techniques and program efficiencies.","We have reprioritized R&D projects across the organization to ensure capital is directed to those projects with the highest potential returns. While most of these programs have been in place, we believe our reprioritization of critical programs will accelerate their commercialization and ensure disciplined execution that will drive shareholder return.","Furthermore, in conjunction with outside advisers, we are well into a methodical process of valuating each of our businesses. Our goal is determine, among other things, the overall strategic fit of each business and whether each is performing at a level that justifies its associated cost of capital. This approach is also informed by a range of financial considerations, including the valuations that could be secured for a given asset and the potential tax impact from pursuing a given path.","Obviously, this takes time and requires thoughtful analysis. I can report to you if we have made headway and have sold or are in the midst of selling some minor assay in our product portfolio. Please appreciate, for a variety of reasons, including competitive impact, confidentiality requirements and employee communications, it is premature to discuss any specifics. We will provide updates when this process results in any significant, reportable developments.","With regard to bolstering senior leadership, we have started by restructuring the organization on all levels. As a result, we have made a number of leadership changes in key areas. We've streamlined our reporting structure and have placed proven managers into critical roles, particularly within our sales and international organization. I am working closely with the board to ensure a strong succession plan is in place for all key management positions that will include further development of internal team members, as well as consideration of a highly qualified external candidates.","Now turning to our capital allocation strategy. Glenn will provide specifics, but I'd like to be clear going forward. We will not commit capital to large transformational acquisitions. Rather, we intend to allocate our excess cash flow to deleveraging the balance sheet as rapidly as feasible through both mandatory and discretionary debt repayments, as well as returning capital to shareholders, beginning with the stock repurchase program announced today.","As part of this effort, we are focused on return on invested capital as a metric to make more informed strategic and capital allocations decisions. As evidence of this, our board has approved new executive compensation policies that are tightly aligned with short- and long-term performance, utilizing return on invested capital as one of the key guiding metrics.","I'd like to now share our key financial and operating priorities for FY '14. Since assuming the role of CEO a few months ago, I have spent a considerable amount of time traveling with our new senior leadership team to many of our domestic and international offices. During these visits, we conducted town hall meetings and held intensive strategic and financial review sessions with team leaders. In addition, we have held national sales meets globally to gather firsthand market data, customer, economic and government reimbursement trends and exchanged thoughts on future product requirements to meet local market needs.","We also visited with clinical opinion leaders, corporate and national health care accounts and laboratory business partners. The input from these meetings, coupled with analysis performed in conjunction with the initiatives described above, has formed the framework to develop a comprehensive financial, operational and capital deployment plan for fiscal '14 and beyond.","Our operating priorities going forward are quite simple. We will focus on deleveraging our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders as prudent business sense allow. We will drive profitable organic growth through disciplined and focused investments and projects with the highest commercial return. We will seek constant improvement in expense reduction to maintain and grow the excess cash available to achieve our objectives of deleveraging and returning capital to shareholders. We will concentrate on improving ROIC and have linked our executive compensation to achieve this goal. We believe we have structured executive compensation to emphasize and incentivized shareholder returns, with ROIC as an integral component and incorporating a performance element in the vesting of equity rewards. And we will continue this strategic review of our businesses to determine if there are any nonstrategic assets that can be disposed of at an attractive valuation.","And finally, we're going to continue to build our leadership team and put the right systems and the metrics in place to maximize operating efficiencies. Now a word on fiscal '14 guidance and a longer-term outlook.","As I noted in the beginning of my talk, FY '14 is a transitional year for Hologic. However, we have products in each of our businesses that are gaining traction and demonstrate continual revenue growth. Our Panther system is increasing our market position in the molecular diagnostics market and will capture substantial downstream recurring revenues, as we continue to expand market share with our family of Aptima tests across all platforms. 3D tomo is establishing itself as the future standard of care in breast cancer screening and just posted record results despite a challenging capital equipment and reimbursement environment, and our MyoSure system for removal of uterine fibroids continues to enjoy high double-digit growth.","Counterbalancing growth from these products, there are headwinds that include cervical cancer screening interval expansion, lower-cost alternative therapies in surgical, shrinking volume -- shrinking demand for the blood volumes in the U.S. and modest price erosion among molecular diagnostics products. And of course, the macro challenges within the health care industry, like reimbursement pressures, capital budget uncertainty, also continued to exist. But it is critically important to note, many of these same forces that we face in 2014 will also impact our competitors. However, I truly think we are significantly better positioned to navigate these challenges and emerge even stronger with increased market share in our key segments. As we look toward FY '15, we believe a number of these headwinds will begin to subside, allowing us to return to top and bottom line growth. Specifically, we expect a stabilization of our ThinPrep business, as the interval expansion dynamic plays out and sets a new baseline for growth, driven by international volumes. We expect stabilization of blood donation volumes, allowing our blood screening business to resume growth based on opportunities in emerging markets. We expect stabilization in our surgical business, as sales force realignment, product enhancements and international growth increases revenues. And while we cannot predict the course of any macro environment, any improvement obviously represents an upside for us both domestically and abroad.","In FY '15, we expect tailwinds will drive top line growth and increase our earnings trajectory. Hologic's #1 market share position in all its key product categories is a distinct competitive advantage, which will help leverage our strong relationships and global infrastructure. When you couple this with the anticipated organic growth from the continued investment of recent R&D initiatives and the steady gains we are making in international markets, the result will be a continual increase in revenues. In Diagnostics, we plan to expand our menu of molecular assays to further establish the value and revenue potential of our instrument platform, especially Panther.","After 2015, we plan to launch our viral load assays, accessing a large new market opportunity that will leverage our current efforts to lock up sockets among key lab customers. We're also very excited about our internal development project to expand Panther's technological capabilities by adding the ability to perform PCR-based tests. This will greatly increase Panther's utility and will be a catalyst for further menu expansion. We'll also continue to register Panther and related Aptima assays in key new international markets, including China.","In Breast Health, we anticipate securing additional reimbursement for tomo from private insurers and health systems, which will increase traction for adoption of 3D as the gold standard for digital screening. On the development front, we are working on our next-generation tomo system, as well as new line extensions for our biopsy family of products that will make the technology more accessible in emerging markets.","To quantify this, what this means from a financial perspective, we expect to generate organic revenue and earnings growth in the low single-digits in FY '15; and in the years following, we expect to return to mid-single-digit revenue growth with earnings growth outpacing this. We anticipate continued strength in our cash flow generation, which we plan to allocate towards high-return R&D projects, deleveraging our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders.","With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Glenn for a detailed review of our performance and our outlook. Glenn?","Glenn P. Muir","Thank you, Jack. I will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter financial results, including key segments, balance sheet and cash flow details. I will then provide an update on the plan we have developed to deleverage the balance sheet and the return of cash to shareholders, as well as the executive compensation plan recently approved by our board. Lastly, I will discuss our first quarter and full fiscal year 2014 financial guidance. Unless otherwise noted, all of my commentary on changes will be on a year-over-year basis.","Fourth quarter revenues totaled $622 million, an increase of 5.7% compared to reported revenues of $588 million and 3.7% compared to non-GAAP revenues of $600 million, which reflect the addition of an $11.6 million purchase accounting adjustment recorded in the prior year.","On a pro forma basis, revenues declined 2%, representing a full quarter of Gen-Probe in the prior year and adjusted to exclude divested businesses, such as Lifecodes. While we experienced significant increases in sales of our 3D tomo and MyoSure product lines, as well as a nice increase in service revenues, these increases were offset by lower ThinPrep and NovaSure sales and, as expected, fewer 2D mammography system sales due to the mix shift to 3D. Foreign currencies had a negligible impact on revenues.","I will now review revenues result by segment, beginning with our largest segment. Diagnostics increased over 14% to $290 million on a reported basis and over 9% on a non-GAAP basis. This increase was due to the addition of Gen-Probe for a full quarter; on a pro forma basis, representing a full quarter of Gen-Probe and excluding divested businesses in the prior year, Diagnostics declined 2.6%. This is driven primarily by the combination of an 11% increase in legacy Gen-Probe sales, offset by a 13% decline in legacy Diagnostics. I would like to note that starting in the first quarter, we will be speaking to Diagnostic revenues and growth rates on an organic basis, and will no longer refer to legacy Diagnostics and Gen-Probe separately, as we have passed this anniversary and fully integrated the acquisition.","Within our legacy Diagnostics business, worldwide ThinPrep volumes were flat year-over-year. However, ThinPrep revenues declined over 13%, driven by continued volume pressure domestically due to extended intervals and lower international pricing. Gen-Probe revenues of $148 million increased 65% and 46% on a reported and a non-GAAP basis, respectively. On a pro forma basis, revenues increased almost 11%. In an effort to best reflect the ongoing profile of the Gen-Probe business, the following discussion is on a pro forma basis.","Clinical Diagnostics revenues within Gen-Probe, which are primarily comprised of our Aptima family of assays for CT\/GC HPV and Trich, grew almost 17%. The largest contributor to this increase was from the significant number of instrument sales to Quest as part of our new agreement. To date, we have installed almost all of the instrumentation that will be required to support conversion to our women's health assays. While these equipment sales had below average Diagnostics margins, they demonstrate Quest's commitment to our leading technologies and lay the groundwork for substantial downstream assay revenues. Capturing these incremental volumes will be an important element of our growth in molecular diagnostics during fiscal 2014 and beyond.","Panther assay revenues continued ramping up nicely and we look forward to a continuation of this trend, as the launch of HPV on Panther is still relatively early. We have now installed almost 500 Panthers worldwide. Also, blood screening revenues were up 1%. Overall, we remain pleased with the integration and performance of Gen-Probe, though the pace of incremental revenue growth is slower than our initial projections at the time of the acquisition. We remain excited about the long-term outlook for this business, especially as the Panther rollout progresses, as we further expand our test menu.","Breast Health increased to $234 million or approximately 2%. Primarily driving this increase was service revenue growth of 4.3%. Product sales were up slightly with strong global adoption of 3D tomo, largely offset fewer 2D digital system sales as expected.","Our Dimensions product line, which includes both our 2D and our 3D systems, represented 82% of worldwide digital mammography product revenues and 72% of units sold this quarter. Overall growth in 3D tomo revenues for Q4 '13 versus the same period last year was just over 50% and grew almost 9% sequentially off the strong tomo sales in Q3.","Due to the continued shift to tomo, overall 2D sales were down high teens and 5% sequentially. The increase in 3D sales outpaced the decline in 2D sales for the second quarter in a row. With a significant and growing body of peer-reviewed publications and increase in coverage from private payers, the growth prospects for tomo are robust. As evidence of this, our revenue backlog for all tomo systems is up 15% sequentially. Our 3D domestic installed base was just over 750 units at yearend. Going forward, we intend to provide our 3D installed base annually with qualitative commentary on the rollout during the year.","During fiscal 2014, we expect to ship over 500 3D Dimension systems in the U.S. As a reminder, there are 13,000 MQSA mammography systems in the U.S., of which 12,000 are digital, some dating back to 2002; and of which, 60% are Hologic.","Overall, we are very pleased with our progress in commercializing tomo and we continue to have high expectations for this best-in-class technology. We remain confident tomo will become the standard of care.","Now turning to GYN Surgical. Revenues were $77 million, declining approximately 4%. MyoSure continued its strong growth with almost 6% [ph] increase in revenues. This product is still in the early stages of its commercial cycle and we believe with our planned product expansions and the opportunities for geographic expansion, MyoSure is in a position to help drive growth in GYN Surgical in the future.","NovaSure continues to pressure segment results, driven by a combination of lower-cost treatment options and lower utilization. We remain focused on programs designed to mitigate these effects domestically, as well as on international expansion. In fact, NovaSure experienced a record quarter outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter.","I will now review fourth quarter non-GAAP performance for the rest of the P&L. Gross margins of 61.5% were down 70 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. This was below our guidance range of 62% to 62.5%, driven primarily by the initial equipment orders from Quest being filled sooner than anticipated, as Quest's interested [ph] in accelerating equipment placements in order to begin using our assays. There was also a greater-than-expected mix shift away from higher-margin products such as ThinPrep.","Operating expenses of $175 million declined almost $12 million or 6% and represented 28% of sales. Sequentially, operating expenses were down 5% and at the low end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. Operating expenses this quarter included $3.8 million for the medical device Tax.","In fiscal 2013, 1 year post the Gen-Probe acquisition, we achieved $70 million in cost synergies, above our initial target of $40 million dollars. We have now realized just about all of the expected 3-year $75 million-plus synergies and are squarely focused on driving revenue synergies from the combination.","As a result of quarterly revenue result at the high end of our guidance range, coupled with our strong expense management and reduced interest expense, net income was $108 million with EPS of $0.39, which was above our guidance range of $0.36 to $0.37.","Before moving to the balance sheet, I would like to discuss the fourth quarter impairment charge we announced in today's earnings release. As you know, we have a large goodwill balance resulting from acquisitions. Accounting rules require an annual review for impairment. In the fourth quarter, we completed this analysis and based on the combination of factors, including a full reevaluation of the company's existing product development efforts and cost structure, as well as a change in revenue forecast, we determined a portion of goodwill was impaired. The impairment was within molecular diagnostics, both legacy Gen-Probe and legacy Hologic Third Wave. As a result, we recorded a noncash goodwill write-down of $1.1 billion. Importantly, while the tempered growth outlook reduced our current valuation of these assets on an accounting basis, we remain extremely encouraged by the long-term growth opportunities that molecular business provides. We do not expect this charge to result in any future cash expenditures or otherwise affect the ongoing business or financial performance of this very important business segment.","Now turning to our balance sheet and other key financial metrics. We finished the fiscal year with cash of $829 million, up $263 million year-over-year and down $135 million sequentially. The lower sequential cash balance was expected as a result of various plan payments during the quarter, such as debt paydown of $216 million, contingent earnouts of $9 million [ph] , taxes of $43 million and interest of $39 million. We are very fortunate to have a strong cash flow profile, allowing us to generate over $600 million in operating cash flow during fiscal 2013, in line with the guidance we provided. In prior quarters, we have reported operating cash flow before taking into account the interest on new debt to finance Gen-Probe to illustrate the pre-financing cash-generation profile of the combination.","For fiscal 2013, this operating cash flow measurement was $690 million. Going forward, I will focus on the net operating cash flow of the combined entity, including the interest cost. For fiscal 2013, it was $630 million. Both of these measurements and their calculations can be found in our PowerPoint presentation available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Throughout the fiscal year, we took measures to improve our balance sheet where possible. Toward that end, in August, we announced the repricing of our Term Loan B, made a $200 million voluntary prepayment on this debt and amended the restrictive covenants in our credit agreement to increase our capacity for our share repurchase or dividend. We ended the fiscal year with total debt obligations of $4.9 billion and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 4.6x.","Now I'd like to provide some detail on some of the initiatives that Jack discussed with regard to capital allocation. As we have stated before, our #1 priority is to continue deleveraging the company. Over the next 4 years, we will have $1.9 billion in mandatory debt payments, beginning with the $405 million we will pay next month to retire our outstanding 2007 convertible notes. We believe the $1.9 billion mandatory debt payments will get us to our target net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2017. I appreciate this timeframe is further out than our initial target of fiscal 2015. However, we have moderated our forecast, which we now believe reflects a more realistic growth profile.","During this 4-year period, we expect to generate approximately $400 million in excess cash flow beyond mandatory debt payments. We intend to do 2 things with this excess cash over this period: first, we intend to further deleverage the company beyond the required payment. Subsequent to quarter end, we took the first step of incremental deleveraging by making an additional $100 million voluntary prepayment, further reducing our outstanding debt and related interest expense.","Second, we plan to use a portion of this cash to buy back shares of our common stock. In furtherance of this objective, we announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a $250 million, 3-year stock repurchase program effective immediately. This amount is the maximum currently allowed under our debt covenants, which was increased in August as part of our refinancing. We intend to repurchase shares opportunistically going forward, and we'll provide updates on a quarterly basis on our repurchase activities.","By the end of fiscal 2015, 2 years out, we believe this plan will result in a net debt leverage ratio of approximately 3.5x and longer term, after we have achieved our targeted leverage ratio of 2.5x and have even greater confidence in our cash flow outlook, we will consider the implementation of a dividend program to begin a regular return of cash to shareholders in addition to our stock repurchase activity.","In summary, we remain focused on disciplined investment in our businesses to drive organic growth and on using our strong cash flow to reduce our debt obligations and return excess cash to shareholders. To that end, the executive management team is highly focused on improving return on invested capital, or ROIC, and generating returns in excess of our cost of capital. Our ROIC for the fiscal year 2013 was 8.26%. We have provided a summary of our calculation of ROIC in our supplementary PowerPoint presentation. This focus on ROIC is fully supported by our board, as evidenced by recent changes to the executive team's compensation plan for FY 2014.","Under this new plan, approximately 1\/2 of executive equity compensation and over 1\/3 of their total compensation will be in the form of performance stock units, vesting at the end of a 3-year period and will be tied to ROIC as the key performance metric. Specifically, performance will be assessed by measuring management's ability to drive improving ROIC each year with minimum hurdle rates and requiring that the average ROIC over this period exceed the company's cost of capital. These metrics will be measured on an annual and rolling basis.","Our non-GAAP guidance expectations are fully detailed in the earnings release in our supplementary PowerPoint presentation. This guidance assumes currency rates consistent with the average during Q4 '13 and does not assume any share repurchases or divestitures.","With regard to guidance, I would like to first put the 2014 outlook in context by quantifying the impact of the 3 primary headwinds that we face. Our reduced outlook for ThinPrep, NovaSure and blood screening presents a revenue headwind of more than $60 million on a pro forma basis. While these products remain highly profitable, their net effect is to offset our positive contributors in fiscal 2014, thereby making overall revenue growth a challenge.","For the fiscal year ending September 27, '14, we are introducing revenue guidance of $2.425 billion to $2.475 billion. Year-over-year, this represents a decline of 1% to 3%. The decrease is expected to be driven primarily by the headwinds I just mentioned. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for Lifecodes, total revenues are expected to be flat to down 2%.","As Jack discussed in his opening remarks, we have a number of products that we expect to solidly grow in fiscal '14. However, this growth is more than offset by the headwinds discussed above. By segment, we are forecasting low single-digit revenue growth in Breast Health, more than offset by low single-digit declines in GYN Surgical and Skeletal; and a mid-single-digit decline in Diagnostics. We believe the guidance we set for fiscal '14 represents a realistic view of this coming year, and we expect to return to low to mid-single-digit, top and bottom line growth beginning in fiscal 2015.","Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. We expect gross margins of 61.5% to 62%, resulting from the expected decline in our higher-margin cytology products and the expected increase in mammography system sales, which have a lower gross margin than our consumable products. We expect operating expenses of $750 million to $770 million, relatively flat year-over-year. While we project that sizable increase in bonus, merit and other variable compensation, these costs should be offset by the cost-reduction measures we implemented in fiscal '13.","We expect interest expense to be approximately $190 million, benefiting from recent refinancing activities, coupled with a lower average debt balance based on recent and planned debt payments. We expect a 34% effective tax rate in fiscal '14 which is 2 points higher than fiscal '13. This increase is primarily due to the federal research tax credit expiring in '14 and a lower domestic manufacturing deduction benefit, as we migrate production to our Costa Rica facility.","We also expect diluted shares of approximately $278 million and EPS of $1.32 to $1.38. This includes an incremental reduction in EPS from the prior period of $0.04 from the increased tax rate and $0.02 from the medical device excise tax.","Lastly, we expect to continue to generate strong operating cash flow, maintaining a level of $500 million to $525 million. This is down from fiscal 2013 due to the reduction in earnings and an increase in expected tax payments.","For the first quarter of fiscal '14, we expect revenues in the range of $600 million to $610 million, representing a year-over-year reported decline of 5% to 7% and pro forma decline of 3% to 5%, excluding Lifecodes revenues of $12.6 million.","We expect gross margins of approximately 61.5% to 62%; operating expenses of $195 million to $200 million, which is 32% to 33% of revenues; interest expense of approximately $50 million and effective tax rate of 34%; diluted shares of approximately $275 million; and EPS in the range of $0.30 to $0.31.","In summary, we believe our guidance reflects a realistic outlook for fiscal '14, and we are committed to executing against this plan. Our renewed focus on ROIC and capital allocation, as well as our corporate strategy to grow organically rather than through large M&A demonstrates our commitment to further creating shareholder value.","And with that, I will turn the call back to John.","John W. Cumming","Thank you very much, Glenn. Since I rejoined the company as CEO, we have taken steps to position ourselves for long-term success. While we still have significant work ahead of us, we are fortunate to be a leader in our key markets and have a team of highly committed associates. Our goals and priorities are clear, and we intend to execute against these goals and position the business to return to growth in 2015. I do appreciate all of you joining us today and we look forward to updating you on our progress.","Now I will turn it over to questions, and I should say that David Harding and Rohan Hastie, who run our 2 major businesses, are with us today; and they will be on the call to answer the questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Bill Bonello with Craig-Hallum.","William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the ThinPrep business, can you give us a sense of sort of where you think you are in terms of the conversion to longer intervals, if that's a process that you expect to be complete by the end of fiscal or calendar '14? And then as part of that, maybe your thoughts on Roche applying for HPV as a primary screen; and if that's approved, what that might mean for ThinPrep trends beyond 2014.","Rohan F. Hastie","This is Roe. Yes, sure, happy to answer those 2 questions. So in terms of the interval expansion, I think we're still expecting to see a double-digit interval expansion within the U.S. for 2014. Again, I think we're still looking for some good share shift away from our competitors that we've seen this year with that regard as well. So I think our market share will increase in that time. The volumes will decrease within that double-digit-plus range for 2014. I certainly think by the time that 2015 comes around, we will start to see a dropping off of that decline, if you would, a much more stabilization within that market. Do I think it will be flat in 2015? Probably not, but it think we will have taken the majority of the falls in 2013 and 2014. And I'm sorry, the second part of the question was?","William B. Bonello - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Just your thoughts on Roche applying for an indication to have HPV as a primary screen and what that might mean for ThinPrep longer term.","Rohan F. Hastie","Yes. I think HPV primary will be not as prevalent [ph] within the market primarily. I think that the path is so ingrained within the gynecologist cervical cancer screening modality that migrating away from that to going to an HPV primary is something that, I think, we will be able to manage effectively within the market. We certainly feel that having a large physician sales force can certainly message the benefits of co-testing. I would remind everybody that testing with HPV and a path liquid-based cytology is the best clinical screening modality for cervical cancer, and we will continue to push that message within the marketplace.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shaun Rodriguez with Cowen and Company.","Shaun Rodriguez - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So last quarter, I think you mentioned that the Quest deal should result in a meaningful contribution for chlamydia and gonorrhea starting this fourth quarter with HPV may be taking a little longer. So you mentioned they've installed the systems but can you update us on the timing of the utilization ramp here, your assumptions for how this progresses over the course of 2014 and, if you could, the impact this deal will have on your pricing for the overall Gen-Probe business?","Rohan F. Hastie","Yes. So this -- I'll start with the latter part of the question first. There's no doubt that in terms of an AUP within this market, that Quest got some good pricing from what they had previously, based primarily upon the competitive dynamics of this marketplace right now. There are more people selling chlamydia and gonorrhea tests, in terms of the utilization Quest have started right now, switching over to our chlamydia and gonorrhea tests. So we will certainly start to see the pickup of that at the latter end of this quarter and Q2. Their HPV business will take a little longer to convert over so that contribution will take a little bit longer. But I would say that, that is slightly offset by some of the AUP dynamics we're seeing within this market from competitive activity anyway. So we're comfortable with the revenue growth that we're going to get from Panther. We're comfortable with the revenue growth we will get from Quest. So the deals that are being completed right now as, I think, our peer group companies have stated as well, are at slightly lower AUPs than what we've seen previously.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So just on the guidance and, Glenn, I know that you mentioned sort of -- that you would be looking at asset sales. So a, does the guidance contemplate any divestitures? And I guess, if you look at the guidance commentary within the slide deck, you have OpEx up next fiscal year and I believe that's based off of an increase in variable comp. I'm just trying to reconcile, if revenue and EPS is down, how should we think of variable compensation now being up for next year?","Glenn P. Muir","Yes. Vijay, so as it relates to guidance, we don't have any divestitures built in to that guidance today nor do we have any share buybacks or anything like that. So it's our current platform and programs that we have today. If we look at that operating expense line, we do have that flat to up slightly in FY '14 in our guidance. And we have had quite a bit of cost savings throughout the end of FY '13, but one of the areas that we have really skinnied down is the whole area of variable compensation. So when we look at FY '14, and we're not talking at executive level here, we are talking at the real management and rank-and-file level, we are reintroducing some of the variable compensation we didn't have in '13. So that's a piece of the increase that we see; and even with that increase, we're only talking operating expenses up slightly in FY '14.","Operator","And our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You mentioned low single-digit growth in 2015 plus, Glenn, in your prepared comments. Is that the type of growth you expect to see in the business, assuming no changes to the current portfolio? And if so, what kind of health care utilization environment you think you need to have as a backdrop in order to hit that growth?","Glenn P. Muir","Right. So in the prepared guidance, we're talking about low to mid-single-digit growth back in FY '15 on both the top and bottom line. So we are looking at FY '14 as a transformational type of year. We are retrenching a big part of this is because of the market environment we see out there. So when we look out to FY '15, there is an expectation that things are going to stabilize throughout all of FY '14, and we will begin to see growth with some of these new products emerging. So we've been talking about 3D tomo for some time. I talked a little bit about the numbers on systems that we're currently placing. We're getting tremendous interest in that product line. When we look in the Diagnostics group, the Panther machines are just now going out the door. And even for Quest, they didn't have any meaningful sales in Q4, but they certainly will in FY '14. So I think we're getting in place the pieces that we need for that FY '15 growth. But I think the problem we have in '14 is more the headwinds. It really is, as is relates to ThinPrep, the expansion on the interval; as it relates to NovaSure, it's that whole utilization as there are some lower-cost alternatives. And that will moderate. We do believe that will moderate in '15 and beyond. I don't know, Jack, or -- did you have anything to add on that or...","John W. Cumming","No, no, no. No, I'm with you on that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups actually to the prior question, just first on divestitures. You brought up the challenges. You fairly described, I guess, is secular [ph] . But as we think about your options with divestitures, would you be willing to divest declining businesses if it's dilutive to earnings? And then as a follow-up, on sales and marketing, you highlighted some of the cost falls [ph] . Can you give us a sense as to where those occurred? It was a little bit better from a sales and marketing perspective than what we are modeling in terms of cost cuts.","John W. Cumming","Yes. I think that -- Glenn and I will probably both handle that. I think for your first question relative a nonperforming asset, would we sell it, you said, if it was dilutive and the answer is yes. Glenn, on the other one?","Glenn P. Muir","I was focused on the first one, too. I think -- and yes, Tycho, the thing is on most of our operating segments, any one of them would be dilutive to earnings. I mean we have great earnings power in each of those segments now, so we appreciate that. What we have to look at is the value and the potential we would get out and how we would redeploy that cash. So we're looking very hard at that right now. Nothing's off the table, but it is a pretty complex thought process to go through on cash flow and taxes, and we want to get it right. And the second part of the question, Jack, was...","John W. Cumming","Tycho, please repeat it again.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Your sales and marketing costs came in lower than we were modeling, and as you highlighted, kind of at the lower end of guidance, maybe just talk to some of the steps you've taken in terms of sales and marketing costs.","John W. Cumming","Well, I'm going to pass it over to, I think, David and Roe, because we have streamlined and we've kind of realigned the forces. So David, you want to go first?","David P. Harding","Yes. We -- this is David Harding. We have definitely taken a hard look at all of our sales and marketing expenses, reflective of the more modest revenue growth rates and have restructured a number of things both on the Surgical and Breast Health side of the business. We've taken out layers of management. We've gotten more efficient in the way that we deploy our marketing expenditures and generally are trying to do more with less at this stage.","Rohan F. Hastie","Yes. And I would echo that, Tycho, seeing the same on the Diagnostic side of the business. We definitely pushed out some of our commercialization efforts. We've just paid very close attention to conference attendance, conference spending, just general marketing spend and likewise, in terms of the overall sales. We're making sure that we are appropriately sized for reach and touch to get the maximum benefit from that sales force. So it's been a management issue just making sure that we keep a close eye on those costs and utilize that cash as effectively as possible.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","James Francescone - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually James in for David. First, Jack, a question about your role in the business. What can you tell us about your commitment to stay with the business for, not only the upcoming transition year, but also for 2 to 3 years beyond that?","John W. Cumming","Well, since David's not there, I should ask you about his. But I had a feeling that you would ask that since that's one of his favorite ones. Look, until someone tells me differently, I am the permanent CEO here; and I want to make it clear. I'm committed to rebuilding, refocusing the company, address the concerns of all the shareholders, the team members and our customers, who I'm visiting with on a weekly basis. So I think everything I've discussed reflects that level of personal commitment and my focus for delivering those results. So the board has asked me to concentrate on restructuring our business and achieving the strategic and operational goals, which we're committing to today. So I don't know how I can make it any clearer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Matson with Needham & Company.","Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess I just wanted to ask about, in the mammography market, I guess GE got their CE mark for their tomosynthesis product; and I guess, they're selling in Europe now. So I was wondering if you've seen that in the market, if it's had an impact on your sales outside the U.S.? And then additionally, just what are your thoughts on, when and if that product comes to market in the U.S., does that -- have you accounted for that in your guidance?","David P. Harding","Yes, this is David. I'm happy to take that question. We have seen the unit in the market in Europe, and there are few installations around. We are anticipating that GE will launch in the United States at some point. We are not exactly sure when, but we do anticipate it being within this fiscal year, probably sooner rather than later. We have certainly accounted for that in our projected growth rates, but we are very confident that our product is clinically superior. We've got excellent clinical results proven through large numbers of studies of many, many patients; and we are very, very happy with the way that our system is performing. Again, we will -- we welcome competition in this market and have fully anticipated it.","John W. Cumming","Yes. I would add to that, that this is fully baked into our numbers. We expect GE -- you always expect at RSNA, they're going to announce some approval, so we've anticipated sooner than later. But if you just look at the market itself being a replacement market and the fact that we have 60%, 65% of the U.S. market, GE's strategy is not just go out and say, \"Let's see how many of the Hologic and Siemens sites we can go sell our product to.\" They're going to go to their installed base, which is sizable, and they're going to -- because I would assume that they have a demand -- pent-up demand from not being on the market, so they're going to attack those first. Internationally, they've been out there a very long time with this new product, so it's nothing new to us. I think it's a positive inasmuch as -- I think it might reset some of their pricing because until they've had it, they've priced their 2D system extremely low and maybe this will bring a sense of reality on pricing. Also, I believe in the U.S., it only can help us with them talking about the benefits of tomosynthesis and putting their marketing dollars behind it; and I welcome their marketing dollars, talking about the technology in and by itself. The fact that, like David said, we have over 100 papers written on tomo in almost every major company. We are working with the societies on tomo studies. So we are so well positioned to continue to drive share gains over the next 5 years with this product and subsequent products that we're going to bring to market.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","My question is on Gen-Probe and the revenue synergies there. You've talked about maximizing those and the pace being slower than you expected. So can you talk specifically, how do you fix that specific steps you're talking about there? And the secondly, on the write-down of the asset, I understand on the molecular side, some Third Wave stuff potentially, but you guys are very positive on the rest of the molecular diagnostics business. So can you talk about specifically what changed relative to your original expectations, given how positive you are, sounding like on the future of that business?","John W. Cumming","When you are talking about the pace slowing down, you meant maybe the uptake. I would assume you meant the uptake in the assays, which certainly has been a factor, especially that we have now installed the system in Quest; and as Roe has talked about, it could be a 6-, 9-month process just to get HPC-certified in these labs. But between Roe and Glenn, I think they can talk about the write-down and the impact on that.","Rohan F. Hastie","Yes, I think we're relatively comfortable with where the revenue synergies are, quite frankly. Again, I think that, as we've stated time and time again, this Quest deal would never have happened had Hologic and Gen-Probe not been combined. And I think we're seeing that portfolio component, that portfolio sale being replicated at all segments of the market right now. We're going again [ph] , and we're talking about ThinPrep, CT\/GC, Trichomonas, HPV and that whole portfolio, women's health testing is really starting to have traction within the marketplace. And that, indeed, is being replicated internationally. We've had a couple of very big closes within the United Kingdom over the past 6 months, really, that again, have been portfolio of women's health products that we're offering. So in that regard, the revenue synergies, I think, we are comfortable with. And likewise and then again, with that physician sales force component has been tremendously important for us in terms of generating awareness of Aptima HPV, generating awareness of nucleic acid testing for Trichomonas right now. I think that has made a big, big contribution to us. I think what has happened, though, is some of the AUP pressures that we've seen again from the competitive activity within the market right now for our competitors trying to hold onto business or compete for business has certainly driven down some of the AUPs that we've been seeing. And then also, we had a little bit of a slow start to FY '13 as well, which did not contribute.","John W. Cumming","Yes. I would add one more thing, and that is as far as the synergies go, we exceeded what we said we would do and we did it in a much shorter period of time. The other thing that Roe didn't touch upon, which is an interesting dynamic that's happening now internationally, governments are -- when they're looking at programs for women, especially in the screening side, they're looking at cervical cancer screening and they're looking at mammography screening. And we've seen, and we're having conversations with certain governments relative to combining our mammography with cervical cancer testing, and we find ourselves in a very unique position to do that. And whether it becomes an HPV or it becomes a Pap test, we're -- we can play in both areas and bring the best mammography [ph] to the market as a combination in a tender.","Rohan F. Hastie","I'm sorry. I should add there. So you are correct that the write-down more due to Third Wave and Gen-Probe, and as we said, we really think this is a little bit of an accounting exercise. We have a slight change in the outer year growth rates, reflective of a bit of a slow start in FY '13.","Operator","And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, can you clarify your fiscal '15 guidance? Are you saying low single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit EPS growth? That's my first question. And then second, can you give us an update on government reimbursement for tomo? I know, Jack, on the last call, you said you had been going down to D.C. a lot. Any up there would be -- any update would be great.","John W. Cumming","Glenn, why don't you handle -- I'll handle reimbursement side and you...","Glenn P. Muir","Yes. As it relates to FY '15, Glenn -- I mean, we believe after FY '14, there will be a return to growth. So when we look at our revenues and our earnings, we believe that both top and bottom line will be low to mid-single-digit growth.","John W. Cumming","Okay. And let me talk about reimbursement for a minute. We -- first of all, we had a little problem going to Washington. Somehow when we got there, everybody had left town because they'd shut it down. But now that they are kind of slowly coming back, we continue to have conversations with CMS. We continue to work kind of a three-pronged attack there, dealing with the legislative side, the private payor side and CMS. And I think we have to work all 3. CMS is kind of constrained in that there is so much going on right now with the ObamaCare. I'm not sure that they're in a position to make decisions relative to a lot of the different projects before them right now. But we have been very encouraged by the legislators that have taken a very active role in dealing and talking to CMS for us, because the fact they are -- they believe, and have read all of the documentation. They have talked with physicians who have come to Washington about the benefits of tomo from just a pure catching cancers early to the economic benefits. And hopefully, we can get CMS to kind of move off the dime and do something here. But there is certainly some frustration on our side. But on a today basis, what we can do is continue to push on the private payor side; and that's where we're putting a great deal of our energies now because that is, whether it be some of the larger ones on a regional basis that are paying $30 to $70 for a mammogram right now or the fact that we've had a group in Florida right now, approve a plan for reimbursement, specifically for tomo. These are all very positive things. It's going to take time in CMS side, and we cannot wait for them. So we have to continue to push on the payor side and continue to work the legislative side and hopefully, CMS kind of comes up for air. And we're working with ACR. We've talked with AMA, so we're trying to hit all of the levers that we can on this.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just have 2 quick ones and maybe the first one is a follow-up to the last comment. Jack, do you think you have a notable commercial win on the reimbursement side for tomo in 2014?","John W. Cumming","I really can't answer that. I don't know. I think the win that I know about is the one-at-a-time insurance companies that we're picking off. I mean, we have a team out there talking on them. As far as CMS goes, I think I said this in the last call, I gave up long ago trying to bet on what's going to happen with the government agency. So I got -- I have to unfortunately defer to that, but we'll continue to push the legislative side in the meantime and push with CMS. We're hoping. I guess that's all we can say at this point.","David P. Harding","And this is David, just to add. I think the important thing to note is that about 60% of the institutions that are submitting claims to their insurance companies are, in fact, getting reimbursed at these incremental levels that Jack talked about, between $30 and $70. So there is already good payment history that is occurring even without major reimbursement policy decisions at this stage.","John W. Cumming","And you have a second question or is that the question?","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Another question. You talked earlier about the stabilization in the pap business as we enter 2015. I think you also alluded to NovaSure. Can you just talk to, big picture, what's going to unwind from '14 to '15 that will allow that high-margin business to stabilize?","John W. Cumming","Okay. I'll let David handle certainly on the surgical side. But I mean, as I did say on my talk, we have made some changes in leadership on the surgical aside and added some very talented people. We have also looked at how we're selling and we've looked at that sales force and how it's organized today, and we think that, that is going to have an impact in driving future sales. But David, go ahead.","David P. Harding","Yes. On the NovaSure side, I think we've mentioned to you earlier that there are lower-cost alternatives that are out there in the form of hormone-eluting IUDs and the like and those have been taking some share away from NovaSure. But we do see that kind of bottoming out in the 2014 period. We also see our international business continuing to grow and offset some of that. So that's why we believe that in addition to our sales force activities in getting more effective on the sales force side, we will see it kind of flatten out and then start to stabilize a little bit more in 2015.","John W. Cumming","And on the ThinPrep side, Roe, do you want to handle that?","Rohan F. Hastie","Yes. Just -- I just think that the penetration of adoptions will -- for last year and this year is when we will see the maximum amount of adoption, and we certainly expect that to fall off as that rate becomes much more fully penetrated within the market, and we predict that, that will be within the 2015 period. Again, to reiterate, I think we will still see some margin expansion within that timeframe. I just don't think that it will be at the rates that we've seen over 2013 and 2014.","John W. Cumming","I guess I should add to surgical. I mean, we'll be introducing product enhancements, new products and that sales force realignment, we believe, is going to be a key to the growth -- to the return of growth on the NovaSure side.","Operator","And our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink Swann.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Jack, just on that last point, just can you maybe clarify how much of the return to low to mid- single-digit growth in fiscal '15 is contingent upon kind of fact as you feel like you have control over versus underlying improvement in the market? It sounded like a blend there, in Surgical, for example, that you have some new products and the sales force alignment; and in ThinPrep, it's a little bit more cervical interval expansion. Can you get to low and mid-single digits if some of the macro factors don't turn?","John W. Cumming","I think we can. Unless we -- I mean we have really vetted these numbers in coming up with our estimates, we thought that they were very realistic for this year. We weren't sandbagging. We looked at the process last year. We looked at the process this year. We changed the process from certainly a bottoms-up review, and we needed to stress test that several times. When you look at the tomo, when you look at the uptake in assays, when you look at the incremental business that's going to come from Quest, when you look at what's going to happen on the new biopsy side, we see there's all very good positives to help drive this growth. We also have 3,000 plus Selenias out there, 7 to 10 years old that need to get replaced and they're going to start really getting replaced from the 2015 on, so we believe that those are also positive. Those secular kind of headwinds of the interval on the ThinPrep side. We really -- we've gone heavy on the discount this year and we believe it is going to start to flatten out, which then, of course, we're coming from a different base, which will allow the other products that are growing to kind of offset that and emerging to those single digits we talked about.","Operator","And our final question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jack, as this discussion of the longer-term growth rate of the company has been beaten around, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the leverage in the business. Because it doesn't sound like when you talk about '15, '16, there's much in terms of leverage from the top to the bottom line. And maybe put that into context of some of the improvements you're trying in supply chain. And then secondly, for fiscal '14, what is the overseas Diagnostics business going to grow in the context of overall Diagnostics down mid-single-digits?","John W. Cumming","Okay. I think we have a variety of people who'll be handling this one. I think Glenn will get involved also. Certainly, the EPS is going to outpace revenue. And from a standpoint of just international and general, I think I'll let David handle that because that's kind of a very bright spot for us right now. It has helped to offset the decline in the U.S., certainly of ThinPrep and of Surgical, and we just completed it. It's very timely because Roe, myself and David just came back from our international sales meeting overseas where we had all of our people in from the Diagnostics and the Surgical side. So we can kind of report back to you on that. David?","David P. Harding","Yes. So on the international side for the Diagnostics piece, in particular, we expect modest growth that will help to offset some of the domestic decline on the Surgical side of the business, again, growing very rapidly, good double-digit growth there; and again, on the Breast Health side, growing solidly in the sort of mid-single-digits range. So the international business will grow. It won't completely offset all of the declines in the U.S. on the domestic side to be sure but -- and nor will in the Surgical side. But it is a very important component of our future growth in all aspects of the business.","John W. Cumming","Roe?","Rohan F. Hastie","Yes. And I mean, I would add from the Diagnostics side that there remain continued opportunities for us in both ThinPrep and HPV as different countries are evaluating, expanding their cervical cancer screening offering. So whether it's an HPV primary, with a reflex cytology or lead with cytology with a reflex HPV, we feel there's an opportunity there for us. I think from the molecular side, that Panther platform is -- the market is much more fragmented within Europe and other areas of the world for that matter, but the Panther plays exceedingly well within those market segments, and I think we're just starting to see some really good traction with instruments placements for Panther there as well. And then as the other element, which we don't tell much about, is we're certainly hopeful of strong international blood screening opportunities for us for countries that are looking at instituting blood screening for donations or, indeed, some potential share shift internationally as well. So I think we're feeling very optimistic about 2015 from the diagnostic sector.","John W. Cumming","And from an organizational standpoint, the international infrastructure is really in place. I mean, we're making a few adds, certainly, to the management right now. But service efficiencies, I think, are going to start to come online in '14, especially on the Gen-Probe side as we put these programs together and trying to do cross-training. And there's going to be manufacturing changes in our capital equipment, that is all part of this remanufacturing delivery of our service, delivery of our application service. So we're making a huge push in that area, which we expect to start seeing the benefits in '15.","Operator","Thank you, and that is all the time we have for questions today.

My name is Kelsey, and I'm your operator for today's conference. Today's conference call is also being recorded and all the lines have been placed on mute.","I would now like to introduce Deborah Gordon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the conference. Please go ahead, Ms. Gordon.","Deborah R. Gordon","Thank you, Kelsey. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Call. The replay of this call will be archived on our website through Friday, August 23, and a copy of our press release discussing our third quarter results, as well as our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 guidance, is available in the Overview section of the Investor Relations section of our website. Also in that section is the PowerPoint presentation related to the comments that will be made during today's opening remarks.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements made by Hologic during the course of this call may constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by such statements. Such factors include those referenced in our Safe Harbor statement in our third quarter fiscal 2013 earnings release and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures can also be found in our third quarter earnings release, including the financial tables in the release.","[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Jack Cumming, President and Chief Executive Officer.","John W. Cumming","Well, thank you very much, Deb, and thank you all for joining us today. Joining me here in Bedford is Glenn Muir, our Executive VP and CFO; Dr. Rohan Hastie, our Group Vice President of Diagnostics; and David Harding, our Group Vice President of Women's Health. It's now been just over 2 weeks since I returned to the role of CEO at Hologic, and I've spent this time meeting with many of our key members to better understand the challenges Hologic faces today and the many opportunities ahead.","But first, I'd be very remiss if I did not thank Rob Cascella, our former President and CEO, for his many years of service to Hologic and for his leadership. I worked with Rob for more than a decade and appreciate his many contributions to the company, our customers, the senior team and the board. Rob was instrumental in Hologic's efforts to grow its footprint in the women's health industry and position itself to succeed in the rapidly growing molecular diagnostics market.","For myself, obviously, I'm truly excited to return to the company as CEO. I say return, but as many of you know, I really never left. Since 2009, I served as Global Strategic Adviser, primarily focused on our international business. During this period, I spent considerable time meeting with Hologic's key clinical opinion leaders and important customers around the world, which has given me a unique perspective on our business. I intend to use this experience to foster more innovation, improve our execution, develop a more balanced plan for uses of our cash and increase shareholder value.","Hologic's success is rooted in our team's acute focus on delivering the most technologically advanced medical products the industry has to offer. My recent meetings with the associates from all of our operating groups have reaffirmed this foundation is stronger than ever.","During this call, Glenn will take you through the operational and financial details for the quarter, but first, I want to quickly outline some of my near-term priorities. Although our third quarter results were in line with our guidance, right now, Hologic is not where we want it to be. However, we have best-in-class products, which means we certainly can modify our approach and focus our energy and our resources for better performance. It is my overarching objective to restore investor confidence: first, by setting appropriate realistic expectations for financial and operating performance; and second, by focusing the organization on the high-level execution required to achieve these expectations consistently.","To this end, as you have seen in our press release, we have lowered Q4 expectations to a level I believe is more achievable, based on current domestic and international market dynamics. We appreciate there's investor frustration that comes with lowering guidance. However, based on what I have learned through my review of the businesses to-date, our new guidance represents a realistic range for our fourth quarter. Meaningful changes cannot be effected overnight, but I believe we can make significant progress over the near term and I have a focused set of goals I will be driving our entire organization toward achieving.","So here it is. What I want to accomplish in the short term. First, I'm focused on conducting a strategic business review to ensure our resources are aligned with the best opportunity for the company's long-term success. We have a very strong platform to leverage, and my priority is to optimize the value of Hologic's existing assets and capabilities to improve returns and drive organic growth. As part of this strategic review, I will concentrate on maximizing revenue synergies from the Gen-Probe acquisition, in addition to the cost synergies we previously communicated.","Second, I intend to bolster our senior leadership team with new associates that can assist in developing creative solutions to enhance revenue and accelerate new product development. We will look for individuals to complement our current team, bring fresh perspectives to the company and better position Hologic for the future.","With that said, we already have strong leaders within this organization, and I'd like to announce 2 key management changes. As I said earlier, joining me on the call today is Dr. Rohan Hastie in his new position as Group Vice President, Diagnostics. Dr. Hastie has been with Hologic in a variety of senior-level roles in our Diagnostics business, including his recent responsibilities as General Manager of our Diagnostics franchise. Previously, Roe had a senior role in our molecular business and, prior to that, in our Corporate Development Group. Roe joined Hologic from the consulting world, where he worked for the strategic advisory firm, PA Consulting. Roe has a PhD in molecular genetics. Also on the call is David Harding, who will be transitioning from his role leading the international team, to now serve as Group Vice President, Women's Health. Prior to driving international growth, David managed the Interventional Breast Solutions business and prior to that, he served as a Principal at McKinsey. I am confident both Roe and David are the right leaders to take their respective business units forward with consistent execution.","Third, I am reviewing our corporate -- I'm reviewing our current capital allocation strategy and our future plans for capital deployment. This will be among my top priorities as CEO. While we won't have all the answers immediately, Glenn, the Hologic board and I are focused on the best uses for the strong cash flows generated by the company, particularly with respect to opportunities to return cash to shareholders, in addition to repaying debt. As part of this review, the board has signaled they intend to implement new executive compensation plans to ensure that management's financial incentives are closely aligned with an efficient and optimal distribution of capital going forward, and I fully support this important initiative. I'm devoted to this company and its success, and I believe we can fine-tune this organization, which will allow us to set appropriate and achievable expectations of financial and operating performance, improve our execution and increase our market share, while being as transparent as possible with our investors.","I now would like to discuss results of the quarter. In summary, as we preannounced on July 18, third quarter revenues were $626 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.38, slightly ahead of guidance we issued last quarter. Breast Health segment revenues increased year-over-year and sequentially, driven primarily by the growing demand for our 3D Dimensions tomosynthesis system. Overall, 3D demand gained momentum, fueling record quarterly placements and revenue since the products' launch a little more than 2 years ago. While 1 quarter does not make a trend and the hospital capital spending environment remains challenging, we can certainly be encouraged by these route -- results, excuse me.","In the U.S., the clinical data recently published on our 3D Dimensions system is having an impact. During the quarter, a U.S. study published in the American Journal of Roentgenology, led by Dr. Stephen Rose, found the use of Hologic's 3D mammography system resulted in a 37% drop in recall rates, as well as a 35% increase in overall cancer detection rates and a 53% increase in invasive cancer detection rates. We believe the Rose study, in addition to others, such as the Italian STORM trial, published in May in The Lancet Oncology, and the Yale Study published in Radiology last week, will support the broad adoption of tomosynthesis.","Fiscal 2013 remains on track with our previously stated goal to more than double our installed base of tomo systems in the U.S., which means we expect to finish the year with over 700 systems in the field. On the reimbursement front, we remain focused on our objective of obtaining payments and coverage for tomo from both Medicare and private payers. We're progressing toward our stated goals and I'd like to be clear about our strategy around reimbursement for tomo.","First, we're continuing our efforts to secure payment and a code from CMS. CMS has discretion to issue payment for new technology. However, the exact timeline cannot be guaranteed and is entirely in their control. As we updated you last quarter, we had our initial meeting with CMS in April, just prior to the Rose data being published. And following this meeting, we continue to maintain an ongoing dialogue, including the high-level staff at the deputy administrator level. We will continue to respond to inquiries from the agency and look forward to the ongoing discussions with CMS as we progress through the balance of the year. I will be personally visiting Washington in a few weeks to actively join in these discussions. Please keep in mind, this progress is completely at the discretion of CMS. On our November earnings call, I will update you on our progress.","Secondly, and very importantly, our private payer strategy will have a significant impact over time, since approximately 60% to 70% of mammography screening patients have private insurance, while the remaining 30% to 40% of patients are covered by Medicare and Medicaid. And to that end, we have a highly -- we're highly focused on pursuing private payer coverage today and we're making definite progress. Our health economics team continues to appeal to payers through outreach to physicians and patients, through presentations and discussions with medical directors at the payers.","In the meantime, as we have shared in previous quarters, we have several hospital systems already covering and paying for tomo because of the clinical benefit to the patient and the cost benefit to the payer. Our strong tomo sales in the third fiscal quarter demonstrates the strength of this commercial plan, and we continue to believe the growing body of published clinical data will help build demand for the technology.","Now I'd like to update you on key developments in our Diagnostics segment. In June, we announced a strategic alliance with Quest to more broadly offer testing with our APTIMA family of products, as well as to codevelop and promote diagnostic solutions to improve women's health. We believed we earned this Quest business because we're able to offer best-in-class assays and menu consolidation on a leading-edge automated instrument platform. One of the key factors in Quest's decision was their interest in having a women's health partner who can help them access this growing market, and they clearly value Hologic's strategic focus in this area.","Although Quest has long been one of our largest lab customers, we historically have garnered a relatively small portion of Quest's chlamydia and gonorrhea test volumes and virtually no HPV test volumes. Our strategic alliance with Quest is significant for our business on many fronts. First, it brings us the opportunity for substantial market gains in CT\/GC and HPV and Trichomonas testing, along with associated revenues. Second, it represents a strong endorsement of our relatively new APTIMA HPV assay, which is clearly differentiated from competing tests on the basis of comparable sensitivity yet superior specificity. And lastly, it is a tangible example of the revenue synergies we expected to generate from our acquisition of Gen-Probe, as we clearly believe this is the type of alliance that neither Gen-Probe nor Hologic could have achieved as a standalone company.","More broadly, while we continue to see headwinds in our cytology franchise due to continued interval expansion, the Panther system remains a prime driver of growth for our Diagnostics segment. We have begun to successfully build Panther into the platform of choice for midsized molecular labs and as a result, we have secured a number of new account wins in the past 2 quarters and have taken market share from our competitors, a trajectory we believe will continue. Over time, we'll continue to expand the menu of assays that run on Panther, as we recognize menu consolidation is an important element of its appeal, in addition to its superior automation capabilities. On July 23, we announced FDA approval for use of our APTIMA HPV on Panther. The next assay we plan to introduce on Panther is HPV genotyping, which -- for which, we expect to receive FDA approval by the end of the year.","Turning to our GYN Surgical segment. Total revenues were up slightly year-over-year, excluding Adiana in both periods. MyoSure was the strongest performer in the third quarter, with double-digit growth compared to last year. And on a sequential basis, the strong MyoSure results were offset by continued pressure on the NovaSure side of the business, which Glenn will discuss in more detail.","And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Glenn for a detailed review of our financial performance in this quarter. Glenn?","Glenn P. Muir","Thank you, Jack. Before I begin, some of you may have seen in the 8-K that was filed today that I have resigned from the Hologic Board of Directors. As you know, it is considered best practice for our company's board not to include the company's CFO, and the board and I agreed that this made sense for Hologic as well. I will continue to serve as CFO.","I will begin tonight with a review of our third quarter results, including a detailed update on our segment results, our balance sheet and cash flow profile. I will then discuss fourth quarter and full fiscal year guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on third quarter changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Third quarter revenues increased 33.2% due to the addition of Gen-Probe and, to a lesser extent, due to a record number of placements of our 3D tomo systems. Foreign currency had a negligible impact on revenues.","On a pro forma basis, revenue growth was 2% compared to the prior year, when adjusted to include Gen-Probe for Q3 of last year. Legacy Hologic revenues were up 2% and Gen-Probe revenues were up 2% as well. All the aforementioned growth rates exclude divested businesses, such as LIFECODES and Adiana, in both quarters.","Now turning to the segment results, starting with our largest segment. Diagnostics revenues of $297.4 million represented 47% of total revenues this quarter, increasing $138.7 million or 87%. Keep in mind that Diagnostics revenues no longer include LIFECODES, which historically contributed approximately $10 million to $12 million per quarter. Within our legacy Diagnostics business, our overall ThinPrep revenues declined approximately 6% year-over-year as a result of the continued adoption of extended screening intervals in the U.S. and lower international pricing. However, worldwide ThinPrep volumes were up sequentially and year-over-year.","In the U.S., ThinPrep experienced a modest recovery on a sequential basis, posting revenue and volume growth compared to Q2. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. ThinPrep volumes declined almost 5%, a continuation of the trend we have seen in fiscal 2013 of volume declines in the range of 4% to 5%. Our China business shows signs of recovering from the effects of our sales channel restructuring during the second quarter. ThinPrep volumes bounced back nicely. However, due to our now greater reliance on distributors, average selling prices have declined materially, which impacted our overall ThinPrep results. As discussed last quarter, the purpose of the restructuring is to provide broader coverage into multiple market tiers and provinces as we introduce our expanded product portfolio. And lastly, in our legacy Diagnostics business, the Cervista HPV was an area of growth, growing almost 20% year-over-year.","Now turning to Gen-Probe. As I mentioned, Gen-Probe's pro forma revenues increased 2%. In the third quarter of last year, Gen-Probe received a onetime $5 million milestone payment from Novartis. Therefore, we exclude this onetime payment and view the business as having grown almost 6%, allowing us to more clearly analyze Gen-Probe's growth and to assess its performance. Clinical Diagnostics product sales grew over 9%. These results were driven by a low-single-digit growth in CT\/GC, high-double-digit growth in Trichomonas and triple-digit growth in APTIMA HPV. These results reflect only a modest contribution from assay sales associated with our recent Panther account wins, and have yet to reflect incremental sales from our recently announced strategic alliance with Quest, aside from a small amount of equipment sales.","Our Panther installs continue to increase and we are on track for 1,000 installations by the end of fiscal 2015. Since most have been installed in the current fiscal year, and considering the lag time in ramping up volumes, we have not yet seen the real revenue contribution from these systems. Blood screening product revenues were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, which is within the range of variability we expect for this stable, highly profitable business.","Now moving onto Breast Health. Revenues of $230 million represented 37% of total sales and increased $18.6 million or 8.8%. Product sales increased 10% on the strength of 3D tomo shipments, and service revenues increased 7%. Our Dimensions product lines, that is both our 2D Dimensions and our 3D tomo, represented 79% of worldwide digital mammography product revenues and 66% of units sold this quarter.","As noted in our release, tomo was the primary driver of total segment growth this quarter. On a dollar basis, for the first time, 3D tomo revenues outpaced our 2D Dimensions and Selenia revenues, as our worldwide 3D system sales this quarter doubled year-over-year. While it remains too early to call this quarter the inflection point, we were pleased with the strong 3D tomo performance this quarter.","This much is clear. The commercialization of 3D tomo remains on a strong growth path, fueled by the recent clinical publications and the efforts of our sales and marketing teams to raise awareness. This growth is evident in our backlog, which is up 23% sequentially for all 3D tomo systems.","Overall, we continue to be pleased with the strong demand for 3D tomo, evidenced by increasing quote activity, whereby most quotes now include 3D tomo, and supported by the improving trends reflected in our third quarter results. GYN Surgical revenues of $76 million represented 12% of total sales and declined $1.8 million or 2.4%. However, excluding $2.2 million of Adiana in the prior-year period, GYN Surgical sales were actually up almost 1%, reflecting a low-single-digit decline in domestic sales and growth in low-double-digits internationally. MyoSure continued its impressive performance, with high-double-digit, year-over-year growth and low-double-digit sequential growth. We continue to see MyoSure as the growth engine of our GYN Surgical business, especially as the recently-introduced product line extensions gain popularity and international adoption grows. So we continue to believe the MyoSure outlook remains strong.","NovaSure continues to see pressure from lower-cost alternatives, as well as the ongoing economic challenges faced by patients related to less frequent office visits and higher out-of-pocket expenditures. We do not expect these dynamics to change in the foreseeable future. However, we are developing programs to mitigate them by capitalizing on recent clinical data supporting the superior cost-effectiveness of endometrial ablation in comparison to hysterectomy. Approximately 100,000 hysterectomies are performed in the U.S. each year to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. In addition, we continue to see opportunities for growth outside the U.S., where NovaSure experienced growth in the high-single digits year-over-year.","Now for a brief review of third quarter non-GAAP performance and the rest of the P&L. Our gross margins were up 62 -- were 62.4%, up 40 basis points year-over-year from the inclusion of Gen-Probe, coupled with the increase in 3D tomo sales. However, gross margins were down 20 basis points sequentially and slightly below our guidance, due primarily to the product mix shift to lower-gross-margin capital equipment products.","Operating expenses increased $43.8 million or 31% to $185 million, representing 30% of sales in both years. Sequentially, expenses were down 5% and were $5 million or 3% below the low end of our guidance range, and also included $5.4 million of Medical Device Tax. Our expenses were lower than guidance due to our continuing successful efforts to manage expenses and drive operating leverage. For purposes of sequential and year-over-year comparison, I would again remind you that operating expenses associated with LIFECODES are no longer in our number.","We are pleased with the results of our expense management efforts in all areas of our business, and now are on track to exceed $65 million in our first-year cost synergies from the Gen-Probe acquisition. As a result of our successful efforts to reduce costs, net income of $103.2 million was slightly ahead of our expectations and resulted in EPS of $0.38 this quarter, above our guidance range of $0.36 to $0.37.","As of June 29, our cash and equivalents totaled $964 million, up $398 million from the end of fiscal 2012 and up $212 million from the end of the second quarter. This reflects continued strong operating profitability which, in addition to focused working capital management, resulted in strong free cash flow generation. Our total debt obligations stand at $5 billion.","In order to further improve our balance sheet condition, last week, we announced we entered into a refinancing amendment that reduced the interest rate on our Term Loan B by 75 basis points. In connection with the refinancing, we also amended the restrictive covenants in our credit agreement to increase our capacity to repurchase shares and issue dividends. We also voluntarily prepaid $200 million of the Term B. In connection with this prepayment, we will incur a onetime charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of approximately $6 million to write off the related deferred financing costs and debt discounts.","Regarding capital allocation, we believe we are starting a new chapter at Hologic and are heading in a new direction. With the acquisition of Gen-Probe, we now own a strong platform with access to growth opportunities that are unique to Hologic and our industry. Our focus right now is on operational execution. We have generated strong cash flow over the past 5 years and we expect this to continue. We are reconfirming our operating free cash flow guidance of $600 million for the fiscal year, as previously defined. Our primary, near-term focus continues to be on paying down debt. As we have stated in the past, our goal is to reach 2.5x net leverage by the end of fiscal 2015, which would return us to the same level of leverage we had prior to the acquisition of Gen-Probe. Today, we are at 4.3x and we are on track to achieve our goal.","Our next priority is exploring ways to effectively deploy capital to create shareholder value. We are currently undergoing a full analysis of an optimal capital structure for Hologic, with the intent of starting to return cash when possible. That is why, last week, we amended the covenants on all of our term loans, in order to allow greater flexibility and more opportunities to deploy cash. We are planning to provide more detail on our November earnings call.","Turning to guidance. Our guidance expectations are fully detailed in the earnings release and our supplementary PowerPoint presentation, both of which are posted on our IR website. Except for fourth quarter revenues, our guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and also assumes currency rates consistent with the average rate during Q3 of fiscal '13.","For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $615 million to $625 million, representing year-over-year growth of 2% to 4% on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis, this represents a revenue decline of 1% to 3% compared to the prior year, when adjusted to include Gen-Probe for all of Q4 of last year, and excluding LIFECODES. We are updating our revenue guidance to reflect what we expect to be a more moderate growth rate in both the uptake in 3D tomo systems in the U.S. and assay sales on the new Panther installations. At the same time, we continue to strongly believe in the growth potential for 3D tomo and Panther. But right now, it is still very early in the adoption cycle for both of these new products. Therefore, we are a tempering our previous expectations.","We expect gross margins of 62% to 62.5%. We expect operating expenses of $175 million to $180 million or 28% to 29% of revenues, down year-over-year even with the inclusion of a full quarter of Gen-Probe's operating results, and also down sequentially from Q3 due to cost-saving initiatives and increased Gen-Probe synergies. In addition, we expect Q4 operating expenses will include approximately $5 million in additional G&A expense related to the medical device excise tax. We're expecting interest expense of approximately $59 million. We are -- we anticipate our interest expense will decline $3 million from $56 million in the third quarter, due to the lower outstanding balance of the Term Loan B coupled with the new lower interest rate. Offsetting this decrease will be a $6 million write-off of certain deferred financing costs and debt discount from our voluntarily prepaying $200 million of the Term Loan B last week. This is a onetime charge, of which $4 million of it is noncash. We're using an effective tax rate of 32% and diluted shares of approximately 274 million. And our diluted EPS is in the range of approximately $0.36 to $0.37, which also includes $0.01 reduction for the prepayment of the term loan noted above.","Based on our adjusted guidance for Q4, our new fiscal 2013 guidance is for revenues of $2.505 billion to $2.515 billion, down from our previous expectation of $2.53 billion to $2.55 billion. For gross margins, we are modestly lowering our guidance to approximately 62.5% from our previous guidance of approximately 63%. The key reasons for this are the reduction in revenues for the year, coupled with a slight mix shift to capital equipment. For operating expense, we are lowering our guidance to approximately $755 million, which is 30% of revenues. We are increasing the cost synergies relating to the Gen-Probe acquisition to over $65 million, and now expect $17 million to $18 million related to the medical device excise tax. We're also expecting $223 million for interest and other expense, when factoring in the incremental net interest charges I previously discussed, and diluted shares outstanding of 272 million and an expected effective tax rate of 32%.","And finally, we are reducing our EPS guidance to a range of $1.46 to $1.47 from $1.54 to $1.56, which results in EPS growth of 6% to 7% over last year. This reduction factors in the lower revenue guidance, coupled with reduced operating expenses. As a reminder, this guidance includes the expected $0.05 dilution from the medical device excise tax, which, if excluded, EPS growth would be 9% to 10%.","In closing, while we are pleased the third quarter financial performance met our expectations, we have taken a more measured view of what to expect in the fourth quarter. Importantly, despite the top line challenges we recently have faced, our profitability remains solid, as the organization has focused on proper expense management and maximizing cost synergies from our Gen-Probe acquisition. We have also taken advantage of the favorable market environment by improving our balance sheet condition and financial flexibility, both of which should help drive future earnings growth. We are committed to de-leveraging the balance sheet and focusing future capital allocation away from large acquisitions in favor of returning capital to shareholders. In short, we are working hard to improve shareholder value.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Jack.","John W. Cumming","Thank you, Glenn. Today's Hologic platforms and products are unique to the industry, which together, will drive organic growth and strong free cash flows. While in the past, we have focused our cash flows on fueling growth through transformative acquisitions, our clear direction going forward will be on maximizing the value of our existing assets and technologies. We intend to utilize our free cash flow to pay down debt and we are evaluating ways to distribute capital to shareholders, as we have spoken on this call. I look forward to updating you on our progress and providing the additional details on our new vision for the future of Hologic on our next call. Lastly, I'd like to thank our incredible team of highly passionate associates. Making a difference in the lives of women is what drives us. It permeates every aspect of the company and is the fabric that binds us together. I want to thank them again.","And with that, we'll ask for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Nicholas Nohling","This is Nick in for Amit. First, let's talk about guidance for fourth quarter. It seems like you're lowering about $30 million at the top. You said it was a mix between 3D tomo and Panther pull-through. Can you talk about the mix between both of those back, forward, and how is that going to impact 2014 and how we think about guidance going there?","John W. Cumming","Look, as we discussed in our call, we're seeing good results in our key growth products, which is 3D tomo and Panther. But having said that, as we sit here today, we don't have the acceleration in growth rates necessary to achieve that prior guidance. And we're seeing pricing pressures in Diagnostics, as well as pressure in the ThinPrep business due to testing intervals. And based on the trend, I believe our revised guidance represents what I think is a realistic expectation for the fourth quarter. Do you want to add more color?","Glenn P. Muir","Yes, no. Jack, that's right. Nick, let me see if I can help fill that in a little bit. I think our Q4 guidance is meant to provide a more realistic view, especially after our Q3 results. I mean, as you know, our Q3 results, even though we were within the range of guidance that we had provided, it was at the low end and that is not what we were expecting. So we did do a full reset for Q4. If we think about the decrease going into Q4, there's really 3 pieces to keep in mind, and 1\/3 of the decrease does relate to the 3D tomo product itself. And we had embedded in our original guidance a much greater acceleration for tomo at the back end of the year, the back half of the year. We were expecting a bit stronger adoption, thinking that the clinical studies would be a little bit further along. And as Jack said, we're getting tremendous feedback on tomo itself. I think it was just slow to materialize in the back half of the year. The other 1\/3, really as you mentioned, does have something to do with Panther, really the pull-through of assay sales on the Panther itself. And to a certain extent, we were expecting a faster ramp-up as labs began to adopt the Panther itself. We had a record Panther placement quarter. We're well on track for the 1,000 PANTHERs we're expecting. The assay pull-through was a little bit slower than we had originally felt it would be. And then finally, the last 1\/3, Nick, would relate to the ThinPrep. I think the interval expansion is having a bit more of an effect than we originally assumed that it would have during the year. At the same time, we are seeing much in the way of competitive takeaways on that ThinPrep product. But nonetheless, the market decline is high-single digit on the product itself. Hopefully, that wasn't too much color on Q4. As it relates to FY '14, I think that's going to be something we'd be more comfortable talking about at the November call.","Nicholas Nohling","Okay, I appreciate it. If I can sneak one more in, maybe on tomo. What is the reimbursement update there? Is there -- what is the latest timing assumptions? Has that changed at all? And talk about the dynamics with the premium pay, what are you expecting to get paid on the premium? And is there any potential that, that may not be a premium pay?","John W. Cumming","Well, if I worked for CMS, I'd probably have the best answer for you. The reality is that we don't know. I can tell you on a today basis that, through private payers, there's a range of anywhere from $30 to $70, and that's from a pretty broad cross-section of major insurance companies across the country. Where CMS goes, I can't tell you that. But there is a lot of data that they can look at because of discussions with payers, with discussions of women's groups, etc. The timing again is -- it's really in their hands. I'll be going to Washington, as I said in my script, and talking with the stakeholders that have certainly helped us, and that is the women's groups. There are congresswomen and men and senators in both parties that are firmly behind us, because they've looked at all these clinical papers and they see the benefit to it. Obviously, we're optimistic. But we -- I just can't put a date in it on what I have today.","Operator","Our next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could ask a 2-parter. On the first part, just given your earlier comment there on the ThinPrep, what is your operating assumption in the current utilization, kind of, procedure environment for the growth rate on a global basis for ThinPrep? And the second question would be on the financials. Can you put some kind of gating factors around your expectations on capital -- on cash use going forward? And specifically, should we assume that share repurchase or anything of that nature will be sort of mutually exclusive to debt service? In other words, you're going to kind of pay down the debt to your target before you do anything on the repurchase?","John W. Cumming","Well, we'll let Roe answer the first one on ThinPrep and you are correct on the second one. But go ahead.","Rohan Hastie","This is Roe. So yes -- and in answer to the question on ThinPrep, obviously, the majority of the market is here in the U.S. And right now, I think we're seeing adoption of intervals occurring at about a high-single-digit, low-double-digit rate year-over-year for the market as a whole. And I think when you look at our business, that we're not seeing a rate of decline to that extent right now, and that primarily due to share shift that we're seeing or to it taking some market share away, both at the physician level, from the physician selling efforts, but also at the lab level. We're trying to -- we're getting market share there. So we're not seeing rates quite that high right now. In terms of the international markets, it really does depend on where you are. There are headwinds in certain of our markets, for example, Belgium, Holland, United Kingdom, where you're seeing more of an adoption of HPV within the cervical cancer screening guidelines, where previously you may have had a reflex test onto cytology, where we would have double-dipped, if you will. Now that is being taken up by HPV. But then there are other markets in the world where the growth opportunity is tremendous. So for example, Latin America, Japan, and places like that, mostly China, where we see a lot of growth for those markets, where the conventional path is the test of choice for cervical cancer screening right now.","Glenn P. Muir","Thanks, Roe. And Isaac, maybe I could answer the second part of your question on the cash use, share repurchase and the net debt, whether it's exclusive or whether you can do both. And I mean that's a great question but -- and I wish I could be a little bit more specific. But that is what we're currently running an analysis for, for the board. I mean, that is exactly what we're looking at. I mean, our first priority is to continue to rapidly deleverage the company. And what we believe is that there will be a point in time, and that is what we're analyzing, that we can, in fact, be returning capital to shareholders. I'd like it -- I'd like to believe it could be earlier rather than later, but we do have to finish the analysis. I think what's important here though, is it's a commitment on our part not -- really not to do acquisitions. I mean I think that's what the signal here is. And for us to find better ways to use our strong cash flow, because I think that is what's really important to in Hologic and something we've always had is very strong cash flow.","Operator","Moving on to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted -- as we think about the portfolio review, I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you're approaching that process, your willingness to maybe sell businesses for less than the acquisition price you'd originally paid for them. Maybe just talk about how you're thinking about the portfolio review and any sense of timing on when you might communicate things?","John W. Cumming","Well, I don't think that we want to sell anything that -- for less than we paid and we have not certainly made any decisions in -- with that regard. Tycho, we're going to look. There's going to be full-blown presentations by the key leaders in the businesses. Obviously, today we made an announcement installing Roe and David to run our 2 core businesses. And they are going to assemble their team this week, next week. They're putting together their strat plans, which were already in progress for 2014. And we're going tick and turn every one of the numbers, and we're going to look at the R&D pipeline and where it's going, what is commercially the most viable products to invest in. Obviously, we look at OpEx, but we're looking at where we can drive revenues over the course of the next 3 to 5 years, what we've done right, what we could have done better. So it's going to be a full analysis of every product that we have and what its value is as part of our entire portfolio.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then in your comments earlier, you addressed realigning the management comp. Should we just assume that this factors in a higher component on ROIC or any specific color you can provide on that?","John W. Cumming","I really can't. This has been at -- the board has handled this themselves for the past year and we have a meeting with them in September, where this is going to be reviewed. They have brought in outside experts to work with them on this. And at that point in time, we'll be going through this with them. But everything is going to be aligned, as I said in my talk.","Operator","David Lewis of Morgan Stanley has the next question.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jack, it's pretty clear that change is the theme of this call and you're clearly a key part of that change. And one thing that strikes us is that you had the CEO title, but you have a shorter contract than your peer CEOs. You don't have board representation. So can you help us understand and shareholders understand how those various dynamics make sense in light of the need for strategic change and frankly, in light of the time it may take to create that change? And I had one follow-up.","John W. Cumming","Okay. So David, are you offering to be my agent? Is that what you're saying?","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm always available, Jack.","John W. Cumming","Thank you. Well, I've been here for, I guess, almost 12, 13 years. And every year, it's a 1-year contract. So it's no different this year than any other year. So I'm pleased with that. If I do well, then I'll be here for the year after that. But it's certainly, you're here at the board's will. I think that there is going to be a lot of -- there's no doubt there's going to be a lot of work ahead of myself and David and Roe over the course of the next year, and we're going to do our best to get our arms around the business and make sure our dollars are spent judiciously in what's going to give us the biggest return on our investment. We're going to add people to the team, which is going to help us. Certainly, the board wants succession planning in place for all major managers, including myself, and that is going to be addressed for this year. So I think we're going to be in good shape. Again, I'm here to do the job. And as long as the board is pleased with it, then I'll continue.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jack, that's very clear. Then maybe just a follow-up question. In your prepared remarks, this commentary of management has come up several times. You talked about bolstering management, but it did sound from your remarks that it was more incremental, more associate-driven hiring. Does this mean no material senior-level hires? And how are sure you that's the right decision, just because you've been there only 2 weeks?","John W. Cumming","Exactly the opposite. We're looking to bring in -- we have -- we've got some great products here, and to make them even greater with the team that we have, to bring in some very creative innovative people, especially in the technology area, so those are senior people. As we go through the portfolio, as we understand where the drivers are for our business, it will be, again, people on the senior team that will be added from the industry. It will be outside the company. Certainly, we look within the company and we'll promote from within because that is what every company wants to do, and we'll fill some of those slots. But we are going outside and we want people with a different perspective from like industries that can add something and give us a new slant and help us bring products to the market more efficiently, help us in the downstream marketing of these products. And so it has to be senior people.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with ISI Group.","Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A lot of moving parts on the call and then Jack, maybe I want to get back to the earlier question that Tycho asked and your answer was interesting, that you said you would not consider selling any assets less than what you paid for. Now I just want to go back to that comment because maybe the market conditions when you made these deals were different, maybe the growth assumptions were different. It's a different market environment now. I just wanted your sort of thoughts and how you value [indiscernible] in the current [indiscernible]","John W. Cumming","Vijay, I don't know if that's you breaking up or...","[Technical Difficulty]","John W. Cumming","I don't know if that was you breaking up on the phone. But to answer your question, first of all, the board and the company has made no decisions on divesting any of our products. What they've asked for is a full review. In the full review, obviously, you're establishing value and how that fits into your product portfolio. That's number one. Number two, where we're going to go over the next 3 to 5 years drives some of those decisions? But we would not announce to the Street anything that we're going to divest if we -- if, in fact, we ever did, nor that we would announce until we were going to do an acquisition. That's what all companies do unless they're going to hold an auction. So consequently, this company is not entertaining any of that. We're looking at each product and its contribution to the company, how it fits to the overall portfolio and how it's going to fit with the overall portfolio over the next 3 to 5 years. I don't want anyone in our company thinking that we're going to sell out a division from them and I certainly don't want that to be a Street assumption. But we're going to look at everything, and we're going to then determine where it fits in our strategic objectives.","Operator","We'll now hear from Shaun Rodriguez of Cowen and Company.","Shaun Rodriguez - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So the Quest deal clearly got a lot of focus, I think, primarily initially in the context of assessing HPV dynamics. But as you noted, there's a lot of potential outside of that. So can you speak more specifically about the opportunity within Chlamydia and gonorrhea, what the incremental share potential is within that customer in Chlamydia and gonorrhea and maybe what the timelines for when this might materialize would look like?","Rohan Hastie","Shaun, thanks for the question. It's Roe again. Yes, so obviously, this is an important partnership for us and we're very, very happy that we signed it and we're working with Quest. We didn't actually have that much CT\/NG revenue in Quest. They did do some of it and they did very little of our HPV. They did a little bit of our Cervista testing. And obviously, they do ThinPrep. But with this agreement right now, the hope is that -- it is a 5-year, nonexclusive agreement, that the hope is that the majority of the Chlamydia and gonorrhea will be migrated over to our platforms, and then a majority of our HPV testing will be carried over as well. But CT\/GC, you can expect that to probably occur and start to see material contribution from that next quarter. HPV will be a little bit slower than that just because of the time it takes to validate HPV tests. It is -- it takes longer to migrate an HPV test over than it does for Chlamydia and gonorrhea. So HPV will take a little bit more time in that regard. And in Trichomonas, Quest did very little Trichomonas testing with us. So we hope that, that will start to contribute materially again next quarter. So it will take them time to ramp up. I will tell you that we're working very hard. Our service organization is working very hard in getting instruments installed and getting ready to get the switch on over there at Quest.","Shaun Rodriguez - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So this is a related follow-up. So that sounds like a pretty good opportunity for you, guys. So I guess the other related question would be, how should we think about the impact of -- on pricing for this relationship? If it does expand beyond HPV as you just described, how should we think about the pricing impact over the next, call it, 18 months or so, as they get fully ramped?","Rohan Hastie","Well, Shaun, I think -- I won't speak about the specifics of the Quest engagement. But I think if we look at the market in general, I think our peer groups have alluded to this and spoken about this as well, but there is no doubt that CT\/GC pricing is coming under pressure in the market right now, which is of very little surprise considering the number of vendors that are chasing that business. So I think that CT\/GC AUPs will come under some pressure. I think from the flip side and the positive side for us is now having Panther Chlamydia and gonorrhea and Panther HPV. I think we're going to target that mid-volume market segment, where AUPs tend to be higher anyway. So I think any offset that -- we should like to see a little bit of the offset from the AUP compression in those higher-volume labs that is purely, purely driven by competition.","Operator","Moving on to Rich Newitter with Leerink Swann.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I just want to start off, maybe Glenn or Jack, either of you, can you give us a little bit more behind the tempered kind of 3D outlook for the fourth quarter? It sounds like you had your record quarter. Just maybe help us understand, is it a little bit more on the hospital spending or capital spending environment that maybe got a little bit more cautious with respect to your outlook or more just on some of the catalysts you were looking for? And is there anything with reimbursement that factors into that?","John W. Cumming","I'll let David answer this.","David P. Harding","Yes, thank you. So I think while we are still very bullish about the overall tomo growth pattern, there are a couple of things that happen as we increase our overall tomo sales level. First of all, we begin to reduce our service revenues. So for each new tomo system that is sold, those obviously go on warranty and reduce our service revenue. So a lot of the reduction in overall Breast Health revenues going into Q4 is a close function of the reduction in service revenues and not necessarily an indicator of declining tomo sales. That being said, the capital spending environment in hospitals, across the U.S. and internationally, is under great pressure. We certainly see that in a lot of international markets as well. And in addition to that, Q4 tends to be a challenging quarter for the international markets, where places like Europe, Middle East and other places tend to go on extended holidays. So there are a number of things driving that. But I would say the vast majority of the challenge that we're facing is really along the service revenue side of things.","John W. Cumming","And reimbursement has not had played any role in that at all.","Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just maybe, looking to your fourth -- fiscal fourth quarter call, Jack, it sounds like you will have had a little bit more time to regroup, potentially, the board to make some decisions. Can you give us a sense of what we can expect? Is that the call where we might get a detailed kind of longer-term plans for debt pay-downs, what the capital allocation priorities will be and the timelines for all of those, or adjusted timelines?","John W. Cumming","Yes, certainly. You -- especially, when it comes to capital allocation, that will certainly be one of the highlights of the fourth quarter call. We also -- with our guidance that we're going to give you at that point in time, we'll be able to give you greater insight into the markets looking forward, depending on what the headwinds are. It's only a couple of months from now but -- or actually, 1.5 months, what's going to be happening. We're all facing, lots of different companies, the same headwinds. Luckily, I mean, we have -- and it shouldn't be minimized, we had a very strong quarter in tomo. We had a good quarter in Panther. We continue to see that. So those are really the highlights. What's offsetting it is when you get AUP pressure and volume reduction in the ThinPrep area just because of the extended interval. But we'll get a better look at that and we'll give you some better insight on that call.","Operator","And Jayson Bedford with Raymond James has the next question.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'll just keep it to one question here. The cost structure exiting the year here will be $175 million, $180 million on the OpEx line, by your guidance. It's obviously down quite a bit since the beginning of the year. Are there any big expenditures planned in fiscal '14? Or could this level even come down further?","John W. Cumming","Glenn?","Glenn P. Muir","Well, we weren't really prepared to talk about FY '14, Jason, but I think we've reset a new base for the company. I think the expectation would be for growth in FY '14.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Expense growth off the fourth quarter level?","Glenn P. Muir","Expense growth off the Q4, yes.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But are there any big expenditures or...","Glenn P. Muir","We don't have -- yes, well, we -- I think we've done -- as we talked about on the cost side, I think throughout all of FY '13, we've been very successful in driving down costs with our internal cost initiatives and then second of all, with the Gen-Probe synergies. And at this point in time, we're now over $65 million in Gen-Probe synergies. So we've been successful in driving a lot of cost out of that business. It's unlikely, going into FY '14, there's anything else to drive a lower expense rate. But on the converse, there's really no big expenses that we're looking at, other than the normal operating increases.","John W. Cumming","Yes. And you might see some things in the -- classic with SAP and Oracle. You have -- as we -- as you buy a company, there are some benefits and then there's some spikes. And we're looking at that right now to see where that's going to be. I mean, we could see a blip in that for next year. But that's the only major one that I see right now.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one further question. That's from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just one on Clinical Diagnostics, one on Breast Health. I think, Glenn, you referenced low-single-digit growth in Chlamydia and gonorrhea in the quarter and it sounds like there was some pricing pressure. So I'm wondering if that step-down was all pricing pressure. And if not, is there something else going on there in the quarter that we should be aware of?","Rohan Hastie","No, it is all pricing pressure that we're seeing out there. We're holding well on our volumes. We do see a little bit of AUP uptick when we place PANTHERS over our older DTS systems. So that's positive for us from an AUP perspective. But volumes are holding steady for us as a business. The major effect is the decrease in AUP.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Then maybe just a quick follow-up there in terms of Quest. How many systems actually do you expect to place with that contract over time? Is it a substantial number of systems or are the systems largely in place and we'll just see an uptick in reagent volume as we move forward with that contract?","Rohan Hastie","I can't give specific numbers, but there will be a considerable number of instruments that one would expect, with Quest being 25% of the Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing market within the U.S. There will be a commensurate number of new instrument placements for service in that volume. And I should add that, that is really what is happening this very moment, is those instruments are actually being placed across the Quest network of testing.","Operator","And Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you so much. That is the time -- all the time we have for questions today. And this concludes our Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Have a good evening.","John W. Cumming","Thank you."]}}
