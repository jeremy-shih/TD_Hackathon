Today's call is being recorded. My name is Dahana and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Steve Movius","Thanks, Dahana, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year-end 2017 conference call. Supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation is available on our Web-site. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual Company results to differ materially.","Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental PowerPoint presentation. I would also note that as of January 1, we adopted the new revenue recognition and pension accounting standards, and today's earnings release contains pro forma schedules that present comparable prior period information recapped to reflect the adoption of these new standards.","On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman and CEO; Kathy Warden, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wes Bush","Thanks, Steve. Hello everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before we discuss our 2017 financial results, I'd like to comment on our capital deployment plans in light of the improvements that we expect to net income and cash flows resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was passed in December along with the benefits of our outstanding pension plan performance.","Ken is going to cover our detailed guidance a little later in the call, but the bottom line is that these improvements will enable us to take several actions, as intended by the tax legislation, that support our economy and the long-term interest of our shareholders, customers and employees. These actions are all well aligned with our long-standing capital deployment strategy.","We saw three important opportunities as we analyzed the implications of these improvements. First, it's important that our employees receive an economic benefit from this legislation and from our Company's performance. We've elected to provide our employees an annual additional contribution to their retirement accounts, an amount each year based on our competitiveness and our overall Company performance. For 2018, the contribution amount can be up to $1,000 per employee if we perform well. All employees, except senior management, participating in our annual incentive plan will be eligible for this new benefit. This approach is well aligned with our performance culture and our performance-based compensation philosophy.","Second, we're focused on making capital investments in our Company that will drive our growth over the long term, support affordability for our customers, and of course generate solid returns. Investing in our Company continues to be the highest priority of our capital deployment strategy. These investments benefit our customers through enhancing our ability to serve them and also enhance our business opportunities and enable us to grow and provide more opportunities for our employees. Last year, our capital expenditures were approximately $900 million. We are increasing that investment to approximately $1 billion this year.","And third, we have a long-standing policy of paying our shareholders a competitive dividend based on a payout ratio tied to pension-adjusted net income. With the growth in net income and reflecting this policy, we announced this morning an off-cycle dividend increase of 10%. As you know, our normal annual dividend assessment occurs each May and we expect to return to that cycle in May of this year.","Let me focus now on our financial results. 2017 was another strong year for our Company and for our shareholders, and I want to express my appreciation to our team for their continuing focus on performance. We delivered solid financial results and our total shareholder return was approximately 34%. We returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders, while continuing our strong level of internal investment. We also took a major step to broaden our portfolio for the future with the pending acquisition of Orbital ATK. We continue to be very positive regarding the benefits to our customer community and all of our stakeholders of bringing our two companies together.","As our fourth quarter and full-year financial results demonstrate, our strategy for long-term profitable growth is gaining momentum and generating results. I'm very pleased that our team remains focused on sustaining top performance. All three of our businesses posted strong sales, higher operating income dollars, and robust cash generation.","2017 sales rose 5% and segment operating income increased about 1%, reflecting an increase in percentage of early-phase development work. Our segment operating margin rate was 11.5%, total operating income grew 3%, and our total operating margin rate was 12.8%. 2017 earnings per share were $11.47 and cash from operations totaled $2.6 billion. Before tax reform impacts, net earnings grew 6% and earnings per share increased 9% to $13.28.","We had a very strong finish to the year in terms of cash. You'll recall that last quarter we indicated that we would consider pre-funding our pension plans if tax reform was enacted. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December and the lowering of the corporate tax rate to 21% starting in 2018, we made a $500 million pre-tax discretionary contribution to our pension plans in late December. 2017 cash from operations before that contribution increased to $2.9 billion, which supported our capital expenditures of approximately $900 million and resulted in 2017 free cash flow before the contribution of more than $2 billion.","Our capital deployment strategy has not changed, and calls for investing in our business, managing the balance sheet, and returning cash to our shareholders. Tax reform enhances our ability to generate cash, further supporting this strategy. We continue to strengthen our portfolio through robust R&D, capital spending, and investing in our theme. We're focused on near-term debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","With respect to dividends going forward, we continue to target a payout ratio of 30% to 40% of pension-adjusted net earnings. Share repurchases remain an important value creation tool for our Company. We are however continuing to pause our share repurchase program during the Orbital ATK transaction process.","Free cash flow in 2018 is expected to grow to $2.0 billion to $2.3 billion, which includes continued robust investment in our business. As I mentioned earlier, we expect 2018 capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1 billion as we expand our workforce, ramp up on large new programs, and pursue new business opportunities.","Our 2018 guidance calls for continued top line and earnings growth, supported by strong operating performance from all three businesses. For 2018, we expect sales of approximately $27 billion and diluted earnings per share of $15 to $15.25. Ken will provide more detail on our 2018 guidance.","As we establish our guidance for the year, we should remind everyone of the risk to our guidance associated with continuing resolutions and prolonged government shutdowns. As we address critical national security challenges and our military faces readiness issues and rapid advances by our near peers, it's more important than ever that our nation returns to a more timely and productive budget process.","Continuing resolutions have damaged our military's readiness and eroded our modernization efforts. Industry stands ready to invest and innovate from next-generation technologies and capabilities but our Department of Defense customer struggle to efficiently plan and execute our national defense investment strategy in the face of perpetual continuing resolutions.","In summary, 2017 was another strong year for the Company and for our shareholders, and we feel we are well-positioned to continue creating value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees in 2018 and beyond. As we move forward in 2018, I am delighted to have Kathy Warden as our President and Chief Operating Officer. Our operating businesses report to Kathy, including the new sector that will be established after the pending Orbital ATK transaction closes. Kathy will lead the integration of our two companies.","So, now, I'll turn the call over to Kathy for an update on the pending Orbital ATK acquisition as well as some operational highlights. Kathy?","Kathy J. Warden","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon everyone. As we reported last quarter, we currently expect the Orbital ATK transaction to close in the first half of this year. In late November, Orbital ATK shareholders overwhelmingly approved the terms of the transaction. The FTC is reviewing the proposed transaction in the U.S. in consultation with the DoD and we notified the European Commission on January 18 under the simplified procedure notice.","As we prepare for integration, we are making good progress in our plans to combine our two outstanding companies after close. We believe that after the transaction has completed, our collective set of market-leading technologies and products, along with very compatible innovation-focused cultures, will enable us to better serve our customers' current and emerging needs.","Our companies' common legacies and well-known reputation for innovation have inspired the name for the new fourth sector, Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. This name reflects the heritage of both Orbital ATK and Northrop Grumman and highlight both companies' essential character, creative workforces, product and process innovations, agile operations, and cutting-edge technologies.","Blake Larson, Orbital ATK's Chief Operating Officer, will lead Innovation Systems. In addition, Scott Lehr, Mike Kahn, and Frank Culbertson, will each continue in their existing leadership roles within the Flight, Defense and Space Systems organizations respectively. Maintaining this leadership team will ensure operational continuity and facilitate the integration of our two companies. We believe our combination represents a powerful opportunity to better serve customers through accelerated innovations applied to new product development and enhancement of our current offerings.","Turning to our sector highlights for the year, each of our sectors captured business and achieved program milestones that position us for the long term. At Aerospace Systems, the Air Force awarded us a three-year $328 million contract to execute the technology maturation and risk reduction phase of a Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, our nation's next-generation ICBM system. We look forward to competing for the final downselect on this important program.","On the Manned Aircraft side, AS delivered 74 F-35 units, an increase of 13 units over 2016, and we are well-positioned to ramp up further in 2018. On the E-2D program, we are in full production and completed the first flight of Japan's E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, and we are in discussions with the Navy regarding the next multi-year E-2D contract.","In Autonomous Systems, we delivered the first operational MQ-4C Triton to the Navy in November and we signed LRIP 1-3 as we continue to ramp up on this important ISR program. Australia continues to make progress toward procuring Triton as their maritime ISR platform, and on Global Hawk we are working towards delivery of Lot 11 for the U.S. Air Force and NATO AGS, and we continue to work on delivering Global Hawk capability to both Korea and Japan.","At Mission Systems, we continue to increase production rates on Sensors and Processing programs. We ramped up significantly on our F-35 sensor program, delivering 90 radars, which was double the number of units we delivered in 2016 and we achieved a significant milestone of delivering the 300th F-35 radar in November. MS delivered 78 DAS systems and 88 CNI systems this year, approximately 30% more than prior year deliveries. And we also continued to ramp up on SABR production for our U.S. and international customers.","At Technology Services, we won the Army's $750 million Special Electronic Mission Aircraft program to provide contractor lifecycle services for the Army's fixed-wing ISR fleet. The award includes a base year contract and eight option years extending to 2027. The Army also selected TS to compete for more than $500 million in task orders to operate Army training centers across the country.","And for international customers, Australia awarded us the sustainment contract for Air Force C-27J Spartan transport, and training work for the Saudi Arabia Ministry of National Guard continues to expand through our joint venture.","Looking ahead, the substantial investments that we are making, both organic and through our pending acquisition, demonstrate our confidence that we will bring the right technologies and capabilities to address our customers' urgent need for affordable, technologically superior national security solutions in response to a rapidly evolving threat environment. Global national security needs are expanding at a rapid rate and we are investing to address those needs.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financials.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield","Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for their efforts this year, particularly in the area of fourth quarter cash generation, which was really outstanding. Before the discretionary pension contribution, the team brought in $1.9 billion in cash from operations in the fourth quarter, which was $400 million more than we generated in the fourth quarter of 2016, so kudos to everyone who contributed to that outcome.","Today I'll spend a few minutes on 2017 results, but devote most of my commentary to our 2018 guidance where we have a few additional moving parts due to the pending transaction as well as changes in revenue recognition and pension accounting. As I go through our 2018 sector guidance, year-over-year revenue growth will be under the new standard for 2018 versus today's reported 2017 results.","I would also note that our guidance does not include Orbital ATK and guidance only includes six months of interest related to the debt issued last October for the acquisition. We will update our guidance after the transaction closes, which as Kathy mentioned, we currently expect in the first half of this year.","Turning to sector results, Aerospace Systems sales were up 5% for the quarter. 2017 sales were approximately $12 billion, a 10% increase. While restricted activities at Manned Aircraft drove a substantial amount of the year-over-year increase, all three AS business areas, Manned, Autonomous, and Space, posted higher year-over-year revenue.","Aerospace Systems 2017 operating income grew 2% and operating margin rate was 10.5%, lower than last year due to the changing contract mix as we continue to ramp up on early-phase development programs. In addition, 2016 operating income benefited from a $45 million gain on a property sale in last year's fourth quarter.","For 2018, we expect AS to grow at the top line at a high single-digit rate to the high $12 billion range. Growth in restricted activities will continue to be a major driver of revenue growth, along with continued ramp-up on the F-35 program. We expect 2018 operating margin at AS will be in the low to mid 10% range. For 2018, cost-type early-phase development work continues to grow at a faster rate than higher-margin production work, although we are seeing good growth in the production programs like F-35.","Turning to Mission Systems, sales rose more than 4% for the year, operating income rose nearly 1%, and operating margin rate was 12.8%. Sensors and Processing was the biggest growth driver for the sector, up more than 10% due to higher volume for F-35 sensors, electro-optical\/infrared self-protection and targeting programs, and communications programs, as well as the SABR radar.","For 2018, we expect sales to grow to the mid to high $11 billion range with an operating margin of approximately 13%. Primary revenue growth drivers include continued ramp-up on combat avionics and communications programs, including F-35 sensors, SABR radar, and infrared countermeasures. With respect to F-35 volume across the Company, I would note that it is expected to grow to approximately 9% to 10% of total expected 2018 revenue.","Now let me turn to Technology Services. Technology Services 2017 sales were slightly lower than the prior year at approximately $4.8 billion. 2017 operating income grew more than 2% and TS ended the year with a strong 11% operating margin rate.","For 2018, we expect Technology Services sales will be in the mid $4 billion range, with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Lower 2018 revenue is primarily due to expected declines in the KC-10 and JRDC programs. Lower revenue for these programs is being partially offset by growth in other programs.","As we roll all that up, we expect sales of approximately $27 billion with a segment operating margin rate in the low to mid 11% range, reflecting a portfolio that continues to have a higher percentage of early-phase development work in its contract mix. We expect our total operating margin rate will be approximately 12%, reflecting the new pension accounting presentation.","As you are aware, starting in 2018, we are required to divide FAS into two pieces. FAS service expense of $400 million is reflected in operating income, while $485 million of FAS non-service income is moved below the operating profit line and reflected in earnings before interest and taxes. This change in presentation reduces our estimated 2018 operating income margin rate by approximately 180 basis points compared to the prior presentation standard. Slide 6 in our PowerPoint presentation provides a bridge to 2018 guidance under the new accounting standard.","Our 2018 FAS assumptions are based on a 3.68% discount rate and 8% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and reflect our 2017 net plan asset returns of more than 16%. Slide 7 and 8 in our PowerPoint deck summarize our pension estimates for years 2018 through 2020, and Slide 9 summarizes 2019 sensitivities to changes in assumptions.","In aggregate, on a GAAP basis, the year-end funded status of our plans was 85% versus 80% at the end of last year. Our qualified plans also remained well-funded at 89% versus 84% at the end of last year. Holding all current assumptions constant, our required contributions remain minimal for the next few years, at $87 million in 2018, approximately $100 million in 2019, and approximately $200 million in 2020. Beyond 2020, we continue to expect required funding will be lower than CAS recoveries.","We expect 2018 unallocated corporate expense of approximately $250 million, which contemplates about $50 million of Orbital ATK transaction expenses, in addition to $200 million of ongoing expense consistent with prior year's guidance. I'd also note that our guidance contemplates net interest expense of approximately $390 million, which is comprised of $300 million for our pre-Orbital ATK debt and around $90 million or six months of net interest expense on the $8.25 billion of net interest expense to align carrying cost with our current expectation regarding timing of the close of the transaction. After the close, we will update our financial guidance.","Turning to tax, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 19.5% in 2018. Our 2018 earnings per share guidance of $15 to $15.25 assumes no change to our weighted average diluted share count.","Just a few comments on cash in 2018; we expect free cash flow will range between $2 billion and $2.3 billion after capital spending of approximately $1 billion, and approximately $150 million for incremental interest and unallowable costs related to the Orbital ATK transaction. These 2018 items largely offset this year's cash tax reform benefit. We also expect our cash generation will be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, as is our typical pattern.","In summary, we had an outstanding year in [2018] [ph] and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team in 2018. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?","Steve Movius","Thanks Ken. Dahana, please open the line for Q&A. Dahana, would you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein.","Sam Pearlstein","[Indiscernible] once a year was down 5%, which I was a little surprised. Can you comment on that in terms of any big items that might have shifted out of 2017? And then secondly with regards to the CapEx of $1 billion, when should we expect that to moderate? Does this continue beyond 2018, does it continue to go up from here?","Steve Movius","This is Steve Movius. Hopefully we have everybody back on the line. I apologize for the technical difficulties. Ken was addressing a question on backlog and capital expenditures. I think we got through the backlog before the line went dead. So, Ken, can you address the questions on our capital expenditure profile for the next \u2013 going forward a little bit?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield","Sure, Steve. Thanks. With respect to capital expenditures, investing in the business continues to be the first priority of our capital deployment strategy. Given the benefits of tax reform on our cash flows including accelerated depreciation as well as an opportunity set that we expect will generate long-term shareholder value, we firmly believe we are making good investments for our Company and our shareholders. We continue to expect that capital expenditures will remain elevated in 2018 and 2019 before starting to return to a new normal that reflects a larger business.","In terms of our overall cash generation, as we look forward, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows, further aided by tax reform. Looking at 2018, we do have additional CapEx as well as $100 million to $150 million in costs from incremental interest and transaction cost related to our pending acquisition of Orbital ATK. We also see our CAS pension recoveries moving down a bit based on our strong pension asset performance in 2017. So there is some impact on 2018 cash flow.","I'd refer you to the pension slides in our PowerPoint deck for our latest estimates of CAS and our required contributions which we've laid out through 2020. While lower CAS reduces cash flows, it provides a competitive advantage for us as we pursue future opportunities.","Wes Bush","Let me add a little bit on to that as well, and Sam, I appreciate you asking the question and I think it's an important item with respect in particular to capital expenditure for us to focus on. And Ken said it exactly right, we have a current approach to this that based on how we see things today sort of plays out. I just want to caveat that a little bit. Should we continue to be extraordinarily successful in capturing business that goes with some capital investment, we're going to reflect that into our plans on a go forward basis, and the focus obviously is making sure we're capturing good business so we can get really good returns. And with the benefits of tax reform, the way we do that math, it makes it quite attractive.","So, what Ken went through I think is an important perspective just in terms of our current visibility on it, but I fully expect this team to continue to be exceptionally successful in capturing good new business for us. And if investment comes with that, with great returns, then we will plan and execute on CapEx accordingly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Good morning, Wes and Ken, and welcome Kathy. Wes, I don't know if you were ever looking to get into the conference call hosting business but you might have an opportunity.","Wes Bush","Yes, it might be a natural adjacency here.","Carter Copeland","Yes, exactly. You are the techie. Look, a couple of questions, just quick ones. One, I know you can't provide much detail here but I'm hoping that given the debate around your margin rates, given the sort of increasing opacity that the classified mix provides, you made the comment, Ken, about cost-type development work growing faster than the other. Is there any way you can give us any sort of color about the quantum of the difference there? Is it modestly faster, significantly faster? I know you can't quantify in numerical terms, but anything I think to help to give the market some color around just what you're seeing from the underlying business standpoint that might be helpful to us?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield","Sure, Carter. Let me see if I can address that, and then Wes or Kathy can jump in if there's additional comments. I would say that as you look at the business, first of all, if you looked at the straight-up cost-type versus fixed-price mix, you would see it's pretty consistent 2016 to 2017 at about 55\/45.","But if you peel the onion a little bit further, and it's hard for me to give you too many numbers because much of it is on restricted business, but if you peel it back further, there's clearly within the cost-type portfolio more mature programs that are generating relatively strong development cost-type margins and those that are early-phase programs where we're still working our way through some of the early risk reduction and some of the early engineering phases of those types of programs, and what we're seeing is a relatively robust growth, a pretty rapid growth in those types of programs within that portfolio. And if you were to look specifically at AS, just to pick one of the sectors, you would see in particular there that it is growing at a rapid clip within AS.","I don't know that I can put more specifics around it, what I will tell you is that as we've looked at our portfolio, we do have a nice mix of both development and production, we do see that we've got some production opportunity in front of us in terms of starting to generate some of the higher margin on those higher volumes as they work their way through. But right now, those early-phase programs are growing a good bit faster than those production programs.","Wes Bush","Yes, Carter, I'd just add a little bit to it. Your remark as to sort of the opacity of the restricted work, just to give a framework here, we're in a world today where the nation's ability to really have technological superiority is going to increasingly depend on the ability of the government to execute more and more of our programs in a restricted manner. It's just the nature of the world today. So, I do anticipate that we're going to just continue to see a bit more growth on the restricted side just as an aggregate fraction of the business.","So, we're working hard to be thoughtful about that to give as much insight as we can, but inevitably the programs themselves are not going to lend themselves to giving much transparency in that regard. But one thing I can say as just sort of a broad perspective on it, the development work on restricted programs, because they are typically at the higher end of technology and consequently carry more technological risk, do tend to be more the classic cost-plus development type contracting. It's not universally true but that's sort of a general characteristic of them.","And as you know, that type of work comes with a little bit lower margin rate but a lot less risk than some of the other types of development work, and that little bit lower margin rate development is more than offset over time because when you actually get into the production side of things, you do pretty well.","So, when we think about the opportunities and we think about it in the context of a likely growing restricted baseline within the Company, there will be that pressure for some period of time, particularly as we are successful in capturing that business. But the payback for our shareholders and for our customers ultimately over the longer term is exceptionally good.","So, I know there's a little bit of anxiety out there about what the margin rate might be in AS this quarter or next quarter, and the team is highly motivated to do really well, and that just comes down to good old basic program performance, but when you look at it from a portfolio perspective, we're going to work really hard to capture even more of this business because it is putting us in a good place for the long term.","Carter Copeland","Wes, just to maybe get at it a different way, you mentioned program performance, so in aggregate the program performance has clearly been strong positive for quite a period of time. If you were to look at the fundamental blocking and tackling of risk identification, retirement milestones, do you see any material difference in the performance of the restricted contracts versus non-restricted, maybe get at it that way?","Wes Bush","Kathy, why don't you take that one.","Kathy J. Warden","Sure, thanks. Carter, no, we don't see a significant difference as we are ramping up on these early-phase development programs in how we are managing risk and opportunities. Our team is incentivised to identify those risks, manage them over time, seize the opportunities, and that's the same performance characteristic that you've seen from us, it's just the phase of the program that we're talking about has different characteristics based on early-phase versus late-phase development and then of course production.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield","And Carter, I'd just remind you that to the extent we had any major program issues or charges, we'd clearly be required to disclose those, and we've had a pretty clean record of not having disclosed program write-downs, and we continue to make sure we're doing our best to perform in that regard.","Wes Bush","[Indiscernible] we feel particularly good about work of our team. That's the primary focus in the Company, program execution. Doing well for our customers means doing well for our shareholders. Thanks Carter.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of J.P. Morgan.","Seth M. Seifman","So, two questions; Ken, when you talk about the $2.6 billion or so, I think you said of F-35 revenue in 2018, how would you characterize that level of activity relative to full rate production? And secondly, Wes, when you look at the additional CapEx, I think it makes sense to everybody, surely makes a lot of sense to me, why you're doing it. But when you think about how these incremental returns will show up to shareholders, should we be thinking about more sustained growth in the out years, faster growth in the out years, higher margins in the out years, or some combination of all three? And then when you look at what you and Raytheon and General Dynamics have said this quarter, it's all a lot of additional CapEx. Is there something about this particular defense ramp that we're entering right now that's maybe different in terms of the level of investment required versus even if we go back far to other ramps the level of capital spending?","Wes Bush","Yes, those are really good questions.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield","I'll take the first part, and before I get to the F-35 question, let me just make a comment. Given the technical challenges we had there for a few minutes, we're going to extend the call past 1 o'clock. So if you're able to stick with us for a few more minutes, we're happy to take questions past the 1 o'clock.","But on F-35 specifically, Seth, I would say that think of those sales that we talked about as being roughly two-thirds AS, one-third MS, I would say the vast majority of those sales are essentially at full rate production at this point. We are performing on LRIP programs, but we are facilitized for the production ramp, we are ready to address the additional units Kathy talked about, the increased deliveries we made this year.","And so, I would say, we'll likely be in low rate production for a few more lots here. I think the plan is through like LRIP 15 or something about that. But we're essentially in full rate production at this point and we're looking forward to being in a scenario where we get funded, get on contract reasonable times, and we are able to generate along with our partners, as Lockheed has talked about, additional margin that will move into those production lots.","And I guess maybe just to comment a little more specifically on the mix, it might be more like 60\/40 or 55\/45 AS to MS, but that would be the F-35 comment.","Wes Bush","And Seth, let me address sort of the broader question you asked about capital, which I think is a really important question just in terms of framing what I see going on in our Company but also what I see going on in our industry right now.","There was a period, a long, rather long, incredibly long period of time we were in a declining defense budget environment. It was difficult to reach a conclusion to expand capital when we had limited visibility and the visibility we had generally looked down for a while.","So, on one hand there's a little bit of pent-up demand to deal with that period of time, but on the other hand, and I think this is the more important part of it for investors, we foresee just given the nature of the threat environment that we observe around the globe today and the number of dimensions in that threat environment that are evident, we foresee a period of time here in front of us, a rather significant period of time in front of us, where our nation and our allies are going to need to invest in their national security to deal with this, and those investments in many cases are going to be different types of investments and at the national level to ensure technological superiority, and we've got to get back to a place of technological superiority.","So, when you're talking about doing that type of thing, you can't just patch up your old facilities and do this incrementally. You have to step back and say, what is the capacity that industry needs to support the customer-strategic objectives here? And it's causing all of us to look carefully at our factories, it's causing us to look at the capacity that we have for our employees to do work in a much higher technology arena than may have otherwise been considered, and it's causing us to add employees.","We hired over 8,000 people last year. That's not net, that was our hiring. We have an ongoing wave of retirements across our industry and those were evident in our Company as well, but we netted well over 2,000, pushing into 3,000, people last year and we did the same thing the year before. And this is just a reflection of the fact that our industry is gearing up to support the nation's needs and the needs of our allies. Our investments are not only here in the U.S., they are in other countries around the globe where we're doing business, and our allies depend on us to do the things we need to do from a facility and tooling and capability perspective so that we can support them as well.","So, from an investor standpoint, this ought to be seen as good news. This is industry saying, we see a runway of business in front of us, and thereby good returns in front of us if we're doing it smartly, that necessitates these investments and we think it's a smart thing to do.","So, it won't all happen tomorrow. That's not the nature of our business. As Ken said earlier, it's a long-cycle business, but it's what we need to do to be well-positioned to support our customers and to enjoy the economic benefits of doing well for our customers for the long term, and that's the way we're thinking about it.","Seth M. Seifman","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard","Just one for me, Wes, regarding the recent tax reform and also what Northrop has been doing on some of its bids over last say 6 to 12 months, you've backed away from a couple of programs because you felt the returns weren't what you'd like them to be if you were to win them. Does tax reform change that and could you be a little bit more aggressive on bidding going forward?","Wes Bush","Tax reform helps in terms of things like the returns on the programs that we are working on, the returns on the investments that we're making. It does not generally turn a bad business into a good business. And I hate to be that sort of sharp contrasted approach to describing it, but the things we walked away from [indiscernible] were just bad business deals and there isn't enough juice in any variant of tax reform I've seen to turn a bad business deal into a good business deal.","So, I don't have any \u2013 if the question is, do we perhaps have a different model of how we're going to look at things going forward on the decisions we make programmatically, if there's something that's right maybe on the margin, yes, that might have an effect, but if it's fundamentally a deal where the balance of risk and return is in the wrong part of the coordinate system, I don't think that will change much of that optic.","I do think, and I'm delighted particularly in the context of the last question, that tax reform is doing a really good job of motivating investment in our country, and you can see it in our industry, you can see it in other industries as well, and to the extent that the programmatics line up in the good business part of the coordinate system, investments applied in that direction make even more sense in the context of tax reform.","So, to the spirit of your question, I believe that's a very strong positive for us and I am delighted to see broadly how business is responding to this. I think it's the right thing for companies to be doing right now to take these benefits of tax reform, support their employees, and invest in our nation's economy. So I think there's good alignment here.","Robert Stallard","That's great. Thanks Wes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew McConnell","Could you share an update on the Orbital ATK close? I know you've said first half, but any other clarity there, and what are key milestones that are left? And then maybe related to that, when you think you could resume the buyback? Is there a certain leverage threshold or any other catalyst that could drive the buyback resumption?","Wes Bush","Kathy, why don't you talk about Orbital? I know you referenced a lot of these in your remarks.","Kathy J. Warden","I did, and so, we still see it closing in the first half of this year, really nothing to add to that other than my comments about where we are in the regulatory process. We have filed on January 18th in the short form process in the EU and we continue to work through the FTC process in the U.S.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield","And Matt, with respect to your question on share repurchase, we wouldn't see ourselves getting back into the market until after the close of transaction, and in fact end of the first window after \u2013 first open window after close.","Wes Bush","As I remarked earlier, Matt, this share repurchase we see as an important element of our value creation strategy. Obviously all these other things we're doing have an influence on the timing, but over the longer term it's part of our overall capital deployment strategy as it has been for about as long as I can remember. So, it's something that we'll get back onto when the time is right.","Matthew McConnell","All right, great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Baird.","Peter Arment","Maybe just quickly on the CR, this is obviously something you've been dealing with for seven some odd years plus, but can you give us an update, if we don't see a deal here in February, the impacts you see, and are several of your programs exempt where you'd still be able to see additional increases? Thanks.","Wes Bush","Yes, you said it right. It's been a number of odd years that we're having to deal with these things. In this year in particular, here we are on our fourth CR, we're about a quarter away through the fiscal year, and as challenging as this might be on the industry side, the real pain here, and I mean pain with a capital 'P', is on our customer side. This business is just really, really tough on them and they \u2013 fortunately for our nation and for our allies around the globe, we have a military that figures out how to get things done, but it's just not right that they are put in this position.","So, we are all doing what we can to support our customers. I think that's the main thing to take away from the industry perspective with respect to the CR. And whether or not individual programs will be impacted kind of depends on the nature of how the customer approaches Congress on things like anomalies or other aspects, other tools they might have, but I think there's just a growing recognition not only on the helm but across our country that this has gotten to the ridiculous point, and we've got to get it solved.","And I might add one other aspect to this that I think is really important for people to understand. It's not simply enough to pass the appropriation. We still have the Budget Control Act in effect. So, Congress has to both pass an appropriation as well as deal with getting these crazy constraints off the table. And I just want to keep that out there because sometimes as we're struggling through CRs and the media is focused on the probability of a shutdown and the rest, there may be some who would think, okay, all we got to do is get the appropriation done, and that would be a mistake to think that. We got to get the appropriations done and we got to get these caps removed so that we can be doing the right things from a national security perspective.","Peter Arment","Appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein.","Douglas Harned","I have got a philosophical question about tax reform. Obviously it's a very important thing, you described the benefits and a lot of people are getting benefits from this, but this industry is somewhat unique in that in the sense the customer is giving the tax benefit but also in a sense has the power to take it away as the customer. And we've heard a range of views on it when you look long-term, and on one side we've heard some say that this is a windfall that defense companies will receive in perpetuity because the FAR uses operating margins, not after-tax margins, it doesn't change very often, and the government wants to make the industrial base healthier; but the other side is that it's been a highly profitable industry and the benefit will likely go away over time because the Pentagon is well aware of the benefit and a lot of people don't have a high appetite for higher defense profits without a clear mechanism to ensure the added cash goes to investment; would suggest that you could see changes made to FAR, you could see contracts move to lower levels of pricing within FAR ranges that sort of incorporate the knowledge about the after-tax benefits. How do you see this playing out, which direction do you see this going over the next few years?","Wes Bush","Doug, let me give you my take on that because we could all hypothesize that we could see a lot of changes in the regulatory manner that might sort of wipe out the benefits of tax reform. All I can say is, industry is going to be very responsive on the positive side or the negative side. I just talked about tax reform being a strong motivator for the increased capital investments that we're making and our ability to continue strong R&D investments.","Should there be a view that regulation is ought to change to take some of that benefit away, I think it would be self-defeating for our customer community, because it ultimately would discourage us from investing on their behalf, it would discourage us from the type of things that we need to be doing to support their capacity and technology needs for the long term. We are a business and we have to make decisions in that context.","So, I'm sure there were maybe some folks who might look at this through a very narrow lens and read some bad conclusions, but hopefully those with a broader view of economic realities will see this the way it's intended, which is tax reform is intended to help grow our economy, and to do that we've all got to step up and make investments and get things done the right way. And if the incentives for doing that get flipped over the other direction, the behaviors will flip over the other direction. So, I really think it's that clear.","So, while as I said there may be some who look at this through a narrow optic and don't really understand the broader views, I certainly hope and would proceed with the team that we've got at the Pentagon at the senior level that a more strategic view would stay in place. And this goes by the way as well to folks on the Hill. There was a lot of support on the Hill for making sure that we're doing the right things for defense, including encouraging investment, and tax reform is a big part of that.","So, we can always get caught up in the possibilities of what might happen, but as always, industry will react one way or the other, and right now I'm pleased to see industry reacting in a positive way and driving investment.","Douglas Harned","But Wes, as an earlier question that touched on this, because if you think of a program, a proposal, and let's say the DoD decided to make the margin less at an operating level, but it you or others looked at that and on an after-cash basis, on an ROIC basis, that program now made sense to invest in, wouldn't you expect that people might be willing to accept a slightly lower operating margin if the all-in cash return was still there?","Wes Bush","No, that's what I would \u2013 maybe I didn't do a good job of describing it, but I would call that a decision on the margin, not to use the exact margin term you were using, but those are sort of incremental decisions. And if you're down to the point where on a bid you are scratching to get an incremental amount of margin, you're probably not doing the right things in terms of your architecture or your cost structure.","So I would actually argue there are other things you ought to be thinking about doing to get your returns there than relying on the increment from tax reform. That's not the place we found ourselves in, in some of these major bid decisions that we've looked at, and I won't go through them over the last years, but a number of them for those who did take the business on, a little bit of change in the tax rate would not have made a difference in their \u2013 whether or not they made or lost money.","And so, I'd be careful about just looking at this as sort of a narrow impact on the decision space. It's more about the way some of these bids are fundamentally architected.","Douglas Harned","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr","So, your guide for 2018 has AS up approximately $1 billion, and kind of as I look at my model, the two big drivers are the black work and F-35, and given that F-35 at AS was not up as much as it was in MS, it would look like it's got some catch-up. So, in my model, F-35 and the black work grow at approximately comparable levels, and you said that F-35 probably has some more margin upside going forward. And if I put those two thoughts together, I would think that the margins at AS this year would be, comp would be flat, and yet you have them down somewhat. What am I just missing in all of that?","Kathy J. Warden","So, I'll start, Cai, and then ask Ken to add on. But you are right, the restricted work and the F-35 work are two major drivers to the AS growth next year. As Ken was alluding, we saw significant ramp during the course of 2017. We still have some of that ahead of us on F-35 in 2018. We are completing LRIP 10 and beginning to work LRIP 11. So we still have some growth toward full rate production there at AS.","And so, those two drivers, both contribute to being at lower margin rate than we will realize once we hit full rate production. So, in the case of restricted, it's early-phase development work and in the case of F-35 we are marching our way up the curve toward those full rate production margins.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","So just following up on Cai's question, the implication to me would be that we get into 2019 that the margin probably goes up, so that this year would mark the low point for the margin. Would that be a correct assumption?","Wes Bush","George, as you know, we won't guide for 2019, but all I would say for all of our businesses is, we continue to use an incentive system that motivates the businesses to grow operating margin over time, and I've found over the years our team is quite responsive to those incentives. So, we'll see how things work out, but right now we can only guide for 2018.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield","And Wes, I would just reference to your earlier comment that we certainly continue to pursue other development work including GBSD and on the downselect and next-gen Joint STARS and some others, and as we are or to the extent we are successful on those, we certainly could see some mix pressure that would further resolve from that beyond 2018.","Wes Bush","Yes, absolutely.","Steve Movius","So, Dahana, I think we can take one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton.","Pete Skibitski","Wes, I'd love to hear your thoughts about the [new management] [ph] strategy that was revealed recently, and of course we had a leak of the Nuclear Posture Review as well and they are talking about a lot of specific modernization areas that are needed, was wondering if you saw Northrop's capabilities kind of line up well with those lanes, were you surprised by anything, and does it kind of support or reinforce your decision that you made on OA?","Wes Bush","I would say just broadly, Pete, this is what we've been getting ready for, for a long time. We're ready to support the strategy that's laid out. Our capabilities are in incredibly tight alignment with where we see the nation going as reflected in those strategies. And I am really excited about the Orbital ATK acquisition and the merger of our two companies. I think we're going to be able to help our customer. It's a very pro-competitive pulling together here of the companies' complementary capabilities, and I think it's just highly supportive and highly aligned with what I see as the team in the Pentagon, and more broadly the national security team, has pulled together with these strategies. So, I'm looking forward to us being able to help a lot.","Steve Movius","This concludes the Q&A. Wes, any final comments?","Wes Bush","Just to wrap up again, thanking our team for their incredibly great work in 2017. We keep raising the bar here in our Company on performance and I'm just delighted to see how our team embraces the opportunity to excel. So, thanks everyone for joining us on the call today and thanks for your continuing interest in our Company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Derek, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year-end 2013 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com.","Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal security laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially.","Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in the supplemental PowerPoint presentation. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush","Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As I look back on 2013, a year characterized by a great deal of uncertainty, it's gratifying to have achieved strong performance. We met or exceeded our guidance for every metric, and that's due to the hard work and dedication of our entire team. So I'm going to start our call today by congratulating our employees on a job well done in 2013.","Our financial results for the year demonstrate the benefit of superior program performance. We continue to focus on reducing costs, innovating for affordability, meeting program commitments to our customers, shaping our portfolio and, of course, generating cash and deploying our cash to create long-term value.","Our sectors continue to produce strong segment operating margin rates. Although we had slightly lower segment operating income, the benefit of our share repurchases more than helped offset the EPS impact.","Full year diluted earnings per share rose 7%, and on a pension-adjusted basis, 2013 diluted earnings per share increased 5.5%. Cash generation was also strong. For the year, before the impact of pension prefunding, we generated cash from operations of $2.8 billion and free cash flow of $2.4 billion. On a reported basis, free cash flow of $2.1 billion represents a free cash flow yield of approximately 13% and net income conversion of 109%.","In 2013, we used our cash to invest in our businesses, fund our pension plans, repurchase stock and pay dividends. Our capital spending increased by approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter, as we ramped up our investments in our Aerospace Systems Centers of Excellence.","In addition, we made a $500 million discretionary pension contribution and we repurchased 27.3 million shares of our common stock for $2.4 billion. As of yearend, we repurchased 20.8 million shares toward our previously announced goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015, market conditions permitting.","Share repurchases in 2013 reduced our weighted average diluted share count by approximately 8%. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 11% last year and paid shareholders dividends of $545 million. In 2013, we distributed nearly $3 billion of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This represents approximately 140% of reported free cash flow. Cash from the balance sheet was more than $5 billion at yearend, reflecting the $2 billion of net new debt we raised last year and substantial cash generated by our operations.","So as I look at 2013 performance, I'm particularly proud of our results in the context of last year's challenging U.S. government budget environment.","In contrast to the challenges in the U.S. market last year, we are seeing growth in our international business. In 2013, we grew our international sales by approximately 20% to $2.5 billion. International sales were slightly more than 10% of total revenue in 2013. Our Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems sectors both posted higher sales for the year, and growth in international business was a significant contributor to top line growth for those sectors.","At AS, the wrap up on NATO AGS contributed to their sales growth. And for ES, growth in their core portfolio of international offerings was a driver of their top line growth in 2013. We see emerging opportunities around the globe that our portfolio should allow us to address.","In 2014, we expect international sales to increase to approximately 13% of total revenue. Beyond 2014, we see growing demand for our unmanned platforms, manned military aircraft, airborne surveillance, electronics, cyber, sustainment and other offerings.","We captured new awards of $21.9 billion in 2013 for a book-to-bill of 89%, and we began 2014 with a total backlog of $37 billion. Awards in 2013 were impacted and in some cases moved to the right as a result of budget uncertainty and turmoil.","Now that we have a budget, we and our customers can plan with more confidence compared to where we were at this time last year. We're still in a difficult and evolving budget environment, but we now have a 2014 appropriations bill that provides program direction. And importantly, the Bipartisan Budget Act passed in December set discretionary spending levels for both 2014 and 2015. We expect this will alleviate some budget cuts that would have occurred if sequestration had been triggered again. These actions reduced some of our customers' budgeting uncertainty and increased their ability to make strategic spending decisions.","Overall, we're pleased with the 2014 budget outcomes for our programs, but it continues to be a challenging U.S. budget environment in terms of absolute dollars spent on national security. And we expect that we'll be continuing pressure on the investment accounts, especially for research and development. As our customers deal with these pressures, there is some uncertainty as to the program decisions they may make this year and in the future to conform their spending to these reduced budgets. The resolution of that near-term debt ceiling issue also poses some additional uncertainty.","We understand the need for disciplined spending to address our nation's fiscal challenges. How we get there needs to be rational and supportive of maintaining our technological superiority and our national security. Our nation needs a balanced strategic approach to our fiscal challenges. We need to recognize that to assure our technological advantage over the longer term, our country must invest in the near term.","Now turning to guidance for 2014, we expect sales to range between $23.5 billion and $23.8 billion, with earnings per share of $8.70 to $9, cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. At the midpoint, our sales guidance implies a top line decline of approximately $1 billion or 4%. Jim will provide more detail, but more than half of the change reflects continued pressure in our short-cycle businesses: Information Systems and Technical Services. The remainder of the variance reflects our expectations for lower volume in some programs in Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems, somewhat offset by our growing international sales in these sectors.","But considering all of these factors together, I see 2014 as another year of good opportunities for our company with continued strong cash generation and cash deployment to create value. Our guidance contemplates continued share repurchases that support our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015.","In conclusion, our 2013 results demonstrate strong performance in a challenging environment, and our priorities remain the same in 2014: driving performance, effectively deploying our cash and optimizing our portfolio for the future.","Our record these past few years demonstrates that we can do this successfully, and I'm delighted to be working with our company's talented team to create long-term sustained value.","So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?","James F. Palmer","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I also want to add my congratulations to our team on their outstanding work this past year. We performed very well in a tough, challenging and uncertain environment and, importantly, sustained the performance improvements we generated in 2012. Our teams' efforts led to another excellent year for our company.","So let me spend a few minutes and review those results. Segment operating margin rate was 12.5% in 2013 versus 12.6% in 2012. On a year-over-year basis, net favorable adjustments declined by $232 million. This decline was partially offset by higher contract margin rates, resulting from several factors, including the continuing effect of prior net favorable adjustments across our portfolio of contracts.","Total operating margin rate for the year improved 30 basis points, primarily due to a $49 million decrease in corporate and unallocated expenses and an improvement in our net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment. Corporate unallocated expenses improved due to lower provisions for disallowed cost and litigation matters as well as the favorable settlement of overhead claims, partially offset by changes in state deferred tax assets.","On a pension-adjusted basis, our operating margin rate increased to 12%, a new record for the company. As Wes mentioned, 2013 cash generation was outstanding and a real performance highlight.","Before the impact of our voluntary pension pre-funding, cash from operations totaled $2.8 billion, which is comparable to 2012. Free cash flow before pension contributions totaled $2.4 billion and more than $10 per share.","During 2013, we distributed approximately $3 billion to our shareholders or more than $12 per share. Based on the average daily share price during 2013, our cash distribution yield per share was approximately 14%. And in addition to the cash distribution yield, our share price increased 70%. So it really was an exceptional year for the company and for our shareholders.","Let me spend a few minutes now and talk about 2013 sector results and provide some thoughts on 2014 guidance for each of the businesses.","Aerospace Systems fourth quarter sales declined by 7%. You might remember that AS had a particularly strong fourth quarter in 2012, so this was a difficult comparison. Aerospace Systems fourth quarter margin rate declined to 11.5% from 13.8% last year. And again, you may recall that 2012 had an unusually high fourth quarter margin rate that benefited from a couple of large positive adjustments in space programs.","For the year, AS sales totaled $10 billion, slightly higher than in 2012 and margin rate of 12.1% in 2013 is comparable to the prior year. For 2014, we expect AS sales to range from $9.7 billion and $9.9 billion with a margin rate in the mid to high 11% range.","The expected sales volume reflect lower volumes for our programs like Global Hawk, Fire Scout, E-2 and the James Webb Space Telescope, partially offset by expectations for higher volume from NATO AGS and the E-2D.","Electronic Systems also had outstanding results this year. Fourth quarter sales increased 6% due to higher volume for space programs, international and combat avionics, and fourth quarter margin rate declined due to somewhat lower net favorable adjustments. And for the year, ES sales increased 3%, reflecting volume in space and international programs, while maintaining a robust 17.1% margin rate.","For 2014, we expect ES revenues will range between $6.8 billion and $7 billion, and top line guidance for ES contemplates slightly lower volume due to some continued impact from force reductions in overseas contingency operations and lower revenues for some radar programs, partially offset by higher international sales. We expect ES operating margin rate in the low- to mid-15% range for 2014. And although lower than 2013, I think it's still very healthy and indicative of continued strong execution at ES.","Information Systems; sales declined by 14% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the year. Declines in both periods reflect lower funding levels, including the impact of sequestration and government shutdown and lower volume due to in-theater force reductions as well as some contract completions.","In addition for 2013, the transfer of intercompany sales by our shared services organization reduced sales by almost $100 million. And excluding the transfer, sales would have declined by 9%.","ES maintained a strong 9.9% operating margin rate in the fourth quarter. And for the year, margin rate was 9.6%, which is about 70 basis points lower than last year, largely due to a $73 million decrease in net favorable adjustments. For 2014, we expect IS sales will range between $6.1 billion and $6.2 billion, a decline of about 7% due to the continued in-theater force reductions, wind down of several programs and lower funding across a number of our contracts. We expect IS to maintain a strong mid-9% operating margin rate in 2014.","Moving to Technical Services, fourth quarter and 2013 sales both declined by 6%. Trends in both periods reflect lower volume for integrated logistics and modernization programs at the KC-10 as well as the ICBM program restructuring.","Operating income for both the fourth quarter and the year reflect lower sales, partially offset by improved performance. Operating margin rate expanded by 40 basis points in the fourth quarter and 30 basis points for the year. High margin rates for both periods reflect improved performance across several programs.","For 2014, we expect TS sales of approximate $2.7 billion, a decline of about 5% reflecting lower funding and in-theater force reductions as well as some lower volume for the ICBM program. For margin rates, we expect a high 8% margin rate for TS in 2014. So on a consolidated basis, we expect 2014 segment operating margin rate will be in the high 11% range.","Turning to pension items, our 2013 planned asset investment returns were slightly more than 8%. So on a GAAP basis, our funded status of our plans increased to 93% at the end of 2013 from 83% at the end of 2012. Due to higher interest rates, the discount rate has increased to 4.99% from 4.12% at the beginning of the year, and we are maintaining our 8% long-term rate of return expectation as well.","So based on those assumptions, we expect 2014 FAS expense of approximately $115 million, a decline of about $260 million from 2013. And we expect our CAS recovery to be approximately $555 million, which was an amount comparable to 2013.","I should point out that, that CAS amount could move up or down by about $40 million, dependent upon actual participant demographics, and we would expect to know those results in the third quarter of 2014. At this point, we expect our net FAS pension adjustment will be income of approximately $440 million or an improvement of $272 million from 2013.","We expect 2014 corporate unallocated expenses to return to a more normal level in the range of, let's say, $150 million to $200 million compared to $119 million in 2013. And as I pointed out, 2013 included some nonrecurring items that reduced corporate unallocated expenses that we don't expect to repeat in 2014. When we consider all of that, we would expect total operating margin rate in the high 12% in 2014.","For interest expense, we expect interest expense of approximately $285 million, up from $257 million in 2013, with the additional interest expense reflecting a higher debt level for the full year of 2014. We expect a tax rate of about 32% to 32.5% in '14 versus the 31.8% in 2013. And as I know you all know, that 2013 tax rate included a benefit, actually, for 2 years of R&D tax credits of $37 million, and our 2014 expected effective tax rate does not include an R&D tax credit, which, at this point, has expired, but it does include the benefit of the expected resolution of the IRS exams for the tax years 2007 through 2009. And our 2014 earnings per share guidance of $8.70 to $9 contemplates a 8% reduction in weighted average shares outstanding to approximately 215 million shares, which is, again, a reduction similar to what we saw in 2013.","We expect cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. The cash guidance does include the benefit of 2014's lower pension contributions net of income taxes, which is essentially offset by lower segment operating margin. The other major variable is working capital, which has the potential to be plus or minus $100 million. At this point, due to the strong funded status of our pension plans, our required contributions in 2014 are only $74 million.","Our free cash flow guidance does include a ramp-up in capital spending to about $600 million into 2014. I would expect that -- this level of capital spending to continue for the next couple of years. At the same time, I expect the required cash contributions -- cash pension contributions in 2015 and 2016 will also remain low, likely less than $100 million, while CAS pension recoveries are also likely to increase.","So in summary, our guidance contemplates solid operating performance and strong cash generation in 2014. Barring any major disruption to any of our major programs, we expect this type of performance to continue beyond 2014, which will allow us to make additional investments in our business, while continuing to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy that returns a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. So, Steve, with that introduction, I think we're ready for Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] And with that, Derek, we are ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from the line of Finbar Sheehy, Sanford Bernstein.","Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You had a pretty impressive run on the share price this past year, and you talked about reducing share count, distributing cash that way to shareholders. So I'm just wondering if there's a point which the share price would give you pause, or [ph] how you think about balancing cash to share repurchases to other uses if the share price moves up.","James F. Palmer","Well, we did talk and have talked for quite a while about a balanced cash deployment strategy, investing in our business, managing the balance sheet, competitive dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders. We do take a long-term view of the company, its portfolio, the strength of the portfolio, the cash generation capability of our company, and all those factors go into our thoughts around our share repurchase program. So I think that pretty well sums up our thinking. It really has not changed from where we've been over the last number of years. As I tried to say in my summary comments, barring any major program changes, I would expect the performance that we've had in '13 to continue into '14 and likely beyond.","Finbar T. Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So yes, you don't have a sort of price where you think about...","James F. Palmer","We make decisions, essentially, every day around our repurchase program. We tend to approach our repurchase program with a 10b5-1 program that we put in place for a period of time based on a grid that does vary the amount of purchases based on share price. Now we look at that grid on a regular basis whenever we put a new program in place.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jason Gursky, Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, I was wondering if you could maybe just walk us through the various puts and takes in guidance, and what would cause you to reach both the bottom end of guidance and the top end, just kind of where the risks lie as we move through the years so we can kind of track things.","James F. Palmer","Well, as I thought about the guidance range and, essentially, the sector operating margins, probably the biggest variable is both AS and ES, our largest segments, those would be probably the largest variables. And really, it's going to come down to individual program performance. Largely, in those 2 sectors, I would think, would be the major variables. I don't know that we're going to have a lot of movement around necessarily the other 2 sectors. And tax rate probably has a little variance around it and corporate allocations. Unallocated costs always have some variance to it. And then frankly, the other variable would be weighted average shares per year.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounded to me from kind of pure operations perspective is just execution on both [ph] the programs that are already in the contract, that there's no reliance on the budget that's coming up and new signings to get things to where you need to be for the year?","James F. Palmer","Yes. Our business, much of it comes from the backlog in the current year. A little bit less so at IS, but for the 2 other longer-cycle businesses, much of it has come from the backlog. The other variable, frankly, would be individual program decisions that may be made during the year that, obviously, if we had a termination of a program, of a major program, unexpected at this point of time, that could be a variable as well.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So, Wes, when we look at backlog and bookings, the funded backlog was down 12%. The overall backlog, I guess, including unfunded, was down 9%. Your sales guidance is, middle of the range, down 4% for 2014. So I guess, it's a single 1-part question, but really with a couple of components. Can you offer a bookings guidance for the year to give us some sense if you expect backlog to come back a little bit at some point? And if not, when does that decline in backlog start accelerating your sales declines?","Wesley G. Bush","Each year, we think hard about what's in front of us in terms of the competitive environment and what our customers may or may not do. In my remarks earlier, I noted that we saw in 2013 just a general perspective in many parts of our customer community that made it difficult for them to pursue the awarding of new contracts as aggressively as I think many of them would have wanted to. And we saw some things move to the right. We may see some more of that this year. Clearly, the investment accounts continue to be under some pressure in '14 and I think in '15 as well, as the department wrestles to the ground what it's actually going to do with the appropriated amounts that are out there. And we all know it takes a little bit longer to deal with force structure and investments become a little bit more the variable as we get through that. So how do we look at '14 in that regard? I think there's going to be real pressure in the investment accounts this year just as there was last year. I think we'll gain a little bit more insight into that as we get the president's budget and can see with a little bit more clarity how the department is sorting through the profile that's going to be using to navigate through '14 and '15 as it looks forward to '16. But getting out in front of that right now, I think, would be a little bit premature. Clearly, we always want to push for a good book-to-bill, but the message that we've given the team, and I think it's important for everyone to understand, is we're looking at quality in the business not just quantity. We want to make sure that we're doing things in a way that's going to ensure that we can continue to grow our value. So that's the domestic side. The other part that I commented on in my remarks was international. We expect to see that continuing to grow this year, and there are some opportunities there that would add to the backlog as well. So we're looking at it comprehensively, and I think that's probably about the breadth of the remark I can make on book-to-bill at this point.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I mean, we do have a 2014 budget at this point. It's 2015 that we're waiting for. I know, of course, it's very important, but most of your bookings this year would come out of '13 and '14 anyway domestically. So at...","Wesley G. Bush","Yes. What I was referring to there is when the 2015 president's budget gets put on the table I think we'll have a better insight into potential award profiles over the next few years. And since your question related to book-to-bill and not so much sales, that award profile really drives more the book-to-bill perspective.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland, Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","At the risk of being extra boring, I'm going to ask you, Jim, about a topic so near and dear to your heart, and that's pension. I know you like it so much, so I wondered if you might be able to help us step through what the FAS\/CAS adjustment would be with no changes in assumptions if you were to look out to 2015 and 2016?","James F. Palmer","Well, you're really asking me to get my crystal ball out, aren't you?","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, no change to assumptions, no crystal ball. We'll pretend nothing ever moves.","James F. Palmer","And we all know that's really the case.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A great assumption, I know.","James F. Palmer","Yes. But to answer your question, if I were to look ahead for the next couple years with no change in assumptions, I probably would see net FAS\/CAS moving up about in the range of 200 to 225 each year '15 and '16, which essentially means that FAS is going to hold about constant where it is and CAS will move up by about that amount each year as we look through time. As you probably know, a big part of that is due to CAS harmonization. And as we go through time, that CAS harmonization does phase in. And by the end of 4 years, it's completely phased in. But CAS harmonization is essentially much more of a settlement concept, meaning heavily dependent upon interest rates, and so to the extent that interest rates do fluctuate over a period of time, that could drive a rather significant change in those assumptions around CAS, particularly in the latter years.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I use some of the numbers, what you've put in terms of percentage of sales of international, it would seem like you're going to get another 20-plus percent kind of growth this year. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's driving that growth, and somewhat related, what competitions we should be watching to unfold this year.","Wesley G. Bush","There are several things sort of across the board driving growth. Clearly, our electronics business has historically been our strongest performing internationally, and they continue to do very well in that regard. And in terms of the breadth of their footprint and the breadth of their offerings, I think we're just going to continue to see electronics have a number of broad opportunities scattered around the globe, quite frankly. The area, though, that's perhaps new in our story with respect to international is unmanned, and we've started that process with the capture of NATO AGS. And that program continues to go well and it was kind of moving up its curve, if you will, in terms of the volume it represents for Aerospace Systems. Over the course of this year, an important one to watch, of course, will be Global Hawk for Korea. And it's -- it, too, is I think a very important milestone, both in terms of the program itself, but also in terms of what it represents for exportability of this class of capability to our allies around the globe. So that's an area that, from my perspective, is one that's going to be important as we look to the future. Now our other businesses, IS and TS, also have international opportunities that range from the work that we're doing in C4ISR to Cyber to sustainment. So it's a fairly broad-based activity that we're seeing in terms of the international opportunity space in front of us. And we're, of course, thoughtful and we want to make sure that each of the steps that we take on an international basis is aligned with what our allies really need and what our customer community can support. But I will tell you that we've been seeing an increasing focus within the DoD to help make sure that our allies are able to access the capabilities that they need to both be interoperable as well as to be a bigger part of the overall global security equation. And so I'm cautiously optimistic that, that trend will continue and that we'll continue to see this expansion of footprint opportunities.","Operator","Your next question is from Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to clarify one thing. I may have misheard it. But the CapEx number for '14 and go forward of $600 million? I'm just not sure I got that right. I haven't seen you guys do that since you owned a shipbuilder.","James F. Palmer","Well, we are looking at around $600 million in '14. And I do think the CapEx will stay -- I don't know if it's going to be at $600 million in '15 or so, but it's going to be higher than it's been over the last couple of years. You might remember in the first part of 2013, actually first quarter, we announced Aerospace Systems Centers of Excellence, moving some businesses down in there and expanding our operations down in Florida. So we're adding to capabilities down there and we're going to be building that out over the next 1.5 years for sure, maybe even a little bit longer.","Wesley G. Bush","And, Myles, it's Wes. I would just say that from a broader perspective, that Centers of Excellence approach does a number of things for us. It helps us, over the longer term, on our affordability, which I think is a critical part of our competitiveness. It also helps us in terms of better managing our human capital base and being able to concentrate our activities in a more integrated manner and take maximum advantage of the skill sets that we have. So this is an important part of our longer-term strategy, and from our perspective, investing in our business makes a lot more sense.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it, okay. And the real question was on the favorable adjustment. It sounds like they were down $230 million, so the underlying margins were quite strong, even with that decline. And so I'm curious, what kind of profile you've built in or baked in for '14 versus '13 in the high 11s in the segment margins.","James F. Palmer","Our margin guidance, Myles, is based really on our expectation for the overall margins in each of the businesses as opposed to any [ph] expectation, if you will, around individual team catch-up adjustments. As you know, we've looked at our businesses and our competitors' businesses that are similar to ours and how they view of what the benchmark margin rates ought to be for each of those businesses, and we're [ph] driving our organization to perform at the top end of those ranges. So it's really based much more on expectations, what the business ought to do. Clearly, we have an understanding of margins in our backlog, and all of those become factors in our thinking about margin rate guidance for the year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ron Epstein, Bank of America.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a big picture question. When we think about maybe 2 things, so one on the financial side. When you complete the current buyback plan, you will have, I think, bought back about half the company, incrementally, over the last 8 years approximately. Why not just buy it all back at once? Why chase the stock higher? You know what I mean? I mean, why not take the company private? I mean, have you thought about it? Any thoughts you have on that?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes. It's Wes. Let me give you kind of a broader view. Yes, when we think about capital deployment and the approach that we think that makes the most sense, we often use the term balanced approach because we want to be investing in our business. We want to obviously take care of our pension plan as we go along, which we've been very good stewards of doing over the last number of years, as well as returning cash to shareholders. And ultimately, when we think about that overall longer-term perspective, the path that we've been on for a number of years is what has made the most sene to us. And as we've talked about our outlook for this year, we've been pretty clear that, that path continues to make the most sense to us. We go through, as every company does, a periodic review of our full range of alternatives. And as we do that, we think about what really does make the most sense for our shareholders over the longer term as well, and that has led us to the conclusion that it has put us on the path that we're on, and we continue to see that as a very, very good path. And as we indicated in our remarks, we remain focused on our goal of retiring the shares that we've outlined through the end of 2015. Trying to project where we'll be beyond the end of 2015 at this point would be, I think, a little bit too speculative. But to answer your question directly, we do think about that broad range of alternatives. And as a conclusion of that thinking, we're doing what we're doing.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just jumping over and out to more program-specific stuff. How should we think about the transition in the airplane business as we see probably F-18s start ramping down and F-35s ramp up? Is there -- how do you view the margin exchange there? I mean, is there some margin headwind? How do they offset each other?","James F. Palmer","Well, clearly, F-18 is a mature production program. We're not quite there yet on F-35. So as we transition, there may be a little bit of an impact there. But frankly, our aerospace sector is much broader than F-18s and F-35s. E-2D is an important part of that portfolio. The space part is there, equally important part, as well as the unmanned portion of the portfolio. All factors, all factor into the overall margin rates at Aerospace Systems. Again, when we look at our competitors in that business, the margins that we've been generating, I think, are really strong margins for the type of business we're in. And we'll continue to manage that business as best we really can.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe just one last one. On the investment side again, when we think about -- and there's been some of this in the press and I realize you're limited what you can say. But on this next-generation bomber program, given you guys teamed up against a formidable other team, will we expect a ramp up of kind of internal R&D money on that given the importance of that program potentially to the company in the future?","Wesley G. Bush","Ron, it's Wes. I think all I can say there is that clearly we have a strong legacy in the business of providing bombers to the United States Air Force. We're proud of that history and our capability in that regard. And I think our shareholders should count on us to do the things that we think are appropriate to continue to position our company for the long term there. I think that's about all I can say on it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Jim, as I take a look at your margin guidance for this year, my question is, is this just the typical conservatism that you put in early in the year? Or is this really the beginning of a trend to get back to some of those normalized margins that you brought up I don't know how many years ago for which you've been way over-earning?","James F. Palmer","George, George, George. We look at our business every year based on -- as I said, we know what's in our backlog. We have expectations what the business ought to be able to generate. Frankly, if I look at guidance for each of our businesses versus performance over the last couple of years, other than ES, the guidance is very close to what they actually have been performing at over the last couple of years. ES, on the other hand, had just an outstanding 2012 and 2013. And again, when I look at a competitive situation, those kind of margin rates on a long-term basis in that business, I just don't know that we can maintain them over that long time -- long-term period. Low- to mid-15s is really strong margins for our business. And so I'm very comfortable with our guidance for this year. There's always a possibility of changes as we go through the year, as we see actual performance. So could they do better? History would say they probably could. I look further back, history would say they could probably be a little bit worse. So on balance, I think, again, it reflects our best judgment at this point in time, of where we think each of these businesses are going to be able to perform for the year.","George Shapiro","Okay. And let me just ask for Wes your comment on the Jammer contract that Raytheon won. Do you have any color you might share?","Wesley G. Bush","No, nothing beyond I think what we talked about in the past. We take each of these competitions and approach them as we think is the right approach for our ability to offer and our customers' ability to offer. And when we don't win, we take that very seriously and go back and scrub and try and learn our best lessons from it. But I don't -- other than as I said what we've communicated on that in the past, I don't think we have any new perspective. It continues to be an important business area for us. The whole EW field is one that I think is going to continue to grow. So nothing about that particular outcome causes us to reevaluate being in this business. If anything, it causes us to just learn some lessons and redouble our efforts here. We think that's a very important business area.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss, UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to come at this margin question in a little bit different way. Wes, I guess the guidance for lower margins, does it speak to anything around the cost reduction opportunity that you see in the company today relative to what you've been able to do over the last couple of years relative to headcount? Or maybe at this point, some of those savings actually starting to find their way back to DoD as contracts reprice?","Wesley G. Bush","Your perspective is correct. We're in a business where the results of our cost reduction activities ultimately go back to our customer over time as we go into new contracts, and that's good. I mean that's as an important part of the way our industry works. It helps us to drive affordability for our customer community during a period of time when, obviously, their budgets are under a lot more pressure. But at the same time, when we're talking about profitability, part of the challenge and opportunity that we have is to continue to figure out how to do things at an inherently lower cost, use some of the innovative capacity in our enterprise to do that, so that we do have the opportunity to continue to make a good profit on what we're doing. So there's always a balance point in this. I would say our guidance obviously reflects where we think we are in our full set of contracts from a total cost perspective and affordability perspective. But let me also be clear that we're going to continue to drive affordability. Yes, we have taken a lot of actions over the last few years to enhance our competitiveness and to reduce cost, both in headcount and in footprint, as well as in a broad variety of efficiencies in our enterprise. You're never done at working on cost, and we're going to stay at that. It continues to be an opportunity in front of us. But clearly, as we think about guidance on margin rates, we factor in that aspect, the aspect of how we price on new contracts, as well as, obviously, what Jim said, our broader view of how these businesses should perform.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. In terms of a follow-up, on the international side, with that ramping up as a percentage of the overall business, is that -- I would assume it's additive to the margin profile. And then would you expect some of that work to bring -- to benefit you on the advancement side of things?","Wesley G. Bush","On international, yes, generally, our margin rates in international are a bit more attractive than the domestic business, not universally, but overall. In aggregate, they are. And depending on the type of contract, whether it's FMS or if it's a sale, in some cases, yes, that can help on advances. But each and every one of these is a negotiation. So we deal with them sort of one at a time as opposed to in aggregate.","Operator","At this time, I'm showing no further questions the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Wes Bush for any closing remarks.","Wesley G. Bush","Thanks, Eric. I just would say thanks, everyone, for continuing to be interested in our company. As I said in my earlier remarks, we're very pleased with the outcome for 2013, given the challenges of the environment in which we operated. It is a reflection of the hard work and dedication of the team across our company. And I think, quite frankly, it's also a reflection given how difficult last year was in our customer community. It's a reflection of the partnership that we have with our customers. They went through some pretty tough times last year. And I think as a nation, we should all recognize and respect what our customer communities had to deal with in navigating through 2013. We all feel a little bit better about where we are from a budget perspective in 2014, having an appropriations process that's back closer to normal. We hope that continues. We hope that we can get back to regular order on a more regular basis and see this as the path that will allow our customer community and our industry to plan and to do the things that are necessary to ensure our national security. So thanks, everyone. Appreciate your continuing interest and look forward to the opportunity to interact with many of you over the coming months as we prepare and launch into 2014.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is Jamie, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Jamie, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2018 conference call.","Before we start, please understand the matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws.","Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release.","We have posted a slide deck to our IR website that summarizes our guidance, updates the three years of pension information we previously provided, and includes a five-year schedule of amortization of purchased intangibles and the step-up in depreciation of acquired property, plant and equipment.","On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman and CEO; Kathy Warden, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I want to start the call by thanking our entire team for their continued focus on execution and performance. Our third quarter results demonstrated robust performance with topline growth and strong operational execution. The quarter included the first full quarter of results for Innovation Systems. Based on our strong performance, we're increasing our guidance for the year. Kathy and Ken will review the operational and financial results.","I'm delighted to note that for the first time in a decade, the Department of Defense begins this fiscal year without a continuing resolution. The fiscal year 2019 defense appropriation bill received very strong bipartisan support, passing the Senate with a 93 to 7 vote. We view this support as well as the administration's focus on accelerating innovation efforts as signals that the Congress and the administration are aggressively addressing the threats emerging across multiple domains and are increasing our nation's pace of modernization and investment.","Our own programs continue to be well supported in the budget, and our portfolio is well-balanced between mature franchise production efforts and the development programs that will ultimately lead to the next generation of production programs.","In the context of an improving budget environment, we've aggressively invested in supporting our customers' need for advancing capabilities, including the addition of Innovation Systems, while also driving affordability. We're focused on performing on our current programs and pursuing attractive new programs in our robust opportunity set.","Overall, I'm very pleased with our team's year-to-date accomplishments, and I'm excited about the many opportunities before us. I'm also excited about the future of our company under Kathy's leadership. She has demonstrated a solid focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders, and she brings the leadership capabilities and values to lead our great company forward.","So, let me turn the call over to Kathy to give us an update on our third quarter results. Kathy?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Wes. Good afternoon, everyone. Wes, I want to first express our gratitude for the way you've led our team in creating value, while always maintaining the highest standards of ethics and integrity. On behalf of the entire Northrop Grumman team, we thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Kathy.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","My comments today will address third quarter financial and operational highlights for each of the sectors, including a status on our Innovation Systems integration.","Beginning with our financial results, the businesses generated solid topline growth and strong segment operating income and margin rates during the quarter. Sales increased 23% to $8.1 billion, reflecting a full quarter of Innovation Systems, as well as continued topline growth at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems.","I'd also note that international sales rose 22% year-to-date and we ended the quarter with total backlog of $52.6 billion. We continue to see strong demand from international customers. At the end of the third quarter, Japan announced their decision to purchase an additional nine E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes, bringing their total planned E-2D purchase to 13 aircraft.","Third quarter segment operating income increased 29% and our segment operating margin rate increased 60 basis points to 12.1%. In addition to this quarter's strong operating performance, third quarter financial results benefited from the settlement of cost claims as well as a lower tax rate. These factors combined to generate a 78% increase in third quarter net earnings and earnings per share.","As a result of our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are increasing our guidance for 2018 earnings per share to a range of $18.75 to $19.00.","Turning to cash and capital deployment, our strategy remains the same: Invest in the business, manage the balance sheet and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","During the quarter, after reflecting the discretionary pension contribution, cash from operations totaled $812 million and $1.45 billion year-to-date, and free cash flow was $530 million for the quarter and $664 million year-to-date. Based on those year-to-date results, we are increasing our guidance for free cash flow to a range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion.","So now, let me touch on our sector highlights. At Aerospace Systems and Manned Aircraft, we continue to ramp up on restricted activities and the F-35. We're on track to deliver 116 F-35 center fuselages this year, which represents a 25% sales increase over 2017.","In Autonomous Systems, we announced the delivery of a Global Hawk autonomous aircraft carrying the Battlefield Airborne Communication (sic) [Communications] Node, or BACN, to the U.S. Air Force. We have received another contract to augment a BACN-equipped Global Hawk with the capability to link fifth generation fighters with fourth generation fighters and forces on the ground. Global Hawk will be the first operational aircraft to provide this valuable capability.","And in Space, the Northrop Grumman team was down-selected to compete for the mission satellite payloads on the Next Gen OPIR GEO missile-warning system. The competitive phase of the program will include development scope through critical design review. This successor program to SBIRS, on which we were the payload incumbent, is an example of the Air Force's go-fast acquisition strategy to develop Advanced Capabilities. The final down-select is expected at the end of 2020.","At Innovation Systems, shortly after the end of the quarter, we were awarded a $792 million launch services OTA for the development of the OmegA rocket for the evolved expendable launch vehicle program. This agreement runs through 2024 and includes certification flights of OmegA's intermediate variant in 2021 and its heavy variant in 2024.","Three providers were selected in this phase to develop commercial launch solutions in order to have at least two domestic commercial launch service providers that meet national security requirements.","IS also supported two important launches during the quarter; the Parker Solar Probe and the final Delta II launch deploying NASA's ICESat-2 satellite. The Parker Solar Probe launch included the first ever third-stage propulsion system for the Delta IV heavy rocket. The ICESat-2 launch represented the 132nd, and final, Delta II mission for Innovation Systems.","Innovation Systems has successfully completed the first qualification test for its new rocket motor, the GEM 63, for the United Launch Alliance Atlas V after beginning the development just three years ago. The successful completion of this test enables full production to begin with a first drop-in scheduled in next summer.","Regarding integration, we remain on track to meet or exceed our cost reduction target and we continue to be very excited about both the operational and revenue synergies we expect our combination to yield.","At Mission Systems, topline growth continues to be driven by Sensor and Processing programs. During both the quarter and year-to-date, we had higher volume on restricted electro-optical\/infrared self-protection program, communications, the F-35 and the SABR radar. We achieved several significant program milestones during the quarter.","In addition to F-16 SABR upgrades for multiple customers, MS successfully installed a production SABR radar on a Marine Corps F\/A-18C, demonstrating our AESA radar's capability without aircraft systems and highlighting SABR's flexible and scalable architecture. We are competing to upgrade approximately 100 aircraft for the Marines.","Also, during the quarter, we achieved important milestones on three development programs, CIRCM and G\/ATOR in Sensors and Processing and IBCS in Advanced Capabilities. Our work on all three programs demonstrates our ability to develop affordable, modular, open-system architectures that improve capabilities, while also reducing total life-cycle costs.","On the Army's Common Infrared Countermeasure System, or CIRCM, we achieved milestone fee after undergoing rigorous testing, signifying our system maturity and production readiness. We are now moving to production on this critical life-saving technology for the Army's helicopter fleet. We received the low rate initial production order in the third quarter.","We also delivered the seventh G\/ATOR, ground-based radar system ahead of schedule to the Marine Corps. We look forward to successfully executing G\/ATOR's full rate production program, which is scheduled to begin in 2019.","In Advanced Capabilities, the Army awarded our missile defense team a $289 million contract to continue system design and development toward fielding the IBCS, which represents a paradigm shift for the Army's integrated air and missile defense.","We are working toward a flight test in late 2019, and you will recall that we also have a letter of agreement with Poland to acquire IBCS in conjunction with their Patriot purchases.","At Technology Services, our global logistics and modernization work continues to grow as we ramp up on programs like SEMA and managed total life cycle solutions for Northrop Grumman platforms and those of other OEMs. And we also captured the re-compete of the Army's Mission Command Training Program valued at $336 million over more than four years.","We've taken numerous steps to position TS for the future. And as we look to ensure we are maximizing operational efficiency and continuing to posture for growth, we will be consolidating two of our TS business areas, Advanced Defense Services and System Modernization and Services into one unit beginning in 2019.","Our company is on a positive vector. We are well-positioned to our customers' needs and we're demonstrating our ability to grow and create shareholder value. We will be providing 2019 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in late January. But looking ahead, we remain focused on achieving above-market, long-term profitable growth with strong accompanying cash flows.","We're confident that our current portfolio of programs, our domestic and global opportunity set and the revenue synergy potential of Innovation Systems supports our positive outlook for 2019 and beyond.","So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financials and our guidance.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for their performance and I'd also like to thank Wes for his outstanding leadership.","I'll briefly review our third quarter and year-to-date results and update our 2018 guidance. Overall, it was a good quarter with solid awards and sales with strong margin rates and earnings growth. I'll cover the sector results and guidance for the remainder of the year, then move to below-the-line corporate items including pension.","Turning to sector results, Aerospace Systems sales rose 5% in the quarter and are up 9% year-to-date. Higher volume during both periods continues to be driven by higher Manned Aircraft volume, principally restricted activities, and ramp-up on the F-35.","Autonomous Systems sales were also higher during both periods as we continue to ramp up on Triton production. Volume for Space was slightly lower for the quarter and year-to-date.","Aerospace operating income is up 9% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Third quarter operating margin rate increased 50 basis points to 11.5%, primarily due to improved performance in Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems programs. Year-to-date margin rate is 10.8% comparable to last year. While AS margin rates continue to reflect a higher level of early phase development work, we're quite pleased with the year-to-date performance.","Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing AS sales guidance to a range of $13 billion to $13.2 billion and we now expect AS will have a mid-to-high 10% operating margin rate for the full year.","Moving to Innovation Systems, third quarter sales totaled $1.4 billion, which, when compared with the pro forma results for last year, represents a 16% increase. Third quarter sales were higher across all three IS business areas. Defense Systems sales reflect increased armament systems and missile products volume. Higher sales for Flight Systems were primarily due to increased volume on propulsion systems and launch vehicles. The increase at Space Systems reflects higher government satellite volume.","Operating income totaled $161 million or 11.4%. Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing IS sales guidance to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion with a mid-to-high 10% margin rate.","Moving to Mission Systems, sales rose 3% for the quarter and 2% year-to-date. High-single-digit growth in Sensors and Processing activities, for both the quarter and year-to-date continues to be the primary growth driver for MS. Underlying mid-to-single digit growth at MS is being partially offset by JRDC and ramp down on an ISR program.","Mission Systems' operating income increased 11% in the third quarter and 2% year-to-date. Third quarter operating margin rate increased 100 basis points to 13.7%, and reflects improved performance across all three business areas. Year-to-date, operating margin rate of 12.9% is comparable to year-to-date 2017.","For 2018, we are refining our MS sales guidance to a range of $11.6 billion to $11.8 billion. We continue to expect MS will have an operating margin rate of approximately 13%.","Turning to Technology Services, sales declined 12% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Declines in both periods reflect our portfolio shaping, as well as the program headwinds we've previously discussed. JRDC, VITA and KC-10 essentially represent all of the sales decrease at TS for both the quarter and year-to-date.","I would also note that year-to-date, our global logistics and modernization business continues to grow at a mid-single digit rate, due to ramp-ups on new programs like SEMA.","Technology Services operating margin rate was 10.7% for the quarter and 10.1% year-to-date. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect Technology Services sales will range between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%.","As we roll all that up, we continue to expect 2018 sales of approximately $30 billion. Based on strong year-to-date performance, we are increasing our guidance for segment operating margin rate to the mid 11% range.","On the corporate front, unallocated corporate expense declined by $112 million. During the quarter, we settled cost claims and recognized a $223 million benefit. This was a non-cash benefit in the quarter that will add to cash flows over a number of years. This was partially offset by $97 million of merger-related items, including $89 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and $8 million of additional depreciation expense resulting from the step-up in acquired property, plant and equipment.","As you can see in our earnings release, we are presenting merger-related expense as a separate line item included in our unallocated corporate expenses. We've also provided a slide that gives you a five-year estimate of amortization of purchased intangibles and depreciation step-ups. For 2018, we expect merger-related items to total $225 million, increase to $379 million in 2019 and decline annually thereafter.","Moving to pension, after completing our third quarter demographic study, we are increasing our 2018 estimated cash pension cost to $1 billion, which results in a slight increase in our total net FAS\/CAS pension adjustments.","Looking ahead to 2019, our net plan asset returns as of September 30 were approximately breakeven, and based on interest rates on September 30, we would expect our 2019 discount rate to increase in the range of 50 basis points to 60 basis points.","For your modeling purposes, we've updated our three-year pension estimates, assuming breakeven, net-plan asset returns for 2018 and a 50 basis point increase in our 2019 discount rate. The FAS sensitivities for plan asset returns and discount rate variances are consistent with prior assumptions and are also included in this quarter's slide deck.","Interest expense increased $60 million in the quarter and $196 million year-to-date, and we now expect net interest expense of $500 million. Our 2018 effective tax rate should be in the mid-13% range. Our third quarter tax rate reflects the reduction in the statutory rate of $35 million benefit for our discretionary pension contribution and a $70 million benefit for additional research credits and manufacturing deductions for prior years.","As Kathy noted, we now expect 2018 EPS will range between $18.75 and $19, reflecting our improved operational outlook, the cost claim settlement, our lower effective tax rate, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares.","Regarding capital deployment, we redeemed $700 million of outstanding Orbital ATK debt on July 19. In addition to paying down debt and contributing to our pension plans, year-to-date we have returned $825 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Through September 30, we've repurchased approximately 700,000 shares at an average price of about $307 per share. Share repurchases remain an important component of our capital deployment strategy and at the end of our third quarter our remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.1 billion.","We continue to expect healthy cash flow from the enterprise this year. And based on year-to-date operational results, we now expect free cash flow to range between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, after both capital spending of approximately $1.15 billion and our $250 million voluntary pension contribution.","With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Ken. In the interest of time, I would ask each participant to limit themselves to a single one-part question. Jamie, would you initiate the Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Hey. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","I was wondering on Innovation Systems, I mean, that's pretty stellar growth out of the gates. And I'm just kind of curious. I'm not one to usually believe in revenue synergy, but are you hitting revenue synergies in, kind of, year one? And what is the underlying growth rate you expect over the medium term for this business?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, Myles, thanks so much for recognizing the solid performance that our IS team delivered in this quarter. We, too, are very pleased with what they have delivered.","I'll tell you, we are on track for the cost synergies that we defined for 2020, and we are making good progress on revenue and operational synergies. Those are being worked. Those will become much more material in the next few years. A lot of the good performance that we're seeing right now is a result of just continued strong growth in the markets that IS serves. We do anticipate that the revenue synergy, as I said, becomes evident in 2019 and much more material in 2020 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, and congrats, Wes. It's the end of an era. Congrats on the performance. It's been amazing.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Well, thank you.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","I just \u2013 I can't help but ask, given some of the other calls, I mean, you chose to no-bid two pieces of work that have now led to a bit of noise around bidding strategies and potential losses and whatnot. And I just wondered if you'd share your perspective on whether you think this could potentially change bidding behavior, not necessarily for you, but around the industry, and are we beginning to see differences in cost structures or product positioning with respect to KPPs or return hurdles? Any perspective you could share on those, I'd appreciate it.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, Carter. No, I appreciate the question. And I would just \u2013 I'd offer two perspectives: one through sort of the lens of industry, and the other through the lens of the customer.","On the industry side, clearly, every company has to make its own decisions about how it will approach the economics of any particular deal. And they have to look at it both in terms of the deal itself and in terms of its broader base of business and how all those things factor together. I like the process we've been using for a number of years. We have a very clear-eyed view of what the economics are likely to be. We spent a lot of time thinking about true net present value and, obviously, when you dig a big hole early, it's hard to get to good NPV. But again, I would not presume to know the economics of other companies and be in a position to comment on how individual decisions get made.","And I would suggest that as we go forward, clearly, any company will have some finite appetite for how much of investment it can make in various areas. And those appetites change a little bit from time to time, but at the end of the day, we are generally a pretty well-managed industry. When I look across the landscape, there are really smart folks running the companies in our industry and, at the end of the day, they're going to have to make decisions that look at sort of their total picture, not just the individual project pictures. And they're going to have to figure out how much appetite there is for different elements of those types of decisions.","On the customer side, the customer has to understand all of this as well. We've gone through an era where this idea of low-price technically acceptable was kind of a mind-set as we were navigating through an era where we were mostly concerned about the capacity of our force structure to deal with all of the different things we've been dealing with around the globe.","For those of you that have taken a careful look at the national defense strategy that we're operating under now, which I think is \u2013 it's high time that we have this framework for our national defense strategy. There is a recognition that we've got to put as much, and probably more, focus on real capability, that our adversaries have taken full advantage of the focus that we've had elsewhere to not only catch up with us, but in some areas surpass us in some core capabilities, and we've got to be investing in that direction.","When we're talking about capability and investing for capability, low-price technically acceptable is the wrong answer. And from an acquisition standpoint, our customers, I think, are beginning to shift in their thinking and understand that they're going to need to use some different strategies when we're really talking about very high-end capabilities and the way programs are going to need to work to assure them that they're going to ultimately get what they need.","So, the pendulum swings back and forth on these things over time. I think it's important not to get too locked into one way of thinking about, which way things are going to go. But I do think that we are seeing a trend as I said more towards the high-end technology capabilities that are going to be needed, and that will influence acquisition behaviors and hopefully as we, industry and the customer community navigate that together, we'll stay on a track that enables the industry to be well managed.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning and congratulations, again, to Wes. Or sorry, good afternoon, I should say at this point. Sort of following on that question, just some broader perspectives on investing in this growth environment. For example, CapEx, we've been waiting for a few years for CapEx to peak. Any visibility as to when that might come down again?","And sort of related is, as you make these investments, what's the sort of sales growth visibility associated with that? Essentially how long is the runway for sales growth now that we have the FY 2019 budget in place?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Jon. Appreciate the question. Maybe I'll lead off, hit the CapEx and then turn it over to Kathy for a little more color on where she sees that as well as the sales growth opportunities.","In terms of CapEx, we have been investing to drive the growth that we are seeing and the existing program portfolio and the growth opportunities in front of us. I would say that we continue to expect that CapEx will stay at increased level in 2019 and then we should start to see it moderate as we look forward after that in both dollars and in a percentage of sales for sure as we continue to drive growth in the business.","I would say that there could be a blip out beyond that if we are successful on some additional development programs. We've been clear that GBSD is one that, should we be successful in the down-select from 2 to 1, that, that is something that could drive some additional amount of capital, but I don't think it's particularly material compared to what we've seen here in the last few years as we've been driving for growth, again, in the portfolio as well as some of the newer programs. Kathy, did you want to add some color on that?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Just to follow on what Ken said, we certainly see investing in ourselves as our primary focus and we do have growth opportunities both near and longer term. We have been very pleased with what we saw in the 2019 budget for our programs as well as opportunities that we're pursuing. And you will continue to see us have growth in restricted and pursue a significant set of opportunities, including GBSD that if we are successful could lead to additional CapEx expenditure. But as Ken said, at the current moment we see that starting to top out next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good afternoon.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I was wondering \u2013 this might be a bit of a sloppy calculation with the acquisition cost and stuff like that, but on a pro forma basis, it seems like maybe you're about three times net levered right now with close to $2 billion of cash to generate in the fourth quarter to take that down. So, how do you think about when you can really kind of get back into the market to buy back stock?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I would say, Seth, that as we look at our leverage, we are quite comfortable with where we are from a leverage perspective. We were able to take advantage of our credit rating at the time of the acquisition to execute on the acquisition, the issuance of the debt, and to essentially see a single notch downgrade from a couple of the credit rating agencies and hold with one.","As we have de-levered, both on some OA debt as well as a little bit of our debt, and we expect to de-lever another tranche that's due in 2019 for us. We see the ability to drive back to our traditional BBB+ credit rating.","But to be clear on the second part of your question on the share repurchase, we were out of the market at the time of the acquisition. That was not related to a leverage issue that was related to the fact that we were in the process of the acquisition, we're in possession of material non-public information, and could not, therefore, enter into a plan to execute on share repurchase.","We are pleased that the acquisition closed on June 8 \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 June 6 and within a couple of days from there, we were able to get back into the market and we continue to be and expect to be in the market on share repurchase as we look forward. So quite satisfied with the leverage. I do expect as we grow the business, grow the cash, grow the EBITDA, we will continue to see that leverage number drop on us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good afternoon.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Ron.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe a question for both Kathy and Wes. Now that you have the OA assets within the Northrop family, how do we think about the opportunities in front of you in classified space, hypersonics, that kind of thing? Because it seems like, strategically, those assets put you in a better position to win some of that work than had you not had them?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, Ron, this is Kathy. I'll start and then Wes can add in. You see it exactly the way we do. We see clear opportunity for us and jointly pursuing opportunities in space, hypersonics, precision munitions. These are areas where the portfolio in bringing together IS with the rest of Northrop Grumman, we clearly see synergy.","And just as important, we see the opportunity to really shape where those markets go through innovation and increased affordability. The cost synergies that we'll generate in bringing the teams together will also contribute to our competitiveness.","So, on all of those dimensions, we see that we are now able to offer more options in the markets I mentioned, as well as others, and that will be our primary sources of revenue synergy, which create the value over the long term from bringing the IS team into Northrop Grumman.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, and I would just completely agree with what Kathy said. I think this is turning out to be just a wonderful bringing together of two companies. The only thing I would add is I've just been delighted to see the very nice culture match and the almost instant desire on the part of all of the individuals involved in this, with respect to both of the companies that came together, to start getting together and creating new ideas, and new ideas are the source of value creation. That's how over the longer period of time, we're able to better serve the customer. And I think that's what the customer is expecting of us, quite frankly, as we bring the companies together.","So, I'm really excited about that because we're already seeing those connections being made and those ideas beginning to be generated. So, I'm very optimistic about what this will mean.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Kathy, Ken, just a question for you on the Aerospace margins side. You had some nice trends here in the quarter and I think year-to-date. I mean, does this create a runway to maybe getting back to the low-to-mid-teens as we look forward over the next couple of quarters and years?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, Rajeev, I'll start, and then ask Ken to add in. But what I see is just really strong performance on the part of our AS team. The blocking and tackling that goes in to good solid program execution is what is leading to the margin improvement, and we clearly see that potential to continue. We incentivize the team clearly to continue to find opportunities for program performance improvement that leads to margin expansion.","And so, what we are seeing is a clear result of that alignment of the team's objective to our shareholder objectives, and we expect it to continue. I'll let Ken speak a bit more on the details.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, I would say that we've seen mix as being the single largest impact on our margin profile at AS in terms of the lower margins over the last couple of years.","To Kathy's point, I think we've seen that the sector is also performing on its portfolio programs both on the production and on the development side and is driving its performance up.","I would just say that as we look forward, some of the larger development opportunities could be at the Aerospace sector. And if we are to take on some more mix challenge in terms of some additional development programs, then we could see some additional pressure on margin rates as we look forward. But with a significant growing top line that AS has had, we have seen nice growth in margin dollars even with some of the rate compression over the last couple of years.","And, Rajeev, just to make sure we're all on the same page in terms of your question, you referenced sort of low teens. I would just say, if you look back historically, AS has tended to run in the 12s (38:36) and certainly our benchmark for AS is 11 (38:41) and we incentivize them to do better than that. So, just to kind of level set us all on where AS has been and make sure we're all on the same page there.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Wes, best of luck with everything.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Kathy, can you maybe give us \u2013 you mentioned some consolidation at TS. Do you anticipate any portfolio shaping out of that or maybe just give us some updates how the timeline looks for when the actions will be completed? Thanks.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yes. So, the new structure at TS is aimed at creating a better focused organization on innovation and affordability, and we are implementing that at the beginning of 2019.","As many of you know, we've been on a journey over a couple of years to eliminate the majority of the commodity-based services work that we have in the TS portfolio. And next year, it'll continue to be somewhat of a tough compare as we had VITA in the portfolio through most of third quarter this year. But the logistics business at TS is growing. All segments of TS are winning new work, and those new programs are achieving strong margin rates.","So, we really see that we now have a services business that has a solid foundation for growth in the long-term and healthy program performance. And so, that's really what we're working to optimize through this restructuring that we'll do at the beginning of January, and we'll go from three divisions down to two.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, and Wes, congratulations.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Kathy, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a whole host of opportunities of program progress. I guess, how do you think about the longer-term growth profile of Northrop? And just outside of F-35 and restricted programs that have been a significant driver, maybe some opportunities you could point to or are significant areas of higher growth?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Sheila. So, I made the comment about our growth prospects in the comparison to the investment accounts, which are what we typically think of as the proxy for our growth. And when I think about over the long-term, I'm talking multiple years. And so, many of the things that we're pursuing are awards in the 2020 timeframe. And to give you a few examples, as you asked, we have both for the OPIR programs, the GEO payload as well as the OPIR Polar satellite programs in our pipeline. We were full-force awarded the OPIR Polar, and I talked about the GEO payload program down-select that will be made in 2020.","We also have a number of restricted space programs, and any one of them isn't as material as the collection of the handful that we are pursuing. We also have several full-rate production programs over the next two years. I talked about G\/ATOR and CIRCM and IBCS all in my comments earlier. Those are all in Mission Systems, but all represent significant full-rate production awards in the next two years.","We are competing for down-select in a number of areas. I talked about OmegA today. You all know we are competing for GBSD and have made it through the first down-select, and we also have been down-selected on Next-Gen Jammer low band. So all of those are competitions that we'll pursue over the next couple of years.","And so, as you can see, it's across all of our businesses, Aero, Innovation Systems, Mission Systems and Technology Services that we have a robust pipeline as well as, as you noted, the growth that we have on current programs that are still ramping up to their full potential, like F-35.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. This is an off-beat question, I suppose, here, but Wes, I'm kind of curious to know what's next for you? Where might we see you next? What are you passionate about? Are we going to hear from you again?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Unlikely that I'll just disappear. But I have a number of things that \u2013 outside of our industry, that are of great interest to me, both on a personal level and, hopefully, in terms of being helpful to others.","I'm going to take a little bit of time to sort all those things out, to figure out exactly where I want to focus my energies and my passion, but I'm looking forward to the opportunity to do that. And I very much appreciate the question, Hunter. It's been just a lot of fun to be involved in this for so long. But hopefully, I can find some other good things to do that will be helpful to others.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Stallard with Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks so much. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Rob.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Good afternoon.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","First of all, all the best for the future, Wes. I hope you have a good time.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then, secondly, Kathy, you mentioned the very strong year-to-date growth in export markets. I was wondering how sustainable do you think that growth rate is looking forward?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Rob, we see that growth rate as sustainable in that a number of the opportunities we are pursuing, including Global HALE, as well as the then sustainment for those products that we're delivering to continue strong pipeline there for other countries that are seeking that capability, as well as additional units.","I spoke today specifically about, also, the E-2D growth that we're seeing in Japan and we anticipate that that kind of growth will also continue worldwide. And so, those are just a few examples that across all of our areas, Space, Cyber, Autonomous, Manned Aircraft, as well as the Sensors that go on those aircraft, we are still seeing strong growth potential in, particularly, Asia-Pacific, but also some notable programs in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about performance. You didn't \u2013 I guess, one is, can you give us an update on some of the programs from last quarter, say, the James Webb and the Advanced Capabilities program? And despite no, I guess, headline performance issues in the release, the unfavorable EACs did move up to $147 million in the quarter, which is up from the last quarter. Can you \u2013 are there any particular issues you can highlight that might have been behind that?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Sure, Sam. Let me maybe start with the second part of the question, and then Kathy can comment on the programs. I would say, from a negative EAC perspective, there's nothing there that I would point to. I would remind you that in the second quarter, some of the adjustments that we referenced were not recorded as negative EAC adjustments because they were with respect to options that had not been exercised and, therefore, some of those margin headwinds were not in that negative adjustment chart.","And looking at the performance for the quarter, we're quite satisfied; all of the sectors performing well. We do have a large and diverse portfolio of programs that are always going to have some ups and some downs. And we try to take a solid approach to booking rates not exceedingly conservative, but not exceedingly optimistic, middle of the road. And that's going to mean you're going to have some ups and downs, particularly with a program that's as diverse and, quite frankly, complicated as ours. And so, no concerns. And on the programs themselves, I would just say nothing to comment on negatively from a performance perspective.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Kathy.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Quite the contrary. We have good performance closing out the contract on VITA. And so, that process has gone exceedingly well. We also, on James Webb, have been executing according to the plan that we laid out earlier this year in conjunction with NASA, and the team is progressing through INT quite well. So, on both of those efforts, we have delivered just as we anticipated through the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, David.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Ken, I think a question for you. Wanted to ask about how we should think about free-cash-flow conversion from here. It looks like this year you're going to be in the 70%, 75% range. All the different moving pieces going forward in terms of CapEx, working capital opportunity, pension, and all of that, how we should think about that trending from here?","And then, a real quick one on pension. I get why the FAS side gets a little bit worse than what you were expecting previously, but it looks like you took 2020, the CAS number, higher. Can you just talk about what's going on there? And I think you've also said that you would expect CAS to actually go up kind of in the 2022 timeframe? Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Sure. Appreciate the question. From a free-cash-flow conversion perspective, I guess I would say that when you have some of these items like we had in this quarter with respect to the cost claim and we certainly had some tax items that are not necessarily going to result in cash tax savings in the year, they result in some future opportunities for cash, you can get some lumpiness in your cash conversion percentage.","I think the important thing to focus on is the ability of this business to generate cash as we look forward. And this should be a business that generates a strong, both operating cash flow as we look forward as well as free cash flow.","And largely, I would say, our free cash flow conversion should be increasing as we look forward. In particular, if you exclude some of the one-time items we've had this year as well as over the past couple years in terms of some either margin or tax benefits.","And then, also as we look forward, we've mentioned that 2019 should be another year of, kind of, heavy \u2013 heavier capital expenditures, and that we should start to see that moderate, both in dollar terms and in percentage of sales terms, as we look forward. So that should help from a free cash flow conversion perspective.","Additionally, going to your question on the CAS, I would say that CAS is certainly less sensitive to a number of assumptions than FAS is. But when we see, as we mentioned this year, we've got, call it, roughly break-even returns through September 30. That will result in some increased CAS as we look forward, and I think that's what you're seeing on the 2020 CAS line. And I would say that pension should continue to be something that is not necessarily a headwind for us from a cash or free cash flow perspective. We continue to see a profile where our CAS should be in excess of our required funding. So overall, this should be generating a fair amount of cash as we look forward. And I would say our conversion should be strong, although we always look to continue to drive operating excellence even when that means the cash might trail a little bit of time just managing all aspects of the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So Lockheed Martin increased their sales guide for this year and for next year, and they cited the fact that the FY 2018 budget got done early. We have an FY 2019 budget early. Congress threw some more money in the pot for the F-35 and the F-18 programs on which you also are a participant. As you look at next year, does your revenue growth look better today than it did three to four months ago?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, Cai, I'll take that question. And I'll also remind you that we'll give you full guidance at the end of the fourth quarter call in 2019, in January 2019. But as we are approaching the end of this year and looking forward into 2019, I mentioned that our programs have been well-supported in the 2019 budget, and we do feel as if we will continue to see the kinds of growth that we have experienced in 2018 into 2019. And we will reduce some of the headwinds that we had particularly in Mission Systems with the two programs that Ken noted, and we will start to get through the headwinds that TS has seen through the three programs that we have noted throughout the call this year.","So in terms of compares, we will be in a more favorable place as we head into 2019. But I will also state that the growth that we have seen historically going into 2017 to 2018 was very solid. So we continue to grow off of prior years of strong growth in the sectors as well. And, Ken, I don't know if there is anything that you'd like to add there.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","No, I think you hit it on the point there, Kathy. And it's right that we have seen \u2013 again, we have a diverse portfolio, and there's always going to be some ups and some downs, and we've seen some programs that have been working their way out of the system this year. Some of those will have a little bit of impact in the early part of next year but largely should work themselves out of, kind of, the compare from year-over-year in the earlier part of 2019. And I'm with you. I think we really feel like we have the ability to grow this business and feel very positive about how we're positioned.","Now with that, Jamie, I think maybe we'll take just one last question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Doug.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And, Wes, I'm sure you're going to find plenty of good things to do, but we will miss you here.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you, Doug. Thank you.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I have a question about the Orbital acquisition. And as you set up the Innovation segment, where you've got three groups there, and when you look, over time, to really get synergies with Mission Systems and with Aerospace, one would think you've got to change that organization around or these organizations around significantly to optimize that. So, my question is how are you thinking about evolving these organizations, and in terms of the things you need to pull together to get the most value out of them? And what kind of timeframe are you looking at for that?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Doug. So, clearly, my primary focus over the course of 2019 is to make those evaluations, look at the portfolio. We are, as I said, developing our revenue synergy opportunities, and those will inform my thinking about how we need to ensure we operationalize and organize to execute on those synergy opportunities. But what I also value in bringing that team in as a standalone sector is the transparency that we will get as we work our way through 2019 around the cost synergies that we want to achieve full run rate of by 2020, as well as the opportunity to make sure we are implementing the best of both models that we have established.","There is a lot for Northrop Grumman to take in terms of value from the way Innovation Systems operates. And likewise, the opposite is true. And so, we have had the best-of-both mentality, we're executing on a well-thought integration plan to help us achieve that, and so really I want to focus the better part of next year on realizing those cost synergies, executing on best of both, ensuring that they have solid operational performance, and then look through the revenue synergies to inform my thinking about any changes that we might make.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you. At this point in time, I would like to turn the call over to Wes for some final comments.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","All right. Well, thanks, Steve. I asked Steve to save me a little time at the end of the call so that I can say a few words as I wrap up my last earnings call with the company.","I want to take the opportunity to publicly say thank you to the amazing team of Northrop Grumman. It's a humbling experience to work with so many brilliant people, who are absolutely committed to serving our customers and advancing global security.","I will tell you that this team rises to every challenge, and it is critical that we do as those we serve, our customers around the globe, are people we genuinely care deeply about. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to work with such incredible people in our company and in our customer community. And it's been a real privilege to serve in so many roles in our company over the years and especially in the roles where I've had a chance to engage with the community of analysts and portfolio managers.","I've sincerely enjoyed working with all of you in the financial community ever since I became CFO way back in 2005. The research that you perform, the questions you pose and the objectives you help frame really do make our companies better. I sincerely value what you do and how you do it, and I want to express my appreciation for the opportunity to work with all of you for so many years.","So, while looking backwards is important to do periodically, I'm actually more excited about looking forward. Our company is fortunate to have an exceptional leader as our new CEO and I'm confident that the best years for Northrop Grumman are the years ahead of us.

My name is Jamie, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Jamie. And welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2018 conference call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws.","Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release.","I would also remind everyone that our results reflect the adoption of new accounting standards for revenue recognition and pension accounting. Schedules 4 and 5 of our earnings release present comparable prior-period information, recast to reflect the adoption of these new standards.","We have posted a presentation to our Investor Relations website that summarizes updates to our guidance and provides an update to the three years of pension information we provided with our initial 2018 guidance.","On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman and CEO; Kathy Warden, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us.","I want to start the call by welcoming our new Innovation Systems team to Northrop Grumman. As you know, we completed the transaction with Orbital ATK on June 6, and we've established Innovation Systems as our fourth sector. As you can see from our second quarter results, Innovation Systems is already contributing. We expect this acquisition will be accretive on both a GAAP and a cash basis in 2018.","It was another quarter of solid performance across our company, and I want to thank the entire team for their continued focus on execution. Second quarter sales grew 10%, reflecting continued double-digit growth at Aerospace Systems, largely driven by Manned Aircraft sales, higher Sensors and Processing volume at Mission Systems, and the addition of Innovation Systems.","Our backlog increased to $52.2 billion, up $9.9 billion, which includes $8.7 billion of Innovation Systems backlog. Net earnings and diluted EPS each increased 24% in the quarter, driven by higher sales and higher segment operating income, as well as improvement in both pension and taxes. These positives more than offset transaction-related expenses.","At the midpoint of the year, we're increasing our full-year 2018 earnings per share guidance to a range of $16.60 to $16.85. During the quarter, cash from operations totaled $875 million, an improvement of nearly $400 million over last year, primarily due to improved working capital performance. Year-to-date, cash from operations totaled $638 million, an improvement of nearly $600 million over prior-year results.","Regarding capital deployment, the strategy is unchanged. Our first priority is investing for profitable growth, followed by managing the balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Capital spending during the quarter reflects our continued investment in support of long-term profitable growth and affordability for our customers. We continue investing to expand our workforce, ramp up on large new programs, and pursue and win new business opportunities.","In addition to the acquisition, we made capital investments of $199 million in the second quarter and more than $500 million year-to-date. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.15 billion in 2018. We're updating our free cash flow projection to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion.","In terms of the balance sheet, we're focused on near-term debt reduction as well as ensuring our pension plans remain well-funded, and we continue to return cash to our shareholders. In 2018, we've increased the dividend 20%. And I'm also happy to report that with the closing of the Orbital ATK transaction, we have resumed share repurchases. Overall, we're pleased with our team's accomplishments during the first half of the year.","In terms of our market environment, we continue to see positive trends for defense spending with the U.S. and with our allies. There is clear recognition that we need to invest in both readiness and modernization. As I look at the opportunity set for our company, particularly with the addition of Innovation Systems, I feel very good about our alignment with our customers' current and emerging needs, and our ability to execute on our current portfolio of programs as well as capture important new opportunities going forward. We encourage Congress and the administration to continue making steady progress to reach a timely agreement on FY 2019 appropriations.","A couple weeks ago, I announced that I'll be stepping down as CEO on January 1. I suspect some of you may be asking why now and wondering if there's some reason you should understand regarding my timing. So I want to be very transparent about my reasons with all of you, as I have been about the other decisions in our company over the years.","It starts with a strongly held personal belief that healthy organizations use the dynamic of change to continuously improve themselves and to support a culture of excellence. Over the course of my tenure in my current role, we've made many changes in our portfolio, in our approach to taking on new business and how we drive performance and I believe, most importantly, in our culture.","I feel these changes have been key to the value that we've created for all of our stakeholders. Healthy change requires new leadership perspectives from time-to-time, and this includes new perspectives at the CEO level. This is my ninth year as CEO and, as you should expect, getting succession right is very important to me. I'm proud that we have a disciplined and thoughtful approach to succession planning at all levels in our company.","And with a long tenured CEO, good succession planning also means having the successor take on the role in a timely manner when they are ready to take the company to the next level. We are so fortunate to have a leader who is now ready to become our next CEO and to lead us forward. Many of you already know Kathy. So I don't have to tell you that she is an outstanding executive, but I will anyway.","Kathy is absolutely the right person to take this on. She is a great leader. She has a wonderful depth and breadth of knowledge about our company and our industry, and her leadership approach is based on the core values of our company. As I've said in my message to our team announcing this transition, I have high expectations for what this company will accomplish during Kathy's tenure as our CEO.","As a part of our transition process, Kathy, Ken, Steve and I will have several opportunities to meet with many of you over the coming months. Kathy and I will be very focused on ensuring we execute a seamless transition through the end of the year. And I've also committed to our board that I will remain as Chairman through July of 2019, about a year from now.","So let me turn the call over to Kathy to give us an update on our company's operations in the second quarter. Kathy?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I review operations and provide an update on Innovation Systems integration, I want to take this opportunity to thank the board of directors for electing me to succeed Wes as Northrop Grumman's next CEO.","Since joining Northrop Grumman in 2008, Wes's mentorship and example have been invaluable to my growth as a leader. As I assumed increasingly larger P&L responsibilities within our company, I was fortunate to work with Wes. Our values, decision-making, and focus on performance are well aligned.","So thank you, Wes. I look forward to working alongside of you for another year to ensure a smooth transition for all of our stakeholders.","I am very excited about where Northrop Grumman is today and, more importantly, where our team can take the company going forward. Our value-creation opportunity is as robust as ever.","Now let me touch on integration of Innovation Systems. With the close of the transaction, 15,000 new employees joined Northrop Grumman, and I want to welcome them to our company. We stood up Innovation Systems as our new fourth sector on June 7 with their existing operations management team in place.","When we announced the transaction, we said that we expected to achieve $150 million of annual cost synergies by 2020, and we estimated it would cost about $75 million to achieve those synergies. We are on track to meet or exceed the cost synergy estimate. We expect to spend about $25 million this year to achieve cost synergies and $50 million in 2019.","While IS has only been a part of Northrop Grumman for a few weeks, we're very excited about the opportunity our combination gives us to broaden our capabilities and offerings and provide innovative solutions to meet our customers' emerging requirements, while also creating value for shareholders and providing expanded opportunities for our combined workforce.","This is a combination that is compelling financially and strategically, and truly strengthens our foundation for long-term profitable growth.","Turning to our sector highlights for the quarter, each of our sectors captured business and achieved program milestones that position us well for the long-term.","At Aerospace Systems, in Manned Aircraft, we continue to ramp up on restricted activities and the F-35. Sales increased by more than 40% on the F-35 program. And during the quarter, we achieved a 1.5-day production interval, or said another way, we're now producing one center fuselage unit every day-and-a-half.","We delivered 32 center fuselages during the quarter, compared to 20 last quarter and 18 in the second quarter of 2017. We've completed delivery of all 94 units under LRIP 10, we've delivered 31 under LRIP 11, and we delivered our first unit under LRIP 12. We expect to deliver 116 F-35 center fuselages in 2018.","I would also note that we reached an agreement with Lockheed Martin on LRIP 11 that supports continued affordability for the customer and incentivizes continued strong performance for our teams.","In Autonomous Systems, the Prime Minister of Australia formally announced the initiation of the Australian Triton acquisition and the successful passage through their Gate 2 milestone. The initial authorization is for one air vehicle, with infrastructure to support the full fleet of six air vehicles.","And in Space, the Air Force awarded Northrop Grumman a sole source contract for the initial phase of the Polar System for our nation's next-generation Overhead Persistent Infrared program. Next-gen OPIR will provide improved missile warning capabilities that are more survivable against emerging threats than the current generation SBIR system. We also plan to compete for the payload portions of the OPIR programs.","Most of you are aware that NASA, based on an Independent Review Board recommendation, announced a new 2021 launch date for the James Webb Space Telescope. The IRB also reaffirmed the mission value of the world's premier science observatory. All the telescope's major elements are now at our Redondo Beach facility, where we have begun final integration and testing of this space telescope that will explore the origins of the universe and search for life beyond our solar system.","In the second quarter, the spacecraft bus underwent a successful mechanical shock test, and the JWS team also separately powered up the two halves of the telescope, the Optical Telescope Element Integrated Science Instrument Module, or OTIS, and the spacecraft bus. These are critical steps in this phase of the program.","Now turning to Innovation Systems. They launched an Antares rocket carrying a company-built Cygnus spacecraft to the International Space Station. Cygnus subsequently rendezvoused and berthed with the station to deliver 7,400 pounds of vital supplies and scientific experiments to support the on-board astronaut crew. Cygnus departed the Space Station on July 15 and it will conclude its mission on July 30.","IS also conducted a successful motor case first test, an important milestone in the development of our new OmegA large-class space launch vehicle.","And finally, we shipped the company-built ICESat-2 Earth science spacecraft to its launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The satellite was designed, built, and tested at our manufacturing facility in Arizona and is scheduled to be launched this September.","At Mission Systems, we continue to ramp up on the F-35 and SABR radar programs in the Sensors and Processing business area. The F-35 program plans to deliver 140 radars this year versus 90 in 2017. Our SABR team has secured its fifth production customer and now has orders for more than 400 systems, of which 56 have been delivered through the end of the second quarter.","The F-16 Air National Guard upgrade program is progressing on schedule, with flight testing for Phase 1 to be complete this year and initial production deliveries to begin March of 2019.","Our teaming agreement with Lockheed Martin positions us to support additional new F-16 buys and capability upgrades of existing F-16 fleets worldwide, highlighting SABR's superb capability, reliability, interoperability and long-term affordability.","During the quarter, MS won an Air Force competition to sustain and modify critical-mission warning radars. The $866 million seven-year single-award IDIQ SMORS contract calls for sustainment and modification of our nation's worldwide network of ground-based radars. Our work on SMORS will uphold and enhance the Air Force's ability to detect missile attacks early, while also providing forces with critical situational awareness of objects in space. Through SMORS, Northrop Grumman will ensure the high availability of ground-based radar systems for Air Force Space Command.","At Technology Services, the State Department awarded us a 10-year $850 million contract for its Consular Systems Modernization program. Our team will support the digital transformation of the systems supporting passport and visa application, and other Department of State Consular Affairs services. This is an important win for TS, and it reflects our strategy to build a TS portfolio focused on higher-end value-enhanced activities.","We've taken numerous steps to position TS for profitable growth over the long-term, and we continue that process as we work with the Commonwealth of Virginia to support the transition of VITA to new service providers.","We are addressing numerous new opportunities in the U.S. and with our allies around the globe. And we are excited about the long-term growth prospects enabled by our portfolio, including the revenue synergy opportunities offered by the addition of Innovation Systems.","So, now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financials.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for their efforts through the first half of the year. Today I'll briefly review our second quarter results and update our 2018 guidance. As you're all aware, in June, we updated our guidance for the addition of Innovation Systems but did not provide sector-level detail. I'll provide both company- and sector-level updated guidance today.","Regarding the quarter, I'd note that we had strong awards, solid sales and earnings growth, including a partial month of IS results, offset somewhat by deal costs and a full quarter of net interest expense on the debt associated with the acquisition.","Turning to sector results. Aerospace Systems had another quarter of double-digit sales growth. Sales for both the second quarter and year-to-date were up 11%. Higher volume in Manned Aircraft was the major growth driver for both periods, with restricted activities and the F-35 ramp-up accounting for most of the higher volume.","Autonomous Systems and Space were also higher for both periods. Growth in Autonomous Systems reflects higher volume across a number of programs, and higher Space sales reflects growth in restricted activities and the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, partially offset by lower volume in unrestricted space.","Operating income for Aerospace Systems is also up for both the quarter and year-to-date, with operating margin rates up 10.7% and 10.5% respectively. While AS margin rates continue to reflect a higher level of early-phase development work, the second quarter rate of 10.7% matches last year's second quarter margin rate and includes positive performance adjustments of $69 million from multiple restricted programs. These positives more than offset a negative adjustment on the James Webb Space Telescope program.","Based on results of the first half, we are increasing our sales guidance for AS to approximately $13 billion. We now expect AS will have an operating margin rate of approximately 10.5%.","Turning to Innovation Systems. For the period since close, sales totaled $400 million with a margin rate of 9.8%. For the 2018 post-acquisition period, we expect IS will have revenue of approximately $3 billion with a mid-10% operating margin rate.","Turning to Mission Systems. Sales rose 1% in the quarter and 2% year-to-date. Sensors and Processing is the principal driver, with double-digit growth year-to-date due to higher volume for restricted, F-35, SABR and communications programs. Advanced Capabilities is also higher in both periods due to higher volume for several programs, including IBCS, partially offset by lower volume for JRDC and follow-on activity. Cyber and ISR volume declined in both periods due to program completions in the restricted ISR area.","Mission Systems operating income decreased 8% and 3% respectively for the second quarter and year-to-date. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 12.2% and includes a forward loss provision on a program in Advanced Capabilities. In addition, last year's second quarter results included a Cost Claim benefit. Year-to-date, MS segment operating margin rate is 12.6%. For 2018, we continue to expect sales in the mid-to-high $11 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 13%. No change to prior guidance.","Turning to Technology Services. Sales declined 10% and 7% respectively for the second quarter and year-to-date. Declines in both periods reflect our portfolios shaping as well as the program headwinds we've previously discussed. Declines in programs like VITA, KC-10 and JRDC are being partially offset by ramp-ups on new programs like SEMA as well as international activity. Technology Services operating margin rate was 9.1% for the quarter and 9.9% year-to-date. Second quarter operating income includes a negative adjustment on the VITA program.","We received a notice of termination from the Commonwealth, which reduced the program's expected period of performance with the resulting impact on earnings. I would also note that last year's second quarter included a benefit for the Cost Claim. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect Technology Services sales will be in the low-to-mid $4 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%.","As we roll all that up, we continue to expect sales of approximately $30 billion and a segment operating margin rate in the low-to-mid 11% range. We also continue to expect a high-11% total operating margin rate, reflecting $425 million for unallocated corporate expense, which includes a preliminary estimate of $175 million for amortization of purchased intangibles for the acquisition of Innovation Systems as well as approximately $55 million in full-year deal costs.","Moving to pension, no change to prior guidance for total net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment of $1.08 billion and no change to net interest expense of $520 million. Further, we now expect our effective tax rate will be in the mid-16% range.","As Wes noted, we are increasing our 2018 EPS guidance to a range of $16.60 to $16.85, which assumes no change to our weighted average diluted share count. Regarding capital deployment, debt reduction is one of our near-term priorities. And during the quarter, we retired $850 million of Northrop Grumman notes, we redeemed $700 million of outstanding Orbital ATK debt on July 19, and we have another $500 million of Northrop Grumman notes we expect to retire in 2019.","In the second quarter, we initiated a commercial paper program to enhance short-term liquidity as we deploy capital for value creation. Cash generation in the second quarter and year-to-date was much stronger than last year due to improved trade working capital performance. We continue to expect healthy cash flow from the enterprise this year, and we have raised the bottom end of our free cash flow guidance range by $100 million. We now expect free cash flow of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion after capital spending of approximately $1.15 billion and a planned $250 million discretionary pension contribution.","We look forward to continued strong performance from our team in the second half of the year. With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Ken. Our formal remarks ran a little bit long today. So we're going to extend the Q&A session a bit past 1 o'clock. With that, I would ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question, so we can get through the queue.","And with that, Jamie, would you open up the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning \u2013 actually, good afternoon, guys.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Ron.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Ron.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On the new segment there, the Innovation Systems business, clearly I mean there's a play there on GBSD. But how do we think about the broader business implications? There's been a lot of discussion lately about hypersonics. What does it bring to Northrop Grumman in terms of hypersonics? And then there's been a lot of discussion on classified space. So how does that segment, the acquisition, strengthen Northrop Grumman in those businesses?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Ron. I will take that question. We are very excited about the portfolio of Innovation Systems because of a number of the areas you noted. Certainly, for GBSD, they will be a key partner for us on that program, as they also continue to partner with Boeing. But we also look beyond GBSD. And some of the areas you mentioned, hypersonics, this expands Northrop's portfolio, which has traditionally been more in the counter-hypersonics part of the market, to now also be able to add value in the weapon systems themselves.","We also look at classified space, and we have traditionally worked with large, complex systems. This expands our portfolio to smaller systems and allows us to have a much more expanded offering to the national security space community. So, across the broad spectrum of things that Northrop Grumman has traditionally done, Orbital and ATK coming together expanded their portfolio, and now as part of Northrop Grumman, significantly expands our portfolio of offerings to our customers across a wide variety of the community.","Operator","Your next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for the time. I guess, Wes and Kathy, congrats on your new role. Kathy, just more of an obvious question for you. As you go through the transition, what are your key priorities going to be for Northrop? Maybe what'll change versus what we've been seeing over the last few years?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Well, thanks for that question. Wes will be in place as CEO through the remainder of the year, and in exercising a smooth transition, I'll continue to focus on the successful integration of Orbital ATK, standing that team up as our new fourth sector. We also are working the capture of significant opportunities, both domestically and internationally, and we're focused on solid-segment operating performance as we ramp up on critical development and production program.","But as I look to the future, there are a number of areas that I believe have served us well. First, our performance-driven culture, also our approach to capital deployment, and the way we have aligned our team's incentives to drive performance for all of our stakeholders. So these are areas I certainly look to continue.","I'm also confident we have a portfolio that's well-aligned to our customers' needs for today and well into the future, but of course, I'm going to continue to assess the portfolio, the structure, our strategies of the organization to make sure that we do incorporate change to enhance value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.","Operator","Your next question is from Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats, Kathy and Wes. Hey, just Kathy, on the Innovation Systems particularly, this has got a higher percentage of fixed-price contract mix. It's also got a higher percentage mix of international customers. And just thinking about just the long-term margin profile of this segment, can this rival Mission Systems, excluding some of the amortization costs from the deal? Thanks.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Peter. When we look at targets for our segments, we're looking at Innovation Systems in that 10% to 11% range. It has the features you noted, with strong fixed-price component as well as international that tend to drive margins up. So it's a very broad portfolio of capability as well and they have tended to focus on very innovative capabilities.","So, when we set benchmark, that would be the 10% to 11% that I talked about. Taking their portfolio, looking at other companies' similar portfolios, that's the range that we would see them in. And we, of course, will drive to achieve better in that benchmark performance.","Operator","Your next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations, Kathy and Wes. Ken, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about Technology Services. The segment was generating about $130 million or so of EBIT on a quarterly basis fairly consistently. We had the step-down in this quarter. The guidance implies it's going to step-up again a little bit in the back half.","But as some of the contracts wind down here, how do we think about where this business bottoms out and where you could start growing again in Technology Services?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Sure, Seth. Thanks for the question. I'll start, and Kathy may have some color she wants to add as well.","So I think a little bit of a multi-part question on both the margin as well as the sales profile. And from a margin perspective, we've seen that TS has been one of the strongest, if not the industry-leading, margin performer in its segment. And I would say that we saw a little bit of a challenge this quarter in terms of dealing with the early termination impact of the VITA program, which had some impact on margin.","We are holding the full-year margin rate estimate that we started out the year with, which does indicate that we have the ability to perform in the second half of the year to get to our 10% approximate margin rate for TS. And we feel pretty good about the team's ability to do that.","From a sales perspective, I would say that we're seeing the continued impact of those headwinds, KC-10, JRDC. TS did a lot of the work on an inter-company basis for MS on the JRDC program, as well as now the headwind from VITA as that is expected to terminate earlier than we had previously considered.","That being said, they have had some wins in the sector. We've talked previously about contract messaging as well as the SEMA program, and now starting to see some of the international starting to take off.","So I wouldn't want to necessarily declare when that growth will start to come again, but we certainly look that as we get some of these headwinds through the system, TS should have the ability to grow its business in line with the market as we look forward over the longer-term.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And I'll just add that we've been on the journey of reshaping the TS portfolio for a couple of years. We are seeing VITA with the completion as our last large IT outsourcing contract.","And so as we look forward to the areas where we've been growing the portfolio, like that modernization of both our own platforms and the platforms of others, as well as some of the higher value activities that I mentioned with the win with the Department of State this quarter, we really are at a place where the growth is now coming from areas that we feel TS is both very competitive and adds significant value to our customers' needs.","So we are encouraged about what this team is going to be able to accomplish in these areas of focus.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Wes, Kathy, Ken, and Steve, good afternoon. Wes, just want to say best of everything. For whatever it's worth, I think you did an absolutely terrific job. Kathy, I wish you all the best. And I have a...","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Well, you're welcome. I have a question on Mission Systems. Ken, I want to know if you can talk a bit more about what was happening there. What was the reason that costs rose so much on the Advanced Capability program that you took a forward loss on? And could you quantify the amount of what the forward loss was? Just trying to get the margin impact.","Now, I may have missed this in your opening remarks, but was the reason that cyber and ISR volumes were down in the quarter just reflects some timing? Or was this all just cyber and ISR programs just winding down? Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Sure. Let me take maybe the second part of the question first, Rich. And we have a business area that we refer to as cyber and ISR. But largely the impact that we're seeing is in the restricted ISR area of that business.","And so we're really seeing that there were some program completions, as expected, I would say, that have created a little bit of a headwind on the sales side.","But we are seeing that Sensors and Processing is certainly more than offsetting that as those programs are working their way through the life cycle. And as we look forward for MS over the long-term, we should see a nice and robust growth profile.","With respect to your question on the Advanced Capabilities program, I would say that clearly the amount of the forward loss was not material, otherwise we would have disclosed it in the 10-Q as we did the amount of the pickup on the multiple restricted programs at Aerospace. So not going to put a number on it today, but certainly had an impact on the trend from a margin rate perspective, which is why we noted it in the document, both the 10-Q and the ER. But certainly not of a materiality level that we saw on the other.","From your question on what drove the loss, I would say we have seen some technical challenges that we are working our way through. Those challenges are on a cost-type program, but we are seeing that it's had some impact on a fixed-price option that we have related to that program.","And this is driving a bit of a cost growth on that fixed-price option, which we think is likely to be exercised by the customer, and therefore we have recorded that as a forward loss.","Kathy, I don't know if you want to add any...","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I'll just note that we've maintained our guide for Mission Systems as we look at the headwinds on the top line, about $225 million for two programs that, as Ken said, completed.","We see great growth in Sensors and Processing. I talked about some of that earlier in the call. And the fixed-price mix is up in Mission Systems in these areas where we are growing in production.","So I'm confident that, as we look forward, both top line and operating margin will continue to be healthy in Mission Systems.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Good morning, and congratulations, everyone.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the moving pieces within working capital and, now with the inclusion of OA, how we should think about those and maybe the opportunities?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Sure, Sheila. I appreciate that. And I would say that we've seen some improvement in working capital this year, and we are happy to see that starting to turn to the positive for us. We have been building working capital for a couple of years, as we saw some long-term production programs that had some liquidations that were tied to deliveries. Those deliveries are starting to occur.","We're also very focused on thinking about how we get the right cash terms for the type of contracts that we are taking on. We had seen the change in the DFARS have an impact on that looking back a couple of years as well. So I would say some favorable working capital performance for us.","From an Innovation Systems perspective, I would say that there are some programs in the backlog that have had some higher unbilled balances. CRS is one that comes to mind. There are some significant milestone events that will drive some payments. The A350 program is one that also had some cash headwinds reflected with it, and we expect that that is starting to turn here as we look forward.","So we're excited about working capital performance so far year-to-date. Obviously, a lot of work to do in the second half of the year, but we're working hard on it, on the entire portfolio including Innovation Systems. And we look forward to strong cash generation for the second half of the year as well as, as we look out into the future, this is a business that should be growing, managing working capital and generating strong cash.","Operator","Your next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Kathy, congrats on the appointment. Wes, congrats on the retirement and a fantastic career.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you, Noah.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Ken, I wanted to try to dig into the margins a little bit. And I know you just kind of passed on the quantification of the item in MS, but I'm getting a lot of questions from your stakeholders on the size of the reach forward at MS and the VITA and at TS. Not sure if \u2013 I guess maybe I'm just asking again if you'd quantify those or maybe if you could give us the factual threshold where you have to disclose something like that so we can make an estimate, just because it did impact the margins.","And then, looking forward, I guess I'm wondering are you at the low watermark for both contract-type mix and risk retirement potential? Because cost plus as a percentage has been moving higher and EACs as a percentage have been moving lower, both reasonably significantly. I wonder how those trend from here.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","All right. So, on the first part of the question, I guess what I would say is, again, don't want to put a number on the individual items that we disclosed in order to give a sense of what's going on in the business and understand the trends. I would say, clearly, we think about materiality and, in reality, significance really as a matter of judgment and not any magic number that we put on it. We certainly did disclose the items on the restricted programs in Aerospace Systems, which was $69 million. So I guess that puts a number on the upper-bound for you.","And with respect to those items, look, they're largely behind us. We feel pretty good about the fact that we've got the issues related to those programs addressed and had an impact on the quarter. We disclosed it, wanted to make sure you understood what it was. But not a material or even significant impact for putting a number on there. And as we think about it, we held guidance on margin rate for both MS and TS, which should indicate that they've got the ability to perform in the second half to more than cover some of those issues that we experienced in the second quarter.","So, from a contract-type mix and risk retirement perspective, I think my view on that, Noah, would be that I don't necessarily think that we have sort of run out of runway on that perspective. I think we have been working hard to try to make sure that we reflect our best estimate of operating earnings as early as possible in the life cycle of a program and making sure that we are taking those increases along the life, and historically, there may have been a little more waiting until a little bit later in the life of the program, but we try to make sure we're always reflecting our best estimates.","And so we've seen that our, what I'll call, core margin rate has come up a bit in the last couple of years, and I think that's really what's driving the lower amount of risk retirements is just moving more of the earnings into the core earnings rate, or baseline rate maybe I should call it, than into the earnings adjustments themselves.","I would also note a little bit of a quirk this quarter. The forward loss on the fixed-price option at MS is technically not an earnings adjustment because the option hasn't yet been exercised. So the forward loss is reflected in the margin rates, but it's not in the schedule above. So, that can have some impact in the analysis as well.","But the bottom line is this business can generate strong margins. I don't see any change in its ability to drive margins. We haven't changed our benchmark, strong performance by AS in the first half of the year and strong expected performance for all the sectors for the full year of 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, all, and congrats on the transitions.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Wes, if you want to take up golf more seriously, give me a call and I could use an excuse to get out of the office.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Look, at the risk of being overly blunt, I just want to probe a little bit on this whole program performance thing, since clearly the stock is down a lot today and I think that's why. And I guess I'll just go back to what I asked last quarter. The headlines on James Webb point to, I guess, sort of performance that I would characterize as maybe atypical from what Northrop has done over the last decade or so. And I get it that a lot of the technology is first-of-a-kind. But Northrop Grumman's a company where lots of things are being done for the first time with bombers or satellites or autonomous aircraft.","And so this quarter you guys gave the first forward loss I think in a decade and, of course, the negative adjustments you talked about. And it sounds like from the commentary, if we put VITA aside since it seems more like a simple termination, it sounds like technical risk identification is the similarity between those two downers that you had. And I want to kind of go back to the same question from last quarter. Are these challenges isolated? Or do they reveal anything that changes how you think about risk identification, where it's appropriate to set booking rates? As a detailed program performance person, what's the postmortem that you take away from the analysis of those things since they have been somewhat atypical over such a long time at Northrop?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. Carter, it's Wes. Let me reflect on that since I've probably got the most historical perspective on it than to bring you current. And I'll just take each of them as you described them. But we'll start with kind of a broader view.","I really like what we've done in our company. And as I said in my opening remarks, this goes to sort of the core of our culture and the enterprise to figure out how to quantify risk, how to manage risk, and to execute our programs better. If you turn the clock back quite a few number of years ago, we were really struggling on that. And as you know, years ago, we instituted a very robust set of changes, and we've maintained those changes. In fact, it's become just core to how we operate.","Does that mean we're perfect? No, we're not perfect. Clearly, if we're going to continue to help our customer community press the edge, there will be some things that we don't get exactly right, but they need to be very few and far between. And we have two, as you mentioned, and I think it is appropriate to set aside VITA. We've been very clear for a long time about our intent to exit that business and do it in a way that created a smooth transition for the Commonwealth. We were committed to supporting them through that process. And I would say on a very positive note with respect to that one, that transition was enabled a little bit faster than originally conceived. So I view that as very, very supportive of our portfolio action.","But let me take the two that you had mentioned. So, first on James Webb. On James Webb, this is a program that we took on quite a number of years ago, a decade-and-a-half ago actually, with the intent knowledge at the time that there was going to be a lot of invention on the program. We have succeeded in that invention. It is a remarkable engineering accomplishment \u2013 scientific and engineering accomplishment to have gotten ourselves through that invention. And now we're down to the phase of actually integrating the final parts together.","And inevitably, and this is how we do these types of programs and why we do what we do, we're going to test the heck out of this thing because we only get one shot at it to launch it. And we're going to make sure we find every little thing. Unfortunately, when you're at the very end stage of a program, finding a little thing propagates to the big thing. And that's what we're experiencing. And we and NASA \u2013 and I have to give NASA a lot of credit for the intensity of focus and their stick-to-it-ness with a flagship program like this.","But we're working our way through it, and I am absolutely confident that we are going to launch something that our nation is going to be so incredibly proud that we did, we together. So that, while it's tough, we're sticking it out, and we're going to make sure we find out whatever the things are to be found as we go through the testing, and we're not going to launch it until it's right. That's what we do, and we're intent on making sure that it comes out right.","With respect to the forward loss item, I think it's been covered rather extensively here. And I'll just say, broadly, this was a case where the technical requirements were, again, similar to what we do in other areas, quite extensive. And with respect to our risk management, I think we found a flaw in our process with respect to this particular class of technology and the way we looked at production.","And so you might imagine we're treating that as an investment that we're going to run through the rest of the company and make sure we don't ever have that one pop up again, just as we've done with other issues that we have found over time. And I'm confident we'll get it right on this program as well and be in a place where the customer is going to be just delighted with the capability that comes through it.","But we signed up to something, once again we're going to make sure that we follow through on our commitments as we always do, and that's the reason we went ahead and recognized this on a go-forward basis. But to your question about is there something endemic or are these more isolated, I see them as isolated cases. There are clearly learnings from each. And as I said, we're not perfect but we sure are striving for perfection here at Northrop and that's the way I would characterize what I'm seeing with these two issues. I feel very good about program execution across the enterprise.","And I'll just add that as we've brought Innovation Systems on and we've taken a good hard look at how they're performing and the way they're going about their business, I see that discipline of program execution at Innovation Systems as well. So it's going to be another very strong culture match of a kind as we bring the two businesses together, and I'm excited about that. But I very much appreciate the question, Carter. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. And congratulations to Kathy and Wes.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Jon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","At the risk of oversimplification, guys, the number of segments that Northrop has had over the years has shifted around a little bit and you recently had a nice consolidation of the three. Now we're at four. Obviously, Orbital just sitting in IS, maybe there's some opportunities there.","So, just now that the deal is closed, what are some of your perspectives on organization and portfolio at this point? Where do you see the opportunity to pull some levers in that organization and to what effect do you usually make those sorts of decision?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks for the question, Jon. As we have brought on the team and stood up Innovation Systems, we're taking this opportunity to really understand the portfolio through revenue synergy to identify where else in the company we can work together to realize that synergy. And we're already off to a strong start. We've talked about some of the areas already, like Space, particularly National Security Space and the recapitalization that we see going on there, and the great work that our teams are already doing to begin working together. We've also talked about missile defense, and even as we look forward into smart munitions, that's another area of synergy opportunity.","So it will be a process over the next period of time to really assess where that alignment should be in the future. We believe that in the near-term, it's best to keep that team organized together. They had recently gone through the integration of Orbital Sciences and ATK, and done a lot of good work in realizing their own synergies in coming together as a team. And we want to have a smooth transition for that team so as to take advantage of the growth that they already were experiencing, which was quite rapid if you look back at their first quarter performance year-over-year, they experienced significant growth. We want to ensure that they are able to continue to stay focused on both that growth attainment as well as their program performance, and that anything we do to change the organization structurally is done very thoughtfully.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K.

Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hunter, I'll just add, we're really proud of our team. They're doing a great job for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Rob.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hello.","Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Wes, Kathy, a question for you, either collectively or individually. There's been obviously the news recently about peace breaking out in the Korean Peninsula, or potentially. And also we've had the NATO summit as well and various things going on there.","I was wondering how this has translated through to what you're hearing from your customers. Have you seen any change in Asian demands as a result of what we've seen? Any clearer than any change in Europe?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So we actually see demand picking up in both arenas. You can look at very, very narrow focused events in one region or another and try and reach conclusions on it. But you really have to look at the big picture.","And the big picture, if you just look at Asia Pacific for just a moment, the nations all see very, very \u2013 I would characterize it as high-risk potential on their horizon with the growth in some nations, both in their economic capacity but also their intentions in terms of their behaviors, causing many of the nations, many of our allies throughout that region to realize that they are going to need to continue to increase their investment in their own security.","So that region in particular, I think as we think about the future, poses a significant both opportunity for us to be supportive of our allies but also a challenge for many of them to sort through how they're really going to achieve their security objectives both through the construct of allied partnership but also in the construct of their own security investments. And interacting with the leaders across Asia Pacific, you can just see that dialogue ongoing all the time.","If I look at Europe, Europe too has a variety of issues and concerns that it's going to have to address. And I think a lot of that was evident in some of the recent summits and discussions about investments that the nations need to be making.","And that's not all just prompted from U.S. pressure, clearly some of it is. But they recognize themselves that their own security environment is changing and that they need to take a more aggressive approach to investing in their security, again, in cooperation across all of our allies.","I think we all recognize that we're in it together. We've got to make sure that we are capable of working together, both in an operating construct but also in a technology construct, to be able to do the things that we're going to need to do going forward.","So I don't want to sound like an alarmist. That's not the intent. But the message is, clearly, from a market environment perspective, that our allies are going to be counting on us, and we're, as a company and I would say more broadly as an industry, stepping up to make sure that we're going to be there for them.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And, Wes, I might just add that we are seeing in fact this year strong international sales growth. And as we look forward, international growth remains a critical part of the strategy as well as ultimately what we believe is our ability to grow this business.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. And let me join in the congratulations to you, Wes. I've probably seen you at work longer than the other guys and always been (58:06)...","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","It's been a lot of years.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","So yesterday, Lockheed Martin that has a mix somewhat similar to yours basically had a significant increase in their sales guidance and earnings guidance for this year that really touched every single one of their divisions and cited new wins put on contract earlier than they expected and quicker flow-through of the FY 2018 kind of budget add-ons that were done in March as the reasons. Could you comment, by your business areas, what are you seeing in that respect?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, Cai, maybe I'll start on that and then I'll let Wes and\/or Kathy add color as they see fit. But maybe I wouldn't want to comment on anyone else's guide or their updates relative to that. But if I think about where we were for the year, when we gave our initial guide in January, we had a pretty strong, I would say, amount of growth in our sales guide.","And you can pick whether you want to think back to actual 2017 on the 605 basis or on a 606 basis, but our view was that we had a strong sales guide that indicated that we could grow this business in 2018. And we continue to believe that, and that's relative to the three sectors' organic growth that we had at that point in time.","If you think about Innovation Systems, it's had strong growth. You can see just the partial month since the acquisition closed, $400 million in sales, and they themselves had a strong first quarter of growth as well prior to the acquisition closing.","And then, just thinking about the guide as well, we continue to hold strong margins in all of the sectors for the full year. So we feel pretty good about our guide.","In terms of the impact of the 2018 budget increase you referenced. I would say that we've seen some of that impact in a few areas of our business, probably more so in Innovation Systems than others, and some of that being in the ammunition and missile side.","Kathy, I don't know if you want to comment further on any of those areas.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yes. So, Cai, I agree. We see strong budget outlook. And in response to that, our portfolio aligns very well to where we expect that growth to come from. Missile defense, munitions, space are all areas where we're seeing increase in growth and also focus in our own portfolio.","And we do anticipate recognizing some of that opportunity within the year. And as Ken said, it was reflected in our guide earlier in the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks a lot. Congratulations, Kathy, and Wes as well.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, David.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","That you.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Wanted to follow up on a question earlier about the cash-flow opportunity. Ken, you touched on a couple of programs at Innovation Systems. But if you just look at that business and how it's run historically, extremely-high levels of working capital, even ex-A350 and CRS.","Could you talk about if you see anything structurally different that business versus kind of legacy Northrop from a working-capital perspective, because there's a huge opportunity there at least looking at it straight up?","And then, quickly looking at the Q, Ken, it looks like intangible amortization in 2019, you're looking at like $275 million incremental. Is that a right number? Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So I'll take the first part of the question first on the working capital side, and then we'll try to address the estimated amortization for 2019 on the PI.","From a cash perspective, I would say that, look, we see room for improvement. We had been building some working capital over the last few years ourselves. There have been some changes in terms of the DFARS, and I think some changes in terms of customer behavior in terms of trying to use working capital as a lever. And so, we all need to react to that and figure out how we best manage that as we move forward. We're working it and starting to see some progress, and I fully expect that we will work it together with the Innovation Systems team and start to see progress on that side.","There are some customers that are simply more challenging than others in terms of working capital. And we will simply have to evaluate those business deals as we are looking at them and determining whether or not the structure of the deal in terms of return, in terms of cash flow profile meets our standards of the type of business that we want to do. You've seen us be pretty disciplined in terms of if we see business that doesn't meet our expected returns, and that's beyond margin profile, also includes cash profile.","But if we don't see that as something that we think is a good business deal, then we'll take a pass and leave it to somebody else. But we'll continue to evaluate all those deals as they come forward and, largely, I just think that we're working hard. We'll work hard with Innovation Systems, and I think there is opportunity in front of us.","In terms of the PI question, we have estimated an amount of amortization for the full year of 2019 of something north of $280 million. I think in the 10-Q, it's $284 million for 2019. And I would just remind you that the amortization of those intangibles are on an accelerated basis in accordance with GAAP and based on the cash flow that is behind those intangibles. And we see that then amortizing down in 2020 and then really starting to reduce in 2021 and 2022 and beyond.","So, still work to do, obviously. We're only a short period into our purchase accounting process, and we'll continue to refine that as we work forward from here to when that process is complete.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Jamie, we'll do one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Your final question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Sam.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I wanted to go back to one of the questions just about overall performance and trying to kind of tease through this. So, just Wes, you made a comment that you don't see \u2013 or you see these as isolated cases. Is there any common thread across the different performance that could change? Or is it something that we may run into periods in the future where a confluence of isolated things come together?","And then, I guess for Kathy, one of your roles right now is COO thinking about in the future. Is that something where you see a need for a COO overseeing a lot of the businesses as well in the future?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, Sam, I think I would largely repeat what I said in response to Carter's question. We've had a good long track record of good execution. I see that going forward. I see that built into the way that we operate today. I see the way that decisions get made. And so, hard for me to say never, never, never, that would be a foolish thing to say. But I feel really good about the way the company is making its business decisions, the way that our teams approach the execution of the activities that we capture, and that we commit performance on to our customers. I see our customers having a lot of confidence in our ability to do that.","So, if the direction of your question is kind of where does it go on a go-forward basis, I think we've got the right not only processes but also people in place as well as development programs in place, because you want to see this sustained well into the future to ensure that we're approaching our business the way we have been approaching our business. So it will require constant attention, and whenever there is a learning, to make sure that we really get the benefit of that learning, just as we've been doing for a number of years. So I do feel good about the process going forward.","I appreciate especially what Kathy has been doing in her role as COO and enforcing that discipline and making sure that we are really thinking about things in a broad way as we enter into new activities and that if we do see something that has any form of issue around the company, that we're putting the full power of this amazing corporation on it to get it fixed early. So, again, I feel good about the vector that I see.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And, Sam, I'll just add that it was important to have this role with the integration activity that we were undertaking and standing up in IS and ensuring that we remained focused on performance across the company. But I view our risk management process as sound, and it needs to be executed at all levels within the organization and not reliant on a single role or individual. And it's my focus to ensure that our company continues to operate within our risk management framework and that as we bring new leaders into the company at all levels, that they are able to also execute this risk management process. And that's how we'll continue to be successful.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","At this point in time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes for some final comments.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","All right. Thanks, Steve. Well, everyone, I think you've heard us say Innovation Systems a lot of times today but I'm going to say it again. I just want to say how delighted we are to have the Innovation Systems team join Northrop Grumman. This is such a great addition to our portfolio and to have it be accretive in 2018 is just tremendous for us. I appreciate the hard work by all of our team members around the company in continuing to drive performance and to position us well for our future.","So thanks, everybody, for joining on our call and for your continued interest in Northrop Grumman.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Robin and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Steve Movius","Thanks Robin, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. In addition to filing our first quarter 10-Q this morning, we also filed a form 8-K to recap the presentation of our consolidated financial statements for years 2013 through 2015 and the disclosures in certain portions of our 2015 10-K to reflect the changes in the company's organizational structure and reportable segments. We've also recast certain 2015 quarterly information as provided in schedule four of today's earnings release.","Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in the earnings release. On our call today is our Chairman, CEO and President Wes Bush; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wes Bush","Thanks Steve. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us today. This was a good quarter and a strong start for the year. So I want to thank our employees for their unwavering focus on performance. Our team continues to execute well and position the company to achieve profitable growth over the long term.","In the first quarter under our realign structure, all three businesses delivered strong results. To remind everyone, we undertook this realignment to better-focus our innovation and affordability efforts to provide our customers enhanced mission capability at a reduced cost. To find more effectively aligning and aggregating our products and services businesses, we enabled greater operational synergy and enhanced our ability to develop, produce, sustain and upgrade our products over their entire life cycle.","Sales for the quarter were comparable to last year at $6 billion. First quarter segment operating margin rate was 11.8% and supports our outlook for the year. Before the tax benefit, first quarter earnings per share would have been $2.59, a 7.5% increase over last year's first quarter. Including the tax benefit, earnings per share totaled $3.03. Cash from operations was the use of $60 million, substantially better than last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was the use of $358 million and includes capital spending of $298 million.","The first priority of our deployment strategy continues to be investing in our businesses to position the company for the future. We continue to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 million shares. This quarter's share, we purchased pace, supports our guidance of the 6% reduction in weighted average diluted share count this year. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $4 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.","For the year, we continue to expect sales will range between $23.5 billion and $24 billion with free-cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion which reflects strong cash from operations and investments for the future. As a result of the tax benefit and first quarter performance, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.40 to $10.70. First is our prior guidance range of $9.90 to $10.20.","In addition to this quarter's solid financial results, I'd also like to highlight some operational achievements. At Mission Systems, our Saber Radar started flight testing for the US F-16 modernization program. Saber brings fifth generation radar capability to the F-16 by leveraging hardware and software commonality between our F-22 and F-35 AS Radars. AMS will begin delivering Saber for international F-16 customers later this year. Also during the quarter, our BCN high altitude airborne communications gateway achieved a 100,000 combat flying hours and continues to provide critical communications capabilities by translating and distributing imagery, video, voice and data to enhance communications and awareness on the ground and in the air.","At Aerospace Systems, we successfully flew a Cyrus 2 Sensor on a Global Hawk, the first time this sensor has been demonstrated on a high altitude unmanned aircraft. Later this year, we expect to fly additional sensors on Global Hawk and we expect that Global Hawk will demonstrate its flexibility for supporting a wide variety of U.S. Air Force operational requirements. Triton, the maritime variant of Global Hawk continued to make good progress in its operational assessments this quarter. We look forward to a positive milestone sea decision that would transition Triton to low-rate initial production later this year.","The highlight during the quarter was getting back to work on the B-21 program. We're pleased at the GAO confirmed that the Air Force conducted an extremely thorough selection process and chose the most capable and affordable solution. The next generation Bomber is critical of the national security. It will allow significant forced projection anywhere in the world in an anti-axis aerial denial environment. We are absolutely committed to outstanding execution on this program and we are off to a strong start.","Northrop Grumman is a technology-driven company. Our team is pursuing innovation and breakthrough technologies to support the world's most technologically advanced military. A successful partnership with our customers helps to ensure military superiority. This partnership requires innovation, affordability, investment and performance. Investment on our part through IRAD and capital spending is critical and performance on our part is equally important. We are increasing investment through IRAD and capital expenditures as our opportunities that has grown. And we are committed to delivering very good returns on these investments.","Over the past several years, we've demonstrated that as a company, we can't perform during a challenging down cycle. That focus is even more important as we began work on important new development programs and continue to position the company for profitable growth over the long term.","To conclude, it was a good quarter and a solid start to 2016. Our value proposition remains the same: drive strong sustainable performance, generate cash and effectively deploy that cash. We continue to believe this is the right strategy and that it positioned us for continued long term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and guidance. Ken?","Ken Bedingfield","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my thanks to our team on their continued outstanding work. Today I'll briefly review our first quarter results and provide a little more detail on our 2016 guidance. But before I do, let me provide some more detail on our realignment. I'll start with Aerospace Systems.","The Azusa based military and civil space business formerly inherited to ES is now part of AS and the electronic attack business formerly in AS is now part of Mission Systems. AS continues to focus on demand aircraft, autonomous systems and space business areas. At Mission Systems, elements of our former information systems portfolio that were focused on sophisticated systems architecture and engineering including both advanced software and hardware capabilities are now combined with our former electronic systems portfolio. This creates a more integrated business to support development of new capabilities for our military and intelligence customers around the globe.","Within Mission Systems, we offer products and services in three major business areas: sensors and processing, cyber and ISR and advanced capabilities. Sensors and processing is the largest of the three and is focused on land and airborne radar, EW, C-2 and second efforts. Cyber and ISR encompasses a combination of work from the two legacy sectors including full spectrum cyber systems and ISR collection, processing and exploitation. Advanced capabilities provides integration and interoperability of net-enabled battle management, sensors, targeting and surveillance systems, air and missile defense, C-2 and global battle space awareness.","Technology services combines the service elements of our former information systems sector with the former technical services. The new TS includes our health IT work and a majority of our civil work. Technology services' primary focus is on life cycle support and modernization of systems and platforms as well as advanced training. The business areas of within TS are global logistics and modernization, advanced defense services and system modernization and services.","Turning to our financial results; our first quarter ETS included an $80 million or $0.44 per share tax benefit. We early-adopted an accounting standard update that requires recognition of excess tax benefits and efficiencies related to share base payments as either income tax expense or benefit in the TNL depending on whether the stock compensation awards best at, above, or below the grant price. In addition, the update requires these items now be presented in operating cash flow rather than as a financing item. Even before the benefit of the accounting update, we had a solid quarter.","Turning to the sectors; aerospace Systems sales rose 3% to approximately $2.6 billion due to higher volume for manned aircraft and autonomous systems. A manned aircraft, we continue to ramp up on our E2D program including production for Japan's first aircraft. Higher F-35 sales also contributed as we delivered 13 units this quarter versus nine in last year's first quarter. Increases on these programs were partially offset by lower volume for the D-2 as well as fewer FAA team deliveries and in the prior period. As expected, we delivered seven FAA teams this quarter versus nine in last year's first quarter.","Higher revenue autonomous systems included higher volume for Global Hawk and Triton. Global Hawk volume reflects the upgrade activities Wes mentioned earlier as well as production activity on Korea's Global Hawk. Triton volume continues to increase as we progress toward low-rate initial production. Space sales were comparable to the prior year period. Aerospace Systems operating income decline compared to last year's first quarter, an operating margin rate with 11.1%. First quarter operating income reflects lower margins on several manned aircraft programs with the primary driver being the timing of risk reductions.","For 2016, we continue to expect Aerospace sales in the low $10 billion range with a mid to high 11% margin rate. No change from prior guidance. Mission Systems' first quarter sales were comparable to the prior year at approximately $2.7 billion. Operating income increased 3% and operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to 13.1%. Sales reflect lower volume for cyber and ISR programs, partially offset by higher volume for sensors and processing and advanced capabilities programs. For 2016, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range with an operating margin rate in the mid to high 12% range. No change from prior guidance.","Technology services sales decline 4%, principally due to continued ramp-down on the ICBM program as well as lower volume for restricted programs. Operating income declined in-line with sales and operating margin rate was comparable to last year at 10.4%. For 2016, we continue to expect sales in a mid-$4 billion range with a margin rate of approximately 10%. No change from prior guidance.","As Wes mentioned, our segment operating margin rate for the quarter was 11.8%, which is a good start towards our full-year guidance of high 11% for the year. Total operating margin rate of 12.4% was strong and we continue to expect total operating margin rate of about 12% for the full year. Our net FAS\/CAS adjustment is unchanged at $275 million for the year and we continue to expect unallocated corporate expenses of about $200 million.","As a result of the $80 million tax benefit, our effective tax rate declined to 17.8% for the quarter and for the full year, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27%. Our updated 2016 earnings per share guidance of $10.40 to $10.70 reflects a $0.50 increase to the top and bottom of the range and continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to about $181 million shares.","We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to range between $1.5 and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $298 million and include $159 million for the purchase of the building previously leased by Mission Systems. In addition to the building we purchased in the first quarter, we expect to close on another facility in the second quarter.","I'll conclude my remarks with a discussion on awards and backlog. During the first quarter of 2016, the company's total backlog increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems in a modest decline in backlog at technology services. The company recorded various awards during the quarter including a portion of the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber Program. We intend to report backlog and awards on a full-year basis for the company and each sector in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K. We also intend to provide qualitative information on a quarterly basis similar to this quarter's disclosure until year-end.","Before we begin Q&A, I would also remind everyone that beyond the statements in our prepared remarks, we have no additional information to share on the B21 award or the program in general. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?","Steve Movius","Thanks, Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, we ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question. Robin?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Wes and Ken, I wanted to try to ask about margins going forward and I just heard the directive on one part. So this is kind of a multi-one part that I'll try to wrap into one. But we get a lot of questions from investors about - we've seen all the new business wins and we think the top line can grow, but we hear concern that margins will go down because of all that new business. When I map it out, it seems pretty likely your F-35 business margins will improve. When I map out your own man business, it looks like margins can improve pretty significantly there because they're such a big mix shift to procurement from development and too international. So I think people kind of get concerned at the Bomber being a new large development program will be pretty dilutive to the margin.","But when I look at it because Bomber stays so much smaller than those other programs, total unmanned F-35 and some others for a while, I actually arrive at the total company having segment margin expansion pretty much every year for the next three to five years. I know you probably don't want to give specific annual guidance, but just directionally, is that in a scenario analysis? Am I missing anything with the margin trajectory?","Ken Bedingfield","Noah, great question and I wouldn't say that you're missing anything in terms of analysis of the fact that we've got a lot of moving parts. We do have a well-diversified portfolio and we've got some business - you're right - should be driving towards some higher margins. We have been realizing margins on F-35 that are below what we expect for a program at that level of maturity and we certainly expect as we move towards more mature production, that we would realize higher margins in that area. Autonomous Systems, we do see some international business that's moving into production as well as Triton hopefully moving out of development and into LRIP. So we would expect to the potential first on higher margins there.","That being said, we do have a fair amount of development work that we're taking on whether that's B-21 or some of the other strategic items that Wes mentioned - whether that's Saber, or SEWIP, or G\/ATOR or others. In some respects, the question is what's going to move first in a web velocity among those various moving parts? I would say that overall, certainly some pressures on margin rates as development programs grow, but as you mention, we do have more mature production that's also going to be growing in terms of dollars. The other one I probably should have mentioned is E-2 that's now into multi-year production.","So we'll continue to work on it. I see it as being range-bound into a reasonable range. We have the opportunity to continue to perform and we also need to work to try to offset the pressure that will come from the development margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned, Bernstein.","Doug Harned","Yes, thank you.","Wes Bush","Hey, Doug. Good afternoon.","Doug Harned","I'm interested in Mission Systems. You made the comment that you're seeing this quarter lower sales for ISR in cyber, higher for sensors, but if you look forward and you look at the pieces of that business, can you talk about where you see the growth trends? Because that doesn't sound like its representative of where this business is really headed over the next few years. Could you comment on that?","Wes Bush","Doug, its Wes. Let me just give you a kind of sense of how I see things with respect to our Mission Systems business. Our strategy in putting the parts of the Legacy electronic systems and Legacy information systems, business together that we combined to create MS was precisely around - I think what you're getting to, which is growth - there's opportunity in that market space over the longer time by integrating those capabilities together in innovative ways that I think will help position us quite nicely to do exactly what our customer needs us to do, which is to give a more capability at lower cost.","When I think about the core product lines in there, the areas that I see as having really good growth opportunities, clearly communications, the work that we do in creating software define capabilities for communications is extensive and we're continuing to see a great demand in that area. Certainly combat avionics is a big part of the growth equation in MS. Cyber, as we've talked about for some time is another area that's growing well and I think you're all familiar with the fact that we have not only had a good IRCM business for some time, but last year with our capture of the crypto contract that added to our portfolio of opportunity in that countermeasures business.","All of those areas are I think examples of the types of businesses where we see really good growth prospects going forward with MS. Ken, was there anything you'd like to add on that?","Ken Bedingfield","I think you hit it on the head on that one, Wes. I think that's the right answer to the question.","Wes Bush","All right.","Operator","Your next question, from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Siefman","Thanks very much and good morning.","Ken Bedingfield","Hi, Seth.","Seth Siefman","Hi. I just wanted to ask about the dividend. Based on what you've done in the past, it would seem that you guys have an increase coming up potentially on next month and part as a function of the rise in the share price, the yield is down to I think about 1.6% to 1.7%, and how you think about where you want that to be going forward?","Ken Bedingfield","Seth, thanks for the question. We do historically review our dividend for whether there will be an increase at the main meeting of the boards, so that is upcoming. I would say that we've had a history of dividend increases for a number of years and we will consider that between now and that meeting. I would just comment that in terms of chasing dividend yield, we don't make a practice of chasing yield. I would note that our yield is lower than some of our peers primarily because of stock price performance as opposed to dividend historical increases.","We tend to think of dividend in terms of a payout ratio and that payout ratio being pension-adjusted net earnings and we believe if you look at our dividend in that light, you'll see that we're in a competitive range within our peer group. That's the light in which we'll continue to analyze this for the foreseeable future.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with the Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good afternoon.","Ken Bedingfield","Hi, Rob.","Wes Bush","Hi, Rob.","Robert Stallard","A Bomber's question. First of all on the B-2, you know that it was a bit lower in Q1. Is this a trend or can we expect this program to remain steady going forward? And secondly on the B-21 - I know we're not allowed to ask you a question, but I'll try - have you had any indication from the Air Force that they will be easing up on the classified structure of this program? Thank you.","Ken Bedingfield","Rob, your first question on the B-2, I would say I do not believe the first quarter volume indicates a trend. This is one that has a number of aspects to the program and various pieces of business that run through there. So I think it's primarily just timing. Modernization more so has a bit more of fluctuation than the baseline maintenance and operations business. As far as the B-21, I wouldn't be able to comment. I think that's something we'd leave for the Air Force to determine income.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ron Epstein","Yay! Good morning\/afternoon, guys.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, Ron.","Ron Epstein","It looks like in Mission Systems, you guys said that the volume in margins were down for cyber and ISR. It seems like the past few years, both of those areas were growth drivers for the segment. Is that decline sort of a quarterly thing, or are we seeing a shift in customer priority?","Wes Bush","I think it's important to be clear about what that was within that part of the business and I know it's a little bit difficult to track what's in the pieces quite yet, given that we're brand new in putting out a description of how we're categorizing the different elements of the business and I would direct you to look at the 8-K that just got filed to help better understand that. But the thing that was really driving that this quarter, the lower sales and the part of the business that we call cyber and ISR was actually a lower volume on the Counter-Narcoterrorism Technology Program, CNTPO, which is an IDIQ type of contract with different task quarters that's been sort of fluctuating up and down over the years.","So, I would not describe that in any way as a core part of the way we characterize cyber or our ISR activities. That happens to be a part of what got put into that portion of the business that we described with that label. So we don't see any negative trends at all in sort of the core cyber or ISR elements of our business. But CNTPO with respect to some of the IDIQ task force had some fluctuation that drove that outcome.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you so much. Did I miss the backlog numbers? Are we going to get restated backlog numbers for your three new businesses?","Ken Bedingfield","Cai, just a comment on the backlog. We are presenting backlog on a quarterly basis at this point on a qualitative level by sector. So we did provide information that AS backlog is up, MS backlog is up and technology services is moderately down. I'd refer you to the 8-K for the details that are in there with respect to backlog.","Operator","And your next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good afternoon, Wes and Ken.","Wes Bush","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Just a clarification question. I noticed there was no B-21 disclosure in the AS comments. Is that due to the programs classification or because of its materiality? I guess just clarify that for us and then a higher level question for you, Wes, and it's about sort of managing growth and performance simultaneously. You got a lot of programs ramping and you got a lot of additional opportunities on the horizon, but clearly executing on the cost performance on several of these programs and none more so than the B-21 is huge.","So, I wondered if you might give us some insight into how you're thinking about how you managed that given the history of several of these programs and the importance to the customer of maintaining the cost targets that you've laid out there.","Wes Bush","Yes, Carter, thanks for the question. With respect to B-21, the disclosures are what they are. We've got the material and what we have released that we're going to be able to disclose on it. I really appreciate your question on growth and performance because it is a topic that we've been spending quite a bit of time on within our company and not just recently having one, a number of activities to something that we've been working hard to be prepared for a long period of time; and the actions that we've taken over the last several years with respect to our focus on execution performance on our programs, I think is serving us very well on that regard.","I know a lot of folks sort of look at the margin expansion that we had over the last few years and thought, \u201cWell, that's just cost reduction.\u201d Well, clearly cost discipline is an important part of it, but I will tell you the big driver for all of those margin expansions was actually better performance, better programmed execution and that discipline in the company has steadily been increasing and it is the focal point for just about every engagement we have with our leadership team in terms of the actions that we need to be taking collectively to further enhance our ability to execute.","So when we look at our new programs, programs that we're taking on, we approach each of them from the perspective of how do we manage the inherent risk that goes with a new development activity? First and foremost, that means being very clear about what all those risk really are, getting them out on the table as transparently as possible for all of us to focus on; and then secondly, in short [ph] that we have very strong risk management capabilities and practices baked in for everything that we take on. That's the discipline that we're driving in our execution.","In addition to our work and in terms of being able to execute more effectively, I would say that there are some very positive trends in our customer community that are helping in this regard. And one of the ones that I would point out is requirement stability. There's a lot of work that's been done over the last few years as a result of the efforts both at the OST level and in each of the services to enhance the acquisition team's ability to hold the requirement stable. Because we all know when it comes to these development programs, a major source of cost growth and schedule expansion historically has been requirements and stability. We simply as a nation can't afford that anymore. In order to execute well, we need to be able to keep the requirements stable, we need to of course drive the execution with great discipline from the companies and I have to give the services and OST a lot of credit for their attention to requirement stability. I think that's going to help a lot.","Now, there's a third component to this that is also really important and that is funding stability. Given the volatility that we've seen in the budgeting process over the last few years, this is an area where we need congress to help as well. We need that stability to be able to execute well. And when we get funding volatility on programs, that too can ripple the outcomes. So this is a matter of focus across the board and it requires all the players both the industry, the customer community and the congress to play their role in making this program successful and we're certainly determined to do our part. I've been encouraged by what I've seen both in the Pentagon and on The Hill with respect to the various defense committees recognizing the importance of all of these aspects to ensure we can execute well. But it's clearly right at the very top of the list of actions that we have within our company to drive good solid execution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard Rubel","Thank you.","Wes Bush","Hi, Howard.","Howard Rubel","Good. I'm going to ask the per se question, Wes and go back to backlog again. Sorry. But it's very unusual for an aerospace company not to report a backlog number and could you go through the logic as to why you won't provide interim numbers?","Ken Bedingfield","Howard, it's Ken here. At this point, I think the only comment I would make is to refer you to the 8-K and just to remind you that we do intend to provide annual backlog data at the entire company and at the sector levels in our 2016 annual report on form 10-K.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason Gursky","Hey, good morning guys, or good afternoon. One of the just quick clarification as well and a lot, on the clarification was mentioned the B-2 volumes look like they're a bit of lumpy this year. Can you give us a percent of what you expect them to be in 2016 relative to 2015 growth, but - and what the expectation was going forward. And then the bigger question is can you just talk about again for - it's all the talk within minuses from a revenue perspective in the aerospace segment that you might see over the next several years. We know about F-35, Long Range Strike we'll obviously see some growth, but are there any other pluses and minuses that we should all be cognizant of as we go out to profile in that business?","Ken Bedingfield","Jason, I would say that in terms of the B-2 volume question upfront, in terms of the lumpiness, I think that's just kind of a quarter-by-quarter thing. We do manage this business for the long term and no concerns about the B-2 or where it is. I would say overall, we expect B-2 volume to be relatively consistent in 2016 with where it was in 2015, somewhere in the $700 million range in terms of sales volume. In terms of the second part of the question on pluses and minuses in revenues, at aerospace, I would say again a fair number of moving parts. In terms of what's declining, probably the biggest piece of decline would be F-18. As that program ramps down, I think we're down to two per month sort of delivery schedule.","The other areas where we've seen a bit of decline in 2016 versus last year would be non-restricted space particularly AEHF, James Webb Space Telescope. In terms of adds to volume, we do expect that F35 will start to ramp here at some point and we're looking forward to when that occurs. The B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber is certainly something that we would see as ramping here. And then as I mentioned, the E2D program that is now into the multi-year production, we talked about Triton moving into LRIP and then I would say a number of restricted activities.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, Miles.","Myles Walton","Wes, I was intrigued to see the company tie 30% of its annual incentive comp to pension adjusted net income growth for the first time this year. Your guidance would imply that it doesn't grow this year. So conceptually, this year - is one question, but then also, I guess you're now comfortable that the company and maybe the industry is centered in the back drop where it's not just a capital return, but there's actually underlying year-on-your compounding pension adjusted net income growth?","Wes Bush","I appreciate the question. It's kind of a reflection of the way we think about motivating our team. Clearly, if you look at the budgets that have been approved, '16, well, in terms of the investment accounts domestically here were up about 14% over 15% and '17, well, not quite as robust in terms of the present's budget is still up noticeably from where we have been in '15. Some question obviously about whether or not the congress can move beyond this two-year process of getting past the budget control act or the sequester and get us into a more stable long term factor. But if you do look at the present budget, it puts the investment accounts in a more robust position. I think you might argue whether or not it's robust enough, you know what's going on around the globe.","Given that, from a company perspective, we see our portfolio as being very well-positioned to take advantage of that healthier environment to better-support our customers with products and services they really need to address that tough threat environment that's out there. So we are looking at that aspect of our incentive plan even though it's stated on an annual basis as something that we are integrating more into the thinking in the company and the way that we're going to incentivize ourselves over time to make sure that we're translating this improved market opportunity space into actual increases in net income over a period of years.","So we tend to use our annual incentive plan as a way of ensuring alignment within the company around a way we're thinking about what we need to get done. You might recall a few years ago when we were taking on this initial thrust to change our outcomes on operating margin rates. We set that up incrementally over a course of several years, but it was a very strong communication within the company around this as our area of focus and this is the outcome we need to achieve and it was very effective. I expect that as we go forward and focus on this transition in the market environment, that we'll be able to generate a very positive outcome by ensuring that our team is focused on growing the bottom line, not just the top line. We need to make sure we'd bring the bottom line with us as we're growing over time.","I would not describe this as an either\/or on capital deployment or net income growth. We do anticipate maintaining a very strong focus on returning cash to shareholders. How we do that over the course of time always varies a little bit. But I think you've heard both Ken and I say on our recent calls, share repurchase will continue to be a very important part of our strategy as well as having a competitive dividend from a payout ratio perspective.","We look at all of these elements of value creation as being very important, but I think you put your finger on it the right way in your question as we look at the changing market conditions, it will be important for us to incentivize our team to make sure that we are growing that bottom line as well as the top line.","Ken Bedingfield","Miles, if I can just add to that. I would say that I think Wes' point around the trajectory, it was important. What we've done here is really set a baseline in 2016 from where there's a trajectory for net income to grow from. So do not necessarily read this as 2016 net income as growing from '15, but we've set a base line that we're looking to grow from as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question is from David Strauss from UBS.","David Strauss","Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","Hi, David.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, David.","David Strauss","Another question on F-35, can you just update us where you are in terms of locking in the various contracts? And then Ken, a question around revenue recognition. I think you're on units of [ph] now the updated revenue recognition standard, how could that impact you on F-35 and if so, when? Thanks.","Ken Bedingfield","All right. Great. Thanks, David, for the question. I would say a couple of things. I guess first to answer your question where we stand on contracts, just a reminder we do have four main contracts on F-35 with Lockheed-Martin. We've got the center fuselage, the radar, distributed aperture system and the CNI communications navigation identification suite and various aspects of those are in negotiation with Lockheed Martin, but I would say that what folks tend to think of as our main piece, that being the center fuselage - which is our single largest contract - we are negotiated through LRIP 8, continuing to work hard to get LRIPs 9 and 10 negotiated. Just working through the details with those with our customer.","In terms of the question on the REV\/REX standard, very good question. We are on units of delivery for all four of our contracts on F-35 and we also have other units of delivery contracts - F-18 is one and some others within Mission Systems. We do expect that when we adapt the new REV\/REX standard which should be in the first quarter of 2018, we would transition from units of delivery on each of those contracts to a cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition. That being said, we do not expect - and looking at the profile of those contracts that are on units of delivery and where they're going to be in their life cycle, we don't expect that the revenue recognized in that period should be significantly different from what would be recognized on the units of delivery basis.","The reason for that is that the cost to repute ultimately is pretty consistent with the unit flow that we see. So there could be some impact and there certainly will be some impact, but we have not at this point seen that as particularly significant for the adaption of that new standard in 2018.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities.","Sam Pearlstein","Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","Hey, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","I guess more for Ken, but can you talk a little bit more about the capital spending? You had the $150 million or so building that you purchased this first quarter, it sounds like there's another one about to be teed up. Can you just help me understand how to think about what that means for the appreciation expense. Does it mean cap ex is going to be near the high-end versus the low-end this year in terms of just now that you've actually executed some of those plans?","Ken Bedingfield","All right. Let me see if I can address those in maybe three pieces. I guess the first part is capital spending in the first quarter. What I would say is yes, the building certainly was a significant piece of that. The other piece of it, I think is just continued projects that we've been working through in 2015 and you can think of those as generally being related to either some of the centers of excellence's work that we've been undertaking here in the last couple of years. As well as some that are programmatic in nature, in general supporting multiple programs whether it's programs that are in production and we're seeing some relatively solid production numbers in front of us where we determine we can invest. A great example of that would be the St. Augustine Aircraft Integration Center where we invested ahead of the E2D multi-year program because we saw that there was a relatively stable base of production for a relative long period of time.","I would say that some of it is the buildings that we've talked about and some of it is just kind of continued spend on the existing projects, much of which is either centers of excellence or program-related. But for the most part, if they're a program, they support multiple programs and not just a single. In terms of depreciation, what I would say is that we don't look at our indirect rates on a piece-by-piece or line-by-line basis. We've managed our indirect as a piece of our total cost and just because depreciation may be going up doesn't mean that we have an excuse to let our indirect rates increase.","So we'll manage and we'll continue to manage this as we have as component of total cost and to the extent depreciation is up, we'll have to find other areas where we'll realize cost savings. I think a great example of that is just if you look within the capital itself. The capital for the building we purchased in the first quarter and the capital for the building that we intend to purchase in the second quarter will result in depreciation charges that are significantly less than the rent expense on those buildings. So there will be savings in the indirect pools right there that would be a component of how we would offset those increases in depreciation charges going forward. But we certainly see that as something we'll be able to manage as we have in the past, aggressively looking at holding our indirect rates.","And then in terms of the range for cap ex, we certainly looked hard at that here as we were giving guidance for the first quarter. We believe it's appropriate to hold our range where it is, still a number of moving parts and a fair amount of time between now and the end of the year. But if we see some additional clarity on that between now and the other second quarter call, they'll certainly update that range as appropriate.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Hi, guys. Thanks. Good afternoon.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, Hunter, how is it going?","Hunter Keay","Very good, thank you. A question on the IRAD. As we think about it, obviously it kicked up a little bit last year and I think I'll understand why that was the case and I was sort of thinking about that going forward as a percentage sales I mean, and if you want to answer the question on the context of sort of how DOD is maybe shifting all of the development expense over the industry. Are you seeing any particular areas where that emphasis of industry spending its own money is particularly emphasized like on radar programs or unmanned, or anything like that where you see a particular area of pressure to spend your own money to develop new systems? Thank you.","Wes Bush","Hunter, it's Wes. I think the thing to keep in mind with IRAD these are decisions that each company has to make on how it invest to position itself for the longer term. That really is the framework that we look at. When we think about IRAD, we drive the process internally to really test, \u201cAre we making smart investments that really have the opportunity not just tomorrow?\u201d Or sometimes you can just put in a couple of years, but over the long term, \u201cAre these investments, they're really going to generate the opportunity to enhance our ability to support our customer and the result in profitable growth for the enterprise?\u201d","There's a lot of judgment that goes into making those investments. We looked across the full array of customer needs and in response to the second part of your question, I would say all of our customers are looking at a threat environment that is going to require that they bring more innovation to the game to the products that they're out acquiring, they're going to need more innovation to ensure that we're going to be able to put forth a military capability that truly is differentiated technologically. So it isn't just one area. Probably all of the areas you mentioned plus many more are representative of our customer's needs today to really enhance their capability to address their very difficult and challenging missions particularly as we look around the globe and see many other countries investing on the technology front as well in that regard.","This is a core part of what we do, our fundamental business model. We invest, we bring brilliant scientists, and engineers, mathematicians together to figure out how to help our customers stay ahead. We don't want their effort to be a case where our service men and women have to go into a fair fight when it comes to the technology capabilities. We want to be with. These are our fundamental investment decisions that we make and given this growth in complexity that our customers are facing, I think it is incumbent on us collectively across our industry to be investing appropriately.","You saw us take our IRAD investments up over the last couple of years, up into the 3% range and I anticipate going forward we'll be at that higher level of investment because we'd see the business imperative both through our customer's eyes and through the eyes of generating returns on those investments. So long as we can make smart investments, apply those funds in the right direction and bring together the right human capital, we should be in a really good position to support our customer's needs.","That's the lens through which we see it. I know that there has been fair amount of public discourse about the need for both industry and quite frankly government to be spending more on investment, but I think it's just reflection of the reality of the thread environment. So we're stepping up, we certainly need government to step up in terms of this investment and fundamental R&D and product development. But I think this is something that's just a clear imperative and supports getting the right types of returns on those investments over time.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn form Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn","Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","Hey, Rob.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, Rob.","Robert Spingarn","Hi, guys. Wes, I was going to ask you a program question and maybe it falls on a little bit from what you were just talking about, but you've always been viewed as a favorite for navy UCLASS strike platform which is now essentially been descoped down to a refueling system, CBARS. So I'm asking about how that changes Northrop's competitive discriminators? Does it alter where Northrop sees CBARS relative to other upcoming competitions, particularly given the major investments that you've made in the demonstrator prototypes?","Wes Bush","Rob, that's a good question and I think a really important one as we look at the underlying capabilities that will be required to support essentially any meaningful unmanned operation off the deck of an aircraft carrier. We're absolutely delighted with the ground work that's been laid by the X-47B program - taking off the deck of an aircraft carrier without a human in the loop is a neat trick onto itself, but landing on a deck of an aircraft carrier is a really neat trick and we're the only company that has done that, something of this capability.","So we see ourselves as well-positioned to support whatever the mission requirement that the navy derives or unmanned operations on and off the deck of aircraft carriers, and we're going to continue to work hard to support the navy on this. Clearly, there are some differences that go with the variability of whatever the mission might be. Strike as I think about it from a long term perspective is going to continue to be really, really important. The navy is concerned as well about surveillance and reconnaissance with an edition's carrier asset and they've chosen to focus this next round of activity on refueling, which is also a really important mission for the navy.","In all of those cases, they are mission-variants, but the underlying technology, the capability to design, and build, and reliably operate an autonomous - a truly autonomous system - in that type of environment, that's something that we've made a lot of progress on. X-47B was important for the navy in terms of demonstrating that this really could be done and I think CBARS and future variants of that type of unmanned capability are going to be really important opportunities for Northrop Grumman.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, Robin, one more question.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Joe Zenardi [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much. Ken, I'm wondering if you could talk about just on the pension side? I think some of your peers are starting to see contributions ramp up over the next couple of years, so if you could just talk about what your required contributions look like going forward? I would imagine it's a little bit smoother than your peers. And then if you could just update us on FAS\/CAS, maybe beyond 2016?","Ken Bedingfield","Yes. Thanks for the question, Joe. On pension, I would say that all things being equal in terms of where we are today versus where we were at the Q4 call in January where we provided some information on pension and without different assumptions, I don't see any changes from where we were then and at that point in time, I would say about call it on average, $100 million a year for '16, '17 and '18 in terms of required contributions primarily for our non-qualified plans and that was based on the discount rates at the end of the year and our expected rates of return. I would say that at this point in time, no major update from where we are there. We'll continue to evaluate that between now and at the end of the year and we'll tend to give some guidance around the third quarter call and an update to have our final assumptions at the end of the year.","But we're looking at again, with assumptions that just stand today, not a significant level of pension funding requirements which is certainly a good place to be.","Steve Movius","With that, I'll turn the call over to Wes for final comments.","Wes Bush","Well, thanks, Steve. Let me just wrap up by thanking our team again for a good start to 2016. It's clear to us that our customers really need performance and innovation to successfully address their demanding missions and our team is absolutely focused on supporting them.","So thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today and thanks also for your continuing interest in our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our today's conference call.

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings.

We will be posting updated company and sector overviews that provide supplemental information on Northrop Grumman and our 4 sectors. You can access our updated company overview and the sector overviews on the Investor Relations page at www.northropgrumman.com.","On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush","Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our team is off to a good start for the year, with a solid first quarter set of results. We continue to focus on superior program execution, affordability and innovation in our drive to achieve strong sustainable results. We're proud of our team's performance and the continued focus on delivering value for our customers.","First quarter earnings per share increased 30% to $2.63. Excluding this quarter's tax benefit for the partial resolution of the IRS examination of tax years 2007 through 2009, earnings per share grew 18%. Strong operating performance, favorable pension trends and the reduction in share count were the primary drivers of this quarter's results. We were also pleased to see the increase in awards relative to the first quarter of last year.","First quarter sales were consistent with our guidance for the year. We continue to see lower volume for programs associated with in-theater troop withdrawals, program ramp-downs and program transitions. Growth in our international business is partially offsetting these impacts. We expect these trends to continue with declines in domestic programs being partially offset by higher volume for international programs, which represented 14% of our year-end backlog.","First quarter segment operating margin rate increased to 12.9%, primarily due to strong program performance. Total operating margin rate was 14.4%, reflecting operational strength and favorable pension trends.","During the quarter, we repurchased 4.8 million shares for $564 million. Share repurchases reduced weighted average shares outstanding by approximately 9%. As of March 31, we had repurchased 25.6 million shares or more than 40% toward our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015, market conditions permitting.","Cash from operations was a use of approximately $400 million, principally due to higher working capital, and we ended the quarter with cash of approximately $3.9 billion on the balance sheet. As you know, the first quarter is typically our lowest in terms of cash generation. Jim will provide more detail on cash later in the call, but I would note that we continue to expect healthy cash flow for the year and we are maintaining our full year guidance for cash from operations and free cash flow.","Backlog at the end of the quarter was $36.2 billion, which includes new awards of $4.9 billion. We had solid award trends in 3 of our sectors. Electronic Systems had a book-to-bill of 111%. Information Systems had book-to-bill of 92%, principally due to awards in cyber solutions. Technical Services also had solid awards this quarter. Aerospace Systems, with a book-to-bill of 60%, was impacted by timing of awards. As our longest cycle business, awards here tend to be larger and less frequent.","Although our customers continue to cope with declining budgets and the threat of sequestration returning in 2016, most of our programs were well supported in the President's fiscal year 2015 budget. And over the long term, we see a significant set of opportunities aligned with our core capabilities, both domestically and internationally.","In OEM, we were pleased that the President's budget proposal specified Global Hawk as our nation's high-altitude, long-endurance ISR platform for the future. The program is currently on contract for long-lead advance procurement for 3 Global Hawks in Lot 11 and the President's budget calls for funding a future upgrade and sustainment efforts. Our team worked very hard to improve Global Hawk's affordability, and this program is a good example of effectively combining innovation and affordability to produce a good outcome for our customer.","In recognition of our performance and cost-effectiveness, the Air Force awarded the Global Hawk team the Roche Sustainment Excellence Award for the second year in a row. Last month, Korea signed a letter of offer and acceptance for the acquisition of Global Hawk Block 30s, an important first step toward finalizing a contract. The Royal Australian Air Force also announced its interest in acquiring Triton for its future maritime high altitude surveillance, and several other countries have expressed interest in both Global Hawk and Triton. We see international sales of our HALE platforms as a robust long-term opportunity.","Regarding the UCAS-D platform, we continue to demonstrate its utilization in the carrier environment. The National Aeronautic Association recently honored our X-47B demonstrator team with aviation's highest honor, the Collier Trophy, for developing the first unmanned autonomous air system to operate from an aircraft carrier. Our UCAS-D experience provides a strong foundation for our future efforts in unmanned systems.","On the manned military side, we and the navy are working towards a multi-year agreement for the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, which continues to be very well supported in the budget. The F-35 also continues to be a priority program, and we expect it will be an additional source of international growth. And while we can't say much about the long range strike opportunity, it is a high priority effort for the Air Force, and an important opportunity for Northrop Grumman.","Our space programs are well supported in the budget. The FY '15 budget provides for incremental funding of SBIRS GEO 5 and 6, and SBRIS RDT&E funding is consistent with prior expectations. For advanced CHF, the FY '15 procurement plan continues the incrementally funded block buy of satellites 5 and 6.","Information Systems, the incumbent on the navy's kings [ph] development contract, is competing for the follow-on production work, which is expected to be awarded later this year. Beyond this CIRCM program, the next-generation countermeasure system, slated to protect rotary wing aircraft is an important competitive opportunity for our Electronic Systems team.","ES successfully completed acceptance testing on the first CIRCM suite of equipment 2 months ahead of schedule. ES will now compete for the EMD phase, which is expected to be awarded next year. CIRCM has the potential to be a multibillion dollar opportunity over the life of the program. ES has also competed for 3DELRR, the Air Force's next-generation long-range radar system. This competition is expected to be decided this year, and would also likely to have potential for future international sales.","So while the U.S. budget environment continues to be challenging, particularly for our short-cycle businesses, we had a good long-term set of opportunities that includes the potential for continued growth in international sales.","Based on first quarter results and our financial outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.90 to $9.15, from our prior range of $8.70 to $9. We continue to expect sales of $23.5 billion to $23.8 billion, and we are maintaining our [indiscernible] of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion in cash from operations, and $1.7 billion to $2 billion for free cash flow.","So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Jim?","James F. Palmer","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As Wes said, just another solid quarter. Our team continues to execute in a demanding environment, and I also want to express my sincere appreciation to them for their continuing dedication. My comments will focus on sector results and our cash outlook for the year.","So starting with the sectors. Aerospace, where sales declined by $65 million or 3%. The volume decline was largely in space programs and unmanned systems, with the unmanned volume decline primarily due to lower production activities on Global Hawk and Fire Scout. These declines were partially offset by higher volume on the NATO AGS program. Operating income increased by 20% due to strong performance and a $48 million increase in net favorable adjustments. The higher level of adjustments was across several contracts, none of which were material on an individual basis. For the year, we continue to expect sales to range between $9.7 billion and $9.9 billion, and we expect AS will have a margin rate in the high 11% range, versus our prior guidance of mid to high 11%.","Turning to Electronic Systems, first quarter sales declined by 4% due to timing of deliveries for various combat avionics programs, as well as the lower deliveries of navigation and maritime systems. Declines in these areas were partially offset by double-digit growth in international activities.","Operating income declined 9% and operating margin rate declined by 90 basis points. You might recall that last year's first quarter benefited from the reversal of a $26 million non-programmatic risk reserve. While this year, ES had favorable adjustments of $57 million, which were $23 million lower than last year. So for the year, we continue to expect sales of $6.8 billion to $7 billion, with an operating margin rate in the low to mid 15% range.","At Information Systems, first quarter sales declined by 6% or about $100 million. IS experienced lower funding across a broad number of programs, including a decline in about $40 million due to in-theater troop drawdowns. The decline in IS first quarter operating income was in line with that lower revenue, and operating margin rate was comparable to last year's first quarter.","For the year, we continue to expect sales at IS to range between $6.1 billion and $6.2 billion, and we now expect that IS margin rate in the high 9% range versus our prior guidance of mid 9%.","Moving to Technical Services, first quarter sales declined 3%. Lower revenues reflect volume declines for the Hunter and ICBM programs, partially offset by higher volume for the KC-10 program. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Qantas defense systems, and TS operating income and operating margin rate increased due to improved performance. For the year, we continue to expect sales of approximately $2.7 billion, with a high 8% margin rate. On a consolidated basis, first quarter segment operating margin rate improved to 12.9%, 60 basis points, and included a $23 million increase in net favorable adjustments.","The remaining performance improvements reflects the higher booking rates across our portfolio that resulted in part from EAC adjustments in prior quarters. As a result of this quarter's strong performance, we're increasing our full year guidance for segment operating margin rate to approximately 12%, and we now expect a total operating margin rate of approximately 13%.","I would also note that we had a lower tax rate this quarter. This quarter's 23 point -- 26.3% effective tax rate reflects a $51 million benefited -- benefit related to the partial resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2009 tax returns.","This quarter's benefit from the partial resolution of that IRS exam is higher than what we had assumed in our initial 2014 guidance. And as a result, we now expect an effective tax rate of about 31.5% for the year.","Last year's first quarter effective tax rate includes a $20 million benefit related to the reinstatement of the research tax credits. On the other hand, our 2014 guidance does not include the potential renewal of the R&D tax credit at this point.","Our lower effective tax rate, combined with this quarter's strong segment operating income, were the primary drivers of the increase in our 2014 EPS guidance.","Turning to cash from operations, we used $402 million in the quarter. That cash use was principally driven by changes in trade working capital, largely influenced by the timing of cash receipts, including the burn-down of international advances.","As you know, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter for cash generation, and we are seeing this same trend this year, but there are a couple of items that also drove the higher working capital.","And that is on the balance sheet that advanced payments declined by more than $200 million from year end, and as I mentioned earlier, that material rate decline resulted from the burn-down of international advances.","Also, you may recall that we had a very strong cash generation at the end of last year, some of which was a pull-forward of payments for aerospace programs that we would've expected in the first quarter of this year.","Free cash flow for the quarter was the use of $462 million, with capital spending in the quarter of $60 million, up from $40 million last year. We did continue to expect capital spending of approximately $600 million for the year, capital spending to support the establishment of our centers of excellence will be ramping up in the second quarter. And as many of you know, our capital spending is typically weighted towards the second half of the year, which will also be the case this year. As Wes indicated, we're comfortable with our 2014 cash outlook from cash from operations and free cash flow.","One final item before I turn the call over to Steve for questions and answers. And that at sometime later this year, the Society of Actuaries is expected to finalize new guidance for mortality assumptions. For national reporting purposes, these new assumptions are likely to be in effect at year-end 2014 for the measurement of our projected benefit obligations.","If that is the case, these new assumptions would then impact 2015 FAS pension expense. The mortality assumptions used in the trend in our future CAS expenses would also need to be revised. The new assumptions, when fully implemented, will likely result in increased liabilities, increased annual FAS and CAS pension expense and potentially, increased funding requirements depending upon the funding status of the affected plans.","This applies in all cases, holding all other assumptions constant, and with no change to applicable funding regulations. In our case, even if the new mortality assumptions were to be immediately required for funding purposes, year 2016, we would not expect a substantial increase in required plan contributions, given our plan's funded status, our prior contributions and, of course, holding all other assumptions constant.","So Steve, with that, I'd like to invite everybody [ph] for Q&A.","Paul Gregory","Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] Now with that, Glenn, we are ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's actually Amit Mehrotra here for Myles. Had a quick question on share repurchase. You're executing well to your plan to retiring 25% of the shares by the end of next year. But it'd be helpful to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about share repurchase beyond that. Should we expect a shift in strategy, maybe from cash allocation away from share repurchase more to M&A? Can you just offer some thoughts on that? And where does acquisitions also rank, when you look out beyond 2015 as well?","James F. Palmer","Somewhere in April of 2014, and our plan, as we have announced, really carries us through 2015, so I really wouldn't want to today speculate what might be going on in our environment and how we might be thinking about things at the end of 2015. All I would say is, if you kind of look back over the last number of years, and look at how we've been approaching cash deployment, our priorities remain the same. We like investing in our business. We want to make sure we're doing a good job of managing our balance sheet. And of course, we're wanting to make sure that we're doing a good job of returning cash to shareholders. So I would say we're a fairly predictable crowd in that regard.","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up with respect to the backlog. Could you just offer any color on where you see that shaping up by the end of the year, and maybe provide some of the major awards out there that we can expect in the coming quarters?","Wesley G. Bush","We don't guide on awards for the year. As I noted in my remarks, we clearly had a, I think, a respectable quarter in terms of awards. And as I think about the set of opportunities that are in front of us, predicting the exact timing quarter-to-quarter is always a little bit of a challenge, given how things are tending to move around a little bit with the RFP dates and the rest. But we see ourselves well positioned, as I said in my opening remarks, across each of our sectors for a number of important opportunities that are both the remainder of this year and in the next year. So many of those are competitive opportunities that I mentioned, but it's a -- also an important perspective to understand about our company, that much of our sales in year derive from our current backlog. In fact, we expect that about 80% of our revenues this year flow directly from our backlog in the company.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on some of the color you gave in the segments. In aerospace, where you cited lower unmanned, can you quantify how much of that came down? And can you paint when the total unmanned revenue contribution bottoms? I know some things are moving higher, some are moving lower. And then in IS, when you're citing in-theater reductions, can you quantify what that total contribution is to the segment at this point, and how it progresses from here?","James F. Palmer","Yes, no, Jim, obviously. As we said, IS sales, for example, were down roughly $100 million, the in-theater stuff is less than half of that. So again, in IS, you get --","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In terms of the change?","James F. Palmer","Pardon?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In terms of how much it changed?","James F. Palmer","Yes. And then in terms of unmanned, basically, unmanned is largely flattish on a year-over-year basis. Some small -- it's a little bit greater declines on, as I mentioned, the 2 programs, Global Hawk and Fire Scout, and then growth in NATO AGS and [indiscernible] down. It's phenomenal.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is the unmanned business growing, once you're out of 2014?","James F. Palmer","I believe so.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, I think if -- when, if you look back at the remarks I made about the set of opportunities that we have in front of us, clearly, getting Triton into production is the, I would say, the biggest lever, the biggest step, and we're going through the test program today, and that's doing well. But the international side of unmanned is also quite intriguing. I mentioned earlier about the step forward in Korea with the LOA, and the growing interest that we're seeing around the globe in our High Altitude Long Endurance programs, what we call our HALE programs, both Global Hawk and Triton-based platforms. So we see a lot of opportunity in unmanned in front of us.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And sorry, just so I'm clear on IS, with the in-theater revenue, what is the absolute dollar number, not the rate of change, but just how much it still is, on an absolute dollar basis?","James F. Palmer","Well, across the company, we're looking at about $800 million, as I recall. Steve, is that right? Yes.","Stephen C. Movius","It's a $300 million reduction.","Wesley G. Bush","$300 million over -- from last year.","James F. Palmer","Year-over-year, but $800 million for the year.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, across the company.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And how much of that is in IS?","James F. Palmer","2\/3, 3\/4, something like that.","Stephen C. Movius","The reduction is probably -- 40% is IS.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So I think you said, you expect your foreign business to go from roughly 10% to 13% of the total. I mean, it's a little tough to tell exactly what that is with rounding, but it looks like that implies a gain of about 25%. And you've mentioned several times the opportunity of HALE, F-35. Can you give us some color on where we should see that going next year? And where do you see this in like 3 to 4 years as a percent, maybe give a range?","James F. Palmer","Cai, it's always difficult to time the exact point when all these international opportunities occur. For me, what's positive is that increasing interest across a number of countries in our High Altitude Long Endurance platforms. So again, I'm not going to call to exactly when that will occur. Getting Korea done will be an important first step. I believe that is important not only because of the opportunity, but it serves to facilitate the next move behind it. So again, we're working very hard on Korea. We have a Letter of Offer and Acceptance, and the next step is to get that under contract. That's what our team is working on.","Wesley G. Bush","And Cai, I would just add, in addition obviously to kind of a newer story for us, in international being our unmanned opportunities, as well as potentially some manned opportunities of the platforms like E-2D, we continue to have a robust international business and set of opportunities through our Electronic Systems organization. And in fact, all 4 of our sectors are focused on a set of international opportunities. Jim's point about the predictability of timing, it is a very important one in the international business, but we are very focused on this, and are working it broadly across the entire enterprise today.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. And while I realize it's always difficult to pinpoint the timing, it certainly looks like F-35 clearly is going to be a plus there. HALE clearly will be a plus. If you look out 3 to 4 years, so that we're not timing it exactly, I mean, could this be 20% to 25% of your sales? Or any rough range you could give us?","Wesley G. Bush","It again is kind of hard to say, so much of what we do on export also depends on the nature of export control restrictions. And I'm delighted with what I see happening today with the administration working hard to move things ahead as extensive commitment in DoD to step out and help through our policy changes that will enable the U.S. to better support its allies around the globe. But there are a lot of factors in the mix here that make it difficult to put a number or even a range of numbers on at this point. But the vectors seem to be aligning in a very positive direction.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So a big picture question that kind of follows on the heels of the spirit of Cai's questions as well, in trying to get a sense of timing that, as you suggest, the exact timing is always difficult. But in looking at the fiscal '15 budget, the program decisions that were made within that, and putting OCO aside, and into your revenue streams that you've had, and then just looking at your base domestic business, do you have a sense of, the fiscal '15 budget's implemented, when you might see a trough for domestic revenue streams. But Cai's looking at the long-term trajectory of international, and I'm just kind of curious, given what you see in the fiscal '15 budget, when you think the domestic budget, the OCO aside, stabilize.","James F. Palmer","Yes, the way I would characterize that is, first and foremost, obviously, we're all delighted to be operating right now under a real appropriations. This is a big step forward from where we had been in terms of predictability and the ability to plan and with the Bipartisan Budget Act that came together at the end of last year, it does, and I think this was a part of your question as well, it does offer a better outlook in terms of predictability and stability for '15 as well. So yes, I think the real question is what happens after that? And there are a range of possibilities, and sequester budget is a real possibility. I think the President rightfully put forward to the Congress in the longer-term outlook, a very strong message about what's really needed to support the security of our nation. And the budget profile that came forward in the plan that the President submitted is above the sequester level. How all that will work out through the politics over the next couple of years, and I think it would be foolish to speculate on that at this point. I do think it's rational to expect that the U.S. budgets will eventually stabilize, and clearly, investments in security are going to need to start growing again. But at what rate and exactly when, I wouldn't want it to be in the spot of trying to predict that right now. So we'll have to stay tuned. I think there's a lot of work to be done to get the budgeting process in the right place to support national security as we work our way through '15 and really take on the challenges associated with that range of possibilities in '16 and beyond. And I know a lot of folks have tired on the discussion around the sequester. But I think we should all be realistic and understand that they're still an important set of policy decisions and budgetary decisions that are out there in front us that we're going to be taking on as we go through this year and next year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm interested in how 2 things might affect your F-35 margins, and the first one is volume. And as F-35 quantities are down in the President's budget, particularly for the C model, and then a sequestration in 2016 would lead to some further reductions, I'm interested in how, and knowing that you do have volume considerations in pricing, that could affect your margins? And then second, over the past year, the program office has made a point to try and look beneath the prime into costs in the subcontractor community. I'm just interested in the volume question, and then the change in the way the program office is looking at the program. Does this impact you at all, in terms of what your margin expectations are?","James F. Palmer","Doug, the volume's, is a very important contributor, probably the most important contributor to our ability to drive down the learning curve. So volume is really important. We've been coming down a very healthy learning curve already. But as you point out, volume is critically important to being able to continue driving down that learning curve.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, and let me maybe talk about the perspective on the program office side of it. I -- the way I would frame this is, Lockheed is, I think doing a very good job as the prime on this program. This is a team, and so we have a big part to play as other companies, in making the program successful. And so naturally, the program office is very interested in what the major teammates are doing and how that's going, so I don't see anything unnatural in the process that has been underway. I think it's sort of a natural step here, particularly as we are, together, very focused on, to Jim's point, how we deal with the volume challenges that are out there in the near term, and maintain an appropriate path forward on driving down the curve and driving the affordability that we know is so important for this program, both domestically and internationally. So I would characterize it more as the framework of the team environment that we need clearly with Lockheed on the front as the prime, and doing the things that are very, very appropriate for the prime to be doing. But I could see -- I continue to see a very good team environment on F-35, and I think that's part of what is contributing to enhancing the success of the program that we're having now. So I'm positive about the way we see F-35 operating today.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So given that performance improvements that you and others in the program have made, if you balance that off against some of these other pressures, such as volume, would you say, as you look forward, you're more or less optimistic on your ability to get a good margin progression going forward?","Wesley G. Bush","Well typically, as we move forward in a program and move into the production phases, that's where the industry has an expectation of making margin, is in production. We've all made substantial investments in this program, and continue to make investments in the program, and that is sort of a natural cycle. So I don't have any different expectations and what experience would tell us should be the outcome.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Aerospace Systems and you threw -- you put out the $48 million worth of adjustments. Can you just talk about, is there any particular program that's a bigger percentage of that? And what was, I guess, contemplated in the earlier guidance that might've just been later in the year versus something that was new performance?","James F. Palmer","You hit on an important point, and that is timing. Many times, our EAC adjustments are tied to specific events as they occur. We did have some of those events occur in the quarter that affected the timing of adjustments. As our guidance would indicate, the 13.4% for the quarter is not what we would expect aerospace to land for the full year. So there are clearly some of those items affecting the first quarter. As I said in my prepared comments, none of the adjustments on an individual contract basis were material. As I think that's a pretty good summary of what happened in the quarter, just a good, strong underlying operating performance and then some events that were tied to those timing aspects of the -- managing the programs.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and if I can follow up, something unrelated, is May, is typically when you look at some of your annual dividend, and I know that you typically have very payout-focused, but I'm just wondering, is there anything about the capital deployment strategy that would change the way you look at that and the type of decisions you might make?","Wesley G. Bush","Sam, it's Wes. You guessed May is typically when we look at that. That is a board level decision. I would not want to get out in front of that level of decision. I would simply say what I said earlier, our approach to capital deployment and priorities in capital deployment have not changed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","There's been some talk recently about the recent green book that came out, and what the DoD is projecting for outlays this year? I was wondering if you looked at this, and how it tally with your revenue forecast for the year, particularly on shorter cycle areas?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, Rob, we've of course, looked at it, and I will tell you, we did not see anything in the green book that altered our outlook for 2014. I think I mentioned earlier that over 80% of our 2014 revenues tend to flow from our backlog. And when you look at what's in the green book, clearly, there's a lot of work done to pull that together. The green book forecast really do not represent contractual ceilings and outlays, which are typically quite a bit lower than Budget Authority. The Budget Authority does represent kind of what the limit is, so you need to be looking at the BA aspects of things. So the short answer to your question of whether or not we saw anything in the green book that changed our outlook, the answer's no.","James F. Palmer","And obviously, the green book came out after we gave our forecast for the year, outlook for the year, and haven't changed our sales guidance.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just an unrelated follow-up, the acquisition you made in Australia this quarter, I was wondering if you can give us some of the background there of what this adds to the portfolio, and whether we can expect further bolt-ons going forward?","Wesley G. Bush","Rob, we look routinely across the board at opportunities such as this. We've not been a very major acquirer for quite a few years, and I think that reflects the discipline that we have in looking at potential opportunities. This was like a very nice fit, and I think it's going to be a very nice fit for us. It dovetails with the work that we're doing in our Technical Services organization, both domestically and internationally, Australia is a very important ally of the United States, clearly a very important market for Northrop Grumman. And so the fit, from a portfolio perspective and a geographic perspective and a market perspective, we found to be very attractive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm going to, kind of go in a different direction. I mean, there is an expression, Willie -- I think Willie Sutton, they said, wherever Willie Sutton was, he's going to rob a bank, or where the money is, he'll go rob the bank, and your guys are banging your head to some degree against the wall with some of the difficulties that exist either in foreign sales or in DoD, and not to say that's not your expertise, but then there's these guys in Silicon Valley that are trying to spend billions of dollars solving problems that you've solved many times over, Wes. And so why aren't you approaching some of those companies, or doing something to take advantage of all that money that's sloshing around, solving problems you've addressed before?","Wesley G. Bush","Howard, I do appreciate your question, because it's a good, kind of a sanity check sometimes to look at all the things going on in the world around us and try and test what makes sense. One of the things that I think we've learned, I would say in our company, and I think generally across our industry is that, we are quite good at what we're good at, and we tend to want to stay focused on that. And periodically, we do look at what other companies are doing and market access that they may provide to see if there are reasonable partnership opportunities and we explore those from time to time. We've had, I would say, across our industry, some notable successes in that regard, as well as some abysmal failures in that regard. So I think it's just prudent to be very careful and thoughtful about how you go about doing those things. But we are a very technologically oriented enterprise. I have mentioned a number of times, our -- of our 65,000 employees, more than 30,000 are degreed scientists, engineers, mathematicians. This is a very, very capable enterprise when it comes to advancing the state-of-the-art on technology. And we have both an interest in partnering where we see that it makes sense. But also, we have, and we take this very, very seriously, an obligation to our customer community to very carefully protect the technologies that are utilized from a national security perspective. And so we're careful and diligent about balancing that out.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So should I take that to mean that some of these things that are percolating in the commercial -- I mean, I get it, how should I say it? It's hard to sell into a market that's got different requirements than what you're selling into now. And it's your point on testing your comfort zone, though these rewards might be fairly lucrative and they change the valuation of the enterprise. And they -- I mean, as you know when you were TRW, periodically, there were great successes, but also there was --","Wesley G. Bush","There were.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","There were also some \"oops.\"","Wesley G. Bush","And I think we've all learned from both of those sides of the experience curve, and recognize that there are value-creating opportunities periodically. You simply need to select your partners carefully. You need to have a very clear view of what the real channels to market are, and you need to be ready and willing to turn things off if it's not panning out. And that guides a lot of our thinking, and how we approach these things.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So I'm just trying to draw you into an answer that is that some of these things have some appeal, or we tested them and no, thank you very much, we're very comfortable in our space?","Wesley G. Bush","I would say that part of being a good partner is to protect the privacy of your partnerships. And so we're very careful about anything that we would say about that too broadly. But the one thing that we do say, when we get out on campus to young folks that are thinking about their options, and there's an incredible competition for talent in the technical space these days, if you really want to work at leading edge technology and advance it, our industry is the place to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So Wes, I have a question for you that's been kind of brewing for -- since the last quarterly call, which is on your CapEx plans, because you guys have been pretty tight-fisted, I think in a good way, in terms of your spending in all kinds of ways, including CapEx, the last couple of years. You've talked about aerospace centers of excellence as really kind of the key driver of the plane going forward. And I wondering if you could maybe take a couple minutes and give a little bit more on what you're doing and why you're doing it. Is it about more of a productivity or business capture? Is it programs that you already have, or ones that you're chasing, just a little more on the investment?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, Joe. I appreciate the question. Aerospace Systems is certainly a big part of our enterprise. And as you've heard us talk today about the set of opportunities that we see in the future, from our perspective, that set of opportunities is adequately robust to merit investment, to make sure that we're doing the right things to be able to pursue those opportunities, as well as to execute on those that we've already captured. If you turn the clock back quite a few years ago, we are a company, like many in our industry, built through acquisition, and that had not necessarily resulted in the most efficient structure and architecture for how to get things done. So as we have worked hard to clarify our strategy, to make decisions in our company about what markets spaces we're really going to pursue and invest in, versus those that we are not, it's become clear, had become clear over the last couple of years that we needed to re-architect our footprint to better align with that strategy. And the benefits that we see from these centers of excellence are really severalfold, and I think you touched on them in your question. One is, our ability to better align the human capital that makes these things work, into centers of excellence where the people who are working on similar things are more closely co-located, and we can better share the knowledge as well as to create new opportunities by having individuals more closely working together on a day-to-day basis. Secondly, the efficiency of the facility infrastructure itself has the opportunity to be dramatically enhanced with the investments that we're making. And so we see that as very, very meaningful and important, from a competitiveness standpoint, as we take on some of these new opportunities over the next few years. And the third point that I would make as well, is by having these teams working together and really creating centers of excellence, we find that to be an attribute in recruiting, and recruiting is an important part of our company, and I know sometimes it's a little bit of an odd message for folks that -- who we think about our industry right now as perhaps shedding jobs and reducing footprint. But even though we're down about 20% in headcount from our peak, we hired about 5,000 people last year, and we're going to do about the same this year. So recruiting is a big part of our thought process as we think about how we architect our infrastructure and our capabilities to enable us to continue to support technological superiority and deliver capabilities for our customers. So it's a sort of a multidimensional answer to your question, but the -- all the rationale pointed in the same direction that now is the time to take the step and invest in our own future.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","As we look at your financials the next 2 or 3 years, where are we going to see this first? I guess that's -- is it moving work and more increased efficiency and productivity and higher margins? Or is it an uptick sale somewhere, where maybe we're not expecting it?","James F. Palmer","Joe, I would say it's going to be a combination of improved efficiency to sustain margins, and the potential for higher sales as the new program opportunities materialize.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I just had one quick one for you Jim, also, the EPS guidance went up. It may be up a little less than one might think, since you raised your margin guidance and also had the tax benefit that wasn't fully incorporated. Were there any offsets, or is this just a Q1 conservatism?","James F. Palmer","No, actually, the guidance raise essentially is about half tax rate and half guidance. When I looked at our raise in guidance, in terms of segment operating margin rates, roughly 10 basis points or so, that's about $0.07 to $0.08, $0.09, dependent from up where you are, and the tax rate is about another similar amount. So essentially, that's the adjustment to guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of different questions here. Just first, Jim, a clarification, because it didn't get caught in the transcript here. On the mortality comment you made earlier in your opening remarks, did you say there was no impact or did you not quantify it? I can't quite tell.","James F. Palmer","Well, what I said is this mortality discussion has been ongoing for a while. We do expect that we should see some updates to mortality assumptions later this year. If that occurs, it will be in effect for year-end measurement of projected benefit obligations, which then affect 2015 expense.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, yes, next year.","James F. Palmer","You can guess a range of what that may mean, because obviously all of us are trying to understand what will be the updates to mortality assumptions, whether or not or how directly they apply to our circumstances. So frankly we're going to have to have a little bit more information and a little bit more time to study what it means.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, I think the expectation and maybe incorrect, was that given that one of your peers actually threw a number out there, which was probably subject to change once things are finalized, you're just not in a position to that.","James F. Palmer","Well I think we can all speculate on what it may mean. But I think as I said, I think that it's, in all confidence, I can say that over the long term, projected benefit obligations will increase, that FAS and CAS expense will likely increase. And dependent upon the funding status of your plans, funding may be impacted as well. The exact timing, exact timing and in exact amounts at this point, are a little bit of an unknown.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Unknown, okay. Two more. This one, Wes, is for you, and it's a little bit of a budget discussion again and on M&A, but you talked about the differences in fidelity, perhaps, between Budget Authority and outlays. And given that sequestered budget authority in '16 would seem to be about flattish with Ryan Murray, Budget Authority for '15, is it fair to say that on the domestic business, you have really reached a trough, or you can at least see it, and what should that invite perhaps earlier M&A activity now that visibility's improved a bit?","Wesley G. Bush","I would continue to say that visibility has improved for '14 and '15, projecting the political dynamics between now and the appropriation cycle in '16. It's not something I would want to be speculating on. And if you just turn the clock back, that amount of time, instead of looking forward, turn it back that amount of time backwards, and try and predict exactly where we would have been today, given where we stood then, you would have been wrong. So I think we're going to have to see how this plays out. And I am concerned about it, as I said in my earlier remarks, and as I know our customers are concerned about it. Anytime we're in a place where the President, despite all of the challenge that we all recognize, we're facing from a total budgetary authority perspective, the President, in putting forward a budget, has to be as clear as I think the clarity was provided in this round that the current budget at sequester level just doesn't do it for national security. But you have to see the pushback that initially came off of the Hill on that, to me is a very strong signal that we've got a lot of political dynamics still in front of us. Where it actually lands, we're going to have to see.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So is this to some extent because of your exposure to the programs they've already talked about, if sequester comes through in '16?","Wesley G. Bush","It's not. My commentary is not so much about our particular company's situation on this. I'm speaking more broadly about the investment accounts and the O&M accounts that our industry relies on, and as a source of domestic revenue, and related to that obviously, what it means for core structure and the rest of it. So those are all things that are bound up together, the set of decisions that translate from the total budget levels into what actually gets invested in equipment, in maintenance and the rest of it. There's a lot that goes on in the world between now and 2016.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly on margins, and this is really for either of you. But you've done a great job, and many in the space have, in terms of getting ahead of revenue declines with your costs. And certainly, I think this translates well in the short-cycle contracts. On the long-cycle side, where would we be, in terms of repricing to the new cost structure, in terms of how much turnover have you seen where you've already re-upped the contracts or signed new contracts that have pricing that reflects your new cost structure, and how much is left to do?","James F. Palmer","Rob, you can pretty simply do the math, frankly. If you look at the run rate of revenues in each of the sectors versus the backlog, and that kind of tells you how much of...","Wesley G. Bush","Term.","James F. Palmer","Yes, the term is. Obviously, aerospace is a little bit longer than the others, and IS is a little -- it is shorter than the long-cycle business. It essentially goes with the comments that we've been making all along about the longer-cycle businesses and the shorter-cycle businesses.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, but then there's the other, the contract nuance that's not easily detected from outside.","James F. Palmer","I was just going to say that, that is the nature of this business, is continually repricing contracts every year when new contracts come up, and continuing to manage cost on a, day in, day out basis. That is the business.","Wesley G. Bush","The thing, too, I would add is, be careful about a static kind of approach to thinking about the cost equation. Yes, we and others in our industry have made some good progress on managing cost and doing what I would describe as sort of a tough blocking and tackling approach on headcount and infrastructure and that sort of thing. No one should assume that the game is up on cost management. That's a constant focus, certainly in our company and I think even more broadly than our company. And as we look at all of the levers involved in that, whether it's technology or architecture or the other elements of affordability, and we all have to continue to be on the cost agenda, if you will. So it is not sort of a static model where you can say, okay, we've taken cost out now, all go-forward contracts no longer get any benefit of future cost reduction. If that were be the model, we'd be in trouble.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on 2 topics from earlier in the call. First, on international sales and the growth opportunity there. I was hoping that you could just elaborate on how to map that to some of the segments, to the extent that Aerospace and Electronic Systems maybe have greater exposure to it than some of the other segments? And the second topic, just to follow up on the last question that was asked. I'm curious, with the improvements in cost and productivity, and you've certainly been differentiated in that right as well as the well-positioned pension, have you found that to actually lead to any competitive wins? Or an ability to kind of position yourself as a lower cost provider and turn it into maybe a little bit of a better revenue trend?","Wesley G. Bush","So on international, the breakout that I would see, if you're trying to map it to sectors, clearly, Electronics has our biggest footprint internationally, has done so for many years, run, sort of in place on the range, 20%, 25% of its sales, as international, and sees continued, very meaningful opportunities around the globe, ranging from upgrades to radar systems to new sensor suites to both the airborne side, the ground-based side. And it is, I think, a very well-positioned and robust international business for our company. Aerospace Systems is a little bit more, if you will, of a new story. It's largely associated with the unmanned system capability, and as well as, I mentioned earlier, we do see some manned potential around the globe, in terms of our E-2D platform and potentially some others. So it is more of an emerging international business, has some footprint today in that regard that is I think rapidly growing. With respect to Information Systems, clearly, the awareness and understanding of the importance of Cybersecurity is growing around the globe, and we have a very important and well-established position here in the U.S. and we are exploring the options for continuing to grow that. IS has, for some time, participated, I would say, at a smaller level, but in a growing way, in the C4ISR domain for some international business. So those are really the pieces. Tech services, by the way, as well, does a fair amount of training and maintenance support around the globe, too. So those are good opportunities for us that I think we're going to just continue to push on and see the opportunity expand. Now with respect to your final question on cost, clearly, yes. And it's important that we continue to work on the cost structure. I would put it in the inverse manner, that if we weren't doing it, I'm sure we would be losing. So hard to attach individual wins to a particular cost structure but we know it's vital to the competitiveness of our business.","Stephen C. Movius","Glenn, I think we're out of time. So at this point in time, I'd like to turn the session over to Wes for final comments.","Wesley G. Bush","Okay thanks, Steve. As he said at the start the call, the first quarter really is a good start to the year to us, and I am just delighted that we were able to raise our EPS guidance, based on the performance that we've seen in the first quarter. So thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today, and thank you for your continuing interest in our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley Bush ","Well, thanks, Steve. Hello everyone, and thanks for joining us. I want to start today by congratulating the entire Northrop Grumman team on 2016\u2019s achievements. We again demonstrated strong performance across the company and continued to create value for our shareholders, customers and for our employees. It was an outstanding year for Northrop Grumman. ","As we strengthen the foundation for long-term profitable growth, it\u2019s really encouraging to see that our team remains focused on sustainable performance. In 2016, all three of our sectors posted higher sales while growing or maintaining strong operating income, and generating solid cash flow.","2016 sales rose 4% and we achieved a strong 12% segment operating margin rate and 13% total operating margin rate. ","Earnings per share for the year increased 17%, to $12.19 driven by both performance and a lower average share count. Cash generation was also strong. Cash from operations totaled $2.8 billion and after investing in our businesses, free cash flow was approximately $1.9 billion. ","During the year, we returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This includes repurchasing 7.3 million shares for $1.5 billion which help reduce our weighted average diluted share count by approximately 6%. ","At year end, $2.7 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. We increased our dividend by 12.5%, our 13th consecutive increase and we paid $640 million in dividends to our shareholders and our total shareholder return for 2016 was more than 25%. ","Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in the business, managing the balance sheet, and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Investing in the business is our first priority. 2016 investments included capital expenditures of $920 million. ","Our capital spending reflects increased programmatic requirements and supports our continued focus on cost reduction, affordability and investments to support our long-term growth strategy. We also continued to focus on research and development with over $700 million of internal R&D in 2016, in addition to the R&D investments made by our customers. We are confident these investments help position us to continue creating value for our shareholders and for our customers. ","We expect our higher levels of capital investment to continue for a couple more years as we expand our workforce, ramp up on large new programs, complete expenditures related to our centers of excellence, and pursue attractive new business opportunities. We also expect strong cash generation to support our capital deployment strategy. We continue to focus on managing the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. ","During the fourth quarter, we took advantage of favorable interest rates and issued $750 million of new low cost debt, a portion of which was use to retire high coupon debt. The remaining $550 million reduces interest rate refinancing risk on future maturities and it provides ongoing balance sheet flexibility.","While investing for profitable growth is our highest priority for capital deployment, we also intend to continue repurchasing our shares and paying a competitive dividend. ","Looking ahead, we began 2017 well positioned to grow sales and generate strong cash flows. Year-end total backlog was $45.3 billion, 26% higher than last year. Strong book-to-bill performance at aerospace systems and mission systems drove that increase. We had several large restricted awards along with awards for F35, Triton, and the UK AWACS program, all of which supported our 2016 backlog growth.","We continued to have a rich opportunity set. We were one of four companies awarded a concept development contract for the MQ-25A Stingray unmanned aerial refueling vehicle. Our work on UCAAS provides a strong foundation to compete for this carrier-based program. The RFP for the Joint STARS recapitalization program was released before the end of last year. ","We were teamed with GD and L3 to develop an offering that replaces our E-8 Joint STARS with a militarized, business-class aircraft. During the Pre-EMD Phase, we\u2019ve successfully completed the program design review and had two successful demonstrations. The Milestone B Decision is expected in late fiscal year 2017. ","We believe we are well qualified to efficiently transition the current capability with minimal impacts to operations given our expertise and battle management command and control and ISR and our experience with legacy platforms such as the E-8 Joint STARS and the E-2 Hawkeye. ","I would also note that Mission Systems is competing for the radar component of the Joint STARS recapitalization. The T-X RFP was also released at the end of December, so we now have the final terms of that solicitation to evaluate. We are presently assessing the terms presented by that RFP to determine whether we see an appropriate business opportunity for us to submit a bid. ","We are excited about the growing list of domestic and international opportunities across our businesses. This includes the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, Triton for Australia, SABR Radar for the US Air Force and several international customers, significant restricted opportunities, and additional international programs being pursued by mission systems and Technology Services in Australia and in the Middle East. ","And while we are pleased to see growing support for long needed increases in defense spending, we also recognize and support our customers\u2019 need to reduce cost and get the most value for every taxpayer dollar spent.","We\u2019ve made substantial internal investments to drive affordability and support our growing workforce. We believe the best approach to achieving affordability is innovation during the design phase to create inherently more affordable systems, combined with a constant focus to drive down the cost of doing business on both the industry and government efforts associated with defense programs.","Our 2017 guidance calls for another year of strong operating performance, as our contract mix continues to shift to a greater percentage of development works. We\u2019ve said for some time that we would welcome this increase in development works, as it provides the foundation for profitable growth and expanding operating income and margin rates over the long-term as development transitions to production.","For 2017, we expect sales of approximately $25 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $11.30 to $11.60 and free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion after capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. ","In summary, 2016 was an outstanding year for the company and for our shareholders. Going forward, our priorities remain the same; drive strong, sustainable performance, generate strong cash flow and effectively deploy that cash. And we will continue to optimize our portfolio to ensure our lines of global security priorities. We are committed to build on our solid track record and we look forward to continued value creation for our shareholders, customers and our employees. ","So, now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?","Kenneth Bedingfield","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll add my thanks to our team for their outstanding efforts this year. Today I\u2019ll provide a little more detail on our 2016 results, and our 2017 outlook. We are very pleased with our 2016 sales of $24.5 billion and our strong operating income and cash generation driven by all three sectors. ","Turning to the sectors, Aerospace System sales were up 20% for the quarter and 9% for the year. Manned Aircraft was the primary driver of sales growth as we ramped up on restricted work as well as higher volume on the E-2D and F-35 programs.","Aerospace Systems\u2019 2016 operating margin rate was 11.4%. This reflected 40 basis points for a gain from the sale of a property in the fourth quarter, which we had contemplated in our guidance. ","For 2017, we expect AS revenue in the low to mid-$11 billion, due to growth on restricted programs and Triton, which together more than offset declines in non-restricted space and the NATO AGS program. We expect F-35 volume will be comparable to 2016. Just a reminder that the F-35 will continue to be on units-of-delivery accounting in 2017 before adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018.","We expect the AS operating margin rate to be approximately 11% driven by the changing contract mix to more development contracts. 2017 AS margin rate guidance also reflects a B-21 booking rate approach that we believe is appropriate for the early stages of this incentive-based development contract.","As a reminder, we will review our booking rate overtime as we work to retire risk and realize incentive fee milestones. In 2017, cost-type development work is growing at a faster rate than higher margin production work. This growing mix differential will persist until the F-35 and other production programs including international ramp up in 2018.","Moving to Mission Systems, sales rose 9% in the quarter, and 2% for the year. 2016 operating margin rate was unchanged from the prior year at 13.2%. For 2017, we expect MS revenue in the low $11 billion range with a mid to high 12% operating margin rate.","Primary revenue growth drivers include continued ramp up on F-35, partially offset by a decline on EA-18G.","Looking at technology services 2016 sales were comparable to the prior year at $4.8 billion. 2016 operating margin rate of 10.6% was also comparable to the prior year. For 2017, we expect Technology Services sales will be in the mid-$4 billion range, with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Lower revenue in 2017 is largely due to an expected decline of approximately $250 million on the KC-10 program. ","As we roll all that up, we expect 2017 segment operating margin rate in the mid-11% range, reflecting, as I\u2019ve mentioned previously, our portfolio of changing mix with more development work. We expect our total operating margin rate will be in the mid-12% range. That's after unallocated corporate expense of about $200 million and net t FAS\/CAS pension adjustment of $475 million.","Moving on to pension, 2017 net t FAS\/CAS adjustment is based on a 4.19% discount rate, 8% long-term rate of return on plan assets and 2016 net plan asset returns of about 7.7% after expenses including PBGC premiums. The 34% decline in our discount rate reflects the higher yield on treasuries at year end.","However, this was more than offset by the credit spread contraction between treasuries and corporate. 2016 FAS is estimated at $485 million and CAS at $960 million. Keep in mind that estimated CAS won't be finalized until the completion of our annual demographic study in the third quarter. ","Let me just go back there. On the decline, the basis point, it was a 34 basis point decline in our discount rate. I apologize, as I said percent, 34 basis points. For 2018, and 2019, we currently expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion. For 2018 and 2019 FAS, we currently expect $400 million and $350 million respectively. ","And for your modeling purposes, holding all other assumptions constant, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate changes FAS expense by approximately $70 million and a 100 basis point change in plan asset returns versus our expected 8% changes FAS expense by approximately $50 million. CAS is significantly less sensitive to changes in discount rate and plan asset returns. ","In aggregate, on a GAAP basis, the year-end funded status of our plans were slightly below last year at 80%. Our funded status reflects the impact of discount rate assumptions, a discretionary pension contribution in 2015 and actual plan asset returns. Our qualified plans also remain well funded at 84%. Our required contributions remain minimal for the next few years, less than $100 million in 2017 and 2018 and increasing to about $400 million in 2019, again, based on our current assumptions.","Beyond 2019, we continue to expect required funding will be lower than CAS recoveries. Turning to tax. We expect the tax rate of approximately 29.5% in 2017. Our guidance includes an estimated first quarter tax benefit for ASU 2006-09, the accounting change for excess tax benefits on employee share-based payments.","Our 2017 earnings per share guidance of $11.30 to $11.60 assumes weighted average diluted shares of approximately 175 million, a share count reduction of about 3%. Just a few comments on our cash results and our expectations for 2017. With nearly $1.9 billion in free cash flow, we delivered strong cash results in 2016 while investing for the future with $920 million in CapEx and we expect 2017 free cash flow will range between $1.8 billion to $2 billion.","We also expect our cash generation will be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year as is our typical pattern. Also during the fourth quarter, we did repatriate about $472 million from certain foreign subsidiaries. So now we have more flexibility in using that cash. We ended the year with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, nearly all of it in the US. ","Year-end cash balance includes $550 million remaining from the November debt offering of $750 million, 3.2% ten year notes after the redemption of the high coupon debt.","So, in summary, we had an outstanding year and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team in 2017. Steve, I think we are ready for Q&A.","Stephen Movius","Thanks, Ken. As we open the line for Q&A, I would like each participant to limit themselves to a single one part question, so we can hopefully get everybody who wants to have a question to ask it. Robin? ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland ","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Wesley Bush ","Hi, Carter.","Kenneth Bedingfield","Hey Carter.","Carter Copeland ","Just a question on the Aerospace growth in the quarter, just to clarify the disclosure, were the increases in manned E-2 and F-35 contributors in that order, and if we were to think about the lead times you've referenced before on the F-35 relative to Lockheed, they are talking about a 40% increase in deliveries next year. ","Is that the kind of order of magnitude of increase you saw in the quarter on that program? Just trying to figure out, it's a lot of revenue delta, almost $500 million in the quarter. How should we think about that splitting between those pieces? Thank you.","Kenneth Bedingfield","Sure Carter. I\u2019ll just comment, I guess that, in terms of the magnitude of revenue growth in the fourth quarter at AS restricted was clearly the largest driver of the growth and with the E2 and F-35 following at from a military aircraft perspective and certainly nice contribution from autonomous systems with Triton and Global Hawk as well.","Specifically, on F-35, I would say that, I\u2019ll just remind you that our accounting model is different from Lockheed. So I would not necessarily look at their change and project it to what you see for us. We are looking at from an AS perspective as well as MS remaining on a unit-of-delivery basis for one more year. ","We are working our way through for the most part production on lots that were relatively consistent in terms of number of units and the units-of-delivery increase as we see increases in the quantities for 9 and 10 and going forward will, would on a units-of-delivery basis flow through in 2018 although by that point will be on to the new rev rec standard, we'll be on to cost-to-cost of Lockheed and I think that\u2019s when you\u2019ll really see us start to ramp from an F-35 perspective.","Carter Copeland ","Yes. I am really just looking at the units that they are calling out. They had said 66 deliveries versus 46 or 47, I think. So, if you are on units-of-delivery that would imply that the F-35, given the lead times you've previously referenced would have been greater than the growth rate you saw in the segment. I was just trying to clarify if that still made sense from a units-of-delivery standpoint.","Kenneth Bedingfield","Yes, just keep in mind; our units are when we deliver it to them versus their units when they deliver it to the air force. So we are well ahead of them in terms of the units-of-delivery. I don\u2019t have the exact numbers in front of me in terms of what units were delivered this year versus last year. ","There was a slight uptick, but I\u2019ll remind you that we\u2019ve been driving the price down as well as we\u2019ve been moving through lot-by-lot negotiations. Certainly happy to have you follow up with Steve on any more details. ","Carter Copeland ","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. ","Peter Arment ","Yes, good afternoon, Wes, Ken, Steve. ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Hey.","Peter Arment ","Wes, I guess, my question is really around, I guess, the budgets and kind of overall. Lot of focus on the readiness of the new administration, but a lot of people don't always tag Northrop Grumman as kind of being the readiness play. Just maybe give your high level thoughts on just if there is any impact to you or how you are viewing that.","Wesley Bush ","So, just in terms of the broader budget view, clearly readiness is a heck of a problem right now. The silliness of the sequester, the Budget Control Act, however you want to reference it has gone on way too long and with this, it clearly needs to get fixed. It\u2019s impacting both readiness and the ability of the nation to recapitalize our military force structure. And to answer your question correctly, we do benefit from the budgets on readiness while that may not be the way lot of folks think about us. ","We do a lot of that type of work across the company and so, we are supporting our customers in a very broad way on the readiness side. But I think it\u2019s important to continue to emphasize the need to deal both with the readiness side and with the recapitalization side. We have such an aging infrastructure from a national security perspective that we have to get on with it. ","And I am just delighted to see with the new administration and in particular General Mattis, and others who are taking a strong lead and communicating the imperatives from a national security perspective are strong support for getting this done as well as the support that we are seeing forward on the hill. ","Wesley Bush ","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman ","Thanks very much and good morning everyone.","Wesley Bush ","Hi, Seth.","Seth Seifman ","Hi. Ken, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about some of the margin drivers in the guidance? I guess if you look at Aerospace and you highlighted some of the mix headwinds there, but, if you take out the gain that you had in the fourth quarter, it looks like you could be keeping Aerospace margins fairly flat next year and you guys actually usually have a little room for upside. ","And so, potentially, even a bit higher with those headwinds. Whereas in Technology Services, I would have thought maybe with exiting a lower margin contract maybe some opportunity to stay flatter or be up and then it looks like Mission Systems is where there actually is a little bit of headwind on an underlying basis. So, maybe if you could just talk qualitatively about those? ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Sure. Maybe I'll take your question, Seth, sector-by-sector and I'll just start at AS. And from a margin perspective, I really think that as we look at AS, the item that's impacting our margin guidance for 2017 really is about the additional development work that we are taking on. It's really about the changing mix that we are seeing. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect that that will have an impact on AS until some of the more mature production programs start to ramp and we expect that \u2013 we expect to see that in 2018 and beyond. ","If you want to think of F-35 and then including international F-35 opportunity and other international opportunities including Global Hawk and other autonomous systems. So AS, I would really characterize as being, again, driven by the mix change with the additional development content. ","From an MS perspective, I think we've seen strong performance out of that team. I think we're guiding a strong margin rate for MS for 2017. They've also got some mix changes. We've been seeing an additional volume out of their restricted space business in particular. So that will have some impact on MS. But we have seen strong performance out of that sector in 2016. ","And then from a TS perspective, we do see that TS will have some lower volume out of the KC10 program, which was not a great margin contributor for us. But we are working with TS in terms of reshaping that portfolio a bit and getting it where we want it to be from a 2017 and beyond perspective. ","We see that having a little bit of impact on margins in 2017, but we look to work with that sector for continued strong performance and I'll say industry-leading performance from that business against its peers. ","Wesley Bush ","And Seth, it's Wes. I would just add, Ken did a great job of walking you through kind of the puts and takes in the individual sectors. Just from a broad view, just as we do each year at the beginning of the year, we think hard about the balance of risk and opportunities and the challenge to our team is to manage those risks down and to realize the opportunities. ","We'll see how we do as we get into this year. I've been pleased with the approach that our team has used over the last number of years to effectively drive on that balance of risk and opportunities. So it's kind of where we are again this year. ","Seth Seifman ","Great. Thank you very much. ","Wesley Bush ","Thank you, Seth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. ","Noah Poponak ","Hey, good afternoon everyone. ","Wesley Bush ","Hi, Noah. ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Hey, Noah. ","Noah Poponak ","So, I guess, my question is, how does a relatively large defense contractor grow revenue 12% organically in a quarter where total DoD investment is flat to slightly down? And then how does that same company that's exiting at a year at 12 step down to 2 when it's a pretty long cycle business a and the comparisons are reasonable in that next year? ","Wesley Bush ","Noah, I think as you know it all comes down to programattics and our business in a very real sense is, when we're talking about top line, I think is pest viewed through that lens. It's programattics and its portfolio. And if you look at the combination of AS and MS, together those two sectors are enjoying nice growth and I think we'll continue to he see that as we get into the course of this year. ","As we talked about last year on a couple of our calls, we are going through a rebalancing of the portfolio in Technology Services. And that rebalancing put some downward pressure on their growth for this year and you have to put that in the overall math of the whole company. So that's really the flavor I would give in that \u2013 from the perspective of the top-line is that it's the way the parts come together against the programattics and the portfolio work that we're doing. ","And again, all of that is aligned around the idea of ensuring that we've got the right portfolio for the longer term that we are going to be best matched into the needs of our customers. So we think we've got that calibrated about right, about where we want it to be. ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Wes, I\u2019ll just add that, if you look quarter-over-quarter, Q4 of 2016-to-Q4 of 2015, you will see a 12% increase, but I would just caution you and remind you that fourth quarter of 2015 was our low point in terms of quarterly sales last year and given that we are a long cycle business, I would just think about it with a little more of a longer-term view in terms of where we've been and where we are going and certainly reflecting Wes' comments as we look forward. ","Noah Poponak ","Yes, now, that makes sense and is helpful. The TS headwinds make sense, I was just - the segment is about half the size of the other two and even if I go to the mid-4s you are pointing to, it looks like the average of even AS and MS isn't far from the implied growth rate of the total. But that's okay. Can you remind us the - or can you size the headwind from the KC loss that you referred to in TS? ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Yes, I think the rough order of magnitude we see that as being about a $250 million revenue headwind for 2017. ","Noah Poponak ","Okay. Great. Thank you. ","Wesley Bush ","Thanks, Noah. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. ","Myles Walton ","Thanks. Good afternoon. ","Wesley Bush ","Good afternoon, Myles. ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Hey, Myles.","Myles Walton ","Wes, your opening remarks, you commented on some of the opportunities that were in the trade space. ","Wesley Bush ","Yes.","Myles Walton ","One of which was T-X obviously. The final RFP come out it sounded like you reviewing it as if you hadn't determined that it was a good business to be bidding into and yet you've obviously clean sheeted your own design. You\u2019ve spent your hard earned cash and effort to develop these prototypes. What is it that's holding you back from thinking you definitely would bid it? ","Wesley Bush ","So Myles, let me be clear. We have not reached a conclusion on that. My statements were more a reflection of the discipline that we have in our company of really looking at each of these opportunities through the cold, hard lens of what's the RFP really tell you and what will the business case looks like. ","While it's interesting that we have made some investments along the lines of supporting this program. Investments which by the way tend to have broader applicability. We need to be thoughtful as we are on every single one of these RFP activities. We need to be very thoughtful about, okay, what's it mean going forward. And that's really the business case we look at. And you've seen us make a variety of decisions over the years. ","Once we see the actual terms and it\u2019s that discipline that I think keeps us in the right place. So that we don't walk ourselves into a decision to do something just because we've being doing it. They all have to be good business opportunities for us. So my remarks were intended to simply reflect that that's where we are in that process having just recently we gotten the final terms of the RFP. ","Myles Walton ","But there was no change in the final versus the prior to in terms of your thinking, this is just the due course of evaluating if it was a good business or not. ","Wesley Bush ","That's our process. ","Myles Walton ","Okay. Thanks. ","Wesley Bush ","Thank you, Myles. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Finbar Sheehy from Bernstein Research. ","Finbar Sheehy ","Good morning. ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Good morning. Hey, Finbar. ","Finbar Sheehy ","I wonder if you could take us back to TS for a moment. I know you've talked about restructuring that portfolio and even before that the revenues have been down in the last three years, backlog has been declining, margins have been doing pretty well. ","Are you at a point where you have a sense for what the bottom in revenues is the base from what you are going to be rebuilding after restructuring and when that might happen? And what the starting point for margins would be? And then as you grow it, do you expect to be able to grow margins at the same time? Or would the growth be at lower margin business in the first or in the sense of just because they are starting as new activities? ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Sure, sure. Appreciate the question and let me just maybe clarify. I hate to think of what we are working on from a portfolio perspective at TS with the word restructuring. So, I would say more so about aligning the portfolio with where we see our capabilities and the customer needs. As I think about TS, the revenue has been declining. Yes, I would agree with that. But it's been in a declining budgetary environment. ","We see it continue to decline in 2017 as contemplated in our guidance. But largely driven by again the activities realigning the portfolio, as well as the impact of the KC10 revenues coming out. But also the impact of some decisions that we have made about not pursuing some business that's lower margin and not differentiated. And I think you are seeing that through the higher margin rate that that business delivers as compared to its peers. ","My thought on the portfolio realignment is we get that through the system largely in 2017 and my expectation is that 2017 \u2013 and I am not going to provide sales guidance beyond then, but 2017 would likely be where we'd see the impact of restructuring and we ought to see a different trajectory as we move forward from there. ","Stephen Movius","We are ready for the next question, Robin. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. ","Sam Pearlstein","Good afternoon. ","Wesley Bush ","Good afternoon, Sam. ","Sam Pearlstein","Just thinking back to the AS margin, I know there was the gain this quarter, but just thinking about a little bit of a decline in 2017. I am just trying to think about as some of that restricted work continues beyond 2017, you mentioned some of the ramp up of the other programs, but F35 converts over to the percentage of completion. So I am just trying to think about the trajectory of AS margins, do you see that staying flat? Going down, going up beyond 2017? ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Sam, I wouldn't want to provide any guidance beyond 2017. What I would probably reference you to is, if you think about the comments we made in our prepared remarks, again, we see that our 2017 margin rate is largely impacted by the mix with that mix being more heavily weighted to development. ","And I think to Wes' point, we look forward to some of that development work transitioning into production and starting to generate the additional margins and additional operating income out of those. But I couldn't comment for you on any specifics on numbers beyond 2017. ","Wesley Bush ","And Sam, let me just add, it's Wes, let me just add. One of the things that I wanted to be clear about in my introductory remarks is, we see quite a nice array of new opportunities in front us and we are pursuing quite a few of those. We are making a lot of decisions in the company around how we pursue those and which ones we are pursuing. Nevertheless, our hope is that we are going to be successful on a number of them. ","And in doing so, we'd be bringing some more development content in. So, this question of mix over time is one that is somewhat dependent on our success and what we capture and when we capture it. And as I've said a number of times, I'll be delighted to be successful with good business cases, capturing a little bit more development mix in this period of time when our nation is working to get the recapitalization initiatives under way. ","And if that means I've got a little bit more pressure on margin rate for some period of time, I think that's the right thing to do for the long-term of the enterprise. And that's how we are thinking about this decision space in front of us. ","So, as Ken said, we aren't providing some guidance out into 2018 in part because, we'll have to see where we are successful on some of these new development initiatives and also the rate at which our customers are able to support financially the ramp-ups on production. So those are sort of the variables that are out there that I think go to the question that you're asking. ","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. ","Wesley Bush ","Thank you, Sam. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. ","George Shapiro","Yes, I want to pursue a couple of things. One, Wes, if I look at your earnings guidance that you provided this time last year, it was 990 to 1020 and we all know you did 1219 for the year. Now maybe about half of that was due to tax benefits and stuff that won't recur, but a good part of the rest was due to lower shares and operations. ","So my question is, what's different this year that we shouldn't assume at least some steady improvement in the EPS, especially, since you look at the Aerospace backlog, it's up 50%. So I would think that per Noah's question, that you'd have faster growth in Aerospace sales than what you're providing. ","Wesley Bush ","Yes, George, I do appreciate that question and I appreciate you kind of recounting the success that we had last year in really driving on performance and the outcomes of our approach to capital deployment. And I would just say that, we are a company that really does take a careful look in assessing both, I mentioned this a little bit earlier, assessing both the risk and the opportunities that we see at the start of each year as we look into the year and that's the way we think about our financial equation. ","And it's also the way that we structure the framework for the team and the work that the team has in front of them across this rather large portfolio of programs that we have to really drive on performance. So how we come out, depends on how well we do on executing. And we have a view of it today that we think is the right balance and that's the basis of our guidance. ","The right balance between those risks and opportunities. But we sure are going to be working hard as we go through the year to realize opportunities and manage those risks. So we'll have to see how we come out this year. I've been really pleased as I said in my remarks with how the team performed in 2016 and to be honest with the number of years prior to 2016. I think there is a growing execution discipline within the organization.","But we have to actually see the outcomes. So that's kind of the framework that we're using and I think it is the right place for us to be at this point in the year. Ken, is there anything you would add to that? ","Kenneth Bedingfield","No, I think that was great, Wes. Let me add to it. George, you commented on a couple things, one of which is tax and I agree that tax was a significant contributor to the increased EPS in 2016 versus our initial guide. You referenced shares as well. Actually, think from a share count perspective, we came awfully darn close to what our guide was. So I don't see shares as being \u2013 share count as being a significant contributor. ","But I will remind you as well that corporate unallocated is an area where we had some success in 2016 in reducing our corporate unallocated expenses that included some one-off type items including settlements including some state tax refunds that the benefit of those we saw in 2016 and not clear that they would recur as we look at 2017 and forward. ","George Shapiro","Let me follow up, how about, Wes, on the sales guide for Aerospace? I mean, you gave for the first time year-over-year backlog up 50% in Aerospace. I mean, is there a way to look at the duration as to how fast that actually rolls into revenues, because on the surface it would seem that the Aerospace sales guide would be low. ","Wesley Bush ","Well, George, I would say, we were really pleased with the captures in Aerospace last year. It demonstrated what we've been working to do to really position ourselves from both an innovation and good ideas perspective with our customers as well as from an affordability perspective. ","And I would say our success in capture last year had as much or more to do with affordability as it did with the inherent technology and capabilities of our offerings. So I was just really pleased to see those outcomes. ","With respect to this translation of backlog into annual sales, again, there is this wide variability across the programs. We are seeing in Aerospace and actually it's rippling into some other areas a little bit more of a longer cycle view on some of these awards. So I can't give you the exact translation factor. ","But, I would just say we are going to have to be thoughtful and mindful of how to think about awards translation into annual sales and that's gone into the way that we are thinking about our guidance. ","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks very much.","Wesley Bush ","Thank you, George. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. ","Jason Gursky ","Hey, good afternoon everyone. ","Wesley Bush ","Afternoon, Jason. ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Hey, Jason. ","Jason Gursky ","Hey, Wes, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind just commenting on recompetes that you face, maybe particularly in the services related businesses and talk about whether when these contracts get recompeted either you're the incumbent or you are challenging to get in on some new businesses not yours. Whether the funding levels have begun to stabilize in those recompletes? ","Or whether we are continuing to see funding levels decline? And then, secondarily to that, just competitive environment around those recompetes, whether things have changed in any significant way over the last 12 or 18 months? Thanks. ","Wesley Bush ","Well, thanks for the question and let me kind of give a flavor of it and Ken can perhaps give a little more color or details to it. But your question actually - particularly because you directed it towards Technology Services, goes to a lot of what we are thinking our way through on this portfolio reshaping. In the areas where we see a good, sustainable differentiated business for the long-term, we are happy to engage in the recompetes if they are well funded, if we see that the customer commitment to them to be something that merits, the natural investment you put into a recompete. ","There have been a few over the last couple years and there is likely to be some on a go-forward basis where we see a recompete really as a transition opportunity for us to help the customer transition to another party. I've said this before and we're serious about it. We will never leave a customer in the lurch. ","If they have invested in us a responsibility to get something done, we are going to get it done and if it means doing it for a bit longer than we might have otherwise liked, we'll keep doing it until they are ready to make a transition. ","But the recompetes tend to offer those opportunities for those transitions and we look very carefully at each one of them, both in terms of as you mentioned the funding and the funding stability that goes into it, as wells as what we read to be the customers\u2019 view of its need for a differentiated capability. So that's kind of the flavor of how we think about it. ","Ken, would you want to offer some more color on that. ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Yes, that's great. Thanks, Wes. And Jason, I would just say that, as we look at our recompete exposure for 2017, we don't see it as material to our results one way or the other successful or unsuccessful on those recompetes and actually the largest recompete opportunity that we see is at Mission Systems and that would be what you might be familiar with as the JRDC program and we've been the prime on that for a number of years. ","There are some other recompetes at MS and a few at TS. But I would tell you that again, we don't see it as being significant in terms of our financial results for 2017. ","Jason Gursky ","Great. Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. ","Cai von Rumohr","Yes, thank you very much. So, impressive cash flow guidance for 2017, given the very heavy level of CapEx. Can you give us some more color on how you can get there, given that high level of CapEx? And then looking forward, you had indicated that we are going to have some more high level CapEx looking forward. About how long do we stay at this elevated level? And can you sustain the cash flow over this period? ","Kenneth Bedingfield","So let me - I'll start, Cai. First of all, thanks for your comment and question. From a cash flow perspective, as we look at 2017, we do see it as being a strong year of cash generation. We are going to generate significant cash from operations. We are going to spend about $900 million on capital expenditures as we look to continue to invest in the business, investing in profitable growth, investing in affordability and competitiveness, all of which Wes mentioned. ","I'll maybe mention that from a cash perspective, we have built a little bit of working capital over the last few years. I think as an industry, you've seen that as a theme or a trend. We look at as we are growing the business, actually the ability to manage working capital to a relatively flat outcome for 2017.","Again, while we are growing the top-line, so we see some ability to manage that perspective, the working capital. We'll also just mention that we do have the CAS recoveries that we are seeing that are generally equal to or just a little bit greater than the CapEx. We are expending in the year, so this is kind of a nice mix there of the recoveries on the pension and investing in the business for future growth. ","Wesley Bush ","And Cai, to your question about sort of the outlook on, so I mentioned in my remarks that we see these elevated levels for another couple years. I\u2019ll also go back to what I said in response to an earlier question, if it turns out that we are successful on a number of other new programs, depending on the magnitude of those programs and the related investments. We would enjoy that success and it could have some implications on CapEx even beyond the couple years. But we are just going to have to wait and see how all that works out. ","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you.","Kenneth Bedingfield","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. ","Robert Spingarn ","Good morning or good afternoon, I should say. ","Wesley Bush ","Hey, Rob. ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Hey, Rob. ","Robert Spingarn ","Hey guys. I wanted to talk about this concept of \u2013 I see this dichotomy forming over contract type at DoD between low cost and best value. And I just noted, Wes, in your comments earlier on the T-X RFP and on the withdrawal of one of the teams yesterday, if that isn't starting to turn into a bit of a low cost shootout and if that might be \u2013 sounds like that just might be less appealing especially as you go here and you are working through some other contracts, that will eventually allow your Aerospace margins to rise as we get into production. ","Is that something that you see? And if that's the case, how do we think about J stars in that \u2013 from that framework? Is that a best value or a low cost type of opportunity? ","Wesley Bush ","Yes, Rob, it's a really good question and I think an important one in the environment that we are in and so let me give a framework that I see right now. And I think our customers actually being thoughtful in how they are approaching this. ","There are some things that our customers\u2019 going to want to buy where there isn't that much differentiation in the type of outcome of the product. And in those cases, it appears they are making what seems like a reasonably good decision to really focus on the cost and to drive for the lowest cost answer they can get. ","And in some instances that might be interesting to us, if we think we've got a particular architectural approach or engineering approach that positions an end-product in a very low cost part of the coordinate system, then we might look at that and see what the returns look like. If it's a situation where it's just low cost because that's what the customer really cares about and we don't see a whole lot of differentiation across the spectrum, those are probably less interesting opportunities for us. ","So if you look at the \u2013 I won't go contract-by-contract in terms of the opportunities that are out there, because we are in a competitive state right now and would not want to say too much about each and every one of them. But there are others where our customer is transmitting the message in their RFP and in other ways that while cost is always critically important, they see a little bit of a trade space between cost and performance and value. And those tend to be a little bit more interesting. ","So, we look at each and every one of these and do a very detailed diagnostic and we look at it in the \u2013 through the lens, through what I would call a non-advocate lens within our company to ensure that we are not kidding ourselves about what the real investment and cost would look like and then we call it. ","And sometimes it takes a little longer to call it based on the information that we need to get to a high quality decision. But we are looking at the way the customer is communicating around its view of the business deal and what's important to them to make sure that our offerings really line up the right way in a very competitive environment. ","Robert Spingarn ","Thank you for your thoughts on that. ","Wesley Bush ","Thanks, Rob. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. ","David Strauss ","Thanks. Good afternoon. ","Wesley Bush ","Hi, David. ","David Strauss ","I know, you can't say much on your restricted portfolio, getting into specifics there, but could you maybe size it for us as a percentage of sales in 2016? How much it grew and what's embedded in your guidance for 2017, specifically for restricted growth? ","Kenneth Bedingfield","David, I'm not sure that I would be able to necessarily provide guidance on what growth or what percentage it makes up specifically for 2017 but I will say that as we look at the 2016 restricted activities as a percentage of total sales, it's in the low 20% range of sales. I will tell you that it is a nicely growing part of our business, very important to us as a company and what we do and what we deliver. But that's probably the extent to which I could get into it for you. ","David Strauss ","Okay.","Wesley Bush ","And David, I would just add, as our customers look at the environment that we're all operating in today and the need for security, there is a lot of focus on b the restricted side. And I think there is going to continue to be a growing focus on the restricted side and I think it makes sense from a national security perspective. ","David Strauss ","Thank you. ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Thanks, David. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical. ","Robert Stallard ","Thanks so much. Good evening. ","Wesley Bush ","Hi, Rob. ","Robert Stallard ","On the shift in mix, I don't know if you are able to quantify it, but how much is the cost plus portion shifting from 2016 to 2017 based on what you know today? ","Kenneth Bedingfield","Rob, thanks for the question. Not sure that I have that exact number in front of me. But I will tell you that we are seeing a marked increase in terms of our cost plus, think of that as largely being a development type work versus our fixed price or production type work and I am thinking that's probably in the range of a 3% shift from the 2016 actuals to 2017 and you can pick up that 2016 number in our 10-K when we file it. We expect to do that early next week. So, probably the best information I can give you at this point. ","Stephen Movius","Robin, I think we'll do one more question. ","Robert Stallard ","Okay. I'll pass on then. ","Stephen Movius","Okay, thanks, Rob.","Operator","And your final question comes \u2013 is a follow-up from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. ","Noah Poponak ","Thanks. Hey, Wes, I wanted to ask you, what is the rate of growth in revenue or in EBIT dollars, which everyone is more important to you, I guess, or easier to quantify that you would need to be reasonably certain you would obtain over some multiyear period in the future in order to be willing to double your CapEx for a few years? ","Wesley Bush ","Noah, I am not sure I want to actually put that out there. A lot of the way we look at our competitive profile is sort of embedded in the way I would think about answering that question. But let me say one thing and I've said this before. We are not about growing revenue. That's not the thing that motivates our company. ","We are about growing value. And I think a lot of folks can make bad decisions in the defense industry in particular if they are just looking at things through the optic of the top-line. It's really the ability to capture business that translates into bottom-line growth and most importantly translates into cash generation. So that, you can make good decisions on how you use that cash. ","And it's - I think an important parameter to keep in front of all of us as we look at the opportunity space that's in front of us. So we are not driving our investment strategy based on revenue growth. ","Kenneth Bedingfield","And let me just remind you, Noah, that as we think about capital deployment, we are very focused on the strategy and creating value out of the capital deployment that we do and I'll just remind you that we very clearly recognize that we are investing in the business which is our first priority. ","It has to be where that is driving more value than another investment that we could make. So, I'd just remind you that we try to be very disciplined in terms of our investments and in terms of how we deploy the precious capital of the company. ","Stephen Movius","Wes, at this point in time final comments? ","Wesley Bush ","Okay, thanks, Steve. I'll just wrap up by repeating what I said a bit earlier. The strong year that we had in 2016 really has laid a great foundation for us as we move into the New Year in 2017.

My name is Sheverly, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Sheverly, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. We do not have a PowerPoint presentation for the first quarter. However, we are posting an updated company overview that provides supplemental information on our 4 sectors. You can access our new company overview at www.northropgrumman.com.","Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements, pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially.","On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush","Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our first quarter performance demonstrates that our team's focus on affordability, cost competitiveness and program performance continues to generate solid results. This was another good quarter, and I'm very proud of the track record that our team has built.","Despite slightly lower sales, first quarter earnings per share increased 4% to $2.03. The combination of strong operating performance from all 4 of our businesses and share repurchases drove this quarter's EPS growth. Our first quarter sales declined by approximately $100 million or 1.5%. Sales for our short-cycle businesses, Information Systems and Technical Services, declined by approximately $200 million, which was partially offset by a $100 million sales increase at Aerospace Systems, our longest-cycle business. Jim will discuss trends within each sector, but generally speaking, top line pressure in our short-cycle businesses reflects federal budget turmoil, continuing in-theater force reductions and our own portfolio-shaping actions. Information Systems was most impacted by the pervasive budget uncertainty in the first quarter and the restrictive nature of the continuing resolution that expired on March 27.","Segment operating margin rate was strong at 12.3%, and we reduced our year-over-year weighted average shares outstanding by 7%. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.5 million shares of our stock for approximately $431 million. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $1 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. First quarter cash from operations improved year-over-year, and free cash flow improved by approximately $150 million. We ended the quarter with a total backlog of $39.4 billion, which reflects new awards of $4.7 billion or a 77% book-to-bill. First quarter book-to-bill was impacted by our customers' reluctance or inability to award contracts or task orders. Sequestration and the restrictive CR were significant overhangs. And most major contract negotiations are taking longer due to the numerous issues our customers have to address in today's environment.","During the quarter, we announced several actions to ensure further alignment with our customers' need for increasing affordability, innovation and cost competitiveness. We're establishing Aerospace Design Centers of Excellence in Florida, California and New York for manned and unmanned aircraft and electronic attack. We're also establishing 2 Aircraft Integration Centers of Excellence in Palmdale, California and St. Augustine, Florida. These actions are aimed at focusing and leveraging capabilities in our key areas of manned aircraft and unmanned systems. Taking a Center of Excellence approach will allow us to preserve knowledge and critical skills across a changing program base.","We're continuing to close and consolidate numerous facilities across the company. These actions are aimed at improving our cost competitiveness by reducing our facility's footprint and leveraging our enterprise-wide capacity in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. Looking ahead, we now have a fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill in place. Sequestration, of course, is now in effect, and our customers are in the process of making the programmatic decisions necessary to comply with the reduced budget levels.","I'd also note that the President has submitted a fiscal year 2014 budget. The administration's budget does not include sequestration, highlighting the importance of continuing to adequately fund our national security efforts. However, if Congress does not take legislative action to avoid the continuation of sequestration, approximately $50 billion in additional spending reductions will be required in FY 2014. In addition to these budget considerations, Secretary Hagel's review of National Defense strategy is expected at the end of May. This review may inform additional programmatic decisions, as well as the upcoming quadrennial defense review. All of this is creating a high degree of turmoil as our customers navigate these budget crosscurrents. We share the concerns of our Pentagon leadership that damage to national security may be irreversible under a prolonged sequestration.","With few exceptions, we were pleased to see that the President's fiscal year 2014 budget supported many of our largest programs. Funding for the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye was increased 25%. 21 EA-18G Growlers were requested at roughly double last year's funding. F-35 units were maintained, and space programs like SBIRS, Advanced EHF and the James Webb Space Telescope were sufficiently funded. We believe it is important that the budget provides $13 billion for cyber-related activities. The Department of Defense designated Cybersecurity as a key investment area and increased funding in this area by more than 20% to $4.7 billion. We were also pleased the budget continues to support Global Hawk Block 30 and Block 40 operations for the Air Force. Our high-altitude, long-endurance unmanned franchise continues to be well-positioned in both the domestic and international markets. Growth in our domestic efforts will be driven by the Navy's Triton program. And on the international front, we are ramping up on NATO AGS and continuing our efforts on Germany's EURO HAWK.","Turning to our financial outlook for the remaining of the year, we're confirming the guidance we provided in January. We now have an appropriations bill in place. We have received some specific sequestration-related program directives. To date, these are not large amounts in the aggregate, and they are being offset by more positive trends in other areas. So without additional definitive action on specific programs, our prior guidance represents our current estimate of this year's financial results, although we recognize uncertainty remains regarding the implementation of sequestration. While we are not yet able to determine all program-specific impacts, we expect the reduced FY 2013 budget levels will result in lower 2013 awards, and the related impacts to company revenues, earnings and cash flows likely will trail the reduced awards. We continue to expect sales of approximately $24 billion, EPS of $6.85 to $7.15, cash from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion before discretionary pension contributions.","So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?","James F. Palmer","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My comments will focus on the first quarter results and, of course, our 2013 guidance. As Wes said, another very solid quarter. Our employees continue to focus on performance and execution in a very difficult and demanding environment, and I want to add my congratulations to our team for a job very well done.","Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems sales increased 4% or about $100 million. The single largest driver was the higher F-35 volume. You might recall that the F-35 program transitioned to the units of delivery accounting method beginning with LRIP 5. We delivered the first LRIP 5 units in last year's third quarter. This quarter, first quarter of 2013, we had 10 LRIP 5 deliveries compared with no LRIP 5 deliveries in last year's first quarter. AS also had higher unmanned revenues this quarter as the NATO AGS and Fire Scout programs ramped up. These positive trends were partially offset by a decline in space programs. I view AS first quarter operating margin rate of 10.9% as supportive of our low- to mid-11% guidance for the year. And we continue to expect sales of approximately $9.7 billion for the year at AS.","Turning to Electronic Systems. First quarter sales were comparable to last year. In-theater force tempo reduced infrared countermeasures and laser systems revenues by about $40 million. Program completions in combat avionics and maritime systems reduced revenues by about another $60 million. These impacts were essentially offset by higher volumes for international and space programs. Operating income on an absolute basis was down 3%, but margin rate was again outstanding at 17.2%. You'll recall that in last year's first quarter, we noted that ES had an unusually high level of net favorable adjustments, particularly in combat avionics. Net favorable adjustments at ES declined by $62 million this quarter but were partially offset by the reversal of a $26 million non-programmatic risk reserve. The remainder of the improvement reflects higher overall margin rates resulting, in part, from last year's performance improvements. Obviously, it's early in the year and most of this year's risk and opportunities are still ahead of us, but I expect that there may be some modest upside to the current guidance for ES sales and margin rate.","Information Systems first quarter sales declined by 9%, with the single largest item in that decline being the $25 million transfer of intercompany efforts to our Enterprise Shared Services organization. Before that item, sales declined by about 8% due to lower volume across a broad number of programs. No single program accounted for a material amount of the total decline. Operating income declined as a result of lower sales and a lower level of net favorable adjustments than in the prior year. Although margin rate declined, it was still strong at 10.2%. And at this point in the year, we are maintaining our sales guidance of approximately $6.7 billion, with an operating margin rate in the mid to high 9%s, although there is likely some modest downside sales risk of the uncertain impacts of sequestration on this short-cycle business.","Moving to Technical Services. First quarter sales declined by 4%, operating income declined by 7%, portfolio shaping impacted sales by about $30 million and lower ICBM and KC-10 volume impacted sales by about another $40 million. These declines were partially offset by higher volumes for new programs awarded in 2012. Operating income reflects lower sales and an operating margin rate comparable to prior year. We continue to expect sales of about $2.7 billion with a mid to high 8% margin rate. First quarter segment operating margin rate on an overall basis was 12.3% compared to 12.7% in last year's first quarter. This reflects a $91 million decline in net favorable adjustments in the quarter. About 2\/3 of that change was in Electronic Systems, but as I noted earlier, that was partially offset by this $26 million reserve reversal. The remaining performance improvement reflects, as I said earlier, the higher booking rates across our portfolio, resulting from, at least in part, last year's EAC adjustments.","I would also note that we had a lower tax rate this quarter. As you are aware, the American Taxpayer Relief Act reinstated the research tax credits for 2012 and 2013. So this quarter's lower effective tax rate reflects about $20 million benefit for those credits this quarter. That amount includes the full effect of 2012 credits and 1 quarter of expected 2013 credits. Cash from operations improved by about $100 million compared to last year, and as I think many of you know, our first quarter cash flow is typically the lowest of the year. As Wes indicated, we are maintaining our guidance from cash from operations and free cash flow. And I would remind you that all those estimates are before the after-tax impact of any discretionary pension contributions. And shortly after the quarter-end, we made a $500 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans. These tax-efficient contributions avoid any future funding spikes and continue to be an effective use of our cash. I would note that over the last 10 years, our average annual planned investment returns have exceeded our long-term expected rate of return by well over 100 basis points. That superior investment performance has positively impacted our funded status, reduced future CAS cost and improved affordability and, I believe, provides a competitive advantage.","Before we move to Q&A, I'd just like to add my perspective on 2013 sales guidance, as we said last year or last quarter, our initial 2013 guidance did not assume sequestration. And as Wes noted, to date, sequestrated-related downside sales risks haven't been that significant and have generally been in our short-cycle business. I would characterize those reductions as pretty much consistent with our expectations in a declining budget environment. So -- and to date, the reductions that we have seen have been largely offset by positive trends at Electronic Systems. So in thinking about this, barring any specific program cancellations or terminations, we don't expect fiscal 2014 budget debate or the results of Secretary Hagel's strategic review to significantly impact our 2013 sales. So given those assumptions, we have maintained our 2013 sales guidance.","Steve, I think at this point, we're ready to take any questions.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] So Sheverly, we're ready to begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies LLC.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Wes, I want to talk for a second about UAVs, and this a little bit of a fine point. But the FY '13 budget approved the -- or supported the Block 30 Global Hawk. And the commentary outside of what Congress has appropriated would say the program has problems, and you can see that accordingly in the FY '14 budget. Could you sort of address -- I mean, obviously, some of your commentary did, but could you put a little bit more of a fine point on this? If the funding is there, then won't you get it?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, Howard, thanks for the question. Let me just kind of back up and talk about Block 30 a little bit more broadly. We continue to be pleased, and I think the customer continues to be very pleased with the in-theater performance of the Block 30 systems. They're in very high demand. They're running at a very high utilization rate. The combatant commanders don't seem to be able to get enough of them. So that's the -- sort of the operational reality of what's going on with Block 30 today. We're in this interesting period of time where the nation is having to make some decisions around budgets, and the departments are feeling very squeezed on their ability to fit everything in and meet all the demands of both the Congress, if you will, from a budgetary perspective, as well as the operational commanders out there in the theater. So inevitably, there are decisions or recommendations put forward for budgetary consideration that the Congress has to debate and make decisions on. And Block 30, I think, is sort of a classic example of that. In particular, it is a brand-new system. And so when you do the calculation on the cost component, brand-new systems take a little bit of time to work their operating costs down the curve, down the operating cost curve. And if you're in a budgetary mode where you're trying to squeeze everything in for the next year and you're not all the way down that curve, it's easy to come up with a different conclusion. And so that's where Congress has responsibility to look at things both near term and long term. And we saw that in this last cycle where Congress took a view of sort of the longer term, given the investment that's been made in Block 30. So we were very pleased to see the continued support for Block 30 in the actions that Congress took with the 2013, both the authorization and the appropriation process. But at the same time, the Air Force has real budget pressures, and that's a reality the Air Force is having to work their way through. This turns out to be more about the cost of operating than it really does in terms of the remaining procurement. If you look at the last of the lots of Block 30 to be put on contract, that will be Lot 11, there's really only 3 more aircraft in that Lot 11. So the budget math here has to go to what it takes to sustain this system in its operations. And so that's on us. We have got to work with the Air Force to continue to address the cost of operating Block 30s. We're doing that. We're putting forward some proposals, recommendations for the Air Force to consider. But I think it's simply a reflection of this budget environment that we're in, that's forcing a decision space that's perhaps more narrow. And we all might want it to be given the longer-term perspective of capabilities for the nation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wes, I would like to dive a little bit deeper on the comment that you made about 2014 and the fact that the impact of sequester is kind of marginal this year but that what we ought to be really focused on with sequester is 2014, and more importantly, that revenues and earnings are going to kind of follow the bookings rate. So kind of leads logically to your expectations around book-to-bill through this year and how you think that, that actually translates into the trajectory as we move out into 2014, keeping in mind that you'll, of course, be able to continue to draw on the backlog that you already have. But just any more granularity that you can offer on 2014, I think, would be helpful for everybody on the call.","Wesley G. Bush","Thanks, Jason. I think it actually might be helpful just to step back and remind everybody of the mechanics here because that really turns into the outcome. So I think we're all trying to sort our way through. And the analogy I would use would be how does the pig move through the snake? Although in this case, I wouldn't want to impugn the population of pigs by calling them a sequester. So maybe it's the rat moving through a snake or something. It's a delayed effect approach. The sequester reduced the amount of money that Congress allows to be committed by the Department of Defense and by the other federal agencies. So it really starts there. The in-year effect of the sequester is a reduction in the department's ability to obligate fundamentally. That reduction takes some time to translate into revenue impacts as the department actually has to turn a reduced level appropriations into specific contractual commitments. And then those contractual commitments, once they're made, they play out over the life of the contracts as revenues. So that creates this delayed effect in realizing the impact on revenues resulting from the sequester. And if you kind of stand back and look at the different types of businesses in our company and in our industry, the shorter-cycle businesses will realize this effect the first, of course, because that delay effect is shorter. And the longer-cycle businesses will see it over a longer period of time. And I think as you reflected in your question, awards is really the leading indicator of that effect. And as I think I indicated in my remarks, we expect to see the impacts on revenue, earnings and, of course, cash flows trail that impact on awards over time. And as I think Jim mentioned, when we were thinking about our guidance, obviously, we're having to reflect the best knowledge that we have today. That guidance does assume that the sequester does not result in cancellations or terminations of our significant programs. But clearly, there's still uncertainty regarding the ultimate impact of the sequester, particularly as we look out into next year. And I think your question went to, what should we be thinking about in terms of the effects on awards and book-to-bill? I wish I knew. We have yet to see that as we go through this year. I think the real test will be what does the third and fourth quarter of this year look like? So essentially, the last quarter of this fiscal year and the first quarter of the new fiscal year. That will inform us a lot. It certainly will inform us on how 2014 will look. And it's very likely that this is going to negatively impact sales in 2014. I'll say it as clearly as I can in that regard. To think that the sequester somehow just dissipates and goes away and doesn't impact the future is putting your head in the sand. So we expect there will be some continuing impact over time. The magnitude of that impact in 2014 is hard to predict. As I indicated, we've got a bunch of things in front of us. We have to work our way through the actual implementation of the current sequester. We have the debt ceiling issues in front of us over the course of the summer, which may or may not impact the outcome for the budgets for next year and how Congress deals with the President's budget that was put forward. And we also have in front of us the overall strategy review that Secretary Hagel has launched, which is standing back to take kind of a broader look at the national strategy in light of overall budget constraints. So obviously, it would be a little bit foolish to try and speculate on how that works out for 2014. But in aggregate, given the impact of the sequester this year, I think it's fair to project that it will have a negative impact on 2014 revenues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to follow on that because when you look at your shorter-cycle businesses, particularly on the Information Systems side, backlogs did come down in Q1. And you've been very clear for some time that this is where you could see more of an effect. And then if we head into sequestration, my assumption would be that there could be some impact in '13 and then more in '14. When you take apart that business, where are you seeing the most maybe downside in Q1 or the most risk going forward, either in terms of customer, civil, defense, intel or business type? Can you characterize that a little bit?","James F. Palmer","Yes, Doug, this is Jim. As I said in my comments, really, the declines we saw this year or this quarter, quarter-over-quarter, were across the broad portfolio of programs. I don't know that I would characterize it as necessarily in 1 particular area or not. Again, I think as we all know, this the shortest cycle business we have. It's likely to be the first impacted. And it's probably also likely to be the first that starts to turn up when there is an upturn.","Wesley G. Bush","I do think there are some effects in there that probably flow through before others. We know -- I think everyone is aware that the O&M budgets are under the most immediate stress. So the components of the IS business that connect to the O&M accounts see it first. The Army budget is also a component of sales, and IS is, I think, probably even under more pressure from a longer perspective, not necessarily quarter-to-quarter but from a longer perspective. So if I had to pick apart sort of the customer community drivers, I would say those are more immediate. But the reality is, as Jim said, all of our customers across the board are dealing with this. There was not real flexibility provided to the department with the [indiscernible] sequester. So it's kind of as we thought it would be should this happen kind of across the board.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So intel, civil agencies, DoD, all sort of the same dynamic?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, they're all having to deal with the sequestered budget amounts, and they're all dealing with it in somewhat different ways. But ultimately, and I'm not just talking about the quarter, I'm talking about our kind of -- our view over the year, we expect to see it manifest kind of across that board.","James F. Palmer","And Doug, to be real clear here, we really haven't seen that large of impacts from sequestration at this point. Largely, the declines that we saw were what we -- I would characterize as expected based on an overall budget decline environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wes, wanted to dig a little more actually into Information Systems. And the backlog decline has been noted, and your comments about that have been noted. Just bigger picture though, this business is going, what I would characterize and maybe you'd disagree, in a direction \u2013 an un-Northrop-like direction. You guys have been very clear about your pursuit of profitable business, and we see the margins in that segment. But pricing is getting tougher, and barriers to entry are -- always have been low. How are you thinking about navigating through this environment where, really, the business is going in a different direction from what you like to do with your businesses?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. Our approach to that, and we've been at this now for a few years in IS, has been to step away from the components of that space that are going in the directions that you described. And so part of what you've seen in terms of our top line in IS have been very focused decisions about where we're just not going to be in that part of the market. And as I said, we've been at that for a while. I think you can see the benefit of that thinking in our -- in terms of our operating margin rate because we've been able to continue to generate good margins in the space by being much more selective in the parts of it where we compete. So if I pull that thread a bit, IS has probably more hardware in it than I think most people realize. If you look at the work that we do for the Department of Defense and the communications arena where within IS, we're building the C&I avionics for the Joint Strike Fighter. If you look at actually much of the work that we do for the Army that has hardware in content, those parts of the business certainly require a lot more engineering content, they require intellectual property investment and create positions for us that are not just the sort of commodity IT business framework that is often seen in the space characterized by IS. If you look at the broader systems work that we do, that is generally characterized by also a lot of engineering content, whether we're building large command and control systems. And missile defense is sort of a classic example of the work that we do in IS in that regard. Those areas are classes of businesses that when you compare within our IS sector to other companies, other companies sometimes put that in, something they would call electronics or missile defense or some other nomenclature for the title of the business. So I am not as concerned about what we're seeing in the more commodity part of what I would sort of call the IT services businesses out there because that's a relatively small part of our business. We do have some of that, and we've made decisions to keep pieces of it where it connects to the higher value, sort of longer investment perspective components of the business. So I do wonder sometimes if we're doing ourselves a disservice by calling it information systems. But quite frankly, in terms of what it actually does, it provides information systems to our customer community. And I don't want to re-label it just from \u2013 put a different banner on it from a Street perspective. I want to make sure that our team understands their charter and what they're out there to do. But the overall vector for that business, I think, is good over the longer period of time. Clearly, as I said, it is a shorter-cycle business. Most parts of it are. And so we'll see some of those effects sooner. But when I think about this for the long term, I like what I see, I like what we're doing and I think it's going to continue to be an important part of our company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Wes, just on the back end of that question, then I have another one, could you characterize, maybe give us a ratio in that business of what you'd call price-sensitive to less price-sensitive?","Wesley G. Bush","Let me ask Steve to do that, Steve Movius. Steve, as most of you know, was formally the CFO of our IS business and I think has a good framework for describing that.","Stephen C. Movius","Yes, I'd be happy to. Information Systems, really look at it in a couple of pieces. One would be kind of services piece with a lot of what I would call high-end engineering content contracts, where we've been with a customer for oftentimes very extended periods of time, quite a bit of that with restricted customers. And I would say that most of our competition in that space are folks that -- kind of the Tier 1 folks that you know pretty well. On the systems side, that's about 60% of our business. And again, that's, by and large, very few of the IT competitors in that space. Again, mostly the Tier 1 guys where you have to have significant capabilities to be able to compete effectively and where the customers' value proposition is more on what you're delivering to them versus particularly a lower hourly rate, so to speak. You might think about it in a services world. So I hope that helps.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No, it certainly does. Then just, Wes, if I go quickly at another direction. One of your peer companies talked a bit about nondefense adjacencies in a recent earnings call. Could you talk a little bit about where some of your opportunities are and then to any extent that you might be further contemplating portfolio shaping?","Wesley G. Bush","My perspective on adjacencies is it's a perspective that any healthy company should always be looking at its portfolio of capabilities and figuring out how to create value. I think the experience of our industry suggests that the longer you have to stretch out your tape measure to measure how adjacent it is, the less likely it is that you're going to really create value. So you have to be very thoughtful both around the real -- the practical application of the technology and a company's ability to understand and navigate the channels to market. It turns out channels to market is every bit as important as the product that you think you have. So our experience generally has been that there's more value to be gained by partnering effectively with other companies that simply have those channels to market and understand the economics and the consumer, if you will, demands that are in those spaces. So I would say there is a value creation opportunity out there for the broader use of technology. You just have to be very thoughtful about how you pursue that and the degree to which you focus the resource of the company in that direction versus sticking to your knitting.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But you wouldn't characterize it as a driver of your forward strategy?","Wesley G. Bush","No, I would not. It's more an opportunity space that I would say that we look at, and that comes and goes over time, depending on where those technologies might actually connect. If you turn back the clock to the latter part of the '90s, there was a rapid growth in the telecom space that needed a class of technologies that derived from the defense industry. So a number of companies, ours included, were able to navigate that and creates some meaningful value during that time through some very thoughtful approaches to partnering with other companies to leverage that technology. So it's a little bit dependent on what else is going on in the economy and where the needs are. And that's really, I would say, the way we think about it. We're mindful of it, we look at it, but it's not the primary motivator of our strategy, obviously. We're a global security company, and we keep that in mind.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had a question which is, if I just look at your net favorable adjustments and I back those out, it still looks like margins were up kind of 30 basis points from December and about 90 versus last year. So I guess the first question is, really, what do you attribute that real change in performance to as to why the underlying earnings still seems to be better? And then should we use this, call it, $225 million of favorable adjustments as the likely number for the future quarters this year?","James F. Palmer","Yes, Sam, I haven't done your math, but as I noted, earnings adjustments are down this quarter, I would think, to a more, if you will, normal level. Last year, admittedly, was -- had very favorable positive adjustments. Didn't think they would be able to be sustained at that level. Ultimately, the margin rates for the 4 sectors in the company reflected in our overall guidance. I feel comfortable with that. Clearly, we're going to push the organization to do better. Part of the improvement, as I noted, in margin rates is a result of the actions that we've taken over time that allowed us to harvest the benefit on our existing backlog of contracts. We'll realize that benefit over the life of that backlog set of contracts. In a go-forward basis, we'll negotiate new contracts reflecting the current cost at that point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Loomis with Stifel.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Thanks for giving the detail on the services. Just kind of staying along that theme, you talked about the impact of sequestration early thought. And then -- but I look at the guidance for the year on both -- looking at the 2 separately, Technical Services and then IS. So on Technical Services, if we look at the guidance for the full year, it was down \u2013 actual was down 4%. But it implies other quarters have to be down 13% to 14%. Can you just talk about what the main drivers causing those lower year-over-year comparisons? And then on the other side with IS, given the full year guidance, it looks like it's going to be relatively stable throughout the other remaining 3 quarters. Yet, you talked about how sequestration would impact the shorter-cycle side. So is there things that are happening positively on the IS side to kind of offset that later in the year?","James F. Palmer","Yes. In terms of guidance, you might imagine in this environment, we look at a whole number of -- a whole bunch of possible scenarios that have different sales levels for all the different organizations. And as I do that, look at all those potentials, as I said, I come back to an answer that tells me that our overall guidance is supportive of what may -- what I would expect to happen for the year. Yes, there's going to be some variation among the sectors as we go through the year and get a better clarification around whether or not there's going to be specific programs affected by sequestration. The timing of when those occur will have an impact on this year's sales. But again, on an overall basis, I feel good about the overall guidance. I would point out that TS, for example, there are some programmatic effects that occur this year. The ICBM program will be down on a year-over-year basis, just as part of that programmatic change in the program, and that has been reflected in our thoughts about overall guidance at the beginning of the year for the TS environment, as well as the total company.","Wesley G. Bush","Bill, it's Wes. Let me -- I'll just add to what Jim had to say on this, just one other little piece to think about. And I think this is kind of a broader market perspective. Our customers are clearly feeling the most intensity of the pressure in the near term around the O&M part of the budget. And obviously, the appropriations process tried to relieve a little bit of that, that they went through. But any of the businesses that are tightly connected to the O&M part of the budget, when we think through all the factors that Jim just described, that's a factor that really weighs in to our thought process. If you think about what's going on at DoD itself, they pay for their civilian workforce out of that O&M budget, and they're talking still about having to furlough some folks. And when we're down to that level of furloughing and impacting readiness, we've heard the Secretary of the Air Force talk about just these awful effects of having to stand down training flights. When we're having to make those kinds of decisions as a nation, relative to the impacts of the sequester, it just really makes that part of the budget risk factors stand up for us and makes us even more sensitive to potential decisions our customers might have to make in light of the things that are weighing on them already. So I just think it's important to keep in mind what our customers are having to work their way through in light of this somewhat ridiculous budget situation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Wes, I'd like to follow on from what you just said about the state of play, so to speak. The customer's clearly got a lot of pressure at the moment. I was wondering if you're seeing any of that cascading down to you on maybe the price or terms of contract situation as, obviously, they could save some money, I guess, by the defense industry booking lower margins.","Wesley G. Bush","The way I would characterize that is things are taking longer to get done, and I think part of that is just a reflection of the turmoil that our customers are having to deal with. And there's always a natural inclination to try and push back on the margin rates and other aspects of the contracts. Our approach to that has been, and I don't think we're alone in this, when you're looking at a total cost picture, the place to go to save the money is the 90%, not the 10%; the 90% of cost, not the 10% of fee or whatever the right percentages are on a particular contract. So our approach has been to very aggressively go after cost, cost from a cost structure standpoint and cost from a programmatic standpoint. And I think in the places where we're able to demonstrate to our customer community that we are making progress in that regard, I think that helps this overall discussion immensely. In the areas where the customers aren't satisfied with progress on that, then yes, there is a tougher discussion around what is the appropriate fee or incentive structure to help motivate improvements in overall cost. And so yes, I would say there's more intensity around that. But to-date, I think we've been in a position where we've been able to work with our customer community to get to outcomes that we view as fair.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just a fine point on that. Are you seeing the customer potentially trying to transfer more risk in the contracts that you sign up to as a way of perhaps saving some money going forward?","Wesley G. Bush","Each time we get into a discussion around an acquisition approach, the ultimate manifestation of that risk is contract type. And there is, I would say, more intensity around what should be fixed price, what should be fixed price incentive versus cost plus. And I would say we were seeing a little bit of a tilt, I think almost an overcorrection tilt in the direction of fixed price or fixed price incentives for a while. If you look at the communication that Frank Kendall has been putting out and, I would say, all of the service acquisition executives have been working on, I think there's a growing recognition that, that might have gone a little bit too far and that there are really some things that the department really wants to be cost plus or perhaps FPI that were getting pushed towards FFP. So I think there's a natural pendulum sort of cycle that we see in this, and my sense is it's -- there's a little bit of a correction occurring right now. But the pressures of the budget environment do cause individual program offices to have to rethink that and figure out how they actually do their budgeting from a total cost, not just what they're putting on contract but also their margin or their risk assessment. So it's a bigger -- I would say a bigger part of the dialogue, bigger part of the discussion. But again, that's on us as well, that's on the industry and in our company, in particular, to be very clear about what that risk balance is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So a general question. Secretary Hagel has sort of emphasized priority on cyber. Your handout suggests that cyber is about a little under $2 billion out of IS's revenue. Everyone defines cyber business differently. Could you tell us, when you talk of your cyber solutions, what do you have in that number? And what are its prospects for growth and profitability this year and next?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, Cai, it's Wes. Let me just say sort of broadly, yes, I agree with you, everybody defines cyber somewhat differently. It is one of these fields that's rapidly emerging. And as we all begin to realize, and by we, I include our customer community, the tentacles of cyber and the necessity of connecting it so intimately to other components of the floor structure, I don't think there's going to be an exact, precise definition that everybody can look to and say, \"That's an airplane and that's cyber.\" Right? I think it's going to be one of these things where we're going to have to build our way into a common understanding. So as we have worked our definition of it, it has emerged over time from sort of the initial view that was all about maybe defense and offense in the network domain to now include situational awareness more broadly in the network domain. And then beyond that, it became clear that we needed to embed cyber capabilities into platforms and other systems that we're selling. So there's an embedded component of it. And then I would say, even beyond that, there's a growing recognition of cyber as an integral component and perhaps the right words for basically the broader category of non-kinetic capability that is inclusive of things that may have historically been called electronic warfare. So we are thoughtful in how we look at each piece and how we describe it, but I think what you're seeing from us is more a reflection of the way that we would characterize the components of our portfolio that match to our customers' emerging definition of cyber. And as that definition continues to change, we're going to try and keep up with it and actually help influence the perspectives on those tentacles of cyber. So I apologize if that's not a precise definition for you, but it is a reflection of an evolving field and a field whose tentacles are increasingly intertwined in just about every other component of the defense architecture. So given that, to the second part of your question, growth, I mentioned in my comments that we were pleased to see the amount of funding that is evident in the President's budget for what I would say is more traditional cyber, the definition of defense, offense and situational awareness. But there are components of the President's budget associated with the other parts of the defense infrastructure that are reflective of the need to embed cyber in those as well. So it's probably not going to help from a modeling perspective, what I just said, but I think from an understanding perspective, it's important to recognize that this is going to be a moving target for a while, which I think emphasizes its importance.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I think the question really was, how fast is it growing? I mean, it's a priority, but is it growing? Or is it relatively stable until some event in the future?","Wesley G. Bush","It's growing.","James F. Palmer","It's growing.","Wesley G. Bush","It's growing. It's growing rapidly. And trying to put a number on it would have to pin down the current state definition on any particular day. But it's double-digit growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just since we made it this far in the call and haven't talked about 1 of 2 topics that are so near and dear to your heart, Jim, and -- capital deployment and pension, I figured I'd at least knock one of them out. The guidance explicitly states that you're not considering a debt ceiling breach government shutdown scenario, but obviously, that's a risk you've got to think about, sort of tail risk you got to think about in your planning. When you think about your stance on capital deployment, share repurchase, as we get closer to that, should expect to see some conservatism in how you manage the balance sheet and how you think about share repurchase? Or is that -- are you in a position where you think you can continue the way you have in the past despite that risk?","James F. Palmer","Yes. Carter, I'd characterize -- our approach here is to be mindful of all the risk that are inherent in our business and then the plan for the possibilities that they all may occur; at the same time, to be balanced, if you will, across the -- we don't guide on a quarterly basis, obviously, on share repurchases. So we've talked about our plan for the year. I really don't see a change in that plan at this point in time. I think we're on pace to do that. And at the same time, we're mindful of the potential risk around the debt ceiling situation here in the summer and feel comfortable that we're able to deal with that as well.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. Since it's Q1, I'll save the pension question for next quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wes, I'm going to go to the high level on sequestration one more time. And the only thing I'm trying to get at is, for the last couple of years, 4% organic decline has kind of been, I think, what you've showed, 4% to 5%. And this year, pretty much the whole industry is at 5%. And Jim, I think you qualified that as being more reflective of a general defense spending declining environment. So I'm just kind of curious, are you feeling better about the industry and your, in particular, ability to manage sequestration? Because it seems like they're giving you a lot of lead time to see it coming. And is it just going to turn out to look like an extension of a down cycle?","Wesley G. Bush","Hard to tell yet. The challenge here, obviously, that we're all struggling through in '13 is we've got to deal with a full year sequester in half a year. And so our customers are just really struggling to sort that out. And I have to say, I admire them for how they're managing their way through this because it is so challenging. Trying to predict where this goes on a '14 or '15 basis is difficult from a variety of perspectives that I [indiscernible] before, trying to predict how the FY '14 budget process will work out, trying to predict the results of the strategy review, those are all sort of big challenges. We are managing. And I would say broadly across the industry, we are managing because we are having to scale to go with what's happening. And it's not what we'd prefer to do, but it's what we know how to do and we are going to do it. And having some lead time on decision-making is always helpful so we can try and do this in a way that is most efficient. But ultimately, as I've said very broadly, and I don't want anyone to sort of hear that we're relaxed about this because we are not, the impact of the sequester will have long-term impacts, even if it just gets turned off for '14 and beyond. The fact that we had it this year will have a ripple effect. And if it goes on very long, I think just about anyone in our industry would tell you we are concerned about the impacts on our supply chain and we're concerned about the impacts on our workforce and we're concerned about how long it takes to turn the engines back on when the nation needs it. And history shows, the nation will need it. So I don't want anyone to hear that this is just sort of business as usual, we'll figure it all out and everything will be fine. It's the wrong answer for our country.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But if you had to make the bet, would '14's decline be an accelerating decline versus '13?","Wesley G. Bush","I'm not going to speculate. It's -- there are a lot -- there are so many factors out there. I think it would be foolish to speculate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Yes. Two questions, actually. Jim, I was wondering if you could quantify at all the potential cash flow impact from what the Pentagon's talked about of switching for milestone payments to progress payments, and also the effect that's slowing payments that have been accelerated last year for small business.","James F. Palmer","I'll take the second one first. Move away from the so-called quick pay methodology that occurred in the first quarter impacted cash flows by, I would estimate, about $100 million, negatively impacted cash flows by about $100 million. In terms of movement from milestone payments to progress payments, George, you'd have to look at the broad portfolio of programs. It is, as you know, just a timing question. You do get paid. It's just how quickly do you get paid. And so we continue to work these issues on a program-by-program basis, contract-by-contract, if you will. Some progress, sometimes not so good. But again, I feel good about the overall guidance for cash for the year.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then if I might, one for you, Wes. I mean, you talked about trying to focus on the 90% of the cost rather than the profit margin. But as you commented, in an uncertain environment that you're in, where you don't have the same ability to see ahead like you might have had, I mean, how do you manage getting cost down in that environment so it doesn't wind up having an impact on the margins?","Wesley G. Bush","Fundamentally, our biggest lever has been our ability to manage our overhead structure in the company. And as I've said on earlier calls, we've been on a several year path to reduce headcount and reduce facilities, as well as address other components of that cost structure, including pension, that we think have been necessary to help address that. The next phase of it obviously is programmatic. And every program in our company is addressing that in some meaningful way. And ultimately, it depends on the nature of the individual program. So we look at cost in a total composite. We've had, I would say, more flexibility or opportunity in going after the overall cost structure, overhead cost components. But we are being very aggressive on it program by program.","James F. Palmer","George, if I may. If you really think about our business, we are a consolidation, conglomeration of a bunch of programs or contracts. Much of the cost on any of those contracts are people-related cost and supply cost. So the vast majority of our cost is essentially tied to our individual contracts or programs, and we can respond based on what happens to those contracts or programs.","Wesley G. Bush","So it takes a lot of disciplined management across the enterprise.","Stephen C. Movius","I want to thank all of you for your interest in our company. This concludes our Q&A session, and I'd like to turn the call over to Wes for final comments.","Wesley G. Bush","Thanks, Steve. I'd just like to wrap up today by thanking our employees for all that they're doing to ensure that we continue to support the men and women of our military services and our intelligence communities as they deal with this very challenging budget environment. The sequester does have real negative impacts on these great people who serve our country, and it's imperative that we all give them our support.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our first half results reflect a continued focus on performance by the great team we have in our company and I'd like to thank our folks for all that they're doing. That focus on executing well in combination with effective cash deployment continues to create value for our shareholders, our customers and employees.","Looking at the quarter, earnings per share increased 16%. Cash from operations and free cash flow were also higher this quarter. Through June 30, adjusting for the first quarter pension-free funding, operations generated about $300 million in cash versus $170 million last year. Strong performance from all four of our sectors combined to generate strong segment operating margin.","We also continued to execute our cash deployment strategy. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.8 million shares for $1.1 billion. Year-to-date, share repurchases totaled 12.1 million. And we are now approximately 90% complete toward our goal of repurchasing 60 million shares by the end of 2015.","In total, under the program we announced in May of 2013, we've repurchased more than 54 million shares at an average price per share of just under $121. We're on track to complete the 60 million share repurchase by the end of the year, market conditions permitting.","In addition to deploying cash to significantly reduce our share count, in May, we raised our quarterly dividend 14% to 0.80 per share. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while continuing robust IRAD and capital investments.","Our capital deployment priorities continue to be investing in our business, managing the balance sheet, maintaining a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases. We believe these priorities are serving our shareholders and the company well.","We ended the quarter with total backlog of $37 billion, slightly lower than last quarter, but 4% higher than we were at this time last year. Through June 30, bookings totaled approximately $10.7 billion, giving us a book-to-bill of 90% at the mid-point of the year.","International customers continue to express strong interest in our products and services, and we see opportunity for long-term profitable growth through both our existing portfolio, with programs like F-35 and E-2D, Triton, and SABR radar, as well as through a robust global opportunity set of new programs. We continue to expect international sales to increase to approximately 15% of 2015 sales.","Here in the U.S., we are competing for the nation's next generation Long-Range Strike Bomber. We believe we are well positioned to continue our successful 35-year partnership with U.S. Air Force on long-range strike systems. Our B2 bombers are combat proven and we've been consistently upgrading and sustaining them.","Other important new opportunities here in the U.S. are programs like common infrared countermeasures, long-range discrimination radar, Trainer-X, the Joint STARS recapitalization and JCREW. As a company, we have a well diversified portfolio of existing programs in future opportunities. No single program is a must win for us. The breadth of our portfolio addresses many areas of investment priority for our U.S. and international customers.","But our customers rely on budget clarity to plan and execute their priorities. Our rational orderly U.S. defense budget process will go a long way towards supporting execution of the Pentagon's strategic spending plans to ensure our national security. We encourage congress to address the artificial spending constraints imposed by the Budget Control Act, which are negatively impacting our nation.","Given the current status of budget negotiations and the limited congressional sessions remaining until the end of fiscal year 2015, we expect to begin fiscal year 2016 with a continuing resolution. Unless congress acts to address the BCA, we may also see sequestration triggered in January. Despite these ongoing budgetary challenges, we continue to be focused on performing for our customer, shareholders and employees. Based on the strength of year-to-date results, we are raising our EPS and cash guidance.","We now expect 2015 earnings per share of $9.55 to $9.70 and free cash flow of forward discretionary pension pre-funding of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. In light of the prevailing budget uncertainty and the likelihood for a continuing resolution in our fourth quarter, we're maintaining our sales guidance of $23.4 billion to $23.8 billion.","So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Wes. I also want to thank the team for a job well done. It was a solid quarter and we're on our way to having another strong year. Second quarter EPS increased 16%, which includes a one-time tax item. We recognized $38 million of additional research credits in the quarter, which provided a $0.20 benefit to EPS.","Excluding the tax benefit, earnings per share increased 7% over last year's strong second quarter. Our segment operating income for the quarter was unchanged and segment's operating margin rate increased 30 basis points, reflecting strong performance across all four of our businesses.","Total operating income was slightly lower than last year, due to lower net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment, while the operating margin rate increased 20 basis points to 13.8%.","I would note that our unallocated corporate expense for the quarter was lower than last year's second quarter, but on a year-to-date basis, unallocated corporate expense is consistent with last year's results.","Turning to cash. Operations generated $626 million in the quarter and $297 million year-to-date before the voluntary pension pre-funding. This year's results are consistent with our pattern of having the majority of our cash generated in the second half of the year. Second quarter free cash flow was $511 million after capital investments of $115 million.","Turning to sector results. We had strong performance across the board. Aerospace Systems sales were slightly higher in the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to see growth in our unmanned and space businesses. Year-to-date unmanned sales are up more than 10%, while space sales are up around 5%. These increases were partially offset by declines in a number of other programs, the largest of which was the F\/A-18. Year-to-date F\/A-18 deliveries have declined to 17 from 25 last year. Ramp-up on production activities for the E-2D is partially offsetting the F\/A-18 ramp down in military aircraft programs.","Aerospace's operating income and margin rate were also higher for both the quarter and year-to-date. I would note that this quarter's operating income includes the benefit of risk retirements on a restricted program, and based on first half results, we now expect an AS margin rate of approximately 12% versus our prior guidance of high 11%. Our revenue expectation is unchanged at $9.8 billion to $10 billion.","Moving to Electronic Systems. Second quarter sales declined 3% and are comparable on a year-to-date basis. Operating income and margin rate were solid in both periods and continue to reflect the changing business mix that is more heavily weighted toward development and cost-plus type work. Our guidance for ES is unchanged. We continue to expect sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion with an operating margin rate in the low-to-mid 15% range.","Information Systems' second quarter and year-to-date sales were also consistent with our expectations. The sector continues to perform very well and at the midpoint of the year, operating income and operating margin rate are slightly higher than last year despite a low single digit sales decline. Due to the strong performance, we are increasing IS operating margin rate guidance to the high 9% range versus our prior guidance of mid-to-high 9%. We continue to expect IS to generate sales of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion.","Moving to Technical Services. Second quarter operating income and margin rates are comparable to last year on slightly lower sales. Year-to-date sales are up about 4% primarily due to higher international and higher intercompany sales in the first quarter. We are raising sales guidance for Technical Services to approximate $2.8 billion from our prior guidance of a range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. We continue to expect a margin rate of approximately 9% at TS this year.","On a consolidated basis, segment operating margin rate was 12.6% for the quarter and 12.5% year-to-date. We are maintaining our guidance of approximately 12% for the year.","While our year-to-date total operating margin rate was 13.4%, we're maintaining our guidance of mid 12% for the year due to anticipated changes in our tax methods for Federal tax ratios. While the methods change, shift taxable income into the future and possibly impacts our 2015 cash guidance, it negatively impacts our 2015 P&L in two ways. First, it results in a non-recurring increase to unallocated paid taxes of around $45 million, most of that will likely flow through our third quarter unallocated corporate expense.","As a result, we expect unallocated corporate expense of about $200 million for the full year 2015. The methods change will also move our effective tax rate higher in the second half of the year and closer to the statutory rate due to lower reductions for domestic production activities. As a result, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32% this year. So, for your modeling purposes, third quarter results are expected to reflect the majority of the $45 million non-recurring increase in unallocated corporate expenses, and our effective tax rate will be closer to the statutory rate.","The last EPS guidance item I would like to note is that we now expect the weighted average diluted share count of approximately 192 million shares for the full year.","Looking at our EPS guidance for the year, we now expect EPS between $9.55 and $9.70. The higher range reflects strong first half performance, the tax methods change and the lower expected share count than our prior guidance.","We're also increasing the guidance for cash from operations and free cash flow. Excluding after-tax discretionary pension contributions, we now expect cash from operations will range between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion and free cash flow will range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion.","With that, Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ken. In order to allow time for everybody in the queue to get through, please limit yourself to a single question with one follow-up. Kaitlin?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Steve. Your first question in queue comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good afternoon, everyone.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Noah.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Ken, maybe just a little bit more detail or some follow ups on those outlook components. So, understand the unallocated, nonrecurring, the tax rate change, is that also nonrecurring or what does that do to the tax rate beyond 2015? And then the change in cash from ops and free cash, is that all just cash taxes or is it something else? And then does that sustain or not beyond 2015?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, on the corporate unallocated, that is a nonrecurring as is the impact on the income tax rate, Noah. It's just moving income from 2015 to 2016. As we changed the method, it'll continue to push income out 2016 to 2017. So, essentially it's a one-time cash benefit, but we don't have to pay it back in the future, and we will then realize the benefits of the state and those federal deductions in 2016 and beyond.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Is it possible to perhaps, I know you don't want to commit to numbers beyond 2015, it's too early to do that, but perhaps there is a sort of directional break own you could provide. On average, the next few years, the base business converts net income into free cash at X% and then between tax and pension or anything else that's a major bucket, what would drive you off of that regular conversion one way or the other?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I would say, Noah, we wouldn't want to comment really beyond 2015. In terms of \u2013 you asked about CAS, in terms of CAS, I think there's some information on the website that has some directional data for CAS purposes for 2015, 2016 and 2017, but I don't think I'd want to comment beyond that.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Doug.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","You have taken net debt up substantially over the last year, and I'm just trying to understand where you want to be in terms of a stable level of cash on the balance sheet going forward?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And so, Doug, let me just kind of frame in a broad sense, because I don't think we want to pick one particular number. We manage the company based on the broad environment that we see. And from a net debt increase perspective, we made a decision in 2013, and we followed through on it, that based on the attractiveness of the debt markets to our company at the time, it made sense for us to change our balance a little bit, go out and take on a little bit of additional debt and use that for share repurchase.","We've been doing that and I think that's served us all very well, and we have a very regular rhythm, if you will, to looking at where we are from a total debt position and what it means in terms of the way both we're operating the company as well as what our overall capital structure looks like. So, we want to retain some flexibility in that regard; that's why I don't want to drive a stake in it at any one point in time. But, in general, I would just say our philosophy is, we want to make sure we're obviously respecting and treating our debt holders the right way. But we look for the right economic environment and circumstances to position our overall capital structure in a way that we think it creates the most value.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, Doug, I'll just mention that certainly we look to maintain more than a comfortable level of liquidity, certainly first looking at cash on the balance sheet and then beyond that additional credit capacity. But, I would say that we're very careful in looking at our expected cash flows in determining when and where we make those investments and maintaining a comfortable level of liquidity.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And that's important given the nature of our contracting business that we ensure that we've got access to adequate cash to deal with the ups and downs of the budget and the appropriation process, and I think we have a pretty good model for how to do that actually. It's a barely detailed model we use to project what our needs may be and add of course some risk factors to that. So I think in terms of cash on the balance sheet, our approach to managing that is serving us quite well.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But is that fair to say then that the level you're at right now is the level that you're comfortable with and I ask because as you finish this year and complete the 25% share repurchase effort, you look at the cash levels and the question we have is to think about what's the next step, whether you do beyond the completion of this current effort?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I appreciate that question as well Doug. It's clear to us that we are going to be, assuming that the growth continues in the factor that we foresee it, continue to be a very good generator of cash as we have been for a number of years. So, your question is a really important question with respect to cash deployment and I think it's appropriate to take a perspective on that now and just kind of layout where we are. As I said in my remarks, we're about 90% complete on the repurchase program that we announced back in the middle of 2013 and at that time you laid out the objective of repurchasing 60 million shares which turned out to be about 25% of our then outstanding shares.","So, right now obviously we're very focused on getting done what we said we would do and that's our primary focus for executing on that and the team is very focused on making sure we complete it. And this most recent program, while it's been at a higher run rate in terms of the rate that we purchase than our prior repurchase activities, it really is a continuation of the cash deployment strategy that we've had in place for a number of years and it goes directly to your question about cash generation and what do we with that. And as I said in my remarks, our priorities are the same today as they have been.","First priority, always invest in the business where we could see that we can get a good return on that investment, but we're also focused on managing the balance sheet and we're clearly focused on ensuring that we're paying a competitive dividend and we've generally been targeting that in the 30% to 40% range of pension adjusted earnings and then with the excess free cash flow we have been very proactive in returning that excess free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchase.","So as I again said in my remarks, I think that's working out well for us. In fact, it's been that way for quite some time if you turn the page back to a little bit over a decade ago, once we get this current program finished off, we will have retired about that \u2013 about half of the total shares we had outstanding a little over decade ago. So, you can take a look at how we've been doing over a long history of how we're deploying our cash and I think you can get the sense \u2013 we kind of like that strategy. We've been consistent I believe in both articulating that strategy and in executing the strategy.","So we don't have any new announcements to make today. I'm not in a place where we're going to say, okay after this program, it's done, here is what we're going to do. We're focused on getting this program, but I think you can judge by our past actions over a relatively long period of time how we assessed and act on our cash deployment priorities and to your point that cash deployment is supported by a very robust approach to cash generation. So, I hope that answers your question, perhaps in a little bit broader context than you asked it, but that's the way we're thinking about our company right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. It's actually Jon Raviv on for Jason. I was wondering if you could revisit some of those long-term margin targets by segment that Jim used to talk about and how they might be affected by some structural shifts in your business, i.e., more international and more aftermarket services linked to your platforms?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Happy to talk about that, I would say that I think our long-term objectives in terms of margin rates for the sectors continue to be relevant, and as we look at our business going forward, we see in some respects offsetting factors. We have some level of domestic development work that we see in front of us, and we have some more mature production work in terms of \u2013 particularly international opportunities, but other opportunities with E-3D and F-35 starting to ramp in those areas as well. So, we have a little bit of a mix in terms of \u2013 potentially lower margin development work and higher margin production and higher expectations on international. That should offset, and I think that's because of those factors that the objectives that we've laid out continue to be relevant.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would just add to that the numbers that we've talked about over time I think are still meaningful, those are benchmarks, benchmarks that we see as representative of the way the businesses can perform based on a marked view of where we've been and how the industry performs. Let me be clear, we incentivized our team to be better than the benchmarks and that's our core part of the strategy in the company. But as Ken pointed out, there are pressures in both directions whether it is the mix of development and production that we have pressing in one direction or the growth in international pressing in a different direction, but it's our job to manage all of those things. And as I said we measure ourselves on how well we do and that goes directly to the way our incentives work.","Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And as a quick follow-up on talking about services, services not necessarily linked to your platforms, how do you approach that portfolio in light of your competitor or one of your competitors suggesting they want out of that market?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But we've been a very active manager of our portfolio for many years now on both, I would say the products and the services sides of the company and I think that portfolio management has been working well for us. It's included taking a variety of actions, selling and spinning out businesses, as well as sometimes simply exiting some of our efforts through attrition. And those portfolios of actions have moved us largely out of the low margin commoditized service businesses. In fact, if you look at IS and TS where the majority of our service business resides, those sectors today are reporting operating margin rates in the range of 9% to 10%.","So I think that shows you what we've done already in terms of managing that part of our portfolio. I think it's also important to add that we see our remaining service businesses as really important in supporting our efforts with our products business. So, there is really good strategic alignment of the different parts of the business in that way. Just to give an example of that, if you look at the service businesses at IS and TS somewhere in the range of 80% to 85% of that service business is with our DoD and our Intel customers.","So we think we've found the balance and mix that's working well to support our broad strategy. We do of course continue to be active portfolio managers and we are constantly testing alignment or asking ourselves whether we're the best owners of each of these businesses and we also work hard just in a broader context to ensure that any decision that we make whether it's a decision to exit or a decision to retain any particular business that such a decision actually enables shareholder value creation based on the market conditions at the time. I think that's a really important part of the thought process.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Howard.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","How are you both \u2013 all three of you?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Since we're talking strategic, you guys do a nice \u2013 the company does a nice job of integrating airborne vehicles. And you look at opportunities and Sikorsky came on the market and there's elements that might very well fit with you. So could you elaborate on what some of the considerations you undertook \u2013 because clearly it does have a cash positive contribution to Lockheed now that they've acquired it?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Howard, I appreciate the question. We have a very strict policy that we adhere to that we don't give specifics on any particular transactional activity in the marketplace. But I think I can answer your question in a broad context. We are active and looking at a variety of things that come onto the marketplace. And to your point, we are very thoughtful and our very first thing that we go to is really fit with the strategic factor that we see our company on and how we see individual elements of both our current portfolio and anything that we're particularly looking at how we see those things fitting together to create value. Often times, we can see something that if you will from an architectural or engineering or how we sell something, we can see it fit together, but we can't get to the create value part, at least not in a relative sense to our other opportunities to deploy those resources that would be used in a particular transaction.","So we're strong adherents to that create value part of the equation and we're \u2013 as we look at a variety of different possibilities out there, we're just adamant that whatever we do honestly stacks up well against our other alternatives, so that's kind of the way we frame our thinking.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate both the discretion and the deliberate answer. Now, I want to just ask on operational question for a second.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","You've \u2013 there's a lot of money \u2013 well, there's an enormous amount of opportunity with the UCLASS program and the Senate has provided \u2013 basically has created you as, at least one of the viable opportunity or solutions there. Could you sort of discuss how you see some of the unmanned vehicle market playing out from here? I mean, you're clearly the leader and you clearly have some very nifty solutions and it's been an important part of your growth as you outlined in the quarter.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It is an important part of our growth. It's a very important part of our company and I honestly think we're still at the early stages of understanding collectively from a defense and security and perhaps even more broad perspective how unmanned systems and more broadly, I would say autonomous systems are over time going to play an increasing role and performing the missions that our nation and our allies need to perform.","On the target though of your question with respect to airborne unmanned systems, the growing recognition that the surveillance needs are continuing to expand and it's not a linear expansion, it's higher rate than that. Those needs are continuing to expand to address all these challenges that we're seeing around the world, really is a direct connect into the strength of what unmanned can bring; the ability to operate with persistence, the ability to use the extra capacity, if you will, of a platform that you obtain by removing the need to support a humanoid and replace that with mission capability, all of those things play very well.","And to the true effectiveness of these unmanned systems and as we've been demonstrating on Global Hawk, our ability to bring the operating costs down on these systems to a place where the cost equation is so incredibly attractive, I think is going to only continue to grow. As these systems grow and their operational utility, we'll be able to continue to bring down both the cost of creating the systems as well as the cost of operating these systems.","So we are at the early stage and I appreciate it that you mentioned UCLASS. UCLASS was a phenomenal set or UCAS, the predecessor to UCLASS. UCAS-D was a phenomenal demonstration of what these things can do, and it wasn't just the fact that we were able to both take off and land an aircraft on an aircraft carrier, this thing was a flying wing that we used to takeoff from land. And for those who are students of aeronautical engineering, you'll understand how much harder that is than just doing any aircraft. So this was quite a demonstration. And then to follow that up with a demonstration of the ability of UCAS-D to go up and get refueled in flight with a tanker, it's just a big big step forward that we're seeing in these systems.","So I believe we've got a lot in front of us. Where this will all go will be a mix not only of technology, but also of policy and operating doctrine, and sometimes those arenas are not as fast paced as the technology is. So I think we have to be thoughtful and recognize that there are a number of things that are going to pace it. But the work that's being done, for example, in the U.S. in terms of aerospace integration that the FAA has taken on, I think is another signal of the growing recognition of the importance of this class of technology. So I'm excited about where this is going. Our team is clearly excited. We are continuing to make sure that we're doing the right things to invest in this technology, both in terms of its development capability, but also in terms of our ability to produce it economically, and we see a bright future for unmanned systems.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. So, Wes, with your share repurchase, your net debt to EBITDA has increased from a very modest level to a slightly higher level, still comfortable. As you think beyond completing the announced share repurchase, what do you think the correct gross or net EBITDA, debt-to-EBITDA ratio is for the company? And how should we think about the potential for continuing the share repurchase after the current one is completed? Thanks.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi. Cai, let me kind of provide a similar perspective to the response I gave Doug on a similar, I know not exact question. In terms of looking at the variety of metrics, whether it's the amount of cash we want to maintain on our balance sheet to ensure the robustness of our operations, or if we're thinking about important metrics like debt-to-EBITDA, this is an ongoing process for the company. We take a very careful and thoughtful look at how our overall capital structure plays into what we're trying to achieve strategically as an enterprise and then what the consequential outcomes are for so many of these important metrics, and what those mean for our broader strategy and for, of course, our board and for our debt holders. We're very thoughtful on both fronts.","So, we haven't put out there any particular hard benchmarks on these things. We think it's important for us to be able to maintain some flexibility to deal with a changing environment that's out there, but we recognize our responsibilities to manage these things very carefully. And we are very, very mindful of all the elements of the different metrics and how they are understood and relate to the way that they have potential impacts for our shareholders and our debt holders.","So, with respect to share repurchase on a go-forward basis, as I mentioned earlier, we're proud of our history. Our look back on that of how we performed on it, I think is quite positive. And that history does inform our thinking about the future. And that's kind of where we are today as we move forward and have more to say on it. We'll certainly continue to be clear and to articulate our strategy. But we're comfortable with where we are today and it seems to make sense in today's environment.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Wes, should I take from your answer that how you approach it in the future will be heavily influenced by your success or lack thereof with the bomber competition?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We really haven't linked those types of broad strategy questions ourselves to individual programmatic outcomes. Cleary, when we look at the integrated impact of all of our programmatic positioning, we include all of those considerations in terms of our overall cash deployment strategy. As I mentioned earlier, our priorities forecast for deployment remain the same; investing in the business there's always first. If we can see an opportunity to invest and get a great return through those investments, that's where I like to put the first dollar. But we're very prudent about that as our criteria for applying that dollar is the same as if we were doing something else different. We look at where we can get the return, and part of the reason for being in business is to deploy cash inside the business and to generate great returns and we're doing that.","We see quite a few really good opportunities. You mentioned one of them. There are a number of great opportunities that we have in our company, and it's exciting actually to be in a place where we see such an array, both domestically and internationally, of opportunities. But that being said, as I indicated in an earlier response, we do anticipate very solid cash flows in our business, and we would expect that as we go forward, we're going to continue to have capacity to do a variety of things with those cash flows in alignment with those priorities that I've delineated.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","How are you, Sam?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Sam.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Wes, you kind of made a comment about the current situation with the budget resolution and starting with a CR and that's led you to not change your sales guidance. And I'm just trying to just think through, I wouldn't think you'd get that quick of a turnaround and just want to confirm if there is some sort of resolution or if they get money through OCO, is there any scenario where that ultimately would help you in 2015?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sam, I'm glad you asked the question, because I think it's important to clarify. When we are in a mode of a CR, particularly one that has on the back end of it a potential sequester, it's usually not so much the actual flow of dollars from an appropriation standpoint that impacts us in the near-term, it's more the way our customers are thinking about what might happen. And we've seen a little bit of this in past years when we were in a CR situation and there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether or not Congress would act with respect to removing the BCA caps or what the sequester implications might be. So this is more about our customers willingness to put things on contract or to allocate funds on existing contracts and we'll just kind of have to see what the environment looks like over the next number of months.","As always, we're making sure that we are planning for a variety of scenarios. So we don't expect to be caught short, if you will, in any respect with how things might play out. But that small extent of volatility that's represented sort of in the range of our guidance is our thinking around, if we see something similar at this time to what we observed a few years ago when there was this uncertainty of what could happen, when you are in a CR with a potential sequester at the end of it, I think it's prudent for us to be clear that there is some potential uncertainty in that regard.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. And then just on some of the changes within the segments and I guess for Ken is really if it looks like Aerospace is up, Technical Service is up, you get some sort of a cash benefit from the tax change that you're talking about. Is there anything that's on the negative side or is it those three items that really are affecting your free cash flow guidance for the year?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I would say Sam that in terms of cash flow guidance for the year, I think the cash we expect to generate from the sectors is pretty consistent with what we expected at the beginning of the year and the update to the cash flow guidance is primarily tied to our change in tax methods, which is going to result in lower tax payments for the full year of 2015.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","First, just sort of clarification \u2013 hey, the clarification on the lower share count. Is that buying more upfronts, lower dilution or are you going above and beyond the $60 million this year?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","For the most part that's buying little bit more upfront than we have planned Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. The question, maybe Ken is on the implied margin in the second half in both IS and AS respectively, 100 basis point plus sequential declines second half over first half and IS has some of that seasonality, AS generally doesn't, I heard you call it the one time in AS, but still it looks like there is more conservatism than not. Can you help us bridge that?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks, Myles. I appreciate the question. So we did increase guidance somewhat at both AS and IS largely based on the performance in the first half of the year. You mentioned IS had some help from risk retirements on a restricted program as we disclosed. And IS had some positive impacts from program completions and that's both in the first quarter and the second quarter. Also, I'll just mention that year-to-date margin rates for ES and TS approximate their 2015 guidance.","Other point I would make is that, our segment margin rate is approximately 12%, so it's not a point estimate at 12%. In terms of other thoughts, we do have the potential, as Wes has mentioned, for some customer behavior changes in the second half of the year, more likely to impact our short-cycle businesses, but we're keeping eye on that risk as we think about what our 2015 segment margin rate is. All that being said, we incentivize our team to perform on this, and several other metrics and certainly look forward to working with a team to continue to focus on managing risk and capturing opportunities in the second half of the year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with RBC Capital.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Robert.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hey.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Wes, you mentioned that you expect to expose this year to make up roughly 15% of sales. I was wondering how much of that is already in the backlog, and also where you think this percentage could hit, maybe hit into next year?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, in terms of the backlog, I think pretty much all of it is reflective in our backlog today. So, I think it's a fairly straight forward projection for this year. We're not guiding it to next year. All I would say though is, international continues to be a growing part of our business. We're excited about the opportunity space that's in front of us and I have in the past sort of clicked through some of those things that might give us the opportunity of your question just to remind everyone of kind of what we see out there. We've earlier this year announced already the Global Hawk in Korea and I see that as a really important first step in the growth of unmanned for our allies.","We have Japan very interested in Global Hawk. They made an announcement earlier of their interest. Australia, as well, has announced their interest in Triton. Germany is now taking a hard look at Triton as well. So the whole arena of unmanned, particularly in the surveillance space I think is going to be a very nice set of opportunities for us. I mentioned Japan, not only are they pursuing Global Hawk, they're also pursuing E-2D and E-2D is a platform. I believe we will see a number of opportunities emerge for us around the globe. It is a remarkable capability that Navy is very successfully deploying and utilizing, and I'm sure that a number of our allies around the globe are going to be quite interested in that.","Electronics, which historically has been our strongest business in terms of the fraction of its sales that are international, continues to see a lot of opportunities. The SABR program that we announced earlier in Taiwan is one that I think we're going to see some nice opportunities around the globe. Cleary, Korea, is one that is in the near term, more near term than some of the others, but I think that's representative of the breadth of abilities that ES is bringing to the international marketplace. And then both IS and TS have a variety of opportunities out there as well, whether we're talking about air defense systems or we're talking about sustainment opportunities or in some cases the cyber opportunities. So it's an important and growing part of our business and we're delighted to be able to serve our allies in a more robust manner.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And then, Wes, just to mention, to add on to that, I think that we have international opportunities, we also have a robust set of domestic opportunities as well depending, the international opportunities do at times take a little bit longer to turn into sales, so depending on what moves first, in terms of domestic, we talk about LRS, F-35 ramp up, E-2D ramp up. Depending on what moves first, you could see international growth with domestic growth out pacing it potentially in one year or another.","Wesley G.

Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So, I have just one question, but it's really kind of a two parter here. Wes, obviously the main focus right now on procurement is Long-Range Strike Bomber, but you recently teamed with L-3 and GD on JSTARS recap, which you mentioned by the way in your opening remarks. So, first thing, is the fact that, a bunch of teams has now been formed, any indication that the program is moving forward? If you could, can you give us some sense of a timeline and maybe size of the program that sort of thing? The second part is, if you mentioned T-X in your remarks, the new trainer, I missed it, but I thought you might give us an update on the program and your current thinking there? And in your answer if you could add any new initiative of the programs that you are focusing on now that I might have missed?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks in terms of Joint STARS, first let me start up by saying we're delighted to be able to team with both General Dynamics and with L-3 to pull together an offering that we think will just do an outstanding job of meeting the requirements and doing so in a very affordable manner. So, we're delighted with that partnership and looking forward to the competition.","The other competitors that have announced so far, my recollection of that is, both Lockheed and Boeing have announced their interest in this competition. So that'll make it a very good competition and we're looking forward to putting together a very competitive offering. The current state of play on Joint STARS is all public information. The Air Force has indicated that they're planning to award a development contract sometime in 2017. I think right now they're talking about towards the latter part of 2017 and then play it out from there in terms of getting to production or production representative aircraft and then roll that on into production over the course of 2020s.","So, we're focused on two things. Obviously, we have responsibility and accountability for maintaining and sustaining the current fleet of Joint STARS, but we're off the belief that the new program can move along as quickly and should move along as quickly as the Air Force can support it from a funding perspective, and in fact we think the nation would be served well by moving it along very quickly, because the technology is ready and it's a matter of integrating and getting the aircraft flying.","On T-X, that too continues to move forward. There we're delighted to partner with BAE Systems and I think as you may have read a little bit or seen some of the coverage in some of the industry trades, we're focused on a new development type aircraft, and we're looking forward to having a bit more to say about that in the coming months. But, we believe we'll be able to put forward a very compelling offering there as well. I would tell you that the Air Force has been indicating, continuing to indicate that T-X is an important priority for them, and that they're going to continue to be supporting that in their overall budgeting approach. So, we're looking forward to being able to compete on that, and provide I think a very compelling offering there as well.","Richard T.

Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Couple of just clarification details, Ken, on the AS performance in the quarter. I wondered if you could just sort of tell us which was the bigger grower in absolute terms, unmanned or restricted? And then, a second one on the in-theater force reductions in IS, which has obviously have come up in several quarters in your description, how much more downside do you see there for that business, and are we getting close to a bottom related to that? Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Carter, no problem. At AS, I would say, the largest driver for the quarter was unmanned in terms of top-line what drove the performance for the quarter. And then, your second question in terms of in-theater, the biggest in-theater impacts that we see are at IS and the ES, and we project about a $200 million reduction this year in-theater sales to, I think it's about $700 million for the year. And actually last year the bigger piece of that reduction was that IS. This year, the biggest piece of that reduction, probably two-thirds, is ES just as the different programmatic and programs that they have in-theater are ramping down. So that's where we see it for this year and $700 million is kind of the baseline for 2015, and beyond that we haven't yet, I would say, put pen to paper on what that would look like.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I'll stick to that.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Carter.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, Wes. Wanted to go back to capital allocation, but I'm not going to ask you what you're going to do next from a buyback perspective. But instead, ask you if the environment stabilizing here might make M&A a little bit more interesting, not talking about specific deals, but just your overall view about what's out there, especially given just the size of these very binary opportunities in front of you and dependent on how those might go.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think it's very possible that a shift in the environment may cause a variety of additional opportunities to become present in the marketplace, but for us the question would always be value and whether or not anything that we're looking at stacks up well relative to our other alternatives. As I've said in the past, and I feel that way today, when I look at our footprint here in the U.S., I really don't see a big burning hole in our portfolio in some way and that therefore puts us in a position where we feel really good about our portfolio. Our decisions are really genuinely going to be value based, and we really have to see the business case for something to make sense for us. So, the thrust of your question was whether there may be more opportunities coming into the marketplace, and yeah, there may very well be, the question will be how will they stack up relative to other alternatives.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Obviously, the value part of that answer makes a lot of sense. But considering just again you've been focused on the stock and that value equation has changed over time with your success with the stock, so can we at least assume that that hurdle rate for alternatives changes relative to your valuation?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think you have to look at all the alternatives. Clearly, we talked about our interest and our history on share repurchase. We also look at our dividend, but we also look at investing inside the company where we have a lot better insight into what the possibility of return is and we have a lot more ability to affect that outcome. So I didn't put all the words into the prior answer. I would add the word risk adjusted return. We really do think about the risk part of the equation as well when we think about overall value.","But as we go forward, we'll continue to look at what our long-term view is of the company's valuation. The answer to your question is, yes, clearly our share repurchase program has been a big part of our success in generating value for our shareholders, but history has not yet ended. We keep looking forward and are convinced that we have a lot of opportunity on a go-forward basis to continue to generate value, and we take that longer term view when we think about share repurchase. We're not just looking at the price as of today; we take a longer term view, and that served us really well. As I said, we've been at this now over a decade and our average price of repurchase over that decade looks really really effective compared to where we're trading today, and we think about our share repurchase program with that type of very long-term view.","Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Kaitlin, I think we'll do one more.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me on; I appreciate it.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Hunter.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning \u2013 well, good afternoon. I know we've talked about this, so I'll try and ask it a little bit different way. On long-range strike, in the event that you are successful, can you give us an idea of what type of incremental CapEx you might be looking at? And in the event that you're not successful, I know you said that you are not going to necessarily change the way you think about capital allocation per se in a vacuum, but would that change the way you think about M&A in the context of being maybe a buyer or a seller? Not necessarily would it raise the appetite to engage in it, but would it change the way you think about it? Thanks a lot.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Hunter. I'll take the first part of the question and turn it over to Wes for the second. In terms of capital, we've talked about the amount of capital expenditure that we expect to incur in 2015. We've talked about a number around $700 million. We think that's \u2013 at this point, we think that's a reasonable number of where we are for the year. And given what we've seen publicly about the timing of an LRS award, I don't think that impacts us significantly one way or the other. I would say that we don't provide guidance beyond 2015, but one way or the other as Wes mentioned we do expect to be strong generators of cash flow whether that's cash from operations or free cash flow as we project out beyond 2015.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Hunter on your question regarding whether a outcome on LRS would change our perspective on M&A, let me get to what I think is underlying some of the questions we're hearing in that regard and that goes to essentially the question of scale or top-line growth. And I'll say what I've said so many times in the past, we do not manage our company on the top-line. We manage the company based on value creation. In fact, over the last number of years, we've taken a number of actions that have very intentionally reduced our top-line, because we saw those actions as accretive to value and that's the way we're thinking about our overall value proposition.","So the question of \u2013 if we're not successful on one thing or another and perhaps that means our sales are not growing as quickly, do we try and make that up some way with M&A, that's not the way we think about it. What we do think about is look at each of the alternatives that we see that are available to us in one way or another, stack them up against our priorities, stack them up against risk-adjusted value creation opportunity and make our decisions on that basis and that's the way we're going to be doing.","Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. That concludes the call. I apologize we didn't get through the queue. I will be in my office for anybody who wants follow-up call. And with that, Wes, I'll turn over to you for final (59:04) comments.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Steve. I'll just wrap-up by saying what I said at the beginning of the call. Our team across the company is absolutely focused on performance, and that focus and commitment is really serving our shareholders, our customers, and our employees really, really well. And I'm very, very proud of what our team is doing, and how they are getting it done.

Movius","Thanks, Carla, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. We have provided a PowerPoint presentation for the second quarter, which you can access at www.northropgrumman.com.","Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements, pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially.","On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush","Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're very pleased with our second quarter results. They were achieved through the hard work and dedication of the entire Northrop Grumman team. As a company, we continue to focus on performance and effective cash deployment as major value drivers.","In the second quarter, these efforts drove a 9% increase in earnings per share and strong cash from operations and free cash flow. This quarter's EPS growth reflects solid sales, higher segment operating income and lower weighted average shares outstanding.","Second quarter sales were slightly higher than last year at $6.3 billion. Segment operating income increased 2%, and segment operating margin rate increased 20 basis points to 12.7%. Jim will provide more detail on the sales and margin rate trends, but the underlying drivers for this quarter's performance were higher sales and strong operating income and margin rates for our longer-cycle businesses: Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems. These positive trends were partially offset by budget-related top line pressure in our shorter-cycle businesses: Information Systems and Technical Services. Even considering that top line pressure, as I look across our businesses, all in all, it was an outstanding operating performance from our team.","As a result of our strong first half results, we are raising our sales guidance to approximately $24.3 billion, and we are raising EPS guidance to a range of $7.60 to $7.80. We continue to expect cash from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion. Guidance for both of these cash metrics is before discretionary pension contributions.","We continue to be focused on deploying cash to create long-term value. In May, we raised the dividend 11%, our 10th consecutive annual dividend increase. Our board also authorized an additional $4 billion for share repurchases. When we announced this new authorization, we indicated our goal of retiring approximately 25% of our then outstanding common stock or about 60 million shares by the end of 2015, market conditions permitting.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of stock for $489 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 12.6 million shares of our stock for approximately $900 million. We anticipate share repurchases will reduce 2013 weighted average shares outstanding by approximately 7%. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $4.6 billion remained in our share repurchase authorization.","In addition to share repurchases, during the quarter, we also made a $500 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans. We also raised $2.85 billion in new debt in the second quarter. We used $850 million of these proceeds to retire debt due in 2014 and 2015, resulting in $2 billion of net new debt. These transactions lowered our cost of borrowing, took advantage of historically low interest rates and allowed us to extend our weighted average debt maturity. The additional cash from this financing activity enhances our financial flexibility in today's dynamic budget environment.","We ended the quarter with a total backlog of $37.7 billion, which reflects gross new awards of $5.5 billion and 87% book-to-bill. Year-to-date, gross new awards totaled $10.3 billion for a book-to-bill of 83%. During the first half of the year, we received significant awards for programs such as F-35, Advanced EHF, Global Hawk, B-2 and the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye. Generally speaking, the pace of new awards continues to be impacted by the face of budget uncertainty. Understandably, this environment is producing fewer new awards and reducing spending on existing programs, particularly in our shorter-cycle businesses. While these businesses are experiencing more of an impact in the near term, we continue to see their longer-term value creation potential as integral to our company's efforts in C4ISR, Cyber and Logistics and Modernization.","Last month, the DoD provided Congress with information on how fiscal year 2013 sequestration reductions will be distributed across spending accounts and funding lines. At this point, we do not see major disruptions to our 2013 revenues, and the impacts that we are able to anticipate and quantify are reflected in our guidance.","Over the last several years, we've been proactive in positioning the company for a declining budget environment, and we continue to aggressively examine all elements of our cost structure. As I've said before, we believe that sequestration that's currently enacted will have serious negative consequences for our national security and will increasingly harm the defense industrial base over time.","While we won't be introducing '24 (sic) guidance until next year, looking ahead, we believe that reduced fiscal year 2013 budgets will result in lower 2013 awards and that the related impacts to company revenues, earnings and cash flows likely will trail reduced awards.","The President's proposed fiscal year 2014 budget is $50 billion, above the Budget Control Act Part II requirements. Unless Congress acts to modify the Budget Control Act, we expect fiscal year 2014 sequestration will be triggered in January of 2014, with so few congressional working days left until the end of this fiscal year and near-term agreement on 2014 appropriation seems unlikely. And we are currently planning for another continuing resolution and the potential for another round of sequestration.","While the budget environment is unpredictable and disruptive in the short term, we are positioning Northrop Grumman for the long term. That means continuing to focus on aligning our portfolio with the enduring priority areas of investment for global security, Unmanned, C4ISR, Cyber and Logistics and Modernization, along with manned military aircraft. It also means achieving and sustaining a high level of financial and program performance and effectively deploying our substantial cash resources to create value.","Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'd like to congratulate the Navy and the Northrop Grumman X-47B team on making naval aviation history. Over the last few weeks, the X-47B achieved several technical milestones. These achievements culminated in the first-ever fighter-sized unmanned aircraft demonstrating an arrested landing when the X-47B landed on the USS George H.W. Bush on July 10. The autonomous landing relied on computer-to-computer communications to establish the carrier's position and react to the dynamic variables associated with this type of landing.","Aircraft carrier landings are difficult, and these technical milestones demonstrate that the Navy's goal of operating unmanned systems safely and effectively from aircraft carriers is well on its way to becoming a reality.","Together with the Navy, we also achieved another major unmanned milestone in May with the successful first flight of the MQ-4C Triton. Triton is designed to allow the Navy to monitor significantly larger areas of the ocean with greater persistence than currently possible. Triton's first flight represents a critical step forward in supporting the Navy's future maritime surveillance mission around the world.","So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?","James F. Palmer","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My comments will focus on the second quarter and year-to-date results, as well as our 2013 guidance. As Wes said, this was another really good quarter. Our team continues to focus on performance and execution, and I personally want to add my appreciation for our team's continued focus and dedication.","Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems sales increased more than $200 million or 9%. The single largest driver was the higher F-35 volume. We have delivered 11 LRIP 5 units this quarter compared with no LRIP 5 deliveries in the second quarter of 2012. You will recall that with LRIP 5, the F-35 program transitioned from cost-to-cost revenue recognition to units-of-delivery accounting. We delivered the first LRIP 5 units in the third quarter of last year.","Unmanned revenue also continues to increase. While our Global Hawk program is maturing, we'll continue to ramp up another unmanned program such as NATO AGS and Fire Scout. Space revenues also increased due to higher volumes for AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope programs. Those increases in space were partially offset by lower volume for our restricted space programs.","AS operating margin increased 15% due to the higher sales and a $26 million increase in net favorable adjustments principally for space programs. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect AS 2013 sales of approximately $9.9 billion, with a margin rate of approximately 12%.","Expected second half revenues are modestly lower due to fewer F-35 deliveries in the third and fourth quarter of this year. During the first half of the year, we delivered 21 F-35 units, and 18 units are planned for the second half of the year.","Turning to Electronic Systems. Sales rose 2%. Higher revenue for international, tactical sensors and space programs more than offset lower volume in other product areas such as navigation, combat avionics, maritime systems, infrared countermeasures and laser systems.","Operating margin, on the other hand, increased 17%, and operating margin rate increased 240 basis points to 18.2%. The primary driver of the higher operating income is a $34 million increase in net favorable adjustments due to improved performance, principally in our marine and space programs. The remainder of the improvement reflects higher overall margin rates resulting in part from last year's favorable adjustments.","Based on year-to-date performance, we now expect Electronic Systems sales to increase to at least $7.1 billion, with an operating margin rate in the low 16% range. Revenue guidance includes the continued ramp-up in international and space volume, and margin rate guidance anticipates a lower level of favorable adjustments than in the first half of the year.","Transitioning to Information Systems. Second quarter sales declined 9%. The transfer of intercompany efforts associated with our -- some of our internal activities to enterprise shared services, as well as some modest portfolio shaping, accounted for $33 million of the decline. Excluding the transfer and the portfolio shaping, sales declined about 7%, with lower volume across a broad number of programs.","IS operating income declined as a result of the lower sales, a $27 million reduction in net favorable adjustments, commercial contract revenue timing and mix results from the ramp-down of several in-theater fixed price contracts.","Rather than looking at second quarter's 8.3% operating margin rate, Information Systems' year-to-date operating margin rate of 9.3% is more instructive as an indication of ongoing performance.","As we mentioned last quarter, our guidance for IS had some modest downside risk to sales given the sequestration and general budget impacts. So as a result of those trends, our guidance now contemplates sales of approximately $6.6 billion for Information Systems, and we now expect a low-to-mid 9% operating margin rate, essentially consistent with the year-to-date margin rate.","Moving to Technical Systems. Second quarter sales declined 8%, with operating margin declining 7%. Lower ICBM and KC-10 volume impacted sales by about $40 million, and portfolio shaping impacted sales by an additional $20 million. The operating trend is consistent with sales, and operating margin rate is roughly comparable to last year. For 2013, we continue to expect sales of approximately $2.7 billion, with a mid-to-high 8% operating margin rate.","So on a consolidated basis, second quarter segment operating margin rate improved 20 basis points to 12.7%, primarily due to the $25 million increase in net favorable adjustments in the quarter. That improvement largely came from Aerospace Systems and Electronic Systems and then partially offset by lower net favorable adjustments in Information Systems and a smaller amount in Technical Services.","Total operating income increased 4% due to the higher segment operating income and lower corporate and allocated expenses. Second quarter interest expense increased $9 million, reflecting the 1 month of interest on the $2.85 billion of new debt and a weighted average coupon of 3.3%.","At the end of June, we used $850 million of those debt proceeds to retire the debt that was maturing in 2014 and '15. These actions lowered our weighted average borrow cost by 11% from 5.3% to 4.7% while increasing the weighted average life of our debt portfolio by 40% from 4.8 to 13.6 years. For modeling purposes, the net impact of these actions will increase our 2013 interest expense on a year-over-year basis by about $45 million, with most of that increase occurring in the second half of the year.","Turning to cash. Before the $500 million discretionary pension contribution, year-to-date operations generated approximately $740 million of cash, generally consistent with prior year results at the midpoint of the year.","Free cash flow, on the other hand, before the discretionary pension contributions, totaled $692 million for the quarter, and year-to-date free cash flow is $653 million, also consistent with last year.","At this point in time, we are maintaining our 2013 cash flow guidance. As many of you know, our cash flows are traditionally weighted towards the second half of the year -- heavily weighted, I might add, with lots of variation around the timing of year-end cash receipts. Given our lack of experience or knowledge regarding how the furloughing of government employees may impact the timing of payments in the second half of the year, we are maintaining our current cash flow guidance. As we gain more experience regarding whether or not the furloughs will have any impact on the timing of payments, we'll consider whether we need to change our cash flow guidance for this year. But in any case, I expect this is only a matter of timing.","I also wanted to point out a couple of items that you'll see in our 10-Q. Total backlog at June 30 reflects the gross new awards of $10.3 billion and a $1 billion reduction in Information Systems' total backlog, primarily to reduce unfunded backlog for expired periods of performance on active contracts, including TASC orders on ID\/IQ contracts.","TASC orders are structured to provide the customer with significant contract flexibility. As such, even when TASC orders are awarded and they become part of our backlog, there remains some degree of variability around execution of the entire TASC order amount. We continually review our backlog of contracts to provide a reasonable depiction of the future work that they generate.","You also see in our 10-Q that we reached a tentative settlement with the IRS for tax audit years 2007 through 2009. If approved by the joint committee on taxation, the settlement would reduce our income tax expense by up to $50 million. As the approval and the timing are uncertain, the potential benefit of the settlement is not included in our 2013 guidance, which at this point assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 33%.","And finally, several of you have written reports regarding how the recent rise in interest rates could impact 2014 pension expense and funded status of our pension plans. So I think it's important that I provide some data on the potential impacts for our plans, if the 2014 assumptions -- pension assumptions were to be set at the end of the second quarter.","As all of you know, that's not the case. Actual assumptions will be set based on year-end interest rates and planned asset returns for the year. But if I were to use the 10-year treasury yield as a proxy, the discount rate would likely have increased by about 75 to 80 basis points from the end of last year. So while higher interest rates could improve our funded status to around 90% or so from the 83% level that we had at the end of last year, they also reduce returns on the fixed income and international portions of our investment portfolio.","As of June 30, planned asset investment returns were approximately 50 basis points. Year-to-date returns largely reflect the impact of the higher interest rates on the fixed income and international portions of the investment portfolio, partially offset by strong market returns on the domestic equities portion of the portfolio. To remind everyone, every 100-basis-point difference in asset investment returns from our assumed 8% investment return for our long-term rate of return assumption changes 2014 FAS expense by about $45 million. And every 25-basis-point change in the discount rate from our assumed rate of 4.12% at the end of last year changes 2014 FAS expense by about $85 million. So if I were to use the June 30 discount rate and asset returns as the basis for setting 2014 FAS expense at this point, 2014 FAS expense would likely be comparable to this year's FAS expense of about $380 million or about $65 million higher than we anticipated at the beginning of 2013. I should also point out that with those same assumptions, based on the June 30 numbers, our required cash contributions would remain under $100 million for 2014.","Lastly, I think, again, I should remind you that pension assumptions, including those related to CAS, are set at the end of the year based on actual year-end interest rates and asset returns. And I know as a number of you know, if we look back into the past, a lot can change between now and then. But I did want to provide you with some sensitivities for modeling purposes.","So Steve, with that, I think we're ready for Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] Carla, we're ready to begin the Q&A process.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm interested in electronics, where you again had a very impressive margin. And it just feels like after that 6 quarters in a row, that upward adjustments, because of good contract performance, it's just -- it's become almost routine. And when you look forward, and certainly, with your guidance, you're looking at lower margins for the rest of the year. But where are you in electronics and do how you think about performance improvement, cost reduction? I guess, I'm wondering, what inning are we in, in terms of being able to continue to improve the performance of these programs and deliver the kinds of margins that we've seen over the last several quarters?","James F. Palmer","Doug, I don't know that I would say we're in an inning. We're on a treadmill, and you got to continually run as fast as the treadmill is going. So we are really focused on that. We have had, frankly, the benefit from a much -- from a number of cost reduction actions we've taken on our backlog with, as well, a number of programs nearing completion, given the -- somewhat as a draw-down. So really good, hard work by the Electronic Systems folks. A lot of focus on being prudent about new contracts that we entered into, all of which are being realized at this point in time. At times, I get asked about our benchmarks for the businesses. I do think that this is a 13-, 14-plus type of business on a long-term basis, but we are realizing some benefits from hard actions that we've taken over the last couple of years.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, Doug, this is Wes. I just -- I can't resist the opportunity just to say how much hard work is actually going on in Electronic Systems. There's a team that is just completely focused on performance and in all dimensions. And if you turn the clock back a number of years, you'll recall that we went through some pretty challenging times in Electronic Systems with, in particular, some international contracts that just simply did not perform very well. And to their credit, that team has top to bottom learned that set of lessons really dug in on contract performance, really dug in on cost management. And they're just doing an outstanding job. As Jim points out, clearly, we're getting the benefit of cost reductions, which flow into existing contracts. As we enter into new contracts, that certainly is an effect we won't see forever. But given your question, I just can't help but reflect on the journey that we've been on Electronic Systems and really complement the team for their extraordinary work.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And just related, we're also seeing you deliver some really good aerospace margins. Are those more linked to specific programs such as F-35 maturing? What's driving that?","James F. Palmer","I would say, Doug, it's across the broad portfolio of products in aerospace.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, I don't think F-35 is quite yet at a point of maturity where I would say that was a big driver for us. But if you look across the portfolio in aerospace, to Jim's point, particularly our manned programs, more legacy manned programs, and also our space program, have been doing very, very well. Unmanned is still earlier in the evolution of things moving into production, so they're probably not quite as far up that curve. But, again, really good performance, really good focus on cost management.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, I wanted to ask you just a couple of quick questions on cash. You mentioned that there's some conservatism in your outlook here for 2013 in light of the furloughs. Can you give us a little bit of flavor of how much conservatism you've baked into that? What kind of cushion are you affording yourself? And then, Wes, you made a comment about the impacts of sequester around in 2014 with regard to revenues, profitability and cash flows, suggesting that they would be under some pressure. But I did want to just dive a little bit further into some of the moving things on cash, such as the discretionary contribution that you may or may not make next year and then cash recovery rates going up. I just want to make sure that your comments were excluding other dynamics that are going on with cash flows and that we won't necessarily see negative pressure overall on cash flows as we move into 2014.","James F. Palmer","I don't think we'll see negative pressures, Jason, on cash flows as we move into 2014. And I did not say conservative guidance. Those were your words.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Those are my words.","James F. Palmer","I was trying to emphasize that we always have substantial variation around cash receipts at the end of the year, in particular, frankly, as the industry manage its cash flows. And those last day cash receipts can easily vary by $200 million, $300 million, just based on what's happening in the overall industry. So on one hand, yes, there can be some variation around receipts, particularly in the last couple of days of the year. I don't know how to call what may or may not happen with the furloughing of government employees and whether it has any impact at all on cash receipts. So it just seemed premature at this point to bet on potentially higher cash receipts this year. As I said in our prepared comments, I do think this is only a matter of timing, maybe only a matter of timing of days. But I think there could be some rises [ph] of variability of cash receipts, and it could be greater this year simply because of the environment that we're in.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, Jason, it's Wes. I just -- I would add. I think what we're all worried about in different ways is what the real impact will be of this furloughing of the civilian workforce. It was just the other day that Secretary Hagel had to basically say, \"Look, if this keeps going, we may be furloughing in the next fiscal year as well.\" And if anybody thinks that, that has no impact, they are not thinking about it with a clear head. It's -- the civilian workforce is an integral component of how our defense and national security infrastructure operates. And it's not just paying the bills. It's manning centers, running intelligent centers, it's -- you name it. Our civilian workforce is extensively deployed throughout the national security framework. So I do think that there is some concern about what that means as we continue to experience this. These are really important people doing really important jobs and trying to predict exactly what the impact of these furloughs will be. It's a very difficult thing. So I think what you should take away from it is sort of an expression of a risk factor, if you will, that's out there in some respect. But as Jim said, ultimately, it's a matter of timing. It's not a matter of do we get paid or not, it's a matter of timing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Wes and Jim, you're not afraid to do something that's unconventional. And so sort of 2 questions. One is, why, with what you've defined as sort of an uncertain environment, how you provided an element of certainty with respect to your share repurchase program?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, Howard, let me say a few words about that. I'm sure Jim would be happy to join in as well. We've tried to be as clear as we can over these last few years about the way that we see the value creation opportunity in our company. And clearly, it all rests on performance and improving how we've been doing over the years in executing on our contracts and delivering on our commitments to our customers. Everything starts there. And I'm really proud of how our team has been working so hard over these last number of years to demonstrably improve our performance. We're not perfect, we still have a lot of work to do and we're pressing in every corner of the enterprise to go after that in terms of program execution and cost management, you name it. It's across the board. But the other thing that we've been, I think, pretty clear about is the importance of the way in which we pull our capital in creating value. And obviously, it takes a number of forms, whether we're making long-term investments in our pension plan, which ultimately do add value over the long term; whether it's increasing our dividend, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we've taken a very long and steady approach to year-after-year consecutive dividend increases; or whether it's been about share repurchase. And the interesting thing about share repurchases, obviously, we do that when a market condition is permitting in the market from quarter-to-quarter. And we often get the question of, \"Gee, is this just something that you guys are doing right now? Or do you see this a continuing part of your strategy?\" So as we thought about that question, and we took a hard look at our forecast on a go-forward basis, and as you might imagine, we looked at it in a variety of scenarios in terms of what might happen in the budget arena and programmatic decisions. But as we looked across that range of scenarios, we developed a great degree of, I wouldn't say comfort, you can never be comfortable in running a business, but yes, I would say we developed a great degree of confidence that the cash flows in our business supported taking the action that we took, which was to be clear about where we see ourselves going so that there wasn't this sort of constant question about what are we going to be doing. We indicated what our goal is, and we laid that out there. And we're off executing on it. So we found it just to be an important part of our continuing dialogue with our shareholders about the way we think about creating value, and that really is the essence of our thinking. Jim?","James F. Palmer","Obviously, Wes, I would echo exactly what you said. The only thing I would add -- remember, folks, that we announced our share repurchase, and then about a week later, we also announced that we would go on to the capital markets for our debt transaction. Having made those decisions, we thought it was important that we communicate both pieces of the decision. So all of the information was out there for the market in its entirety. So clearly focused on driving shareholder value, see a significant opportunity there, but also try to be very transparent with all of the market on what our intentions were.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I -- no, I understand that. And it makes -- it's just you have been so conservative to be -- to step out like this clearly underscores your confidence or your, I guess, your confidence in the outlook. And then related to that, I'm sure this wasn't lost on U.S., is that Cisco yesterday bought Sourcefire for something like 7x revenues. And there's a whole host of your cyber business and other things that clearly operate in some of those same markets. How do you react to something like that?","Wesley G. Bush","Clearly, we watched very carefully what's going on in that whole market space, because as you point out, Howard, we have some extraordinary capabilities in addressing elements of that market. One difference, obviously, is we continue to focus on the very high end of the cyber arena to help our nation address the big challenges that we're facing in that regard. We've not put a huge energy into sort of the commercial side of that. And so there is some difference in sort of market perspective and how different companies look at those things. But I would tell you that just if I were standing in Cisco's shoes, I can understand what they're doing. This was an important area. I think it just continues to grow in challenge and complexity. And as we've talked about a little bit on our calls in the past, there's several different aspects of the flavors of cyber, if you will, from -- ranging from the sort of the purer traditional perspectives on cyber to, increasingly, the view on what actually needs to get embedded in the hardware, if you will, the capabilities. And from our perspective, that might be platforms or sensors, but it might also be networking equipment and other things. So I think it's just a representative example of how this issue is becoming more and more pervasive...","James F. Palmer","Growing importance.","Wesley G. Bush","It is. It's an absolutely critically important perspective on its growing importance. And I think we're going to continue to see it become a part of just about every aspect of the technology landscape that we all rely upon to make our world work the way it works today. So from my perspective, this was just another indication of the importance of this arena.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wes or Jim, my comment -- or my question is on backlog. So backlog is down. I'm focused on funded, and I understand the issue in IS in the unfunded area. But just focusing on funded, you're down about 10% year-to-date and sort of in equal amounts in Q1 and Q2. Some other companies' backlog has tended to be a little bit more seasonal than yours. Yours doesn't seem to be as much so. But obviously, market conditions are tough. So wondering if you could comment on where specifically you think you might end up the year on funded backlog. And then maybe, Wes, if you could just go through each of the businesses quickly, particularly AS and ES, and comment on what the major moving parts might be.","Wesley G. Bush","No, I would just -- I think I addressed this a little bit on our last quarterly call, kind of trying to call it for the end of the year on backlog. I wouldn't do it at this point. There are so many variables out there that are shaping not only the decision space but what I would call the behavior space of our customer community. Many of our customers are just very, very concerned about decisions they make this year, having to flow through into the next few years, and they're kind of holding back, waiting to see what may or may not happen. And I understand that behavior. I understand that difficulty in making decisions when, in fact, they're getting asked to turn out a whole new idea on budget every few weeks. They're getting put through an enormous number of what-if cycles. I actually admire how they're handling this in light of all of the challenges that they're facing. So where this all comes out and how that will translate into specific contracting behaviors over the course of this year, it's really hard to tell. So I wouldn't want to get in front of our headlights on that and try and call it. But what I would say is that it has put an emphasis within our company on working with our customers to really help understand where things need to get put on contract to actually reduce cost, because as we all know, the longer things take, oftentimes, that means there is additional cost induced by that delay in getting things on contract. So it's an intense source of effort across our enterprise to work with our customers to try and balance out the challenge that they are dealing with, as well as what it takes to maintain the cost of the systems and to make sure that things are operating as efficiently as they can in this environment, which is inherently inefficient. So I won't call it, at this point, on what the outlook will be for the end of the year, just given the number of variables in front of us. But I would emphasize the degree at which it has the attention of the enterprise and working it. You asked for AS and ES. The vast majority of our revenues, certainly, this year, like most other years, come from contracts already awarded. So it's not so much a big swinger on what our financial outcomes are this year. And to the extent that we're aware of any, we've already included that in the guidance -- the updated guidance that we provided today. As we look across the landscape, there are a number of activities, sort of new contract award activities, that are out there that will certainly impact the total -- or could impact the total awards number for the year. The challenge we continue to see in the awards environment, as you know, is you get an award and it gets protested until you kind of hold back on that. But when I look at both AS and ES, they continue to have large opportunities, competitive opportunities, in addition to the ongoing award cycles in front of them. And it's both domestic and international that -- where we see those opportunities. One of the things that we pointed out, I think, on our first call this year was our outlook for 2013 as an increasing international content in our business. International always takes longer than you hope it might, but we do see it on a positive trajectory in the enterprise. So I hope that helps to some extent. I know I didn't answer your question quantitatively, but I don't feel we're in a position to do that right now.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I do understand that. Maybe just if you could give -- if you characterize one part of this, which is the uncertainty that you have and the reason you don't want to answer the question yet. Is it more the competitive items that are out there? Or is it the timing of the follow-on items, whether they flip out of the year or not?","Wesley G. Bush","It's both. Even the follow-on things are being slowed down just because the system is operating more slowly. So it is both aspects of that. And on the follow-on things, obviously, in general, it's usually not a matter of whether it's going to happen. It's usually a matter of when. But as the customers are going through their internal debates on priorities, it is challenging for them to go on and get out there with those decisions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Loomis with Stifel, Nicolaus.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Looking at Information Systems, so looking at the backlog write-down, just tell me if I'm looking at this right, if I had it back to second quarter backlog, it says that you had roughly a one-to-one book-to-bill in Information Systems in the second quarter. Am I looking at that right?","James F. Palmer","Will, I don't recall the numbers, but I think it was around 90%.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So, I mean, that's still a very good number given awards...","James F. Palmer","A lot of gross awards, yes.","Wesley G. Bush","Gross awards, yes.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. That's a good number considering that award activity has been relatively light. What does that say -- what prompted you to write down the backlog and then you obviously had good awards in the second quarter?","James F. Palmer","We try to, on an ongoing basis, look at our backlog. And as you might imagine, the most variability is in the shorter-cycle business, particularly in those areas that have ID\/IQ contracts, which, by their very nature, provide some level of flexibility or variability on the actual amount of revenue that you recognize from each of those individual TASC orders. Just to reiterate, ID\/IQ means indefinite delivery, indefinite order. So there's variability associated with it. So yes, in this environment, we try to look at any kind of activity that may have potential for an adjustment, and we make those as soon as we know about them.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And to be clear, you are putting feeling in that figure before? You were just looking at awarded TASC orders, and that's what you wrote down?","James F. Palmer","Correct. Correct.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then any -- and you had good awards in the second quarter there. What do you see in the second half? I mean, typically, we see in the September quarter on the short cycle side pretty robust period. Is there anything that you've seen to date that you think differently about that?","James F. Palmer","I think we all have been speculating about what might happen here at the last quarter of the government fiscal year, but it would be simply that, speculation. And so I think I'll just leave it as we have that issue every year. Will it be different this year? It's really hard to say whether or not it will be any different.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then separately, just -- if you can just review on Global Hawk specifically, just the different variants where we stand now, not in terms of where Congress is but where you are in terms of production and revenue and kind of visibility based on what's funded in hand now.","Wesley G. Bush","So on Global Hawk, the kind of remaining issue out there is the Lot 11 [ph], the Block 30, and we're in active discussions with the Air Force on that.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","But you're still completing prior orders?","James F. Palmer","Yes.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, absolutely. Yes.","James F. Palmer","Yes, not finished.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that will continue -- you have visibility on that through '14 completing those orders?","Wesley G. Bush","There's a staging of what those orders look like, some this year, some over next year, but there's really been no change in that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So the one pattern I think we're seeing in the industry is that short-cycle businesses, the revenues are under more pressure, generally. Margins are under more pressure, and the weapon systems seem to be basically knocking it out of the park. As those longer-cycle businesses come under more pressure, should we expect greater pressure on your margins? So to the question of the margins just continue to get better and better beyond everyone's expectations, what's it going to take to continue that? If we do see sequester impact on the top line, will that start to throttle those margins back? Is that the key variable?","James F. Palmer","Cai, as I think about this, the nature of our business is both some longer-cycle and shorter-cycle businesses. In the longer-cycle businesses, as Wes alluded to earlier, we have the ability to work off of our backlog. And to the extent that we don't have any unexpected surprises, so program cancellations or terminations, the nature of the contracting process normally provides you with some visibility on where the customer intends to go in the future. My point simply is, in those types of businesses, you have a longer period of time to react to what may occur. We also made a comment -- had made a comment for a number of quarters now that we've been conscious about trying to take cost reduction actions in advance of where we thought the market, our customer was going. And so we've realized that benefit on our existing contract backlog. As we negotiate new contracts, they will be negotiated based on our current cost structure, and it will be harder to maintain the margins that we are realizing today out of the existing backlog. That's the natural ebb and flow of the business.","Wesley G. Bush","Cai, I would also offer one other perspective. It's perhaps a little bit tangential, but I think it's important in a broader view. The nation took a procurement holiday for strategic systems in the 1990s. Over the last decade, we've been largely focused on dealing with the issues surrounding terrorism around the globe and have really not still been able to recapitalize our platform infrastructure in any meaningful way. We have an aging platform capability as a country. And we are going to have to replace that. Things just don't last forever. And so if there is any forcing function to continue a support for, I think, kind of the class of weapons capabilities that you were mentioning, I think that's actually an important strategic one. Now what will the sequester do to that? And what decisions might the department be forced to make? Hard to tell. But that is a real force that's out there right there today. And I think it needs to be understood as a driving factor in the decision space here.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But essentially, what you're referring to is whether or not we're going to have more production programs as the mix, more production programs than development programs?","Wesley G. Bush","Exactly right. Exactly right.","James F. Palmer","[indiscernible] point in time.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Wes, I wanted to ask, not really ask, but just get your perspective on this EAC question and margin issue a different way and sort of apply it to capital deployment. I wonder what the observation of the improvements you've seen in performance over the last couple of years now tells you about what the performance must have been 3 to 5 years ago, which is sort of the last time these stocks were at these levels. And when you think about in the intrinsic value of these companies, Wes, we get several of both your stock, the stocks of your peers at levels that are now once again on all-time highs. How do you think about the intrinsic value of the firm and that of your peers now that you've improved the performance? I mean, obviously, the profit policy hasn't changed. The budget's lower. So does it sort of make the case that, intrinsically, the companies were much poorer at their old prior highs and now they're much better and it still makes a lot of sense to buy back stock here? I'm just interested in your perspective.","Wesley G. Bush","You have to look at it, I think, from a number of different angles. Clearly, the marketplace makes some decisions around EBITDA multiples. And if you kind of look at that historically, I think that's illuminating. And I know a number of folks on the call that looked at EBITDA versus EBITDAP as better predictors over time. But if you look at that historically, you'd say, \"Well, we're probably actually in a reasonable place with the value opportunity that's still in front of us.\" So when we think about share repurchases, and I've said this a number of times on our calls. We think about it over the long term, the long-term value of the enterprise, how we see ourselves generating cash, how we see ourselves with the ability to deploy that cash both internally to create longer-term value and directly to the benefit of our shareholders. And all of those things go into our thinking around the core economics of doing share repurchase. Obviously, we've concluded it makes sense. We've been pretty vocal about that. And it actually stated a goal for where we would drive our share repurchase activities here through the -- over the next couple of years. So everybody takes a little bit of a different view on this, but I think you can be informed by looking at it from a couple of different angles. But fundamentally, it comes back to how you see the long-term performance and portfolio of the enterprise and how that aligns with the nation's needs and the needs of our allies. And that's really the core of our thinking.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And do you think it's correct to say that it implies that the understanding of what performance was possible 5 years ago, let's say, is very different today than what it was then?","Wesley G. Bush","I'd hate to try and Monday morning quarterback what happened a number of years ago in the marketplace. I know there were a lot of different factors in play then, but all I can do is sort of snapshot my view of where we are and what I think our future looks like. And that's really the framework for decision-making.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can we focus a bit on the specific of the F-35? And obviously, you moved into LRIP 5 here. It's adding nicely, too, on the top line. It presumably is not dilutive to the margin either. So I was hoping you could comment. 5, 6 and 7, I think, are roughly the same quantities. It would imply that you're not going to have much of a revenue growth rate, but I'm curious of the margin potential over the next several LRIPs. Is there a lot of margin potential, number one? And the second piece of it is, how much of those contracts are fully definitized at this point?","Wesley G. Bush","So Myles, let me say a few words, and then -- and Jim certainly can add in. And you're right, the LRIPs are pretty flat in terms of the number of units being built. So I think over the next near-term period of time, we're going to see F-35 continue to kind of be where it is. And we're still in LRIP land, obviously. We're not into whole rate production and the multi-year productions. And so inherently, the margin rates during development and even LRIP are not what the potential margin rates could be later on as we move forward into the program. I hope we're going to be able to start up that curve in a more meaningful way, but we do have to get all the things done that are necessary at this stage of the program to be able to achieve that. I think we're making really good progress on this program. And I would give credit to Lockheed Martin. I think they're doing a great job as the prime on this. I think we have a really good team with Lockheed and Northrop and BAE Systems and Pratt & Whitney all together on this. We are working together on it in a very, I would say, highly aligned, team-oriented way with our customer community. So I am of a mind that this program is making really good progress, and I'm proud to be on this team. I think it's got some really good future in front of it. Now, how does it get interfered with potentially by all of this budget challenge that's in front of us? I don't know. That's a hard one to call. But the job we have in the industry is to continue to drive to make it more affordable and to demonstrate the extraordinary capabilities of this aircraft and that alignment with what not only the U.S. needs but all of our partner nations need. And I see an increasing alignment around that on this program. So number one, really important, but as you point out, these LRIPs are sort of going to hold us flat for a while until we can get up a more substantial production curve. And over time, I would hope to see the margins come with that.","James F. Palmer","Just to add, Myles, based on the planned quantities that we see ahead of us for all the LRIPs, we really don't see F-35 revenues ramping until about 2016. And as Wes just said, the team's -- the entire team's focus is really on driving affordability, how do we get unit cost down. We all recognize that that is going to be an important factor in being able to realize the quantities that are ahead of us. So a lot of focus on how to drive affordability, reduce cost, improve performance, deliver on time.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the margin potentially across the 3 LRIPs, is it roughly the same? Or is there pressure to the downside as you move out at flat quantities and customer wanting lower prices?","James F. Palmer","I wouldn't -- I don't know that it's worthwhile commenting on margins by individual programs at this point in time. We're really working hard to drive...","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, this is really about -- this is about affordability.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to go back to the share repurchase conversation, a little bit more just on the mechanics of that in the near and medium term. So when you announced it, you had said you could issue debt to buy back stock at a faster rate. You've then added some debt not long after that. Was that what you're referring to? Or could we see more balance sheet capitalization changes? And then given you did that, should we look for a faster pace of buyback in the back half of the year? Should we specifically be looking for ASRs? Anything you can give to help us there would be great.","James F. Palmer","We make all of those decisions essentially every quarter. And looking at the pace of our share repurchase program, we did, as you pointed out, go to the capital markets and raised some additional debt and net of $2 billion to increase our overall financial flexibility. We could use some of that cash for accelerating share repurchases, but essentially, our message was around the -- our goal to reduce our share count by about 60 million shares or 25% by the end of 2015. Make it real simple. That's 11 quarters, kind of like 5.5 million shares per quarter on a pro rata basis. And we can do that on a pro rata basis. We can do it on an accelerated basis. We have the flexibility, the financial resources to think about what makes the most sense and each time that we address a new program. Could we do ASRs? Yes, it's a possibility. It's something that we look at on a regular basis to see whether or not we make -- whether it makes sense. No commitment to any kind of formal transaction at this point in time.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is it pro rata that's in the updated 2013 earnings guidance?","James F. Palmer","The guidance for 2013 was based on weighted average share reduction of 7%. We still expect to get a 7% reduction. On a weighted average basis, it's going to be really hard, given that we're halfway through the year to having meaningful change in that average for the year. So I still feel really good about the overall 7% reduction for the year. Our guidance anticipates that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to IS, a follow-on to Bill's question earlier, and the discussion about short cycle. Wes, in the past, you've characterized your IS business as being a little less commoditized perhaps than others, but it seems like the pressure is still pretty strong there. And particularly on the margins, Jim, you did mention fewer EACs and a couple of other things, but is this a trend that continues? I know you've said the margins reverse a bit here in the second half, but we really -- we haven't bottomed here in the short-cycle pressure. So how should we think about this going forward and into next year?","Wesley G. Bush","So Rob, let me make a little bit of a distinction because I think sometimes this gets lost in the communication. When we talk about commoditized, we talk about the way the market operates. So if there are many players, and it is essentially a race to the $0.05 or to the $0.01 contract-by-contract, that's commoditized. That means that you're really having difficulty competing on the basis of technical differentiation or knowledge or intellectual property. That's the framework we mean with commoditized. Short cycle, some commoditized businesses, most commoditized businesses probably are short cycle, but those 2 are not fully overlapping circles in the Venn diagram. When we think about short-cycle businesses, we mean those business which inherently have shorter-term contracts. Those may or may not be commoditized. In fact, many of our short-cycle businesses are businesses that take extraordinary engineering skills to perform, rely on our ability to provide intellectual property and an experience base that simply is not commoditized. But yet, they are still short cycle by nature of the way that customer buys. So I just would want to make sure that those 2 don't get confused in the dialogue. And we have, in fact, moved away and have been doing this now for a number of years from those businesses that we see as more commoditized, because we don't see that that's necessarily a place where it makes sense for us to invest a lot of our time and energy and resources. We have focused in IS and more across the board in those areas where the differentiation occurs on the basis of the intellectual capital that can be brought to whatever the particular competition might be, which inherently shrinks the field of competitors. And, in fact, if you look at that smaller field that we tend to go after more on the system side of this, I think you'll see in the marketplace that has all of these earnings releases have been coming out, they were all kind of having the same experience, that because a lot of that type of capability is purchased on these ID\/IQ contracts, the customer has a lot of flexibility to throttle up or throttle down. And given the budget uncertainties, we're seeing more throttle down than throttle up in that space right now. So from a strategic perspective, we're on the track that we've talked about. We continue to focus our portfolio in the areas where we see our ability to be differentiated as creating longer-term value. But we're going through a budget environment that is, for these shorter-cycle components of that, causing this type of variation.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Wes, are you saying that what we're seeing here in IS is not pricing-related? Because it's not -- this is about demand in volume and periods of softness.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, I would characterize it as a market condition, not so much a competitiveness perspective, because the work that we've been doing in IS, I'm convinced, has us in a very competitive position. So it's more about what we're seeing in the market.","James F. Palmer","Rob, a couple of other perspectives on this. In my prepared comments, I talked about a $27 million adjustment or reduction in favorable adjustments. I also mentioned commercial contract revenue timing, a smaller impact, as well as the ramp-down of in-theater programs. Frankly, a big part of that $27 million reduction in favorable adjustments is a result of some adjustments in last year's second quarter, resulting from immediate needs on production-type products in-theater.","Wesley G. Bush","Right. There was...","James F. Palmer","I don't anticipate that those would always be there. Margins of almost 11% last year in IS in the second quarter, well above what we consider to be the benchmark for this type of business. Performance on a year-to-date basis in IS basically in line with, again, what we see as the benchmark for this business. So, frankly, I think you're seeing an anomaly more in last year's favorable performance than an unfavorable performance in this year.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But even so, you're talking about a lower margin in the second half than you addressed in the first half.","James F. Palmer","No. We're basically saying consistent with the 6 months margin in the second half of the year with the first half.","Wesley G. Bush","Which is consistent with the benchmark that we see for the business.","James F. Palmer","Yes.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And by the way, Jim, on that, do you see EACs -- are they -- could they continue to trend down as this is a business where just maybe the maturity of the contract base suggests that's going to be a lower portion of your profit going forward?","James F. Palmer","Frankly, if we're again still talking about IS, the IS, being a short-cycle business, the amount of the adjustments that they traditionally have is relatively small.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So this really is an anomaly? Or last quarter was an anomaly?","James F. Palmer","Last year's second quarter was much more.","Wesley G. Bush","I think so.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just while we're on the topic, the other businesses, which are more long cycle and have more EACs, Wes or Jim, are we at a point -- given that the new starts are fewer and farther between and programs are closing out, just how do you see those trending EACs?","Wesley G. Bush","Our objective is to win every new start we can that makes sense that's going to be profitable. So if we're successful in that regard, that inherently will hold the margin rates down a little bit. So just in terms of our desires for our business, we like winning.","Stephen C. Movius","Well, this concludes the Q&A session. We ran over a little bit because we couldn't quite get to everybody. So I apologize to those that are still in the queue. I will be at my office to answer additional questions. At this point in time, I would like to turn the call over to Wes for final comments.","Wesley G. Bush","I'll just say thank you again, everyone, for your continuing interest in our company. I'd also like to say thank you to the team here at Northrop Grumman for continuing to work so hard on performance and delivering value to our shareholders. I'd also like to say thank you to our customer community. They are dealing with an extraordinarily difficult set of challenges. I really admire and respect how they are dealing with it. It is not a situation that any of us should be putting them in as they work so hard to defend our nation. So we ought to all keep that in mind as we go forward and hopefully find some resolution to these challenges. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Movius, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Frances, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year end 2012 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's calls constitute forward-looking statements, pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially.","On the call today are our Chairman, CEO and President, Wes Bush; and our CFO, Jim Palmer. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a very strong finish to the year with outstanding fourth quarter and full year results. We met or exceeded guidance for every metric, and I want to congratulate our employees on a job well done. Fourth quarter earnings per share increased 2% to $2.14; and for the full year, earnings per share rose 5% to $7.81.","On a pension-adjusted basis EPS increased 11% in the fourth quarter to $2.06, and 15% for the year to $7.47. Our financial results demonstrate the positive impact of superior program performance driven by cost reductions, affordability initiatives, innovation and portfolio shaping across our 4 businesses.","The strength of our sector's operating performance, coupled with continued share repurchases, more than offset lower sales, higher pension expense and higher effective tax rates. Cash generation was also strong. For the year, before the impact of pension prefunding, we generated cash from operations of $2.8 billion and free cash flow of $2.5 billion. On a reported basis, free cash flow of $2.3 billion represents a free cash flow yield of 14.3% and net income conversion of 117%. We deployed that cash by repurchasing 20.9 million shares of our common stock for $1.3 billion, reducing weighted average shares outstanding by 10%. We also paid dividends of $535 million and made a $300 million discretionary pension contribution.","Through share repurchases and dividends, we returned more than $1.8 billion in cash to our shareholders or approximately 80% of 2012 reported free cash flow. We captured new awards of $26.5 billion during the year for a book-to-bill of 1.05. Total backlog increased 3% to $40.8 billion and funded backlog increased more than 10% to $25.7 billion.","I'm very proud of the performance improvement accomplished by our team. Achieving these improvements has required tough but necessary actions. To put our improvement into perspective, since the end of 2009, sales from our continuing operations have declined about 9% due in part to portfolio shaping. During that same period, our focus on performance has generated a 20% increase in absolute segment operating income, and a 300 basis points expansion in segment operating margin rate or more than a 30% improvement.","As a result of this improvement, in combination with effective cash deployment, EPS from continuing operations have grown by a compound annual growth rate of 20%. While superior program performance and portfolio shaping drove much of the improvement, we've also significantly reduced our cost structure. Over the last 4 years, we've reduced our headcount by approximately 17%, and we've reduced our facilities footprint by approximately 12%. As we improved operating income and margin rate, we maintained robust free cash flow and free cash flow conversion.","We also monetized assets to create value for shareholders. Over just the past 3 years, we've generated free cash flow of $7 billion, including the $1.4 billion contribution from the HII spinoff. More than 90% of that cash has been distributed to our shareholders, $4.8 billion to repurchase shares and another $1.6 billion for dividends. In addition, we increased the dividend in each of these 3 years.","Looking ahead, I can't recall a time of greater uncertainty regarding customer funding levels or government fiscal policy. We continue to operate under a 6-month continuing resolution that expires on March 27, and there is the potential for sequestration on March 1. In addition, other issues such as the debt ceiling raise the possibility of a potential government shutdown.","Our nation needs a balanced strategic approached to our fiscal challenges. Blind, indiscriminate budget-cutting is not the answer, but that is exactly what sequestration would entail. We urge Congress to work to avoid the destructive economic impacts, particularly in terms of government and private employment, and the impacts to our national security that would result from a sequester, a prolonged restricted continuing resolution or a government shutdown.","Our 2013 financial guidance is based on the assumption that the current 6-month continuing resolution would be immediately followed by appropriations, which, even if in the form of a full year CR, will provide program spending levels that are consistent with those set forth in the President's fiscal year 2013 budget and that support and fund the company's programs. Guidance for 2013 also assumes there is no disruption or shutdown of government operations resulting from a federal government debt ceiling breach or lack of immediate appropriations following the current CR, that sequestration is not triggered and any budgetary approach agreed by Congress to address longer-term spending does not result in significant reductions to our customers' FY '13 budget levels. While we don't have control over these issues and can't predict their ultimate resolution, I believe the work we've done over the last several years on performance, as well as our strong balance sheet, leaves us well prepared for a likely defense spending downturn.","For 2013, we expect sales of approximately $24 billion, earnings per share of $6.85 to $7.15, cash from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2.0 billion. Our top line guidance contemplates a $500 million impact for lower volume on space programs, Joint STARS and the F\/A-18; $300 million for the impact of troop drawdowns in overseas contingency operations; $200 million resulting from the current CR impacts; and approximately $100 million each for the ICBM program restructure and portfolio shaping, principally the deemphasis of base and range operations in our Technical Services business and the Park Air Norway divestiture in Information Systems. Beyond that, we expect low single-digit growth for our core capabilities in cyber and unmanned systems. We also expect higher international revenue. In 2012, international revenue, both direct and FMS, totaled approximately 8%. In 2013 with the ramp-up of NATO AGS and other international bookings, we expect international sales to increase to more than 10% of our revenue, and we see continuing opportunities around the globe that our portfolio should allow us to address.","In conclusion, our 2012 results demonstrate strong performance in a challenging environment. In order to continue creating shareholder value, we must remain absolutely focused on our key priorities: driving performance, effectively deploying our cash and optimizing our portfolio for the future. Our record these past few years demonstrates we can do this successfully, and I'm delighted to be working with our company's talented team to create long term sustained value.","So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?","James F. Palmer","Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I also want to add my congratulations to our team on the outstanding work this year. 2012 results were simply excellent. Our dedicated team again rose to the challenge and performed very well in a tough environment. We continue to make the difficult decisions to reduce cost, improve affordability that are helpful in translating to our record results.","Let me give you a few numbers to put our performance into perspective. Segment operating margin rate of 13.5% for the quarter and a record 12.6% for the year. Pension-adjusted operating margin rate of 11.9% for the year, also a record. I'm particularly pleased by the cash our operations generated this year. Wes noted that our free cash flow was $2.3 billion. That means that free cash flow per share was more than $9. Of that amount, we distributed about $7.30 per share through share repurchases and dividends or 80% of free cash flow. Based on our average 2012 share price of $63.63, our cash yield was 14.3%. And in 2012, our shares appreciated 15.5%. As you can see from the guidance, we expect another strong year of cash generation, and we expect to continue our balanced cash deployment strategy that returns a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders.","Turning to results for the sectors. Aerospace Systems finished the year on a high note with a 7% increase in fourth quarter sales and slightly higher sales for the year. AS margin rates for the quarter were outstanding at 13.8% and margin rate of 12.2% for the year matched last year's strong performance. AS did book a couple of positive performance adjustments in the quarter in its space programs, neither of which was more than $20 million. For 2013, we expect AS sales of approximately $9.7 billion, with a margin rate of low to mid-11%. The sales trend reflects lower volumes for space programs, Joint STARS and the F-18, which is more than offset by higher volume unmanned programs due to the ramp-up of NATO AGS and Fire Scout.","Electronic Systems also had outstanding results. While fourth quarter and full year sales experienced a mid-single-digit decline, operating margin rate increased 28% for the quarter and 11% for the year. Margin rate was outstanding at 18.5% for the quarter and 17.1% for the year, records for both periods. ES fourth quarter net performance adjustments were about $50 million higher than last year, reflecting solid operational performance, as well as a lower level of negative adjustments for contractual issues.","The fourth quarter of 2011 also included some costs from reductions in force. For 2012, ES operating income includes an increase of approximately $160 million in net positive performance adjustments. The increase is driven by 2 factors. First, last year's negative adjustments included about $50 million in our domestic postal automation business that obviously didn't occur this year. And secondly, in 2012, we had a higher level of favorable adjustments, particularly for combat avionics, as well as several programs, completed deliveries, negotiated contract modifications or successfully mitigated risk.","For 2013, we expect ES revenues will be roughly comparable to 2012 levels at approximately $6.9 billion. This does contemplate lower volume for some space programs, some continued impact from force reductions in our overseas contingency operations, partially offset by higher international sales. We do expect continued strong margins, but obviously, some of the 2012 performance improvement is likely not sustainable. We expect ES operating margin rates of low to mid-14% for 2013, and while not at the record levels of 2012, they are still very healthy and indicative of outstanding execution at Electronic Systems.","Turning to Information Systems, fourth quarter sales declined by 2%, principally due to the divestiture of Park Air Norway in the second quarter of this year. Park Air contributed $30 million in sales in last year's fourth quarter. For 2012, IS sales declined by 7%. For the year, the divestiture of Park Air Norway and the County of San Diego IT outsourcing contract reduced sales by $100 million, and the JTRS termination accounted for about another $80 million of the variance. After these items, IS sales decline was about 5% and reflects force reductions in overseas contingency operations and a wind down in completion of a variety of programs. IS operating income reflects lower volume and improved performance.","Fourth quarter margin rates do reflect the impact of some costs related to affordability initiatives. But for the year, margin rate expanded 60 basis points to 10.3%, outstanding performance, particularly in light of the lower volume in a challenging market environment.","For 2013, we expect IS sales of approximately $6.7 billion. I want to point out that about $125 million of that variance to 2012 sales reflects some portfolio shaping activities, as well as the transfer of intercompany efforts to our corporate shared services organization. That transfer, which is about $100 million of the $125 million, does not impact overall company P&L -- as you know, intercompany sales are eliminated -- but will impact the year-over-year comparison for IS. Excluding these items, we expect a decline of about 8 -- 7% due to lower volume for in-theater programs like BACN, Command Post Platform and C-RAM, to name a few, the wind down or completion on a variety of other programs and the expected impacts of the current CR.","Moving to Technical Services. Fourth quarter and 2000 sales -- 2012 sales declined 7% and 5%, respectively. Trends in both periods reflect our portfolio shaping actions to reduce base and range operations volume, to lower KC-10 volume and the ICBM program restructuring. Operating income for the fourth quarter is consistent with the change in volume. And for the year, the higher income and margin rate are due to improved performance on the KC-10 program. For 2013, we expect TS sales of approximately $2.7 billion, which contemplates the impact of the current continuing resolution, some force reductions in the ICBM program restructuring and then a little bit of portfolio shaping as well. We expect a mid to high-8% range in margin rate for TS in 2013. And I know many of you know this, but I would point out that our IS and TS businesses are our shortest-cycle businesses and most vulnerable to the uncertainty of the current budget environment.","As I said, our segment operating margin rate for 2012 was 12.6%. You will see when we file our 10-K that we had net favorable performance adjustments of $985 million for this year. That includes an increase of about $150 million in favorable adjustments and about $100 million decrease in unfavorable adjustments. Much of the increase in the net favorable adjustments occurred at ES, and I don't expect that to reoccur this year. So on a consolidated basis, we expect segment margin rate in the low to 11% (sic) [low to mid-11%] range.","Turning to pension costs for 2013, the assumptions that underlie our 2013 net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment of $120 million include a discount rate of 4.12% versus last year's 5.03%. A long term expected rate of return of 8% versus 8.25% last year and reflect 2012 investment returns of slightly more than 12%. We expect 2013 FAS of approximately $380 million, which is about equal to the 2012 amounts, and we expect our CAS cost of approximately $500 million. That CAS amount could move up or down by about $30 million depending upon the outcome of our annual demographic study which we expect to complete in the third quarter of 2013. So after pension cost and corporate unallocated expenses, we would expect our total operating margin rate will range between high-10s and low-11% for 2013.","We also expect a tax rate of about 33%. That includes the positive impact of the extension of the 2012 and 2013 R&D credit, which we estimate at about $27 million or about $0.10 or $0.11 for 2013. The 2012 credit, about $15 million, will be recorded in the first quarter of this year. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to range from $6.85 to $7.15 per share, which assumes a weighted average share count reduction of approximately 7%, reflecting continued share repurchases in 2013. Cash from operations of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2.0 billion before the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions.","We did make progress in 2013 in reducing the seasonality of our cash flow. But I still expect cash flow to be weighted towards the second half of the year. We do plan, at this point, a $500 million discretionary contribution in 2013 over and above our required contributions which are less than $100 million for this year. Beyond 2013, we would expect CAS harmonization will begin to increase CAS pension recoveries in 2014 and '15. And over that same period, our annual pension contributions -- required pension contributions, should be about a little bit less than $100 million, which is principally for our nonqualified plans and some of our foreign plans.","In summary, continued strong operating performance, strong cash flows for our businesses in 2013. So Steve, I think with that, we're ready for some Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions] Frances, we are ready to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jason Gursky.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wonder if you might just give us a bit of an update on the long term margin targets and whether you've seen any change here as we move into the new year.","James F. Palmer","Yes, we set those targets a number of years ago by looking at the performance of our peers over a long period of time, and we used them to incentivize our organization to improve and drive performance. It's worked really well. I tend to think of those not necessarily as targets, if you will, but more of a benchmark on what our businesses ought to generate over a long period of time. We continue to strive to do better than those \"targets\" or benchmarks. We have done better than that. We've been very successful in using them as a motivation for our team to do better, and I continue to believe that they are applicable, as I said, over a long period of time looking at the performance that we and our peers have generated during that period of time. I find that they tend to be supported by many of our major peers as well. So all in all, I think they have served us well. They continue to be that benchmark that we refer to and using to strive to do much better. As I said, we continue to incent our team to drive performance, and it really has been beneficial in doing that. So I'm comfortable with them as they are.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then the follow-up question is just a book-to-bill outlook as we move into 2013 and how that kind of translates into revenue streams as we move out.","Wesley G. Bush","Jason, this is Wes. I think we all recognize that this year, with the continuing resolution that we have in place, much less some of the uncertainties that we see as potentials on the horizon, that book-to-bill is going to be under pressure and getting to a 1.0 book-to-bill would be a tremendous outcome. We don't guide on book-to-bill or awards each year, but I would say anything close to 1 for 2013 would be a great outcome.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm interested, Wes, you've talked about some of the success you've had in cost reductions, square footage, headcount over the past couple of years. And when you sit today and look at the opportunity going forward for the next year and say the following year, does it look as like the opportunities are as large today as you saw in the past?","Wesley G. Bush","Doug, it really depends on the business space that we see on the horizon, and all of that sort of depends on some of these budgetary decisions that get made. To the extent that the there are more severe budgetary outcomes than the Presidents FY '13 budget would suggest, then yes, there's a -- it will go with that. We will need to scale -- continue to scale the operations and continue to address whatever comes our way. I think we've shown we know how to do that. It's not something we'd rather do in terms of dealing with a more severely depressed budget than the Pentagon is already trying to manage its way through, but we do certainly have the capacity and know how to get that done. If things were pretty much on track for the budget, just from my perspective, there's always room for more, and we're going to continue to push and drive efficiency in our corporation. I'm not going to set any public targets on how much more we can get there, but I think I would just say that the market should be informed by the work that we've been doing, that we are determined at ensuring that we can be very, very competitive from a cost structure perspective, and that goes to every aspect of cost. And that we can be putting forward the most affordable concepts and approaches for our customers who are dealing in a much more tightly constrained environment. So it really is a responsibility that we see to support our customers to be most cost efficient as possible.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then on the continuing resolution, certainly with the CR in place, that limits the availability of funds for new starts, for transitions from development into production often. When you look across your portfolio, where are the areas or the major programs that you're most concerned about in terms of being able to ramp up or make the transitions?","Wesley G. Bush","Doug, it touches every one of our sectors in some way. In the large sort of hardware-oriented parts of our business, we have a whole variety of programs that are undergoing that transition. Whether it's unmanned systems like BAMS, even things that are at the very early stages of development, where you want to go out and do long lead that are associated with production. Those -- it would be too long a list to go through. I mean, they're all touched in some way. And then clearly, the shorter-cycle businesses, both Information Systems and Technical Services, deal with this at a much higher rate because the nature of a short-cycle business is you've got to start the new programs more frequently. And when you're constrained in your ability to do that, it really hamstrings the customer community and us from doing that in the most efficient way. Ultimately, what you end up seeing happen in those types of business, our current programs, our services approach get strung out. And while that can be good in some respects, ultimately that's usually not the best answer for the customer either. So I hate to give you too general of an answer to that question, but the detailed answer would be incredibly detailed, and that we see this environment with those types of very tight restrictions really touching all the components of the business. And I think that's why you're hearing -- well, it's one of many reasons why you're hearing the department be so vocal about the CR approach and how constraining it is, and they're attempting to be very clear with the Hill that resolving these restrictions as we come to the end of March and the current CR expires is a necessity for them to be able to really operate the department in a more efficient manner. If we're talking about saving money for the government, efficiency matters, and so that's a critical message.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just, Wes, I know this is a hard topic to address and in terms of contingency planning if we actually do trigger the sequester. I mean, obviously, you have a set of contingency plans that you'll work off of. I wondered if you might kind of take us through what's the sequence of internal events if something like that is triggered. What's the sort of play-by-play of the implementation of one of those plans?","Wesley G. Bush","The work that we've been doing to get ready for the variety of scenarios is both broad and deep. And I guess I should start just by saying that I'm clear about this, I'm not going to speculate on what scenario might lie in front of us, whether it's sequestration or problems associated with the CR that I was referencing in relation to Doug's question. There's clearly a lot of uncertainty on how this whole situation's going to get addressed and the fact that we're seeing now...","[Audio Gap]","scenarios you think will come into play. But the other think that I think is really important to point out here and sometimes gets lost a little bit in some of this dialogue is, our primary obligation is to successfully execute on the portfolio of contracts that we've taken on. And so the planning work that we're doing is trying to be mindful of what might happen, but also have its primary objective, do no harm. To make sure that we really can and do continue to execute really, really well. When we think about all of these different scenarios, I think to the question you're asking, we have to think about it in terms of contractual, potential contractual actions that our customers would take and traditionally that's what would trigger any particular sequence of events on our side, whether it's delay in terms of slowing a contract down or in a more ugly situation, termination for convenience on the part of the customer. Naturally, as a part of our process, we have gone through our full set of contracts, and we understand what the issues and approaches would be associated with those variety of potential customer actions, and they all vary by scenario, and we're certainly prepared to address those if we have to. In general, as I was remarking earlier to Doug's comment, it adds cost. It adds cost to the department to have to go through and do those things in a period of time when the nation's trying to minimize outlays, the idea of adding cost is not a really good idea. And what's interesting to me is, I don't see folks on the Hill adding up the numbers that go with all of those additional costs that will get created by that massive inefficiency that would result. The other part of the planning process that's also very important is the people part of this. And this isn't just about contracts, contracts turn into work that real people perform, and these are individuals whose skills are precious resources in our country. These are the skills that enable the companies and the Defense Industrial Base to provide the technological superiority upon which our nation's strategy, our national security strategy relies. And so part of our challenge, as we think our way through this, is being ready to address how we most diligently and carefully manage that precious resource of capability that we're going to need to make sure that we preserve our ability to continue to support the nation as we go through this challenge. And I would say that, in my mind, is the most challenging part of this. We're talking about extraordinarily good people who have lots of opportunities and making sure that they see our industry as a great place to continue their careers despite these budgetary pressures. That's something we're all working hard on because we know that ultimately that determines the success of our ability to support the mission that we're here to serve.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So F-35, I think on the Q3 call you mentioned...","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","And that question is from Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So I think on the third quarter call you mentioned the F-35 was going to be, I think, higher volume in the second half. Could you give us some sense in terms of where was the F-35 volume last year? Where should it be in 2013? How is your performance and kind of what's the opportunity for improved profitability at some point?","James F. Palmer","Cai, from memory, the F-35 this year was around $1 billion in terms of revenue and about $1 billion would be the expectation for next year as well. You know we don't comment on profitability by individual programs, so I'm really not going to go there. We are working hard to be a teammate with our friends at Lockheed and support the program. We're doing well in our pieces of the work, and I would characterize our margins at this point as basically as I would expect given the stage of the program.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So the follow-up would be if we look at aerospace, you kind of have lower margins projected and some mature stuff coming off. When do we have some of these newer programs like the F-35 reach the point where they should start maturing so that those margins in aerospace could start to improve?","James F. Palmer","On the F-35, I don't really see a step-up in terms of volume until about 2016 given that the current plan for quantities.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But I mean, the question was volume. As you mature the program, and you made the point about where you are in the stage of the program, usually the margins get a bit better. So when do we reach the point when more of that volume starts to become mature?","James F. Palmer","If we want to talk about aerospace in total, we still have a very good strong mix of new development-type programs. And I don't think that changes much over that couple of year period of time going forward. So the good news is, continued growth on new opportunities will be important as that portfolio transitions over time.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit about ES. Jim, you had mentioned about the net favorable adjustments this year and that they were the majority of the total. If I back those out, and I don't know exactly what the total favorable adjustments are, but it would still seem to imply a margin well into the high-14s on the baseline, and your guidance seems to imply kind of 50 basis points below that. So I'm wondering why is it declining kind of even x the adjustments in 2013 versus 2012?","James F. Palmer","I thought you were going to ask me why they were above our long term rate of return or something.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, the basis points are, that's not a new question.","James F. Palmer","Oh, okay. I think that the guys, the team at ES is just doing a fabulous job over the last few years. They really have driven up the margins. We've worked really hard to reduce the negative adjustments that part of that business has been plagued by over looking back 3 or 4 years or so. And at low to mid-14s, I think they're going to just have a great year.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So there's not really a change in the mix or development to production or anything else that's going to drive it?","James F. Palmer","I don't think so. We do have -- did have in 2012 a number of programs or contracts reached the end of their production or life. And as well, did get a benefit from the cost-reduction activities that we undertook at ES and at the company in '11 and in '12 had a big impact or favorable impact on their contracts. And as you know, you give those up as you go forward with new contracts. All of that are factors into that overall margin rate expectation for ES for 2013. Having said that, you bet we're going to push to get us the very best performance that we can out of that part of the business and every other part of the business.","Wesley G. Bush","Jim, I would just add that similar to your earlier remarks around aerospace, ES has been very successful these last couple of years in capturing some new development work as well. And as you all know that the margin rates during the development cycle are generally less, and I think we'll see some of that too.","James F. Palmer","And we have some new development activities, possibilities.","Wesley G. Bush","Exactly, on the horizon here.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Rob Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick one, Jim, actually. I was looking at goodwill on the balance sheet. You've got $2.4 billion. I was wondering if you did your annual impairment review, what the results of that where, how much cushion you might have from the latest reassessment of that goodwill?","James F. Palmer","You bet, we did our annual impairment test. And just like last year, the most sensitive piece of our businesses is IS, and we do have a cushion. It's not real large, if you want to call it that or look at it from that perspective, but we're comfortable with where we are at the end of the year and as we go forward, we'll do the test again based on new information when we have it.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I mean, I'm sure you wouldn't be able to get into specific details, but can you give us an idea of maybe how much that cushion might have reduced versus last year?","James F. Palmer","It's down a little bit from last year, and frankly, the cushion is a combination of a whole bunch of different factors. Obviously, interest rates play into the discount rate on the use of discount cash flows that has an impact on terminal value, has an impact on pension liability. All those are factors in the overall calculation, but it does start with the expected cash flows from the business. And our guys at IS, although revenues were down, we still expect that they'll have reasonably healthy margins given our guidance for 2013, and again, comfortable with where we are.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just a quick one for you, Wes. I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the competitive environment that you are seeing in services and your ability to preserve margins going forward.","Wesley G. Bush","I think a lot of that goes back to the point I was making earlier around affordability. Clearly, as the department's budgets are under increasing pressure, our customer community needs our industrial base to drive additional efficiencies into the way that we do business, which we've been busily doing now for several years, and they need good ideas. They need the innovation that can come out of our industry to suggest alternative approaches to getting things done. So I think, just thinking about it very broadly, the competitive environment is going to be very healthy. I think everyone's working on cost and everyone's working on innovation. And hopefully, we're all going to be able to not only be competitive with each other, but be supportive of our customers in this more difficult period of time. It is going to be a challenging competitive environment. I don't want to sound dismissive of that at all. Those of us who had been through defense downturns in the past have that experience under our belt and understand very clearly what that means. But that's part of the reason we've been doing the work we've been doing to get ready for this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The first question is more of a clarification, Jim, I think in the slides it implies what the share -- diluted share count benefit is to EPS with 6% drawdown. I don't have the period end share count, so I don't know exactly, but is the share repurchase number on a dollar basis about...","James F. Palmer","It's 7% on a weighted average shares this year to next year.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, is the dollar repurchase assumed to be about the same?","James F. Palmer","Yes, roughly the same. Obviously, for planning purposes, we've assumed that it's generally proportionate throughout the year, which equates to about a little bit more actually. It's price dependent, obviously.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. That kind of brings me to the question, so -- to your earlier comments on your pension plan, you're in a much better funding position than probably anyone else or definitely better than anyone else out there and probably 85% or so funded.","James F. Palmer","Actually, 83%. You'll see in the K.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","83%, all right. So if I look at your cash balance, that continues to grow. You're returning over 80% or 80% of the free cash flow generated in 2012. But again, the cash balance continues to grow. You're in a net cash or close to net cash or 0 net debt position. At what point do you actually take some of the cash balances and return those or at least increase more than 100% free cash flow return to shareholders? Or is there M&A out there on the horizon that you'd like to retain it for?","James F. Palmer","Well, actually, if you think about the comments that we just went through pro rata a little bit more than last year, dividends and our free cash flow guidance for 2013, you're at 100% if not maybe more than 100% just with that.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, Myles, I'll just add. We continue to see share repurchase as a very important part of our overall balanced cash deployment strategy. We think that has been serving our shareholders well, and it has been a good use of our cash. We do think about our business over the longer cycle and that's the perspective that we have in mind when we're thinking about our approach in share repurchase in particular. So it continues to be a very attractive mechanism for cash deployment for us.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So the cash balance though question, you would still expect it to be not coming down anytime soon in terms of this being the level that you'd be comfortable maintaining on the balance sheet?","James F. Palmer","I'm sorry?","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It seems like...","James F. Palmer","If I have, let me try to answer. $1.7 billion to $2 billion on free cash flow, and let's call that midpoint of $1.8 billion or something like that. $500 million for dividends, round numbers. If I have a similar amount of share repurchases to last year's, that's $1.8 billion, midpoint of that free cash flow. Got CapEx. That free cash flow is out of that. But then if I spend any money at all on things like funding the pension plan or other opportunities, and clearly, as we tried to outline, we're in an uncertain environment, so we do want some financial flexibility to be able to deal with that. I think I'm, on one hand, I'm continuing to do what we've set out to do and have done over the last few years with deploying cash to invest in the business, to manage our pension plans and return excess cash to shareholders and provide us with financial flexibility to deal with this uncertain fiscal environment that we're in at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Your level of EACs that you've assumed in your 2013 guidance is what?","James F. Palmer","Less than last year.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Any -- obviously, last year was close to $1 billion was pretty high. Any sort of range?","James F. Palmer","No. I really think about it as those overall margin rate as opposed to what kind of level of adjustments do I need to have to get there.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Jim, on the cash flow from ops walk, can you give us some help on working capital, cash taxes, what's baked into that number relative to 2012?","James F. Palmer","Yes. As you all know, the hardest bit in this business on cash flow projection is working capital. So right now, the guidance anticipates a use of working capital anywhere from, let's call it, $50 million to $250 million for the year. Cash taxes and tax expense roughly about the same, maybe $50 million greater on cash taxes. And then the other variable in that whole range of EBITDA to free cash flow is, first of all, stock compensation, about $100 million and then CapEx of around $400 million for the year.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then last one, if I'm looking at it correctly, you still have a decent chunk of what would be considered relatively high cost debt outstanding given today's rate environment. What's the plan, if anything, to address that? I know other companies have gone after that pretty aggressively.","James F. Palmer","We tendered for all of that or much of that in 2010. We actually tendered for $1.9 billion at the time and were able to pry out about $800 million. We continue to look at it, continue to look at who holds it and the likelihood that they might be receptive to tenders. And at this point, we haven't been able to convince ourselves that something like that makes sense given who the holders are of that -- largely of that high-coupon debt.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","I wanted to ask, you were surprising to me in the sense that you had substantially up margins where a couple of your major competitors had down margins in the quarter. But yet, you're still guiding to significantly lower margin in '13 and even though you've always been conservative in the past, I'm just wondering, is it all just EACs reflecting in '13 or the core programs are that much tougher? Can you just go through that a little bit more?","James F. Palmer","Well, I would say that we have an increasingly tougher environment. At the same time, we're working very hard to make sure that on all the new contracts we get reasonable terms and conditions, that our cost estimates fairly reflect what we think our cost are to do the work. As I did mention earlier, we have taken -- we tried to get out ahead of what we saw as a decline starting in 2011. We did take a number of actions to reduce, as Wes said, our footprint and our headcount. We did get a benefit in 2012 on our backlog for those activities. And our backlog normally runs about 1.5 years. If you get all the benefit on 1.5 years, you get a year's worth in '12, you don't have a whole lot left, do you? So it's a combination of just what we see in the marketplace in terms of the environment and the actions we've taken that have resulted in favorable performance adjustments. As I said, we have also worked very hard to reduce the quantity and the quantum of any of our problem programs and been, I think, pretty successful with that. So it's really just that look at the entire portfolio of programs and where we stand that lead to our judgment around those margin rates for 2013, which I think are really strong operating performance, particularly in light of our benchmarks for the types of businesses we're in, which, as I said, largely are confirmed by many of our peers, both in their guidance for this year, as well as their performance. So all in all, I think we're doing a pretty good job.","George Shapiro","You definitely are. And just a follow-up for either you or Wes. So Wes, you clearly have done a great job in taking out cost before ahead of revenues. Can you continue to do that if sequestration goes into place, which is going to be somewhat more abrupt? I mean, how do you actually plan to be able to do that or continue that?","Wesley G. Bush","George, I've remarked on this just a little bit earlier that in the event of sequestration or other budgetary actions, our first challenge is going to be addressing whatever contractual changes come along. But ultimately, we have to scale cost structure with that, and that's what our planning has been focused on, to enable us to do that in a smart way so that we're not doing something that undermines our ability to perform for the long term. But we worked our way through those scenarios and are certainly ready to take on the variety of scenarios. Ultimately though, in any of those outcomes, first and foremost, we're going to have to deal with the contractual matters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner from Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A question about free cash flows after discretionary pension. They've been fairly volatile here over the last couple of years. $1.9 billion a couple of years ago and now just $2.3 billion in 2012, and I guess the guidance for 2013 implies somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. Now I understand that a lot of these discretionary pension payments are going to come back to you later on, but can you just help us understand what we should think about as a long term sustainable free cash flow after pension?","James F. Palmer","I've said a number of times publicly that I think even in this environment, that we're going to have relatively strong free cash flows as we look forward. I really don't see -- we've had strong cash flows. I continue to expect that we will have those relatively strong cash flows, free cash flows on a go-forward basis. I don't know what else to tell you there.","Wesley G. Bush","And we look at the voluntary pension amounts sort of on a year-by-year basis depending on what's going on in the marketplace and the economic benefit that we see by making those contributions. So that is something that we do look at and make decisions based on the environment. And a look to the longer term as well.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Your backlog went up, both funded and overall, this past year and you have revenue guidance that's down without sequestration, and I was wondering if you could comment on whether that's just a profile of the backlog, the tail got bigger or if there's something else in your planning? And also, you had a good quarter from a sales standpoint, I might add, the best one you've had in a while.","James F. Palmer","Joe, backlog is a function of obviously contracts and the genuine performance of contracts. A contributor to our backlog this year is the NATO AGS contract. It extends over 5 years or so. So when you get a contract like that, it adds to your overall backlog numbers as well as the period of performance that goes with that. So that's principally the factor that you're seeing that's contributing to growth in backlog dollars, and you perform those contracts, as I said, over about a 5-year period of time.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So it's just AGS?","James F. Palmer","NATO AGS.","Wesley G. Bush","And Joe, in my earlier commentary, I sort of went through the components of the -- of about roughly $1 billion differential in sales. So I don't know if you caught that commentary, but it might be helpful in addressing your question as well.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And the next one, the second one is just we're all focused right here on the sequestration and the CR and everything. Wes, when you look out a little further or not even that much further. You have this Jammer, this Next Gen Jammer competition. Could you comment on that and your teaming arrangement there with Exelis and what led you down that path? And then really, any other competitive situations that you see over the next year to 2 for the company that you consider important?","Wesley G. Bush","There's a whole variety of activities that we're pursuing, and I like your perspective on it, that we all do need to keep looking down the road because the nation's going to continue to need a Defense Industrial Base, and we're going to continue to need that technological superiority that the industrial base provides. Next Generation Jammer is an exciting opportunity. We've been working on that now for some time. Our teaming with Exelis was driven by a view of how do we bring the very best offering to our customer. And we saw in the team at Exelis some great capability that when combined with ours, we believe is a compelling offer. So that relationship is going well, and I'm looking forward to continuing it. There are whole series of opportunities of that nature and some even larger scale as we look on the horizon. Clearly, both the Air Force and the Navy, and I would add to that, the intelligence community really need to position their capabilities to align with the nation's evolving national security strategy. This pivot to Asia-Pacific has brought implications on the types of capabilities that are going to be needed, that range from aircraft, unmanned and manned. They range to sensor systems, the C4ISR domain. And also, cyber continues to be just a heck of a challenge for our country, and we think it's going to continue to be a challenge. So across that array of sort of broad mission areas, there are whole array of specific programmatic targets, both '13 and '14, that we are investing in and continuing to push hard on. One point I would make in response to your question, that even while we're seeing a perhaps tougher environment around the top lines, we're committed to continuing to invest for the future here. We think that -- we feel very strongly that it's going to be imperative that the Defense Industrial Base continue to bring innovation to the nation's capabilities and investing now is going to be important for our ability to serve for the long term.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wes, are you seeing the procurement groups at your classified customers having the same sort of freezing up, same sort of issues that the broader customer set is going through right now? Or have there been more provisions for -- to enable them to operate more smoothly through this whole situation?","Wesley G. Bush","Joe, there's only so much I can say about that, but I will say that they too are subject to the legislation around the CR and potentially, if we were to get to the sequester, those issues as well. So they're having to address that in a very prudent manner and address it from a planning perspective as well. So these budgetary effects sometimes just get a stamp on it associated with the Department of Defense, but they hit everybody. And I think it's important to understand that from a broad policymaking perspective, that this really does span across government, all the functions of government.","Operator","And the last question will come from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Kind of 2 parts. Wes, the interesting thing about all that's gone on is the authorization bill protected Global Hawk in a big way and actually underscored how important it was. Can you address sort of some of the other positives that came out of that and how do you sort of square that walk with what Congress' will there with, in fact, this meat-axe approach to solving a problem that doesn't?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, it's hard to square that, Howard, I appreciate your question. It's clear to us that when Congress, and then particularly those in Congress who are charged with addressing specific matters associated with the functioning of our government, when they're given the latitude to dig in and really address a particular issue, they're able to do that strategically, and they're able to make great decisions. When there is this broad umbrella approach to trying to deal with the bigger challenges without dealing with the strategy, you get to these other approaches that really don't make sense from a strategic perspective. On Block 30, I would just say that we continue to be pleased with the performance in-theater of those systems. They're  in very high demand by the combatant commanders, and we were just delighted to see the Authorization Act support the continuation of Block 30. We continue to work with the Air Force to provide more affordable approaches to sustaining that program because we think that will be something that's going to be important to the country's ability to conduct its surveillance mission for a long time. So I would just say, it's sort of a contrast between the processes, when the Congressional processes that have been developed over many years to work on and deal with the authorization and appropriations for specific components of government are allowed to do their jobs, I think we get to very good rational outcomes. When there's this broad across-the-board meat-axe approach, we get to really bad outcomes.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just last, just a follow-up. I mean, the numbers would say, you don't have very many red programs or anything close to them, but I'm sure there's always you're not happy with. How would you evaluate maybe the bottom 10% of your performers at the moment? What are you trying to do to change that?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, we've been doing a lot of work on that over the past few years. Jim alluded earlier to the fact that it wasn't that long ago, 4 or so years ago that we had a serious list of red programs that we kept talking to you all about, it seemed like every quarter. So the focus on performance in our company is not just about margin rates. It goes to performance for our customers as well. It starts with quality. It starts with the quality of our processes and the quality of how we approach getting the work done, and I'm not just talking about quality coming out the end of the production line. It's the quality of engineering, it's the qualitative of contracting, it's all of those aspects. So we're not perfect. I wouldn't want anybody to hear that we think we are somehow reaching a point of perfection in any way. We have still a lot of work to do as any honest organization would tell you. But we have substantially reduced the number of programs in our portfolio that are demonstrating those performance variations, in part because I think we've made good progress on our risk management methodologies. And for those programs that are in sort of the bottom 10%, I would characterize them as those where the risk that we've identified and been working to manage still find a way to manifest in some way, but we're able to get on it more quickly and more aggressively, and we've become a lot better about utilizing the resources of the entire corporation to go after them when those problems pop up. So still work to do, still, I think, to some extent inevitable in the technologically complex environment in which we operate, but a lot better place than we were a few years ago.","Stephen C. Movius","This concludes the Q&A session. I would like to turn it over to Jim for a couple of brief comments on some information that's always of interest to you all, and then turn it over the Wes for final comments.","James F. Palmer","I'm kind of disappointed. I didn't get my normal FAS\/CAS pension question. Let me try to answer what I would have anticipated to be your questions. So we talked about our FAS and CAS guidance for 2013, and if I look forward to, let's say 2015, 2 years out, I would expect based on no change in our assumptions that our FAS cost would decline about $130 million and that CAS cost would increase about $300 million or the net FAS\/CAS change being about $430 million. 2014 is probably halfway in between the 2013 numbers and the 2014 numbers. Spent some time this morning talking about the current environment, the possibility that we're faced with at least an uncertain defense budget and likely a declining defense budget. So clearly, in that environment, the emphasis on affordability is so important. So growth in CAS cost isn't necessarily good as it does add to the affordability challenge that we all face in light of that environment. So we are working really hard to reduce both FAS and our CAS cost. And if we find ourselves in a rising interest rate environment, as you know from our past conversations, that rising interest rate has a near-term impact on our FAS cost, and we would look at that today at being every 25 basis points is in a range of $85 million to $90 million. However, because of MAP-21, a rising interest rate environment over the near-term likely doesn't have nearly the impact on FAS as it does on CAS and on funding. So ultimately, besides rising interest rates over a long term, the important levers for reducing or controlling your FAS cost or CAS cost rather, CAS cost as well as funding are first of all, investment performance. Our 10-year compound annual rate of return is just under 10%. And then you have to manage the provisions of your plans. We have capped entrants to the pension plan back in 2008, as I recall. So any new employees do not have the same pension benefits as the past. And then last year, we announced another change for our pension plans that essentially capped growth in compensation cost, all of which are aimed at reducing that CAS cost on a go-forward basis. So we've been working really hard. I know you all are interested in those trends around FAS and CAS, so I wanted to give you that flavor as you work your models, but this is going to be an important item as we go forward. So Wes, with that I think we're ready to close.","Wesley G. Bush","Thanks, Jim and Steve. Let me just wrap up with a couple of thank yous. First, thank you to our employees for their incredible focus on performance and serving our customers. Our 2012 outcomes are due to the hard work of our team, and we all sincerely appreciate that. And secondly, thanks to all of you for your continuing interest in our company. We appreciate you being with us on the call today. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your presentation.

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Erica, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.","Todd Ernst","Thank you, Erica. Welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2019 conference call. Before we start, matters discussed on today's call including 2019 guidance and any outlook or expectations for 2020 reflect the Company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's earnings release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may also cause actual Company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release. Additional information can be found in the supplemental presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President, and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?","Kathy Warden","Thank you, Todd. We're pleased to have you aboard as our Vice President of Investor Relations and I also want to thank Steve Movius for his many years of service in that role. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings call. I want to thank the entire Northrop Grumman team for another solid quarter. We delivered strong business capture and backlog growth, higher sales at all four sectors, strong earnings and healthy cash flow. Year-to-date results supported a substantial increase in our EPS guidance, as well as an increase to the lower end of our free cash flow guidance, and we are on track to achieve the other major elements of guidance.","Before discussing the quarter in more detail, I want to touch on the realignment we announced in September. Beginning in January, we will have four operating sectors that more closely align with our customers' priority investment areas. Our new sectors are Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems. These changes will enable our teams to quickly identify and deliver solutions for rapidly evolving national security challenges. The realignment is also aimed at driving continued strong execution, sustained profitable growth and operational efficiency.","Under the new structure, Aerospace Systems becomes Aeronautics Systems and continues under the leadership of Janis Pamiljans. In addition to long-duration franchise manned and unmanned program, the sector will also include the aerostructures work currently being performed at Innovation Systems. A new sector, Defense Systems brings together Technology Services, the defense businesses of Innovation Systems and select capabilities for Mission Systems.","In addition to being our global sustainment and modernization business, Defense Systems includes tactical missiles, munitions and our Integrated Air and Missile Defense program. Defense Systems will focus on products and services that address evolving threats and quick-turn requirements for a wide variety of national security, military, civil and international customers. Chris Jones, the President of Technology Services has announced his intention to retire. I want to thank Chris for his many contributions to Northrop Grumman particularly for leading the effort to position Technology Services for the future. We wish him the best.","Mary Petryszyn, who currently heads Land and Avionics C4ISR within Mission Systems will lead the new sector. Mission Systems remains largely intact, but with a sharpened focus on growing its leadership position in open, cyber-secure, software-defined systems for defense and intelligence application. Mark Caylor will continue to lead Mission Systems.","The fourth and final sector, Space Systems brings together our significant space and launch capabilities from across the company into one organization. Space Systems will be a robust platform to accelerate the development of innovative and affordable offerings for our national security, military, civil, commercial and international customer. We expect Space Systems will be the fastest growing sector in our new structure. Blake Larson, currently the President of Innovation Systems will lead Space Systems. This realignment is the next logical step to maximize the powerful revenue synergy opportunity we envision from our combination with Orbital ATK. It also further enabled strong execution and our organization's agility.","Turning to financial highlights for the quarter. Sales rose 5% to approximately $8.5 billion and included sales growth at all four sectors. Our year-to-date segment operating margin rate of 11.5% is tracking to our guidance of approximately 11.5% for the year reflecting solid operational results. Cash from operations increased $327 million to $1.1 billion in the third quarter and free cash flow increased to $882 million. Year-to-date, operations have generated $1.8 billion of cash. After capital expenditures of approximately $800 million, year-to-date free cash flow increased to approximately $1 billion. New awards remained robust and demonstrate our strong competitive position in critical national security domain. In the third quarter, we booked more than $10 billion in new award or 1.2 times sale. Book-to-bill was above 1 times at Innovation Systems, Mission Systems, and Technology Services.","At Aerospace Systems, year-to-date, book-to-bill is 1.6 times sale and backlog is up 28%. During the third quarter, Japan exercised an option for nine additional E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes for approximately $1.4 billion. This is in addition to the $3.3 billion multi-year award we booked last quarter. I would also note that France has indicated they're interested in purchasing three E-2Ds. At Innovation Systems, we booked the initial $300 million of $1.1 billion Missile Defense Agency competitive award to supply new targets and countermeasures used to test the Ballistic Missile Defense System. Our offering provides a new solution to the complex threat scenarios our customers face.","I also note that IS has been awarded approximately $1.3 billion for hypersonic and counter-hypersonic activities, as both the prime and subcontractor. At Mission Systems, we were awarded a 13-year IDIQ to -- contract to produce and sustain next-generation navigation systems for the US Air Force and international customers. The Sole Source Award has a potential value of $1.4 billion. Mission Systems also booked a six-year $375 million order to provide surveillance radars for the Navy's Triton Aircraft, and a $200 million IDIQ Award for our layer front [Phonetic] systems and related support. And at Technology Services, in addition to winning two large recompete, TS won a competitive restricted award valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars. We're particularly pleased with this award as it demonstrates the sector's ability to win new restricted work and expand our national security services portfolio.","A good indicator of our company's portfolio alignment to the national defense strategy is our growing share of restricted work. Year-to-date, restricted awards totaled $8.5 billion. At the Company level, restricted work across multiple domains continues to grow as a percent of total revenue. As of September 30th, total restricted backlog has grown 22% since year-end, and new awards of approximately $36 billion or 1.4 times year-to-date sales. Looking ahead, we have large opportunities across our portfolio in four sectors -- in all four sectors and program execution remains solid.","Turning to Aerospace Systems. F-35 production continues to ramp up. Year-to-date, AS has delivered 100 center fuselage units and we are on pace to deliver a total of 134 units in 2019, 13 more than last year. As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of our B-2 Spirit, the world's first stealth bomber, we continue to perform well on the B-21 radar, our nation's next-generation stealth bomber. Last month the then acting Secretary of the Air Force, Matt Donovan noted that the development program is on schedule and production will occur in Palmdale, California.","At Mission Systems, our IBCS Systems successfully intercepted a cruise missile at an extended range with Sentinel and Patriot System. The flight test demonstrated the value of IBCS to detect, track and engage low-flying threats at a distance well beyond the range limitation of the current Patriot System. In August, Innovation Systems submitted our proposal for the National Security Space Launch, down-select, which is currently planned for the third quarter of 2020. Our OmegA vehicle is on track to meet the customers' requirement for a first launch in 2021 and operational launches of national security payloads in 2022. On GBSD, we have assembled an exceptional nationwide industry team, that is ready to meet the Air Force's technical and schedule requirements. We are successfully executing on the TMMR phase of the program and we look forward to submitting our proposal for the next phase of the competition. The Air Force has been clear that our nation urgently needs to modernize the ICBM System, and that it is critical that this acquisition remains on schedule.","Turning to the US defense budget. We're now working under a continuing resolution that expires on November 21st. More often than not, we begin each fiscal year under a CR and we don't expect this to cause a significant disruption to our fourth quarter activities or our outlook for next year as long as there is not a prolonged CR. Our customers need predictable funding that is not constrained by continuing resolution limits. This enables investment in the critical technologies we need to stay ahead of rapidly advancing global threat. We believe our nation's leaders will provide the necessary resources to modernize key capabilities and therefore we are hopeful that the government will act quickly to finalize appropriations.","In closing, based on a solid quarter, strong year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing 2019 earnings per share guidance. We now expect mark-to-market EPS will range between $20.10 and $20.35. We are maintaining our sales guidance of approximately $34 billion, and we are updating our free cash flow guidance by raising the bottom end of the range by $100 million. We now expect free cash flow of $2.7 billion to $3 billion for the year. Regarding the 2020 outlook, we will provide detailed guidance in January. We expect mid-single-digit sales growth in 2020, which now includes the impact of the Lake City contract winding down in the latter part of the year. We also expect segment margin rates consistent with 2019 and strong and growing free cash flow.","So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financial results and guidance. Ken?","Ken Bedingfield","Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. I also want to thank the team for another solid quarter. We had excellent awards, strong book-to-bill, and higher sales at all four sectors. Year-to-date awards support our outlook for continued top-line growth. And as Kathy said, we are tracking to our segment margin rate guidance.","Turning to the sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 5%. Higher manned aircraft reflects volume increases on the E-2D and F-35 programs. Space sales also increased reflecting growing activity on next-gen OPIR programs. Autonomous Systems sales were also higher due to volume increases in multiple areas, including Global Hawk. AS third quarter operating income declined to $324 million and operating margin rate was 9.4%. This was driven by lower net favorable EAC adjustments. AS had fewer favorable adjustments this quarter primarily due to timing. We also had negative performance adjustments on two activities. The B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization program is experiencing schedule delays. Although the upgrade has taken longer than planned, installation of DMS has been completed on the first test aircraft and aircraft checkout is underway. AS has now completed most milestones on the program and are well along toward completion. We also experienced production delays for certain commercial space components.","We have introduced new leadership and processes in this business in order to successfully complete these contracts. In both cases, we believe our current EACs have captured the cost to complete the required work. Excluding these two adjustments, AS third quarter margin rate would have been in the mid 10% range. We continue to expect AS sales for the year in the high $13 billion range. We are maintaining operating margin rate guidance of mid-to-high 10% with a bias toward the lower end of the range.","At Innovation Systems, third quarter sales rose 12% in its first full quarter comparison. In Space, we had higher volume on national security satellite systems. Defense Systems had higher volume on precision munitions, armaments and tactical missiles, including the AARGM-ER program. Flight Systems had increased volume on military and commercial aerospace structures. IS operating income increased 2%, reflecting higher sales. Operating margin rate for the quarter was solid at 10.4%. The prior year period benefited from favorable indirect performance and the recovery of an insurance claim. Year-to-date, operating margin rate is 11.1%. For the year, we continue to expect IS sales of approximately $6 billion with a high 10% operating margin rate. No change to prior guidance.","Turning to Mission Systems. Third quarter sales grew 4% and operating income was comparable to last year. Advanced capabilities had higher volume on marine programs. Cyber and ISR had higher volume on space and restricted programs. Sensors and Processing had increased activity on airborne radar and electronic warfare programs, including F-35 and radars [Phonetic]. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect MS revenue to grow to the low-to-mid $12 billion range. And we are raising margin rate guidance to the low 13% range. At Technology Services, sales rose 3% and operating income rose 23% with an operating margin rate of 12.7%.","As we discussed last quarter, program headwinds are moderating and we are now seeing the underlying sales growth in both TS businesses. Operating income benefited from a focus on cost reduction, as well as a favorable adjustment on a sustainment program. We continue to expect TS sales in the low $4 billion range, no change to prior guidance. And based on strong year-to-date performance, we are raising guidance for TS operating margin rate. We now expect a high 10% range versus prior guidance of low 10%. As we roll all that up, we continue to expect 2019 sales of approximately $34 billion with a total segment operating margin rate of approximately 11.5%. Below segment OM, we continue to expect unallocated corporate expense of $225 million. Unallocated corporate expense is typically higher in the fourth quarter and our guidance contemplates an estimate for state deferred taxes and year-end accruals.","We are increasing our guidance for total operating margin rate to approximately 11%, largely due to updated cash pension estimates as we completed our annual demographic study. The presentation materials we posted this morning include updated estimates for CAS, net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment and required funding for 2019 through 2021. Our 2019 estimates do not include the mark-to-market adjustment we will be recording in the fourth quarter.","2020 and 2021 estimates are based on year-to-date trends and assume a discount rate of 3.31%, 12% planned asset return in 2019 and 8% planned asset returns thereafter. Through September 30, our actual returns were about 14%. I'd also note that our CAS prepayment credit approximates $2 billion. The demographic study increased 2019 CAS and net FAS\/CAS adjustment by $60 million. For 2020 and 2021, our updated assumptions increased net FAS\/CAS adjustments by $140 million and $80 million respectively. And over the three-year period, our required funding is about $100 million lower.","Moving to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.6%. Based on year-to-date results and our updated fourth quarter analysis, we now expect the tax rate in the low 16% range for the year. Wrapping all that up and considering year-to-date results, we are increasing our mark-to-market adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $20.10 to $20.35. This continues to be based on approximately $170 million weighted average shares outstanding. Free cash flow increased $352 million in the quarter. Year-to-date, we've generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow. Based on year-to-date results and our fourth quarter outlook, we are raising the bottom end of the free cash flow range by $100 million.","We now expect $2.7 billion to $3 billion for the year. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion, as well as share repurchases of approximately $750 million. And as planned, we retired $500 million of debt in the third quarter. Beyond this year, we expect growing cash flows driven by higher sales and earnings, some improvements in working capital and modest required pension funding. Regarding capital expenditures, we continue to invest in growth opportunities as robust backlog growth continues. We are still targeting capex at about 2.5% of sales in 2021.","In summary, we had a solid third quarter and we expect strong results for the remainder of the year. I think we're ready for Q&A. Todd?","Todd Ernst","Erica, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter Arment","Afternoon, Kathy, Ken, Todd welcome.","Ken Bedingfield","Yes, thanks.","Peter Arment","Kathy, thanks for the -- all the details on the realignment. Could you maybe give us just your thoughts on, sometimes when you do a realignment, you do shine a bright light on something that doesn't fit. Is this going to result in any portfolio shaping and just any updated thoughts on that? Thanks.","Kathy Warden","Yes, thanks for the question. And you're absolutely right, as we did this realignment, we've looked in depth of what we had in the portfolio to ensure that we were getting things aligned in a way that would create the most value for the company going forward. And I'm really pleased with the structure we're putting in place, it seizes the opportunity that we knew we had in space to bring the portfolio together in the new Space sector. I'm also excited about the creation of the Defense Systems sector, as it brings together some of our munitions and integrated air and missile defense capabilities in a tighter way along with our sustainment strategies, which deal with customers' very quick-turn requirement. So, this has really been about the forward look in our company and seizing those opportunities that exist. And as we did shine a light on the whole of the portfolio, there wasn't anything that didn't fit within the structure that we created. But, of course, I continue to look at that on a regular basis and as we execute the strategies that we defined in this newer realignment, we'll continue to assess just that question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. This is Kristine [ph] dialing in for Ron today. And -- yes. I just wanted to follow up on the B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization effort. Are the operating issues you're facing there related to the re-baselining of the program, and then also, should we expect lower margins in this program to continue to your B-2 contracts going forward or is this issue kind of a one-time thing?","Kathy Warden","So, Kristine, I'll start and then hand it over to Ken to talk about the financial implications of what we saw on B-2 this quarter. We are managing thousands of contracts across the company and delivering very strong performance. And sometimes contracts are re-baselined as we did report earlier in the year, the B-2 program. What we saw this quarter was an adjustment there that Ken outlined in his comments related to the performance on that program. We feel very good about where we are in completing major milestones on our way to finalizing and executing the B-2 program. It is complex to update a system of that type, but we now have our arms around those challenges. So, I'll turn it over to Ken to talk a little bit more about the financial implications.","Ken Bedingfield","Thanks, Kathy and Kristine, I appreciate the question. Let me just say that, as I mentioned in my comments, we do believe that our EAC reflects the cost that we think will be required to complete the program. And as we look at our portfolio and I'll just go back to Kathy's comments, a portfolio of many different programs and contracts across not just the Aerospace sector, but across the company. We don't expect this program as it will book essentially a lower margin from now until completion to have any material impact on our overall segment margin rate at either AS or in total for the company, again, given the very diverse portfolio that we manage on a day-to-day basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Hey, good morning. Thanks. Ken, maybe if you could talk about -- you mentioned repaying some of the debt. When you look out beyond this year, there's some debt coming due each of the next couple of years. Can you talk about the approach that you plan to take there?","Ken Bedingfield","Sure, Seth. I would say as we look forward, we do have debt coming due. We also have a growing EBITDA as we look at growing the business, growing the top-line and maintaining strong margins, and that growing EBITDA gives us some naturally deleveraging there. So, as we look at that, I would say, we've got some optionality on what to do and depending on the value-creating opportunities that we see in front of us will very much shape what we do in terms of that debt repayment strategy, and we'll continue to evaluate what are the most value-creating uses of our capital and that will really shape it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you. Good afternoon, Kathy and Ken. Kathy, you made some preliminary comments on 2020. Can you talk about your comments regarding margin mix and having it consistent or margins being consistent, can you talk about mix within the portfolio, how you see it transitioning from mature to development programs, if you could give some color?","Kathy Warden","So, we'll be giving detailed guidance in January in our new structural alignment, but my comments did apply to the company as a whole seeing our segment operating margin rate stay consistent with 2019 guidance. And as we look at what's happening within our segment operating margin rate, we are taking on additional development work and there is some downward pressure on margin rates as a result, but we're also having very good cost management, which is offsetting our rates and allowing us to keep both competitive rates to win new business, but also healthy segment operating margin rate, and we expect that trend to continue into 2020. So, it's like a duck on water. While we're remaining consistent, there is a lot happening beneath to keep the margin rates consistent even as we take on additional development work.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss","Thanks, good afternoon, everyone. Wanted to -- on the mid-single-digit sales growth guidance, Ken, you had been hinting potentially something higher than that on the last call, I know you talked about Lake City. How much does Lake City's -- was Lake City kind of the only change versus what you said prior and how does that impact things in '20 and I guess in the '21 as well? Thanks.","Ken Bedingfield","Of course. Yes, as we look at our sales growth for 2020, really Lake City has the biggest impact that we see versus the previous outlook that we had provided. We look at Lake City as probably having about a 1% impact on what we had expected for 2020 sales. And certainly, as we look forward, we see -- again, after the Lake -- after Lake City coming out, mid-single sales growth, solid margins and then again that growing cash. So, we're looking forward to performing on the existing portfolio driving that growth and turning that into margin cash.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, good afternoon. Ken, a question for you just coming back to the couple of comments you made on cash. I appreciate the color on easing capex and improving working capital. Can you maybe take it a step further and give us an idea of what conversion looks like over the next few years and maybe in 2021 and in particular given your comments there on capex levels?","Ken Bedingfield","Sure, Rajeev. Let me first comment -- from a conversion perspective, I would just say, you really need to be careful as you think about conversion for a number of reasons. I mean, first of all, the pension impact, as well as the amortization of PI and things like that. So, let me really focus on kind of how we're looking at cash and as we look forward to 2020 and beyond, we'll provide detailed guidance in January and walk you through all that. I'll just say that we've been clear that this business is going to be a strong generator of cash as we look forward.","And let me just kind of walk through some of the drivers there. As I said, we continue to expect solid sales growth for several years and that's really driven by our portfolio alignment to customer needs. And I would say it's demonstrated by the strong backlog that we've been generating and quite frankly, we continue to expect to generate in Q4 and 2020. And as I mentioned, we continue to expect to generate strong margins and convert those margins into cash.","Rajeev Lalwani","Yes, that's what he asked just about kind of taking an [Phonetic] answer, do you want to say it or just kind of ...","Kathy Warden","Well.","Ken Bedingfield","Erica, can you mute the other line, please? given our confidence -- given our confidence on our expected 2019 cash performance, we did increase the bottom end of the range, as Kathy mentioned to $2.7 billion, and we continue to be confident on our 2020 free cash flow growth. So, as we've been investing in the business to drive growth and a lot of that investment at AS, where we've grown the business 30% in three years, and at IS, that will grow double-digits in 2019, we continue to expect about $1.2 billion of capex this year or about 3.5% of sales.","And looking at 2020, we expect capex to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of sales as we trend down to the 2.5% range in 2021. And I'd just say these investments continue to support our growing backlog and a robust set of near-term opportunities across multiple domains, including restricted space. So, just moving on from capex, again, pensions are well funded, some of the best funded plans in the industry, and that offers us structural advantage in our new business captures. Working capital as I mentioned, should moderate a bit starting in 2020, a bit more opportunity probably in the out-years, some of that being timing of cash receipt milestones and some of that continued focus on solid working capital management.","Operator","Your next question is from Doug Harnett with Bernstein.","Doug Harnett","Thank you, good afternoon. I want -- I wanted to understand a little bit better the growth trajectory in -- on the AS side, and if you look at the elements of this, I mean, you have F-35, clearly, there is some restricted space growth, but on autonomous systems in the release you refer to Global Hawk, but when we look at autonomous systems, it looks heavily biased toward Hail Systems, and those appear -- appear to be somewhat episodic in nature, I mean, on Global Hawk, NATO AGS, Triton. Can you talk about how we should think about this as more of a long-term trajectory with autonomous platforms?","Kathy Warden","Yes, Doug. So, as I think about the opportunity for unmanned systems, we've clearly seen some adoption for unmanned in applications like intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. As we look into the future, we believe unmanned systems will be utilized for more missions and we also see the opportunity for more international sales of unmanned systems as export regulations are considered and perhaps addressed to allow more of its capability to get into the hands of our allied nation. So, when we think about UAS under over a long-term trajectory, we see a continued evolution of these platforms into additional mission, we see them continuing to evolve in terms of their technical capabilities and these are the areas that we are investing in as a company. Today, there's everything from remotely piloted to truly autonomous systems, as you know, we tend to operate on the high end of that sector and we believe more missions will continue to evolve to that higher end capability as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS.","Myles Walton","Thanks, good afternoon. Kathy, I know that in the -- Kathy in the 10-Q, you alluded to the FTC disclosure specifically as the rates of the competition for GBSD. I'm just curious in your conversations with the customer, how they may or may not view this as an impediment to kind of bids being received, which I guess have a December -- mid-December is I guess the timeline for that?","Kathy Warden","Yes, thanks, Myles. So, we did indeed receive an inquiry from the FTC, and I want to note that we've been working with the FTC and the Department of Defense to ensure our compliance with the FTC decision in order that were -- that governs our ability to enter into the transaction of acquiring Orbital ATK and we're going to continue to do so. This is just a more formal inquiry that we are responding to as part of this latest request and that's why we disclosed it in the Q.","With regard to the GBSD competition, we haven't seen any changes regarding the RFP process since the [Phonetic] final RFP was released this summer. As you know, we have established a nationwide team and it's ready to go in meeting the Air Force's technical and schedule requirements for the competition. So, we're looking forward to supporting and submitting our proposal in December, and we've had no indications that there will be any change to the acquisition strategy at this point, and both the Department and the Air Force has made statements as recently as this week about their support for the program.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Good afternoon, team. Kathy, I just wanted to ask about more broadly program performance. I mean, this is I think the only -- only the second quarter I can recall on a decade, where there were more than one negative performance call-out, and I just -- I think the last one was a little more than a year ago. So, I just wanted to make sure there is not some sort of trend here that especially, with the realignment, you guys will have some stuff moving around, and I wonder as we go through that, if you can just talk about your confidence level that you have that other stuff may not emerge as you go through that process because it's got a lot of complexity and you guys are managing a lot right now. So just broadly, if you could speak to program performance, I'd appreciate it?","Kathy Warden","Yes, thanks, Carter. As I look at our program performance, it continues to be very strong. I'm particularly proud with some of the large development efforts that we've undertaken, as well as our ramp on major production programs that we are delivering on those very well, you've seen some public statements by our customers about how pleased they are with our performance on some of those, so I won't rehash them here. But every year, we do have a small number of programs that require negative EAC adjustments based on performance out of the thousands of contracts that we're managing and sometimes the timing of those adjustments causes a particular segment's operating margin rate to fall below our expectations in that quarter.","You're referring to that this quarter with AS and a little over a year ago with Mission Systems. But as you've seen over time, our performance management has remained strong and we're yielding good margins as a result of these circumstances being few and far between and fairly isolated. So, that was the case that you saw in AS this quarter. I'll also note, we had positive EAC adjustments that delivered to both expected segment operating margins and that happened in TS this quarter and is driving the increase in segment operating margin guidance at both MS and TS for the year. So, performance overall is still very strong in our company, and as a result, we're continuing to hold our guidance for the year on operating margin performance. Carter, if I could just add, I would say that in terms of the items that we called out this quarter, we were really trying to indicate what was the trend between last year's third quarter and this year's third quarter and help you understand the movement there as opposed to trying to identify the two items as having a longer impact on our performance. So, really it was a comment with respect to just the trend between Q3 '18 and Q3 '19.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn","Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to turn to -- hey, guys, I wanted to turn to TS, especially since we really won't be able to see it in the future, but it seems like under the hood, it's accelerating here with high single-digit growth to the US government, double-digit growth internationally. And since the headwinds are dissipating here in Q4, could this business despite the -- in its old form, for example, see mid-to-high single-digit sales growth next year if we thought about it in its present form because I think that's going to be a little bit obscured, so I'm curious?","Kathy Warden","So Rob, certainly, this year we have worked to reposition TS to be more competitive, that's been some good cost management, it's then rebuilding a stronger pipeline, and I'm really proud of what the team has done there and you see in the third quarter, a return to growth year-over-year and a strong operating margin. I believe that can persist and as we said, we do expect this to be a growing segment of our business in 2020. I would not go with far to say high single-digits, I would see it more in the low-to mid-single-digits, it is on a bit of a ramp and we still have some VITA burning off through the remainder of this year. So, that would be my macro outlook, and I'll hand it to Ken for any other comments he wants to make.","Ken Bedingfield","Yes, let me -- I guess, what I would say is, just to kind of frame up TS for the quarter and just to make sure we're all on the same page. We did see 3% growth at TS quarter-over-quarter, and I think you might be referring to in the schedules in the footnotes, there were some higher sales to the US government as opposed to some inter-segment sales and we've been working at TS to make -- essentially for TS to be the prime on certain international programs and particularly, International Hail and some others, where they were previously a sub to AS. So what you, I think are seeing somewhat there is, they are priming some of those programs that are some FMS, some through the US government as well, there were some B-2 work, where they were previously through AS, where now they are the prime.","But as we look at it at a top level 3% growth this quarter. We look forward to the continued growth of the TS sector in 2020 as it's a part of the Defense Systems. But broadly, we would -- wouldn't necessarily see it in that, that high single-digit range that you -- high single-digit range that you were referring to. I think some of that is just movement in the different parts between -- in our segment and the prime work.","Operator","Your next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Ken, just going back to the segment margins for 2020, I think you've talked about the possibility of expanding margins modestly over time here, because you've mixed down a bunch over the past few years and maybe have hit a floor in that mixing down. And in 2020 you'll be -- at AS you'll be now comping against this -- the issue in this quarter hopefully not repeating it, Lake City out, I think helps the margin compare. Mission Systems is your largest earnings contributor and highest margin segment and I think may grow the fastest next year, actually, would love to hear your thoughts on that since that one's maybe not accelerating as quickly as we thought. But, so -- it seems like there are some margin uppers next year. Am I not appreciating how much development or classified work is still coming in or should we be thinking about flat as a floor with some upside potential?","Ken Bedingfield","So as we look at 2020 margins, I would say, first of all, as we think about 2019, we are essentially for the full-year still projecting where we expect it to be for 2019 from a segment margin basis, and each of the sectors is consistent to where it's been with the exception of TS, where we're looking at that increasing. You had some questions about AS and I would say, again, their forecast for '19 is consistent with where it is today.","And -- so I don't necessarily think of that differently from a Lake City perspective, certainly, we don't see that as having a significant impact overall on the portfolio. And just kind of thinking through it, we're -- we'll provide guidance in January when we get to that point. We certainly will work in 2020 to continue to perform on our portfolio and see the ability to drive up those margin rates as we work through the year and we've tried to do in the past, but we do continue to have some early-phase development work in particular, IS has some early-phase development work in the restricted space area or in the national security space as we call it. And that will be one of the drivers to what you will see, I think to your question about the fastest grower what I think you will ultimately see as the Space sector as the fastest grower in 2020. But again, we'll provide more detail and guidance when we get to the January call.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi.","Jon Raviv","Thank you. Just following up on margin question in 2020, but a big -- bit bigger picture. Ken, you -- Ken, you started talking about the IS classified being some of the pressure there, can you just identify some other areas of the business that are seeing more of that development pressure? And then on a related note, is there something different about the development that you're doing today versus what you're doing maybe a few years ago that might be putting a little more pressure on early-on rates perhaps anything to do with contract structures requiring more risk upfront or anything like that? Thank you.","Ken Bedingfield","So, as we look at it, I don't see anything different honestly, Jon, with respect to what we're doing today. I mean, simply when we start in the early phase of a long development program, we're identifying the risks and therefore we're tending to book a lower rate as we try to burn down those risks over time. So, no change in how that's worked over the years. I think the biggest change being that we're seeing more opportunities for early development growth. And those are opportunities that we're more than willing to take on, and those will lead to those next-generation production programs that will provide that additional opportunity for margin expansion down the road.","So, I don't see any change. I mean, as I think about some of the restricted programs, they may not be multi-year awards, but many of them are multi-year in periods of performance. And so we're just managing risk over that long-term period of performance and again trying to create those opportunities as we look forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much. Maybe going back to Myles's question, the FTC investigation. Do you expect it to have any impact on when the GBSD decision might be made and roughly when might that be? And have you had any pressure or kind of suggestion from the customer that maybe you might consider the national team proposal that Boeing has made?","Kathy Warden","So, Cai, we do not currently expect any change to the Air Force acquisition strategy as a result of this inquiry. They do you plan to award next August, so there is some time. Our proposal is due in December, and so obviously we will continue to monitor that, but right now, we do not see any impact. And in terms of the question about any pressure, we are not receiving any pressure to engage in a national team, because I would point out that we do have a, what we're calling nationwide team that includes many large and small companies across the country, who are bringing strong capability that will support our GBSD bid.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard [ph] with Buckingham.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Kathy, Ken, Todd, good afternoon. How are you?","Ken Bedingfield","Good. How are you, Rich?","Kathy Warden","Well, thanks.","Unidentified Analyst","So, an F-35 question with just a few parts to it as usual partly based on your opening remarks. So, the House and Senate fiscal 2021 mark-up has an increase in the F-35 quantities by 12 or 18 aircraft depending on which version you believe impacting I think Lot 14. So to the best you Ken as always, could you tell us what's being assumed in your 2020 guide for F-35 quantities? Now Kathy, you mentioned no disruption to your guide from the CR, but I wanted to know and maybe it's pressing you a little bit here. Is it possible that you could alter your guide depending on what happens in November when the CR expires and we potentially have a budget with possibly higher F-35 quantities, what do you think you likely captured all the -- all likely scenarios? And then finally, you've had enviable margins on the program, just wanting to know if that continues with the block buy? Thanks.","Kathy Warden","Great. So, I'll start with some of your more macro questions and then turn it to Ken on the quantity specifically. As I noted in my comments, we do not see an impact on our guide for a for a short-term CR. If we were to sustain a longer-term CR, that would impact to cause us to revisit our guidance, and I would include F-35 quantity in that statement. We have contemplated the possible quantities on F-35 changing through the appropriations process and feel that that's adequately reflected in our guide for '20 -- will be in our guide for 2020, because of course at this point, we've just given 2020 outlook. The other thing that I'll note is on F-35, we continue to focus on performing and driving down the cost curve and being a good partner to Lockheed Martin, but we also have opportunities on the program that are causing some growth for us over the next several years. One, of course, is increased sustainment work on the program, which I've spoken to before. And we're also seeing growth from the Block IV modernization program. We're working new development on our sensors specifically, radar, comms, navigation and identification sensors, and this will yield production opportunity in the long-term. So, we think lots 14 and beyond, and we have some production growth to support additional bearing with quantities increasing between lots 12 and 14. So, those aren't significant drivers. They're not nearly as significant as the production quantity itself, but those are some additional opportunities that we have in both the near and the longer-term on the program. And I'll turn it to Ken to add anything he'd like.","Ken Bedingfield","I think you -- you've nailed it there, Kathy. I would say, we certainly wouldn't want to go into the quantities that we've assumed for our 2020 outlook at this point, Rich, but we are continuing to perform on the program, proud of the performance that we've seen at both really at all of the sectors, who are supporting the program, supporting our customers. And we have continued to increase quantities and we'll see some continued ramp, and then Kathy kind of talked about what that longer-term profile looks like. So, I think that's -- that really captures it.","Todd Ernst","Erica, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Yes. You made a comment that Lake City would be about 1% sales impact next year, that says to me that you may still -- you may have Lake City for half of the year, because I would have thought the total impact would have been about 2% of sales? And then my second question is, how long does the current B-2 contract for which you took would look like a pretty sizable hit in the quarter last? Thanks.","Ken Bedingfield","Sure. Thanks, George. On Lake City, you are correct. We do have a transition from ourselves to the new provider of that service and so we will be performing on that program for at least the first half of the year for 2020. And so we will see some volume on that and the 1%, I was referring to was actually the reduction that we see to the previous outlook we had for sales, so, about a 1% reduction to our previous outlook relative to Lake City. From a B-2 perspective, George, I would say that I wouldn't want to comment extensively on the period of performance other than to say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're well along on program. We're making good progress. We're passing milestones. And I would just point out to your question about the substantial amount of the adjustment, I would just say that in regards to the adjustments at Aerospace Systems this quarter, neither one of them was in excess of $20 million. Again, we largely highlighted those as having an impact on the trend from our Q3 margin rate of 2018 to our Q3 margin rate of 2019. So, just a little color there for you.","Todd Ernst","Okay. I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy for final remarks.","Kathy Warden","Thank you, Todd. One correction from my commentary that I want to make sure I convey is the total backlog, not total restricted backlog growth year-to-date is 22%. So again, I want to thank our team for another strong quarter of financial and operating performance. We're executing well, building on our backlog for profitable growth and strategically aligned to our customers' highest priorities. And all of this provides us an exceptional platform for sustained value creation. So, we're focused on delivering a solid finish to 2019 and a strong start to 2020 with our new organization alignment. I look forward to updating you again in January and providing detailed 2020 guidance in that call. Thank you for joining our call today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Brent and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Steve Movius","Thanks Brent, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year end 2015 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation, that you can access on our web site. First, a reminder that our 2015 financial results are reported in four sectors, our new three sector configuration is effective as of January 1, 2016. We will be filing an 8-K in April, which will present historical financial information in our new sector structure.","Also, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call might also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in the supplemental PowerPoint presentation. On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wes Bush","Thanks Steve. Hello everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Well I want to start by congratulating the entire Northrop Grumman team on another outstanding year. In addition to excellent financial results, we took some major steps to position the company for the future. We look forward to building on 2015 successes, as we continue our focus on performance, portfolio, and capital deployment, and as we take on new opportunities in 2016.","Strong operational performance and effective cash deployment supported another year of value creation for shareholders, customers, and employees. Solid margin rates from all four of our businesses combined to generate a segment operating margin rate of 12.4% and earnings per share of $10.39, a 7% increase. Free cash flow before pension contributions was $2 billion, and we returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders. In total, we repurchased 19.3 million shares for $3.2 billion this year, reduced our weighted average share count by approximately 10%, and completed our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015.","At year end, $4.3 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. Continued strong cash generation also supported our 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. We raise the quarterly dividend by 14% and paid shareholder $603 million in dividends in 2015. Total shareholder return for the year was slightly more than 30%.","The first priority of our capital deployment strategy, is to invest in our businesses. 2015 capital spending totaled $471 million, and we increased our IRAD investment by 25% to $712 million, or 3% of sales, and we perceive significant opportunities ahead.","In addition to strong financial results, we captured several important awards that position us well going forward. While LRSB was our most high profile competitive win in 2015, we had several other key strategic awards. Global Hawk solidified its position as the nation's next generation high altitude ISR platform, with a $3.2 billion IDIQ award for development, modernization, retrofit and sustainment activities. Congressional notification was completed for Japan's purchase of Global Hawks, and we received $437 million in FMS contracts for E2Ds for Japan.","In the mid-altitude long endurance unmanned domain, we were selected for phase-3 of turn, which is a joint effort between DARPA and the Office of Naval Research, to demonstrate a next generation unmanned system for Maritime ISR and strike from small deck naval vessels. This important win, built on the unique naval unmanned capabilities, that we demonstrated through programs like UCAS, Fire Scout and Triton. And as many of you know, UCAS demonstrated fully autonomous unmanned aerial refueling last year, building on prior milestones of autonomous unmanned aircraft carrier take-offs and landings.","Electronic Systems won important U.S. competitions like SEWIP Block 3and Kirkham. Both wins demonstrate our success and expanding into market adjacencies. SEWIP represents our entry into next generation sea-based electronic warfare, and Kirkham expands our infrared countermeasures presence into rotary winged aircraft protection. These wins are domestic programs, but they have long term potential for international sales.","Also in Electronic Systems, Saber radars were selected for Taiwan to upgrade of its F-16 fleet, and we continue to work with Lockheed Martin on other international F-16 upgrade opportunities.","Information Systems won the navy's JCREW award and will provide software programmable jammers to protect the warfighter from device triggered IEDs. These systems will provide important capabilities to both the Navy and the Air Force. IS was also competitively awarded a seven year IDIQ contract by the U.K. government to develop and deliver cyber security solutions, in support of data security and information assurance.","And in Technical Services, Saudi Arabia awarded one of our joint ventures, which is consolidated IPS an approximately $950 million contract for the Ministry of National Guard Training Support.","Year end total backlog was $35.9 billion. New awards in 2015 totaled $21.3 billion. Book to bill was strong in IS, TS and ES. Awards in AS are generally lumpy, and did not include LRS-B. And AS and ES awards did not include F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10, other than long lead items. We continue to capture international opportunities, and at year end, international awards represented 16% of our total backlog.","As we look ahead, we have more stability on the budget front, and have better budget environment than we have had in several years. The bipartisan budget act passed in November raised the statutory limit on the desk ceiling until March 2017, and provided much needed relief on the BCA sequester caps in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations act provided an increase in the procurement accounts and provides welcome funding stability for our customers. Our programs continue to be well supported, with a number of them receiving plus ups.","While we have improved budgetary stability in FY 2016, the Department of Defense faces a shortfall in funding for fiscal 2017. We look forward to learning more about how this will be addressed, when the DoD introduces his FY 2017 budget in the coming weeks.","Turning to guidance for 2016, we expect sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with earnings per share of $9.90 to $10.20, and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion after capital expenditures of $700 million to $1 billion.","Our 2016 guidance is indicative of another year of strong operating performance. This year, we are beginning work on some major new development programs, as we transition from a number of legacy production programs in aerospace and electronic systems to new production programs, in aerospace emission systems. And our restricted portfolio continues to grow, validating our technology leadership in several domains.","I would note, that our guidance assumes that the stop-work order on LRS-B will be lifted in February, and that we will begin to ramp-up in performance on this program over the course of the year.","So in summary, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company and for our shareholders. Going forward, our priorities remain the same, drive strong sustainable performance, generate strong cash, and effectively deploy that cash, and continue to optimize our portfolio, to ensure our alignment with global security priorities.","We continue to build on our solid track record, and we look forward to continued long term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees.","So now, I will turn the call over to Ken, for a more detailed discussion of results and our guidance. Ken?","Ken Bedingfield","Thanks Wes and good afternoon everyone. I want to add my congratulations to our team for their continued outstanding work. Today, I will briefly review 2015 results, and then discuss our 2016 guidance.","2015 sales totaled $23.5 billion, slightly below our expectations, primarily due to reduction in lower margin material sales at Information Systems, some of which slipped into 2016. International sales increased to 14% of sales in 2015, an increase of approximately 10% over 2014, even with negative foreign exchange impacts. We expect stable international sales in 2016, as our NATO AGS program ramps down, and other international programs ramp-up. However, we expect international opportunities to be an important source of growth for the company over the next several years.","Our businesses performed well and ended the year with a 12.4% segment operating margin rate. Operating performance this year is comparable to last year, considering that 2014 margin included $75 million legal settlement and about $45 million in non-recurring HAFTA benefit.","The year-over-year trends reflect strong performance by all four sectors, with particularly strong performance by Information Systems, where margin rate increased 70 basis points over last year. Total operating margin rate for 2015 was 13.1% comparable to 2014. Higher net FAS\/CAS adjustment was offset by an increase in unallocated corporate expenses.","You will recall, that last quarter we mentioned fourth quarter unallocated corporate expenses would be higher than last year, due to the adoption of a tax method change and other state tax items. We have strong full year EPS of $10.39, which includes the benefit of a R&D credit.","Turning to cash, 2015 was another good year, both in absolute dollar and on a per share basis. Free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions totaled $2 billion and we returned $3.8 billion or $19.75 per share to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. So it was an outstanding year, in terms of creating value for our shareholders. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect consolidated sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with a segment operating margin in the high 11% range.","Turning to sector guidance, we expect sales at Aerospace systems to increase to the low $10 billion range. This reflects a low single digit growth rate, and includes higher volume for space and unmanned programs.","In manned military aircraft, we will continue to see higher volume for programs like E2D and F-35, which will be partially offset by lower volume for the FA-18. Our 2016 revenue guidance for Aerospace systems, also contemplates modest LRS-B sales, assuming the customer issues are noticed to proceed in February. It also assumes a gradual month-by-month step-up in headcount, as engineering on the program gets underway. We expect a mid-to-high 11% margin rate for aerospace in 2016.","In addition to continued strong performance on our current portfolio of programs, our 2016 AS margin rate guidance, reflects the booking rate approach on LRS-B, that we believe is appropriate for the start of this incentive based development contract. We will review our booking rate over time, including for potential increases, as we work to retire risk and realize incentive fee milestones.","For Mission Systems, we expect 2016 revenue in the high $10 billion range, which is a stable top line. Our MS sales guidance includes international growth, modest declines in some mature programs, and some impact from in-theater force reductions. We expect MS operating margin rate in the mid to high 12% range.","For Technology Services, we expect sales in the mid $4 billion range, with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Our 2016 sales guidance represents a low single digit sales decline. Most of that decline is expected in our short cycle and services programs, including ICBM program ramp-down. We expect the decline will be partially offset by international growth.","Consolidated segment operating margin rate is expected to be in the high 11% range, reflecting a portfolio of changing business mix with less mature fixed price production revenue. We expect our total operating margin rate will be approximately 12% after net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million and unallocated corporate expense of approximately $200 million. Based on 2015 return on planned assets of negative 1%, a discount rate of 4.53%, and expected 2016 return on planned assets of 8%, 2016 FAS is estimated at $585 million and CAS at $860 million.","For 2017 and 2018, we currently expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion and $1.1 billion for 2018. For FAS expense, we currently expect $470 million and $400 million for 2017 and 2018, respectively. And for your modeling purposes, holding all other assumptions constant, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate results in a change of approximately $70 million in FAS expense, and a 100 basis point change in planned asset returns versus our expected rate of return results in a $50 million change in FAS expense, while CAS is less sensitive to both.","In aggregate on a GAAP basis, the funded status of our plans was 82% at the end of 2015, reflecting the impact of our higher discount rate, discretionary contributions in 2015, and actual plan asset returns. Our qualified plans are 86% funded. Our required contributions remain minimal, about $80 million in 2016 and 2017, increasing to about $125 million in 2018, given our current assumptions.","We expect a tax rate of approximately 30% in 2016, which include the now permanent R&D credit.","Our 2016 earnings per share guidance of $9.90 to $10.20 assumes our weighted average shares are reduced by approximately 6% to about 181 million shares. We expect 2016 free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions to range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016.","Capital expenditures in 2015 were lower than originally expected, as we actively managed our capital spending to support requirements that slipped into 2016. In addition to some of our 2015 spending moving into 2016, CapEx will be elevated this year due to increased programmatic requirements, as well as the planned purchase of several buildings. We have leased some of these buildings for many years and now have the opportunity to purchase them. We expect these purchases to total about $300 million and to support our continued focus on cost reduction, affordability and competitiveness.","Our guidance reflects another year of strong operating performance and strong cash generation, supportive of the continued investment in our businesses and distribution of cash to our shareholders.","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to note that due to the classified nature of the LRS-B program, we won't be providing any information beyond what we've said in our prepared remarks. So we will not be taking any questions on that program. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?","Steve Movius","Thanks, Ken. Before we begin the Q&A, please note, as usual, no more than a single question per participant. Feel free to reenter the queue if you have additional questions. Brent, we're ready to start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland","Good morning, gentlemen.","Ken Bedingfield","Hello, Carter. How are you?","Carter Copeland","Fantastic. Ken, could you help us maybe bridge what moved in and out of Aerospace? I know you added Asuza and took Electronic Attack out. But to go from 11 to low 10s, how should we think about the relative size of the pieces that move there? And then just to add on to that, the net margin impact of one versus the other, if there's anything of significance there to note.","Ken Bedingfield","So Carter, just to make sure we're on the same page with in and out, you're correct, Azusa and Bethpage out. Think of them as relatively even sized businesses. In terms of Aerospace, 2015 was just over $10 billion, $10.004 billion in sales. As we mentioned, we're projecting low 10s for sales in 2016, so low single digit growth at Aerospace. In terms of margin, I wouldn't think of those two businesses as significantly different in terms of margin rates.","Carter Copeland","Okay. Great. Thanks. And just a quick one on the CapEx on the office buildings, $300 million seems like a big amount. Is this Space Park or something that's high end real estate that we should be thinking that is there, or is it just the scale of a lot of buildings?","Ken Bedingfield","It's not Space Park, which is already, for the most part, owned. But it is a number of buildings. And it certainly is a large capital outlay, but we do believe over the long term, the benefits are such that we'll realize affordability, we'll have obviously avoided rent expense and those cash outflows down the road. So we think it's a good decision, buildings that are core to our new three sectors and particularly Mission Systems.","Carter Copeland","Okay. Great. I'll let someone else ask.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. Wes, you talked about a number of new wins during the course of the year, whether it's SEWIP or Kirkham or so on. If we were to look at old versus new, what do you figure the percentage of new business is for 2016 versus 2015?","Wes Bush","So like most years, the challenge with new business, with the way the appropriations process works and the conversion into sales, it takes a little bit of time for the new wins to transition from the win, and then, of course, the appropriation, into the actual outlay and the contracting and then converting it into sales. So of all of those things that I just mentioned as we went through, none of them, or in aggregate, I would say, they do not represent a large fraction of our sales in 2016. Most of these things will manifest in the sales that we'll see in 2017 and beyond. So I wouldn't venture a guess, because it would only be that, in terms of the actual percentage. But I think to get to the general vector of your question, it takes a little bit of time to pull those things through, but we're pulling hard.","Howard Rubel","All right. Thanks very much.","Wes Bush","Thanks, Howard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Pete Skibitski","Good morning, guys. Wes, I saw during the quarter some press about this new Northrop advanced design organization. And it sounds like a lot of pretty rapid aircraft prototyping efforts, stuff like that, like the old days. And I was wondering what's driving that. Is it connected to the third offense strategy or just what the strategy is there?","Wes Bush","Yes, I appreciate the question. When we think about the pace of technology and also, quite frankly, the pace of the threats that our nation faces, we've all been frustrated over the last, it's more than a decade now, at the general slowing that we seem to see and the ability to take good ideas and turn them into reality. So part of our overall technology and development focus in the Company is focused around speed. Because speed does matter. Speed matters to support the war fighter. Obviously, it matters as we're addressing a lot of these emerging threats that we're seeing around the globe. And we don't have to wait for a procurement program to come out for us to jump into things and to demonstrate that we can move it along a bit more quickly. We can do it, oftentimes, ourselves through our internal investments. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've been increasing those internal investments.","You pointed out the particular category of what we've been doing on the aircraft side and we are especially proud of that. We have the ability within the Company to quite rapidly go from conceptual thinking to prototyping and to flying those prototypes so that we can get good early engineering information and turn that around back into the design approach that we're utilizing to bring actual products to offer to our customer community. And our scale composites organization is a really important part of that process that we utilize in our Company, a really innovative and capable group at scale and have a long track record of demonstrating the speed to product, if you will, in terms of our ability to prototype.","But that's one example of a broader perspective that we have in the Company that the work that we're doing to support our customers needs for the long term needs to not only be at the high end of technology, they need to be able to access it quickly and utilize it in a very effective manner.","Pete Skibitski","Wes, has DoD given you an indication that they would provide production on ramps for you as part of such an endeavor?","Wes Bush","So we try and align what we're doing with the vector that we see Do D on. We don't expect that we just walk in the door and we suddenly get a production turn on. We see these as very important parts of our ability to be competitive. And so we're not actually asking DoD for any assurances in turn ons. We're simply seeing this as the challenge that we collectively have across our industry to make sure that the most advanced technologies are ready quickly for our customers.","Pete Skibitski","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason Gursky","Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","Hello, Jason.","Jason Gursky","I wanted to go back to Howard's question really quickly and see if I couldn't get you to talk a little bit more about the wins in 2015. Which ones do you think represent the biggest long-term strategic opportunity for the Company? And then maybe just comment on when you might expect some of this development work that you've been successful with over the list couple of years to lead to an inflection point in the growth rate overall for the Company?","Wes Bush","I appreciate the question. Last year was phenomenal in terms of our positioning with some of these wins. And as I noted earlier, clearly LRS-B, which is currently under protest, so we're having to wait for that process to work its way through. But just in terms of the win itself, was a very nice win, one that we'd worked hard on for a number of years and we were delighted to see that outcome and to be ready to go and execute that when the time comes. That will represent a meaningful opportunity, a very meaningful opportunity for the Company over time.","But I would not want to overlook many of the other things that happened last year that are so critically important for our long-term positioning in the enterprise. While Triton was not a win, if you will, last year, last year was such a notable year in terms of its programmatic progress that I think it's important to lay that out. It's a program that we've been in development on for a number of years. And the progress that we made last year with the articles that we have flying and the testing that was being done really puts that program in a good place as we move forward this year to be ready to enter into LRIP.","I think that's a really important milestone as we think about these next steps in unmanned capability, Triton representing the natural evolution from Global Hawk. And we see that as an important capability not only for our Navy customer, our direct Navy customer on this, but I think it represents the high altitude long endurance solution that's going to be sought after by many customers, including many of our allies around the globe. So that is sort of in the unmanned domain as, I think, a representative program of the big steps.","The work that was done last year at Electronic Systems to break into some new adjacencies, I also would point out as really important work, notably, the wins on SEWIP and Kirkham. The SEWIP win was one that for us was a long reach into a domain that we think is going to be incredibly important for the future, which is all of the work that's being done by the Navy for advanced electronic warfare. And while over the years in the past we've held a few smaller positions in that regard, SEWIP really does position us in that space in a new way. And we're excited about what that represents and the opportunities that will come with it.","And in Kirkham, this was a move into the rotary wing adjacency for aircraft protection. We've had a long and successful run and have a great future in the fixed wing side of things, but to move into the rotary wing side of it, as well, was another big step forward for us.","So I'll stop there. I could keep going. But I would just point those out as some of the clearly significant milestones that we encountered last year that as we go through the course of this year, but I would say it's really more into next year as we really begin to ramp up on these things, that we'll see an impact on our trajectory.","Jason Gursky","So the second part of the question was just the inflection point on the growth rate, and maybe your last statement there was the answer, but 2017 is the year that we begin to see the acceleration in the growth rate?","Wes Bush","Well, we don't guide for 2017. We're guiding for 2016, so I don't want to get too far out in front of that. But I would go back to a point I made when Howard asked a similar question, which is if you look back over the history of the way that changes in defense spending translate into changes in the industry, I'll say it broadly, the industry's revenue cycle, there's generally a delay. If you look back at the downturn cycle, our most recent experience in that, I think the investment accounts peaked right around 2010 and you saw the related sales and industry peak a couple years later, and I think it's just that is just a reflection of a natural cycle. And if you look back in history at the up cycles, you'll see a similar situation, where it simply takes a little bit of time for the decisions that the Department makes on the new things that it needs to translate all the way from the appropriations cycle through to the outcome cycle.","So I think this is just going to be another one of those situations. Everyone likes to talk about where are we in the trough. And I think it's important to remember that the trough has a part in the rear view mirror which was a steep down cycle, hopefully in the rear view mirror, and then it takes a little bit of time for that transition to come into effect as we climb out of that.","Jason Gursky","Perfect. Thanks.","Wes Bush","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","Wes Bush","Good afternoon, Myles.","Myles Walton","The first one -- or the only one, Steve, that I have, in multiple parts -- is on the side with Aerospace and the growth, I think you implied a low single digit. And I think the only headwind I heard was the F-18 and the size of that I was thinking was a couple hundred million, and everything else it sounded like you rattled off, Ken, was growing, inclusive of the drop in of LRS-B. So I guess I'm just curious A, is the F-18 headwind bigger, or B, is everything else just in a growth mode, but it's a really, really low growth mode?","Ken Bedingfield","Thanks for the question, Myles. I would say F-18 is probably the largest of the declining piece of the business and certainly worth pointing out, as we've been successful on that program and have realized some nice margins out of that. But I think the other thing I would point out is we are seeing lower volume in 2016 in the unrestricted space business, particularly AHF and the James Webb Space Telescope, as those are moving into a more mature phase of their life cycle.","The other piece of the decline that we pointed out was a bit in NATO AGS, as we've reached, again, a level of maturity on that program, as well. So a number of moving parts that go together to give us the low single digit 2016 sales increase.","Myles Walton","Got it. And then just one clarification, on the $300 million of CapEx for the buildings, we should think of this as a one-off and the underlying normalized level of CapEx is $300 million less of what you're telling us?","Ken Bedingfield","Good question, Myles. I think what I would say is, as we've discussed, we do expect CapEx to remain elevated for a couple more years. And that represents our investing in the business for a robust set of opportunities that we see ahead of us. And I wouldn't want to give CapEx guidance beyond 2016, but in terms of the level of elevation, certainly I wouldn't consider the $300 million in where you look at it. I do think those are more of a one-off in 2016. But certainly, we look really hard at every investment we make and we do believe firmly these are worthwhile investments.","Myles Walton","Okay. Thanks.","Wes Bush","And while we're transitioning to our next question, Steve is reminding me that I slipped a couple years in the timeline that I was giving Jason. It is about a two-year delay in the difference between the peaks of DoD budgeting and contractor revenues. I think I said it was 2010 to 2012. It was actually DoD peak in 2008 and contractor revenue is peaking in 2010. But the point is still the same. It's a couple year difference that we've historically seen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David Strauss","Good afternoon. Ken, just wanted to touch on the balance sheet and cash flow. I see you put some additional cash on the balance sheet this past quarter. Can you talk about what you see as the right level of cash on the balance sheet and then also touch on what you've assumed in your operating cash or free cash flow guidance for working capital and cash taxes relative to 2015? Thanks.","Ken Bedingfield","Appreciate the question. I would say that we, in terms of managing cash on the balance sheet, we certainly prudently manage that to make sure that we have got sufficient cash and liquidity. We're north of $2 billion at the end of the year. We were north of $1 billion at the end of the third quarter. So I wouldn't necessarily want to put a target out there on where we are, but we certainly actively manage that.","And in terms of cash guidance, I would say from a working capital perspective, I think we're looking at it as relatively stable, a lot of moving parts in working capital this year, particularly some changes in accruals and mostly timing type items. But cash taxes, I would say that we saw a really good year for cash taxes in 2015. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we'll be able to repeat that in 2016. So I would say a relatively higher level of cash taxes in 2016, but I would say net working capital could be a bit better than it was in 2015.","David Strauss","Any way you could quantify the cash tax headwind, rough level?","Ken Bedingfield","I don't think I'd want to quantify that. I would say that the team, our tax team, actually working really closely with our sector teams, combined to have a great result in 2015. And I wouldn't want to put a number out there, because I suspect that our teams will continue to work hard and do better than what I currently think they could do. So appreciate the question.","David Strauss","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.","Doug Harned","Thank you.","Wes Bush","Hello, Doug.","Doug Harned","Hello. I wanted to talk a little bit about Information Systems in the last quarter and actually in 2015. The margins were good. And I know in the release, there was nothing that appeared there that indicated anything one-time, just all around good performance. So you have a good margin there and then you split Information Systems in two and lose some to Technical Services, the service portion, products over to Mission Systems. But when you look at the Technical Services side going forward, you're projecting 10% margins there. Can you talk about how I would expect the lower margin part of Information Systems would be moving into Tech Services, how do you get to that 10% and have you seen an upshift in the ability to perform on your Information Systems business overall?","Ken Bedingfield","So Doug, I would say that, and let me address first the 2015 piece and a number of parts there that drove the strong margin. First of all, a great performance by the team. We also saw some, as I mentioned, of the lower level of the material sales that have a lower than average margin in that business. So that certainly helped contribute. In terms of looking forward for the new Technology Services sector and its strong margin rate at 10%, it did pick up a number of services business from IS that have actually above margin rates as you look at the legacy IS business, particularly the civil and health businesses that were in IS. So as we look forward, we see technology Services as having a strong 10% margin rate.","Wes Bush","This is Wes. I would add that we've worked hard over the last number of years to remove from our portfolio the lower margin parts of our service business. We've not seen that as really the best fit for the Company for the long term. So I think what you're seeing, in addition to sort of the layout of the components that Ken addressed, I do think you're seeing just a broader move forward in how we position the portfolio and the services part of our business. And it's reflected in the way that we're giving you a forecast for 2016.","Doug Harned","Okay. So that looks like, going forward, that looks like really a 10% type business now, which is great for a service business.","Wes Bush","Well, we are in the process of benchmarking. As you know, we go through a process early each year to sort through what we think the right benchmarks are for our businesses. And of course, we incentivize our team to do better than those benchmarks. So we're not in a place where we're going to give you a forward look on what it should be. But in terms of our guidance for 2016, you can see the number and I think it's reflective of the great work the team's been doing.","Doug Harned","Very good. Thank you.","Wes Bush","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with RBC Capital.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","Hello, Rob.","Robert Stallard","Your colleagues over at Lockheed Martin put some details around their F-35 plan the other day and it's a pretty steep ramp up in 2018. As a major supplier, I was wondering if you're fully capitalized for that move up and whether that move up under your fixed price contract structure will also be helpful to margins? Thank you.","Wes Bush","Well, we're all looking forward to F-35s making progress on the ramp. This was a ramp that we've all been preparing for many years, both in terms of our facilities, as well as making sure that we've got the supply chain capacity and the people capacity to effectively execute the ramp. We're ready and we've been ready. This was a program that, as I said, we've been preparing for quite some time. And I won't speak on behalf of Lockheed, but from a broader team perspective, this has been the topic of a lot of engagement and the assurance that we need to provide collectively to our customer community that we're all going to be able to get this job done.","The nature of the contracting at the prime level I won't address. That's a very appropriate interaction with Lockheed. But moving us into a more normal process, both in the contracting side and on the ramp side of where we really should be on a program like this, we're all looking forward to that.","Ken Bedingfield","And Rob, if I could just add that if you think about F-35 for us, we do have four contracts for F-35, the center fuselage, the radar, the DAS and the C&I. And I will just point out that we are on units of delivery for each of those four contracts. So the timing of the ramp, as you see out of our business, could be a little bit different out of what you'll see out of Lockheed. So just want to make sure you keep that in mind as you look forward.","Robert Stallard","But presuming you'd be a little bit ahead of them, maybe six to nine months or something like that?","Ken Bedingfield","We would be ahead of them in the production cycle, but from a revenue recognition standpoint, not necessarily.","Robert Stallard","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. So Ken, would it be possible to get the three new segment numbers for 2015 so that we can better gauge your guidance and what's getting us from one year to the other?","Ken Bedingfield","Thanks for the question, Cai. We are planning to file an 8-K that will present our realigned structure from the current four sectors at the end of 2015 to the new three sectors as we move forward in 2016. And that 8-K we expect to be filed in April before we file our first quarter 10-Q that will include three years of information on the three-sector format. And that's the earliest we'll be providing that information.","Cai von Rumohr","Can we just get a rough sense? You've told us we're looking at low single digit growth in Aerospace Systems. Because just having this guidance in the absence of knowing the baseline is a little bit difficult to make any kind of guess, even on a full-year basis.","Ken Bedingfield","I would say, Cai, that as we look at it, we provided the guidance on the prepared remarks in terms of the expected sales range and the whether it was growth or flat or slightly declining in terms of Technology Services. And at this point, I think that's the best we can do for you.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein","Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","Hello, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","Can you talk a little bit about, if I look at your 2015, the cash from operations before the discretionary payment, looks like it's a little over $100 million less than what you projected, and that was coupled with a CapEx that came in lower. So what moved out of 2015?","Ken Bedingfield","You know, Sam, I would say that if I look at cash from operations, we were a little bit shy of last year. We had some just some timing of things, timing of cash collections on some fixed price contracts where we have performance based payment terms and some protected negotiations that have driven some delays there, a little bit on some payroll accrual items\/ But overall, I think that it was a strong cash year, cash from ops before the pension prefunding of about $2.5 billion and free cash flow, again before the prefunding, of just north of $2 billion, so a lot of cash generation in the fourth quarter. Our profile has tended to be that way, but this year was a bit more even, for us heavily weighted into the fourth quarter. And we'll work hard to try to bring some of that forward as we look at 2016.","Sam Pearlstein","And if I can follow-up Ken, I think you had said the guidance assumes the share count is down 6%. Is that the share count or are we talking about the average shares? Because that obviously implies very different level of buyback.","Ken Bedingfield","Yes, it's the 6% reduction in the weighted average number of diluted shares.","Sam Pearlstein","Thank you.","Ken Bedingfield","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. You mentioned in the Technology Service business the ramp down on work on ICBM. Wondering if you look out over a multi-year period, do you see modernization of nuclear forces as a key revenue driver?","Wes Bush","This is Wes. I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in that modernization wave. It's another one of these areas that, unfortunately, as a nation, we put off, I think, for probably too, long and so now we're going to have to deal with a significant amount of modernization. It is an area of deep expertise within our enterprise. Most of that expertise is within our Technology Services organization in terms of the historical programs like ICBM. But it's actually resident, we have significant capability in all three of our sectors. So as we look forward at this wave of modernization, it's an area that we do intend to participate in, I think we can bring a lot to the customer community in that regard, and we look forward to addressing those opportunities.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much.","Wes Bush","Thanks, Seth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Yes, just wanted to go through earnings. At the beginning of last year, you said you'd earn $9.20 to $9.50. You made $10.39. So can you go through where the opportunities were last year and if this year would offer similar opportunities to the guidance that you just provided?","Ken Bedingfield","So George, the single largest driver to the guidance last year to the performance this year, the single largest driver would be the R&D credit, which was not in the guide last year, as it was not enacted, versus this year with the permanence of the R&D credit today, we see it as in our guidance. And other than that, it's really about performance. If there was a single program that was a material piece of our performance in 2015, we would have disclosed what that was. So it really was just strong performance by the team across the board, all four of the sectors in 2015 contributing to that performance. As we look forward at 2016, we think about the risks and the challenges that are ahead of us. We think about the opportunities and how we can manage those risks and how we can take the most advantage of those opportunities to drive continuing performance as we look forward. So I think that's really the name of the game.","Wes Bush","The R&D credit is, what, maybe $0.20, $0.25, I don't know whether you specifically disclose it in the release or not. So you still had $0.75 of other items and you're saying those are all in aggregate $0.75, but isolated much less than the $0.25 one-time item?","Ken Bedingfield","Yes, I think that's fair. I would say the R&D credit is more like $0.30 and then the other items are, again, just an amalgamation of strong performance across the Company.","George Shapiro","Okay. And if I might follow-up with a totally different question. You mentioned in the release that the unmanned business had less favorable performance. Could you specify maybe how much that actually was and what programs that it refers to?","Ken Bedingfield","I wouldn't want to refer to the programs or the specific amounts. I will just say again, if it was material on any particular program, we would have disclosed it, but we look forward to realizing opportunities in unmanned as we move forward.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks very much.","Wes Bush","Thanks, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Hello. Thank you guys, appreciate it. Can you guys quantify the margin benefit you're going to get, the SG&A, from the $300 million CapEx spend both this year and then on an ongoing annual basis?","Ken Bedingfield","Hunter, appreciate the question, but I wouldn't want to quantify what that is. I will just say that we take really a disciplined approach to making these investments and we only make these investments when we see a reasonable return. But we do believe that this is significant to our businesses and will provide a long-term benefit in terms of affordability and competitiveness.","Wes Bush","And I would just put a fine point on what Ken just said. It's often the thought to model it into rate structures and that perspective, from how does it drop down to the bottom line quickly. But many of the things that we do of that nature in our Company go precisely, as Ken said, to affordability, to our ability to compete effectively, capture new business, and to address our customers' continuing needs for more capability at lower cost. So when we have the opportunity to do this type of a transaction, if you will, that is clearly cost effective, it just makes a lot of sense for us to take that on. So we look at it, obviously, we demand a return on any type of capital deployment that we do, but it has multiple benefits that I think are important to recognize.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you, Wes and Ken. And just a quick one. I'm sorry for the basic question here, but can you explain to me why F-18 is a headwind this year, given the recent adds we saw in the FY16 budget? Thanks for the time.","Wes Bush","It had been at a much higher rate of production. And so what we're seeing is just the slow, gentle ramp down on the program. We're delight to see some of these additional opportunities on F-18, because it continues to be just a great aircraft and is, I think, performing well for all of its users around the globe. So it's nice to see that, but it's just a cycle down.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn","Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","Hello, Rob.","Robert Spingarn","Hello, guys. I wanted to follow-up on Sam's question, Ken, on the cash. And so I guess if you back out the prefunding in 2015, you're at about, I think you said 2.5 on the OCF. And it looks like it's about the same in 2016 when you adjust, based on the guidance you gave us on free cash flow and CapEx. But with the flattish sales, FAS\/CAS a little lower, margins lower, and cash taxes higher, is there anything else that we should be thinking about there that offsets to the positive?","Ken Bedingfield","No, I think you're thinking about it right, Rob. I would say that if you think about FAS\/CAS, the impact is more higher FAS than it is on the CAS side, so I'd factor that into it. The only other item I would mention is timing of international awards. We had gotten some international advances and been burning those down in 2015. I think I mentioned some of the accrual items, and then again really comes back to continuing to focus on working capital and improve our working capital position from here.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then just, you mentioned international, just brings up one more thing. Wes, in the Mid East, are you seeing pressure there, anything new lately?","Wes Bush","Well, clearly the governments are collectively economically having to deal with the situation in oil. But at the same time, they're having to deal with the threat environment that's all around them. So we continue to see robust demand. We continue to see a very high degree of engagement with our allies in the region. And I suspect that's the way it's going to be for awhile, because of just the reality of the security situation throughout the region. So from our more narrow optic than the broader economic optic, we've not really seen any backing off from the needs for support on the security front and, if anything, in some areas, it's growing.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thank you.","Steve Movius","Brent, I think we'll do one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ron Epstein","Hello. Good morning.","Wes Bush","Hello, Ron.","Ron Epstein","I have maybe a big picture question for you, Wes. Because I think this has worked out well for you guys, but I just want to get your opinion on it. Today, do you think that the DoD is rewarding companies for making their own investments in R&D? I mean, you mentioned on the call you're spending 3% of sales on R&D. Do you think there's a bias today towards contractors that are willing to put more skin in the game than in previous years?","Wes Bush","So the way I would frame that is if you're investing smart in R&D, you're going to be more competitive on what the Department wants to acquire, so the reward comes when you win. And that's really the way we think about this equation, that by investing smartly for R&D, we're going to have the products and capabilities in place that our customers need over time. This is, in many respects, this is the story of our industry over a decade of cycles, that we have to be engaging with our customer community in a way that we can have insight into what their future needs are going to be. Because you can't just wake up one morning and say, I need a different class of performance than I had yesterday. It takes time to get those capabilities in place and we do rely on the DoD having follow through from the stated needs to actually acquiring things, because that's how we get a return on those investments. We go and we compete and when successful, we win and we perform on those programs.","So I don't think there's any significant difference that I would cite in terms of the way that the overall model is working. I think there has been a lot more attention of late, from a DoD perspective, into where are all of the sources of the R&D investment that they can tap into. Because quite frankly, the amount of R&D appropriations that the Department has had available to it to go and make its own investments has declined over the last number of years, and in many respects is declining at exactly the wrong time, while our potential adversaries around the globe are investing much more aggressively in R&D.","So DoD very appropriately looks to the broader ecosystem that supports it and is in need of those investments being made for the long term, and I do think that it pays off if you do it smart. If you're applying that investment in areas that turn out to be the right ones for our customers and if can convert those investments and capabilities into competitive offerings that really meet the customers needs. So I think the model makes sense, but it requires that very high degree of engagement with our customer community to make sure we keep that alignment.","Ron Epstein","Great. Thank you.","Wes Bush","Thank you.","Steve Movius","At this point in time, I'd like to turn the call over to you, Wes, for final comments.","Wes Bush","Thank, Steve. Well, as I said at the beginning of the call, 2015 was an outstanding year for our Company and I'm really proud of what our team accomplished last year. And I have to say, I'm looking forward to what this team can accomplish in 2016. So thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today and really appreciate your continuing interest in our Company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.","I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations.

The overview includes detailed information on each of our three sectors.","On the call today is our Chairman, CEO and President, Wes Bush; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a very strong second quarter, driven by solid operational execution and effective cash deployment. I want to thank our team for their unwavering focus on performance.","Second quarter sales totaled $6 billion, 2% higher than last year's second quarter, driven by growth at both Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. At Aerospace Systems, we're reaching an inflection point, where new programs and the planned ramp-ups on production programs are beginning to outpace declines on mature legacy programs. While we may see some variability in that trend going forward, the growth in manned and autonomous systems drove a 4% second quarter sales increase.","The programs driving sales include our restricted programs, the production ramp-up on F-35 Triton and volume in Global Hawk, as we began production for international customers. These growing programs are more than offsetting the expected declines in AS programs such as NATO AGS, F\/A-18, Advanced EHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.","Sales at Mission Systems grew in the second quarter, driven by higher volume for restricted programs and ramp-ups on programs like F-35, G\/ATOR, SEWIP Block III, JCREW and (2:51). We delivered our first (2:53) Systems in June and we expect this program to continue ramping up.","The reorganization at Technology Services at the beginning of this year has enabled us to sharpen our focus on reshaping its portfolio to better align with our strategy of providing differentiated services and capabilities in this market space. We see this as an important business for our company. And while these portfolio actions may impact sales growth at TS in the near-term, we see this restructuring process as key to aligning our investments and capabilities at TS with our longer-term growth objectives for this business.","Enterprise-wide, as we continue to add new programs and shape our portfolio, we remain focused on sustaining strong performance and operational excellence. This focus enabled all three of our businesses to contribute to a solid 12.2% segment operating margin rate in the second quarter and a 12% rate year-to-date.","Second quarter EPS increased 4% to $2.85. And based on our year-to-date results and a tax benefit that we will record in the third quarter, we are increasing 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.75 to $11 versus our prior guidance of $10.40 to $10.70.","Second quarter cash from operations was approximately $600 million, consistent with last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $173 million and free cash flow totaled $431 million. As we've mentioned on previous calls, our capital spending plans contemplate the purchase of several buildings this year. And during the first half of the year, we implemented those plans, with facilities purchases totaling approximately $240 million. This includes a facility purchased for $80 million in the second quarter.","At the midpoint of the year, capital spending was $471 million and we now expect our 2016 capital spending will range between $800 million and $1 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.","In addition to investing in our businesses, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend 12.5% to an annual rate of $3.60, our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase, and our fifth consecutive double-digit increase.","We also continue to repurchase our shares. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 3.4 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $3.6 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.","We do not yet have an FY 2017 Defense Appropriations Bill. And as Congress has adjourned until September, it is increasingly likely that we will begin the government's fiscal year 2017 with a Continuing Resolution. As you know, a CR will constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. Beginning the new fiscal year with a CR has unfortunately become a familiar scenario. The larger concern is how long the CR lasts. Obviously, the longer a CR lasts, the more disruptive it is to our customers' acquisitions plans. So, we encourage Congress to work together to fund our government and enable its effective operations.","In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results. And we expect our focus on performance to continue to generate solid results for the remainder of 2016, as demonstrated by our updated guidance. We remain well-positioned to achieve profitable long term growth, and we continue to generate value through performance, managing our portfolio and our approach to cash deployment.","So, now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to the team on our second quarter performance. Today, I'll briefly review second quarter results and provide a bit more detail on our 2016 guidance. It was a good quarter, with higher sales and EPS, and strong margin rates and cash flow.","Performance was strong at all three sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Increases in both periods reflect higher volume on manned aircraft programs and autonomous systems, which more than offset a low single-digit decline in space volume due to lower non-restricted activity on programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.","Restricted activities and higher F-35 deliveries were the growth drivers in manned aircraft. Growth in these areas more than offset lower volume for the F\/A-18 and B-2 programs. The F\/A-18 continues to ramp down. We delivered five units this quarter versus eight units in last year's second quarter.","Lower volume on the B-2 is due to timing of modernization activities. In autonomous systems, volume continues to ramp up on Triton and Global Hawk, more than offsetting lower activity on other autonomous programs, primarily NATO AGS. While space sales were lower, volume for restricted activities grew, but did not fully offset lower volume for the non-restricted space programs I referenced earlier.","Aerospace Systems' operating income declined slightly. Change in contract mix and a timing of risk retirements more than offset the impact of higher sales. Operating margin rate was 12% versus 12.8% in the last year's second quarter. And most of you will recall that last year's results benefited from risk retirements on a restricted program. At the midpoint of the year, Aerospace is on track to achieve our sales guidance in the low $10 billion range. Through six months, Aerospace has an operating margin rate of 11.6% and we continue to expect AS to generate a margin rate in the mid to high 11% range, no change from prior guidance.","Mission Systems second quarter sales grew more than 2% and year-to-date MS sales are up 1%. Both periods reflect higher sales volume for Advanced Capabilities programs, as well as Sensors and Processing programs. The primary drivers in Advanced Capabilities are restricted programs and ramp-up on several navigation and maritime programs, including SEWIP Block III. Ramp-up on G\/ATOR contributed to higher Sensors and Processing volume in both periods and JCREW contributed to the second quarter increase.","Mission Systems second quarter operating income increased 1% and operating margin rate was 13%. Year-to-date MS operating income is up 2%, with an operating margin rate of 13.1%. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, unchanged from prior guidance. And based on strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our guidance for operating margin rate to the high 12% range versus our prior guidance of a mid-to-high 12%.","Technology Services second quarter sales declined 2% and year-to-date sales are down 3%. The trend for both periods reflects the completion of several programs in 2015, lower ICBM volume as well as the ongoing repositioning of the business portfolio, as mentioned by Wes.","Second quarter operating income increased 2% and operating margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 10.8% due to improved performance. Year-to-date, TS operating margin rate has expanded 20 basis points to 10.6%, and we are raising our margin guidance to low 10% from our prior guidance of approximately 10%. We continue to expect TS sales in the mid-$4 billion range.","Total segment operating margin was 12.2% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.3% for the second quarter and 12.8% year-to-date. We now expect a low 12% total operating margin rate for the year versus our prior guidance of approximately 12%.","Our updated guidance assumes unallocated corporate expenses of $175 million, lower than our prior estimate of approximately $200 million. You'll recall that our unallocated corporate expense is typically more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter generally being the highest. We expect that to be the case again this year.","Our guidance also includes net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million. Keep in mind that we will be finalizing our 2016 pension demographic study in the third quarter. The study results may impact our net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment for 2016, so no change to the guidance until that is finalized.","Wes mentioned one of the drivers of our EPS guidance increase is a tax benefit we will record in the third quarter. After the close of the second quarter, we received approval from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for the resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense will be reduced by approximately $40 million. This will reduce our 2016 expected effective tax rate to approximately 25.5% and provide approximately $0.20 more in EPS.","All that rolls up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $10.75 to $11, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares.","We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance now anticipates capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016 versus our prior guidance of $700 million to $1 billion.","A quick update on backlog, as we indicated last quarter, we intend to report backlog for the full year and provide trend information each quarter. Year-to-date, our backlog has increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace, a modest decline in backlog at Mission Systems and a high single-digit decline at Technology Services.","Looking ahead to next year, and in light of the significant decline in interest rates through mid-year, I thought it would be helpful to remind everyone of our discount rate and plan asset returns sensitivities as they may impact our 2017 FAS expense.","Every 25 basis point change in our discount rate results in a net impact of approximately $70 million to our 2017 FAS expense. And every 100 basis point difference in our 8% return assumption and actual plan return changes 2017 FAS by approximately $50 million. In January, we provided a $470 million estimate for 2017 FAS based on a 4.53% discount rate and plan asset returns of 8%.","Year-to-date plan asset returns are a bit north of 6%. And as you're all aware, benchmark interest rates have declined by about 75 basis points. If we had to set our discount rate today and holding all other assumptions constant, our expected 2017 FAS expense would be about $200 million higher, or $670 million. But obviously, a lot can happen between now and year-end.","We continue to expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion for 2017, and we continue to expect 2017 and 2018 required cash contributions will remain fairly low at about $100 million each year. I don't expect much volatility in these required pension contributions, barring major market disruptions.","One final note on Brexit, while it's too early to predict any long-term impacts Brexit may have on our business, we saw no material impact to second quarter results. We have limited foreign currency exposures related to the affected currencies and we had significant contract-related exposure. We did see a decrement in our reported cash balances in U.S. dollars of about $30 million, which reflects the conversion of balances held in affected foreign currencies.","With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Steve.","Stephen C. Movius - Corporate Vice President and Treasurer, Vice President Investor Relations","Thanks, Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, we ask each participant to ask a single question, and please rejoin the queue if you have a following question. Robin, if you could open up the line?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good afternoon, guys.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Hey, Myles.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Myles, how are you?","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was hoping to talk a little bit about cash for a second. Lockheed brought up on their call the F-35 lack of contracts under signature being a headwind to ongoing funding of, obviously, their suppliers and their work to make sure everything stays on schedule. Is there a similar kind of cash drag that you're experiencing now? Can you size it, and is it any risk to full year cash flow?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Hey, Myles, thanks for the question. In terms of our cash on F-35, our profile is a little bit different than Lockheed's, as they're prime and we're sub. We are on progress payments today as we perform on our work that's in the flow today. And as we get on contract on LRIPs 9 and 10, we will move to performance-based payments. That will liquidate some of the withhold that we see, primarily at the AS sector in terms of cash flow, but we fully expect that we'll get that resolved, and should see that sort itself out by the end of the year.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Richard Safran from Buckingham Research.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Wes, Ken, Steve, good afternoon.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Good afternoon.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So, I just have a quick question here on Technology Services. You say, if I got my math right, you saw a 50 basis points higher margins on slightly lower sales. The only comment you made was improved performance. So, I thought, I wanted to ask if you could discuss the quarter in a bit more detail and maybe longer term expectations. Near-term, are you seeing a better mix of more favorable contracts? Thinking more longer-term, are business conditions improving overall? Are you seeing more favorable contract terms, or is the margin improvement mostly just due to restructuring and taking out cost?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'll start on that. This is Wes. And let me then turn to Ken to perhaps give a little bit more color on some of the aspects. Overall, when we say performance is the primary driver, that's actually what we mean. TS has a rather significant mix of different contracts across its portfolio. And credit to the team, they've been doing a really good job on executing on those contracts. So, it's a broad reflection of the work that's being done across the organization, just to continue to drive on program execution, particularly, I would say, in the global logistics and modernization part of the portfolio, where we're seeing some especially good program performance. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we are working on portfolio in TS. The reorganization that we did at beginning of the year has allowed us to really pull together the broad set of our service and modernization-oriented activities, and kind of step back and look at that market space and ask ourselves how we really want to position to compete over the long-term.","And so we're going through some thinking on which of those areas we're going to continue to invest in and others that we may tune down on as we go forward. And as I mentioned in remarks, any time we go through a little portfolio tuning, that can in the near-term impact the growth trajectory, but over the long-term, we see this as a very good business for our company, one that we are absolutely committed to being into, and the idea is to make sure that we're investing in the places where we see really differentiated capabilities. And with differentiated capabilities, we're able to focus on the areas that provide the better margin rates.","And that's our strategy as sort of stated in a broad context, but we're looking at that, the implications of that strategy, in each of the three parts of the TS business. So, it's not just one of the components of that business that are the focus of this activity. And it's enabling us, I think, to better position the organization for longer-term growth. Ken, anything do you'd want to add to that?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Yeah. Let me just add that I would say, I agree it's a matter of TS having a broad portfolio of contracts, that are generally differentiated in the types of services we offer, and just real good execution by the team this quarter. There was really no major program or no major area that drove the majority of the increase. All of the sectors are innovative teams that work really hard to deliver, and they've shown that they can do that this quarter. And, I would just say that maybe another piece of it kind of broadly is disciplined bidding behavior and making sure that we're going after the right work that can deliver the right margins as we look forward. So, I think that's an important piece of it as well.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Well, thanks very much.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Good morning.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Hi, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","I was looking at, Ken, your guidance for Aero Systems at low $10 billion range in the context of, Wes, your comment that this quarter is the first quarter you've started to see new programs outpace the legacy programs. So, why wouldn't the subsequent quarters have higher sales and why wouldn't the low $10 billion guidance be somewhat low for the year?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","George, I would say that halfway through the year, we're a bit shy of $5.2 billion in sales. We've got programs that are ramping in terms of volume and programs that are declining. We mentioned F\/A-18, AHF (sic) [AEHF] (22:51), and James Webb on the declining side. So, as we look at the profile, I think we don't generally see significant fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. We don't tend to see a big fourth quarter like some of the other participants in the industry. And, I think the other impact we're looking at is a fewer number of working days in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is driving kind of a fewer number of second half versus first half days in the year based on our quarterly accounting conventions.","So, overall, I would say that we see certainly a solid path to the low-$10 billion range and the team will work hard to deliver solid results for the rest of the year.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And this is Wes. I'd just add that from quarter-to-quarter, we may see a little bit of variability, but I think the thrust of your question applied to the long-term is exactly right. We see AS on an upward trajectory over the next number of years as we are executing that broad variety of programs that I mentioned in my remarks. So while quarter-to-quarter, we may see some little ups and downs, the trajectory that you mentioned is the right one.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay, thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Thank you, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit philosophically, I guess, about the cash balances. Just looking at you're down to about a $1.1 billion this quarter, it's kind of as low as I can remember. I know the second half cash is always better than the first half, so that will build. But just thinking about what is the right amount of cash to run the business? Does that make you think differently about how you return cash to shareholders? I'm just trying to think about how we see things move from here?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question, Sam. I would comment that we are satisfied with the amount of cash we have on the balance sheet and satisfied with our liquidity position. It's a bit lower than where we were the second quarter of last year. I think we were a bit north of $1.25 billion, somewhere shy of $1.3 billion last year at this time. So, we're looking forward to a strong second half in terms of cash generation. I think you'll remember that that's pretty consistent with our normal historical pattern of cash generation, although I'm determined to figure out how to pull some of that forward into the first half of the year as we look forward. But overall, we don't have any concerns about where we ended up the second quarter on cash and look forward to solid second half of the year and then delivering continued solid cash results from there as we move forward.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Sam I'd just add it's always the balance. We want to put our cash to work and making sure that we've got the right balance between putting it to work and having the adequate balance we need just to run the business is somewhat a reflection of the volatility that we see from time-to-time in the market space. During the period of time where we were dealing with shutdowns and some of those other issues, that biased us a little bit more in the direction of a more significant balance. It's hard to tell that we're necessarily in a period of greater stability on funding. We'll see how this whole CR process works out. But it's working to find the right balance in that overall equation with a strong bias towards putting our money to work.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Noah. How are you?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Pretty good. How are you, Ken?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, could you update us on the FASB change and the possible revenue recognition change, where your units of delivery, and I don't know if there could be a change or not on F-35 for you?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Sure. The rev rec standard, we do expect will result in a change to a number of our programs, F-35 probably being the largest in terms of those programs for which we are on units of delivery.","If you think about it, essentially, we will take units of delivery sales in the year of adoption and we'll take those units of delivery out and replace it with cost to cost sales. So, generally, we expect it to have a not too significant impact in terms of any particular year in regards to the P&L, and the sales and earnings to be generated. Certainly, something we're spending a fair amount of time on. Our accounting folks are working hard on that. We do expect to have that fully analyzed and our method of adoption identified by the end of 2016. And I'd say we're well on track to dealing with that issue, and we don't see it as significantly impactful to any particular P&L as we look forward.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. It seemed like potentially something like F-35, where the program is ramping pretty significantly and you're a long lead supplier, if you had to switch overnight to POC, it would sort of create just like a step-up in the revenue, but it sounds like that's not necessarily the case?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","The pull-forward could result in a little bit more revenue than units of delivery. It really depends on timing in terms of what's being delivered that quarter versus the work in flow. And so, it's still a little bit out in front of us. The closer we get to it, the more accurate I could give you an impact of what likely increase. There likely would be some increase there, although some other programs could result in some decreases going the other way. So, as we get closer, we'll be able to give you a better picture of that.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But you think you'll be on it in 1Q 2017, basically?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","1Q 2018.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Oh, okay. So, you'll just...","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","And we'll have a likely retrospective look back.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So, did you say you'll decide exactly what you're doing by the end of this year?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","By the end of the year, yeah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But you won't actually switch in the financial statements till 2018.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","That's right.

Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Doug.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Hi, Doug.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I wanted to talk about Aerospace. And you talked about expectations over the next few years for a ramp there. When you look at across those next few years in terms of margin, you've clearly got the B-21 ramping up in development, I know it's something you probably can't say much about, but when you look at Aerospace as a whole, do you think you can maintain margins at current levels even with the mix shift? And I would imagine the people working there would like that, too, given that incentives are tied to margin levels.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Thanks for the question, Doug. Let me start and maybe Wes will add some comments at the end. But in terms of mix, we do have some additional development coming in. You talked about the B-21 and there's always a mix of development versus production work, as we look. But the other piece of this is that we've also got a fair amount of production. We spent a little bit of time talking about F-35 today, as that production should mature and ramp. E-2D is in mature production. And Wes mentioned we're looking to get to LRIP on Triton. So, we've got a bit working both ways.","We do incentivize the team to perform better than the benchmark and its peers. That benchmark continues to be 11% for Aerospace. And I would say maintaining historically a strong level mix of production versus development, I think will that move one way or the other, yes. I think development could move up, but I don't think it swings so wildly that margin rates are unsustainable. I think I've described margin rates as kind of relatively range-bound. We certainly don't expect any precipitous drop in rates. And one thing we know is, is the team out there will continue to drive and find ways to perform.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think Ken said it well, Doug. I guess the way I would frame it is, if you just look at the mix of development and production that we have, we have every opportunity to continue to do well on margin rate, so it comes down to performance. The other variable is how much more we win, and we'd like to win some more. And we think we are well-positioned and we're working hard to provide our customers with some very innovative offerings, so we'd like to continue to add development content to the business as we can. But at the same time, and Ken mentioned this, we're going to the team incentivized based on our benchmarking process, where we need to do better than the benchmarks. So, we only want good wins. We want wins that will help us continue to perform well, and where we're going to be able to deliver the customer really good capabilities.","So, our future wins could have, if you think about it in broad context, could have some impact on the mix. So again, it's going to come back for performance (33:24). So I think we have a good opportunity to continue to do well on the margin rates at AS while we continue to work on some additional captures to continue to grow that business. And the bottom line is we got to perform.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, the mix as you see it now, it seems reasonable to you that you could keep margins here if you perform well, that there's no fundamental trend that's going to take them down, I guess?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't see a precipitous drop in the margin rates, assuming we continue to perform.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you very much. Wes, sorry for another question on Aerospace, but if you look at the three headwinds you've got this year, the James Webb, AHF (sic) [AEHF] (34:13), and F-18, are those more of a headwind next year or does that start to ease a little bit in 2017?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Joe, I would say that largely those headwinds start to ease a bit in 2017. The F-18 should kind of flatten out and stay at a delivery level of about two a month. The others could see a little bit more decline as they continue to mature, but I don't see it as a particularly significant drop in those programs.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Your next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Hi, Jason.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jason.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Wes, I was wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on the TS restructuring. How long is this going to take? When do you think revenue streams could inflect higher there to get some growth out of it? And, just what are you going to be prioritizing there as you work through this process?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, it's a little hard right now to project on the timeline for it, just given the fact that as we make our decisions, we, at the same time, make sure that we continue to support our customers. We're a company that never leaves a customer high and dry simply because we've decided that we're changing a part of the portfolio. And, I'll give you an example on that. Our approach in state and local, where we've been pretty clear that we've been ramping down our business in the state and local marketplace over the last few years. And so, we're not rebidding on a lot of new things. But, in many cases, those customers need us to hang in there a little bit longer to affect a smooth transition. And we're committed to making sure we support them. So, a lot of the variability here is on the nature of the customer needs to ensure that nobody gets left hanging in some manner. We want to make sure we support them well.","My experience on these transitions, as we've gone through them over the last few years, suggests that it takes usually, at a minimum, about a year, but sometimes it can be a little bit longer than that to affect the portfolio shaping. Some of that gets assisted by where the new bids are. And we can elect in many cases to just simply not rebid in an area that we're working to transition out.","And you asked for a few examples. So, state and local is one, where we are continuing to work our way down through that process. There are other areas, both in the global logistics and modernization programs, as well as our modernization services, and our advanced defense services businesses, where we're looking at the nature of how the customer is buying. If their approach to buying is shaping things more in the direction of the commodity services, that's really not the part of the marketplace that we see ourselves as adding great value. We tend to do a better job for our customers in areas where they need some aspect of technology componentry as a part of what they're doing or they need engineering applied to the outcomes for the products or services that they're looking at.","And that, over time, continues to shape and shift a little bit. So, this is really down at the business unit level, where we're sorting through each of these areas and making those decisions. And I think you'll see the outcomes of some of those decisions as we begin to talk a little bit more about 2017. And then, that'll allow us to lock in on it and make sure we're investing on it the right way and move through that as we move into 2018 and beyond.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Wes, let me just add to that, that a couple of other things to think about. One, for TS, I think it's important to think about its intercompany focus and the work that it does supporting and being really integrated with MS and AS. And you've seen that growing as a percentage of TS's sales. And I would expect that's going to continue to be a strong and important part of its business. One other impact as we look forward was a re-compete this year, where we bid what we believed was an appropriate margin rate for this type of work. And unfortunately, were not successful in that bid. So, that impacts the business as we look forward as well, and all that's factored in.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, Wes and Ken.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Carter.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just to follow up on that, Wes, when you look at TS, I mean, if you have someone else who doesn't have the same return hurdles or the same technology componentry focus that you do, is there a scenario where divesting a business as opposed to non-bids works, I mean there is obviously a lot of movement in that marketplace, a lot of changing business models in that marketplace, could that be part of the consideration as well or any color you can provide?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We always look at that full range, Carter, of portfolio options, but I will tell you in this case, what we see is the redeployment of people. We've got a great asset in that business of just extraordinary people, who can provide really good returns and provide really good outcomes for our customers as we better deploy them into these areas where we think there are better opportunities.","So, my general bias in looking at a business like TS, where we do have such an amazing group of employees, is to just more effectively leverage that capability that we have into a place that makes a lot more sense for us to be, and, again, being mindful of it and respectful of our customers' needs, so that we are not causing any customers any grief in the process. So, that's generally how I see this going. As always, and you've seen us do this over the last number of years, if it's very, very clear that some part of our business would be better executed in the hands of another party, we're the first to step up and make that happen. But, in general, just giving you my impression of how I see things headed at TS, I have a bias towards redeploying the amazing people that we have in that organization to ensure that we can be on the better trajectory.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Can you quantify how much redeployment that it is as a percentage of the total?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Not really, and I want to be careful that this doesn't come across as a huge sort of instantaneous transition of the business. We're just talking about the general vector that we see the business on. Again, I don't see a precipitous drop in any aspect of that business as we move into 2017. But when I compare the three businesses, AS and MS to TS, I would say that we're looking for a more near-term reflection of our growth opportunities at AS and MS and that will lag just a little bit in TS. That's the way I would frame it for you.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Carter.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. I want to turn the discussion a little bit towards some of these new innovative programs that you're starting to capitalize on. I think there is two and maybe three, one is SEWIP, second is JCREW and then third, it seems to me that you've probably won some space situational programs, and could you address sort of what you see, both with that portfolio and how to build on it, Wes?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, Howard. I appreciate it. There is, as you point out, so much innovation that's occurring right now and attempting to insert some very new thinking into the way our customers are executing their missions. SEWIP Block III and JCREW are perfect examples of that. And we're really proud of those wins. And I'm especially proud of how the teams approached those areas. Those are reflections of some much of what we do in the company that takes a number of years of investment in advance to really generate the level of technology capability that we can demonstrate to the customers and show them that they can achieve and some of these cases, something that they didn't actually anticipate being able to do when they began thinking about the way they were going to formulate their mission capability.","And in all of these areas as we are able to not only advance the technologies themselves, but better integrate these rapidly-moving technology spaces, we're creating these types of outcomes for our customers. And I'm especially excited and proud about that.","SEWIP III, you mentioned a really good example of how the Navy is thinking aggressively ahead on electronic warfare. And, it needs to, given the complexity of the threat environment that the Navy is going to be facing as they move forward.","And, in JCREW, if you looked at what we've been able to do over the years in our communications space through the application of software-defined capability and the ability to integrate a lot of different ways of operating into singular devices, I think that's a really good example of that outcome.","You mentioned space. And space is an area that I really think we're on the beginning next steps of a change in the way of looking at the space portfolio for the nation. For years, we operated our space assets with sort of the perspective that we were in some sort of sanctuary in space, and didn't really have to worry about threat. And that's changed dramatically over the last few years. You've heard a number of senior officials in government talk about that shift in the thinking and that understanding. And, consequently, as we go forward, I think just about all of the space missions that are going to need to be recapitalized are going to be recapitalized with those concerns in mind, which inevitably moves the architecture of those missions in the direction of the application of higher-end technologies, which is what we do.","So, I think there will be quite a few very good opportunities for both our company and the companies with whom we partner in addressing these new needs in space. And we are investing to make sure that we're in the right place on that and forming the right partnerships to ensure that we can together bring the capabilities our customers are going to need. So, there's actually quite a bit of work that's going on in our company and across our industry right now on the higher end of these technologies to ensure that our customers are going to be able to get what they need from us.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","So, if I interpret that, there is some study contracts that have moved forward and you're part of that?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There are, sort of across the board on a lot of these things, much of the advanced study work, as you might imagine, is classified, so we're not able to talk very much about that, but I would just say there is quite a bit of effort and energy that our customers are putting into making sure that the application of these advanced technologies really does enable them to differentiate their war-fighting capabilities.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Howard.","Operator","Your next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So in your first quarter 10-Q, I think you identified $75 million difference between what you were assuming in recovery on equitable adjustment claims versus what your claim was. And I think you alluded to an REA in your current 10-Q. Could you give us the status of those first? Were both of those two REA's from the first quarter settled here in the second quarter? And was the one mentioned in your Q here that you settled in July, is that included in these numbers? And if so, you know, what was the recovery? Thank you.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Cai, thanks for the question. On the REAs, let me kind of cover it broadly. The one REA that we discussed in the 10-Q was resolved in July. It was reflected in the numbers and does not result in a material impact for a disclosure in the financials or the 10-Q. In terms of the remaining REAs, there is a remaining balance that we believe is not material for disclosure, working through that, or those, in due course and don't expect any material issues arising out of that, certainly to the downside. And to the extent there's an immaterial upside, we'll include that in future 10-Qs or 10-Ks, as the timing is right.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then, you mentioned also in the Q that you have, I guess, another potential $40 million or so tax pickup. Could you basically explain what's that about? And what has to be triggered to allow you to realize that?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","There is a number of outstanding tax audits, Cai, that continue through the process. And some roll their way out and\/or realizes. We saw 2007 through 2011 was this quarter and other audits, be they Federal or state, or other international jurisdictions, sometimes roll their way into what we call the early warning disclosure in terms of what changes we could see in the next 12 months. So, it's just kind of a rolling inventory of a large number of claims and audits that our tax team works very hard to stay on top of and maximize our cash tax benefits, while always making sure we're in strict compliance with the tax laws and regulations.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good afternoon. In Mission Systems, I think you noted in the 10-Q that the backlog was down slightly year-to-date. I think after the first quarter, it had been up a bit. I wonder if you could talk about the order environment there and the possibility of ending out the year with that backlog higher.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Seth, I think that one of the complications of backlog is it's really hard to analyze on a quarterly basis. And we certainly, being kind of a longer cycle businesses at AS and MS, we do see the impact of \u2013 I wouldn't call it necessarily seasonal change in the backlog, but kind of fluctuations in terms of increases as large orders come in and decreases as you kind of burn those down. So, I would say it's not unusual, pretty consistent with our historical timing of booking awards and our backlog balances. And that's one of the reasons that we don't guide on book-to-bill is it's just, in a long cycle business, it can be a bit lumpy, and dependent on timing of getting awards in the door and when those contracts are signed and negotiated.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Hunter. Good morning.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. How are you? So, CapEx, the low end came up by about $100 million. Well, not about; it came up by $100 million. And, I think you said the building purchase was about $240 million versus I think the prior placeholder was like $300 million. So, what's driving the increase there?","And, as you think about the next couple years, two, three years out, are you finding that there's maybe some unanticipated required investments with some of the ramping development work that maybe means CapEx stays a little more elevated than maybe some people were expecting, or you guys were originally expecting, maybe closer to the $1 billion level going forward for the next few years? Thank you.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","No problem, Hunter. I would say that I don't think that this \u2013 the profile of the CapEx for 2016 is surprising to us. We fully expected that we'd have the facilities in the early half of the year. And we've been executing on that, as Wes mentioned. We've got a couple other major projects that are working their way through the system. And we fully expected that some of that would be second half-loaded. So, we see a higher level of CapEx on the non-facilities side of things in the second half of the year. And, we fully expect to be within the range of $800 million to $1 billion.","In terms of the future CapEx requirements, I think what we've talked about is, is that we expect to stay elevated from our historical amount, if you look back a number of years, for a few more years. And what we're seeing today, I don't see any significant change in our previous expectation as to where we are today on that outlook. So I think we would continue to say not necessarily the number of facility actions in front of us as we saw the first half of this year, but we do see as we grow the business and we're investing for the future, profitable growth that we see in front of us, we'll see an elevated level for a few more years, but, no change from where we've been in terms of the longer-term outlook.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good afternoon.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Hi, Robert.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","If you'll indulge me, I was going to try and tie two things together here into one question related to LRIP 9 and 10. And, the first component is the F-35 margin, which, Ken, I think last quarter, you mentioned was below where it might be relative to its level of maturity, the program's level of maturity, at this stage.","And then, the other part is the logistics side of the equation, which you both talked about a few questions ago. With this LRIP 9, 10 deal, I guess this is to you, Ken. Are you getting where you want to get on margins? And then, how should we think about this Blueprint for Affordability?","And then, separately, the sustainment cost reduction initiative. What are the anatomy of these programs? Are they real initiatives that you've cooperative with a customer or are they euphemisms for price decreases?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President","Let me start on the margin side and LRIP 9, 10. And then, I'll turn it over to Wes on the Blueprint for Sustainability. And I can comment briefly on Blueprint for Affordability, as I was a bit involved in that when I was in my previous role at the AS sector.","In terms of F-35 margin, I would say that, yes, in fact, the margin rates we're realizing on that program is not what we expect at this level of maturity. We're talking about LRIPs 9 and 10 moving into full rate production, and we would expect that the margin would be a bit higher than where it is today.","That being said, the negotiation of each lot is only the first step in that process, and you've got to perform in order to realize the margin.","So, we've been able to work hard with Lockheed Martin to get to an MOU on LRIP 9 and 10 for AS, and we were previously there on the other sectors. And, now it's a matter of performing and delivering the margin that we expect out of that program.","From a BFA perspective, we did invest along with BAE and Lockheed Martin in the BFA through I guess that was in 2012-2013 timeframe. And, I would say that we've been making good progress on that working with the industry team and the government through that process. Any other questions on BFA, I'd refer you to Lockheed Martin for any other comment.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me just comment broadly on the blueprint investments, because just the tone of your question, I think, perhaps conveyed a little bit of a negative view on them that I think is inaccurate. These investments, they are team investments that are focused on helping our customer get cost out. And as we do that, they have inherent in them a return mechanism for the company. So, this is not sort of a side-swipe at some way of reducing our margin or something. This is an overt decision by the industry team to come together, to work on ways to actually get the cost, the unit costs in the case of the BFAs and then the sustainment cost in terms of the BFS, to get the cost structure into a place where our customers can afford more of the capability.","So, from an industry perspective, we are only doing this, because we see a benefit to the program and ultimately an economic benefit to those who are participants in the program. And it's a win-win, because the government, our customers, get an economic benefit from these investments as well, and have worked very closely with us in both structuring the investment strategies and programs, and on ensuring that there is a good return mechanism.","So we see them as very positive mechanisms, very supportive of the program objectives. And I think it has been a really good reflection on the partnership approach that we have together across the companies on F-35, that we're able to make something innovative like this work so well. So, I'm very proud of these blueprint initiatives. I think they're a very good thing.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Wes, I think that make sense. The part I'm curious about is, I would think that you and Lockheed and BAE are working on these sorts of things in any event to get the cost down, and I'm just curious as to the role that the customer plays here in catalyzing this.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, what's neat about the blueprint process, and you're right. Of course, we're always working together to figure out ways of taking the cost down. It really does create a really good team environment with the customer, because in some of these areas, they have to make decisions to do things a little bit differently.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I see.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, it's a very good way of crystallizing a very effective joint process with not only the partners, but the customer to benefit the program. So, I think it's a good idea, and I'm glad to see us moving forward with these.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And just on the logistics side, sustainment side, just based on what was said earlier on other programs and then we have this BFS, I guess it is on F-35, are there different flavors here of sustainment programs? It sounds like some have become LPTA and maybe others aren't?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. There is probably enough variability across sustainment programs as there is the number of sustainment programs. There is a lot of different models that are utilized by different customers, depending on how much work the government itself wants to do, how much they want to contract out, the nature of the economic relationships they want to create. So, it's a marketplace with a lot of different business models. And I think that's appropriate, because we have many different types of systems at different stages of their lifecycle with different levels of technology, different desires for modernization. So, it's a very interesting and dynamic marketplace.","Stephen C. Movius - Corporate Vice President and Treasurer, Vice President Investor Relations","Hey, Robert, we're going to cut it off at this point in time. So, I'm going to turn it over to Wes for final comments.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, well, thanks, Steve. Let me just wrap up by thanking our team again for developing an approach over these last number of years that has allowed us to consistently deliver solid results. I think this quarter was another good demonstration of the team's focus and commitment on performance. But also the team is doing such a great job in positioning us so well for the, not only the remainder of this year, but for the longer-term and for working closely with our customers to satisfy their needs as we go forward.","So, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today, and also thanks for your continuing interest in our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. My name is Natalia, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Steve Movius","Thanks, Natalia, and welcome to Northrop Grumman\u2019s second quarter 2019 conference call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today\u2019s call constitute forward-looking statements, pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today\u2019s earnings release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may cause actual Company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today\u2019s call will also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental presentation.","On the call today are Kathy Warden, our CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Kathy.","Kathy Warden","Thank you, Steve. Hello, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s call. We had an excellent second quarter results across the board, including business capture, backlog growth, sales, earnings and cash. Based on our strong performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing 2019 guidance. I want to thank the Northrop Grumman team. I\u2019m particularly proud of our ability to deliver innovative, quality products and services, which enable global security and human advancement.","Starting with Space, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of our nation\u2019s Apollo 11 lunar landing, we are proud of our strong legacy in supporting each of our nation\u2019s manned space flights to-date. Looking forward, we are poised to continue supporting manned space flight through NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which is expected to return humans to the moon by 2024.","In addition, this quarter, Innovation Systems has passed its one-year anniversary as our fourth sector, and I\u2019m delighted with the progress we\u2019re making. Costs and operational synergies are on track and our margin rates across the Company are benefiting from the synergies realized since the acquisition. We are also realizing revenue synergies sooner than we expected.","A good indicator of our success in capturing revenue synergies is our growing share of restricted work. We booked $843 million in restricted space awards during the second quarter and $4.5 billion in the first quarter. At the Company level, restricted work across multiple domains continues to grow as a percent of total revenue. This demonstrates our strong alignment to the national defense strategy and our ability to leverage our entire portfolio to create innovative solutions for our customers.","We booked net awards of $13.5 billion in the second quarter and $25.8 billion year-to-date. Now, net awards are approximately 1.6 times sales and our total backlog is up 18% to $63 billion. The large multi-year awards we are capturing across the Company are the building blocks for sustainable long-term profitable growth.","Year-to-date, Aerospace Systems has booked net awards of approximately $13 billion and total backlog has increased 28% since year-end. In the second quarter, we booked $3.6 billion for the E-2D. Approximately $3.3 billion was booked at AS for the U.S. Navy\u2019s next 24 Advanced Hawkeyes and associated deliverables, with the balance awarded at Mission Systems.","In addition to U.S. Navy Aircraft, the multi-year includes an option for the nine additional E-2Ds for Japan. In the second quarter, we delivered the first four E-2Ds currently under contract for Japan. And we anticipate being under contract for the additional nine by the end of this year. On the F-35 program, we booked awards of over $4 billion in the quarter across our four sectors. At Aerospace Systems, we finalized to $4.9 billion agreement for production lots 12 through 14 center fuselage units, and booked an award of approximately $3 billion, net of previous incremental funding.","Mission Systems added $1 billion of award for additional F-35 radar CNI and DAS production. And IS and TS together, were awarded approximately $100 million for their scope on the program.","Moving to Innovation Systems, year-to-date net awards totaled approximately $3 billion. In addition to our prime role of supporting U.S. government hypersonic weapon systems development efforts, we are also supporting Lockheed Martin and Raytheon program. In the second quarter, Lockheed Martin awarded us $265 million for the Intermediate Range Conventional Prompt Strike program and IS is working with Raytheon on the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept or HAWC program.","Shortly after the end of the quarter, Space Norway awarded IS a $250 million contract for its Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission to provide critical ground infrastructure and to design, manufacture and integrate two satellites. This activity increases utilization of our hot production line enhancing affordability and production efficiency across our customer base.","In addition, Aerospace Systems is developing payloads for the Space Norway satellite, which will be hosted on the IS bus. This is another example of revenue synergy in the space domain, and it highlights our industry-leading end-to-end capability.","Now moving to Mission Systems. We signed a $1 billion contract to begin full-rate production on our G\/ATOR program after achieving initial operating capability in the first quarter. G\/ATOR is our first ground-based gallium nitride or GaN radar to be operationally fielded. It combines five legacy systems into a single solution, improving mission performance and reducing customer costs. G\/ATOR provides real-time 360 degree situational awareness against a broad array of threats and we see the system, having strong opportunity for international sales.","Mission Systems is also supplying the upgraded integrated avionics suite for the Black Hawk program, which entered LRIP in April. An initial 25 kits were ordered under this LRIP and the Army plans to upgrade 760 Black Hawks with this avionic suite. And lastly, the Army awarded us an OTA for agile software development of their next incremental build with the IBCS capability. This competitive win signifies our customers\u2019 confidence in our ability and commitment to accelerate delivery of critical new war fighting capabilities.","Mission Systems, year-to-date net awards totaled approximately $8 billion and backlog is up 14% from year-end. The common thread running through our successful efforts on G\/ATOR, Black Hawk as well as IBCS is our modular multi-mission, open architecture approach to next-generation defense electronics. We are reaping the benefit of substantial technology investments we\u2019ve made to support development of solutions that give the customer advanced performance and greater affordability, as well as the ability to rapidly address future threats.","Turning to Technology Services. Global Services booked $223 million for an international training program, a $70 million task order to support the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a $59 million contract to provide enterprise defense cyber operations for the Marine Corps. In Global Logistics and Modernization, we secured a $162 million Army award for sustainment of the Hunter unmanned aircraft system. And on EA PUP, our Electronic Attack Pod Upgrade Program, the Air Force exercised a $44 million option.","Our business capture has been outstanding year-to-date and we expect strong bookings to continue. We have a robust opportunity set across the Corporation with large potential awards in restricted space, National Security Space Launch, GBSD and product line expansion in airborne radar and electronic warfare.","In May, on the National Security Space Launch program, Innovation Systems successfully conducted a full scale of static fire test of the first stage of our new OmegA rocket. This milestone keeps OmegA on track to performance first launch in 2021 and begin operational launches of National Security payloads in 2022, meeting the congressional mandate and U.S. Air Force requirements.","And as you know, the final RFP for GBSD was released last week. Northrop Grumman has been a trusted systems engineering partner for every new ICBM system over the last 60 years. We look forward to offering a highly capable, technically measured and affordable solution that addresses evolving threats and fulfills our nation\u2019s critical nuclear deterrence mission.","Turning to P&L. At the midpoint of the year, sales were up 20%. As we indicated last quarter, Mission Systems sales growth is accelerating and the top line is stabilizing at Technology Services. Looking ahead, we continue to expect sales of approximately $34 billion for 2019. In addition to solid top line results, our sectors generated a 26% increase in second quarter segment operating income and 70 basis point increase in our segment margin rate, driven by strong performance and cost synergies.","Year-to-date, our segment OM rate is up 60 basis points, and we are raising our guidance for the year to approximately 11.5% from low-to-mid 11%. EPS rose 12% on the quarter and we now expect full-year earnings per share to range between $19.30 and $19.55.","Cash generation was also a highlight this quarter. Our businesses generated $1.6 billion and after capital expenditures of $252 million, free cash flow totaled approximately $1.4 billion. For the year, we continue to expect 2019 free cash flow of $2.6 billion to $3 billion. And beyond this year, we expect to continue generating strong cash as we grow the business. We continue to execute a balanced cash deployment strategy. In addition to capital expenditures, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, we continued repurchasing shares toward our 2019 target, and we will retire $500 million in debt in August.","Now turning to the U.S. budget. We are pleased by reports the Congress and the Administration have reached an agreement on fiscal years 2020 and 2021. This should prevent harmful budget cuts and disruption. Predictable funding enabled our customers to increase investment in critical technologies needed to stay ahead of rapidly advancing global threats. We believe our nation\u2019s leaders understand the threats we face and will act to provide the necessary resources to modernize key capabilities.","Northrop Grumman continues to invest in advanced capabilities to enable long-term value creation. Our new franchise programs and leading technologies demonstrate the success of our investments and an approach that combines innovation with affordability. We believe that our portfolio and cost structure, our competitive differentiators that is evidenced by our business capture success, will continue creating value for our customers and shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financial results and guidance. Ken?","Ken Bedingfield","Thanks, Kathy and good afternoon, everyone. I also want to thank our team for a strong second quarter. I\u2019d note that our presentation includes an EPS bridge from second quarter 2018 to second quarter 2019, and the bridge to our updated 2019 EPS guidance.","As you can see from the bridge on Slide 6, the majority of the EPS increase is driven by a strong year-to-date operational performance and full-year expectations with the remaining $0.10, primarily reflecting lower expected unallocated corporate expense.","Let\u2019s turn to the sectors. Aerospace Systems rose 2% in the quarter, reflecting higher F-35 volume in Manned Aircraft and increased civil space activity in space systems. Autonomous sales were comparable to the prior period. I will note, second quarter sales were also unfavorably impacted by the timing of supplier costs. Operating income rose slightly and AS operating margin rate was comparable to last year\u2019s second quarter. We continue to expect AS sales for the year in the high $13 billion range with a mid-to-high 10% operating margin rate. No change to prior guidance.","At Innovation Systems, based on pro forma sales comparisons, second quarter sales rose 8% due to higher volume at Flight Systems and Defense Systems. Flight Systems had increased volume on military aerospace structures and launch vehicles. Defense Systems had higher volume in tactical missiles, including the AARGM program. IS operating income was $169 million with a strong operating margin rate of 11.3%. IS year-to-date margin rate reflects several favorable adjustments and the risk [Audio Gap] (15:01) the largest of the businesses grew above the sector growth rate.","Increased volume on infrared countermeasures, airborne radar and restricted programs, drove the sensors and processing growth. And higher volume on restricted programs drove growth at advanced capabilities. At Cyber and ISR, we had increased volume on space programs. With previously discussed program completion headwinds behind us, Mission Systems growth rate has accelerated as we ramp up on a number of programs, such as F-35, G\/ATOR, CIRCM and IBCS, to name just a few. We continue to expect MS revenue to grow in the low-to-mid $12 billion range this year with a margin rate of approximately 13%. No change to prior guidance.","At Technology Services, I\u2019m pleased to report sales were comparable to the prior year period. TS operating profit increased 19% and operating margin rate increased 170 basis points to 10.8%. Looking ahead, previously discussed program completion headwinds moderate in the second half, and we expect TS sales will continue to stabilize. We continue to expect TS sales in the low $4 billion range, no change to prior guidance. And based on strong first half performance, we are again, raising guidance for TS operating margin rates. We now expect a low 10% range versus prior guidance of approximately 10%.","As we roll all that up, we continue to expect 2019 sales of approximately $34 billion, and based on strong year-to-date performance and sector guidance increases, we are increasing guidance for total segment operating margin rate to approximately 11.5%. Below segment OM, we now expect unallocated corporate expense of $225 million versus prior guidance of $250 million. Higher segment OM, along with a lower unallocated corporate expense, moves our full-year guidance for the total operating margin rate to the high 10% range.","Through the first half of the year, our effective tax rate is 16.4% versus 17.5% at this time last year. Our year-to-date effective tax rate reflects a higher level of research credits than we currently anticipate for the second half of the year. So no change to our guidance for 2019 effective tax rate. As a result of improved performance, we are increasing our mark-to-market adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $19.30 to $19.55. This continues to be based on approximately 170 million weighted average shares outstanding.","Turning to cash. It was a very strong quarter. Second quarter cash from operations reflects improved trade working capital and higher earnings. Improved trade working capital includes the recovery of first quarter delayed billings that resulted from our ERP conversion to a single instance of SAP covering a majority of our businesses. For the year, no change to prior guidance of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion cash from operations and $2.6 billion to $3 billion of free cash flow, after capital expenditures of about $1.2 billion.","We continue to plan share repurchases of approximately $750 million this year, subject to market conditions. And as previously discussed, we intend to retire about $500 million of debt in the third quarter. Beyond this year, we expect growing cash flows as a result of growing earnings, some improvements in working capital, and our well-funded pension plans. As a result, we expect to have increasing capacity for value-creating capital deployment.","In summary, it was a strong quarter, a good first half, and we expect strong results for the remainder of the year. I think we\u2019re ready for Q&A. Steve?","Steve Movius","Thanks, Ken. I would ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question. Natalia, would you please open the line for Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.","Myles Walton","Thanks, good morning.","Kathy Warden","Good morning.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey Myles.","Myles Walton","I was wondering on the bookings front, obviously, extremely strong in the first half and particularly here in the second quarter. But I think in the 10-Q you filed, it also shows a slower burn of that backlog, about 40% over the next 12 months as opposed to the 50% over the next 12 months for the last several quarters not a couple of years. Can you talk about how indicative that growth in backlog is about your acceleration of growth given that kind of reduced burn rate, if that\u2019s accurate?","Ken Bedingfield","Yes, let me start with that, Myles. I would just say that we are really happy to see the awards in the backlog that we\u2019ve been able to get in the first half of the year. And as Kathy mentioned, we do expect to see continued strong awards in the second half of the year. I would just point out that a number of the awards we\u2019ve been booking like the B-21, E-2D, which is a five-year multi-year contract, F-35 lots 12 to 14, many of these programs are going to support multiple years of revenue.","And so given in particular, the awards booked in the first part of the year, first half of this year, the biggest ones being E-2D, as well as F-35 and then some restricted space activity, we expect those awards to result in sales for a multi-year period and give us really good visibility into strong sales growth for a number of years to come.","And so given those \u2013 the impact of those large, kind of multi-year awards, we do see that those will result in our backlog turning into sales and about 40% in the next 12 months versus our previous average of about 50%. But it does not give us any pause as to any guidance we have given with respect to 2019 sales or with any indication we have given you about where we think we can be on 2020 sales.","And I\u2019ll just remind you, we talked about a mid-single digit range on 2020, but given our awards activity and the opportunities we see in front of us, we think we\u2019ve got opportunity to be in the higher end of that range for 2020. So we think it\u2019s really a good new story and supports, again, this \u2013 while we\u2019ve been talking about the level of visibility we have into some long range sales growth for this business.","Myles Walton","That\u2019s great color. Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Ron Epstein","Hey, good morning, guys. Good afternoon, actually. Quick question, it\u2019s my understanding that the RFP came out for \u2013 through the next phase of GBSD. Can you share any thoughts on what you guys are thinking about it and how you feel about it?","Kathy Warden","Yes. Thanks, Ron. This is Kathy. And as we look at the RFP, which did come out Monday, a week ago, we are really seeing what we expected to see and we are positioned to be able to support the U.S. Air Force requirements and view this as a strong opportunity for our Company as I noted in my own remarks, we have been supporting the ICBM system for over 60 years. So we have the knowledge and the expertise needed to put together a strong offer for the U.S. Air Force, and we look forward to doing that. There is a 150-day response period, so we will be submitting the proposal late this year and still expect an award in the mid-to-late part of 2020.","Ron Epstein","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter Arment","Hi, guys. Good afternoon, Kathy, Ken. Kathy, you mentioned the revenue synergies that you\u2019re starting to book. Obviously, a lot has been restricted, so you can\u2019t really talk about it. But I just wanted to talk about how that flows through to growth. Do we expect to start to see that layer in kind of the way Ken described, the burn rate on the backlog or is it something that happens faster? Maybe just some color there. Thank you.","Kathy Warden","Yes. We had talked about revenue synergy really not starting to kick in earnest to 2020, and as mentioned in last quarter\u2019s call, as well as this one, that we are seeing those revenue synergies sooner than we expected. They are on efforts that are restricted and developmental largely, and therefore, you see a fairly slow ramp of that revenue in 2019. You\u2019ll see it more materially happening in the 2020 and 2021 time frame as we\u2019ve talked about previously.","As you noted, it is in restricted space and today I shared the Space Norway award because it\u2019s something that\u2019s unclassified and that we can talk about, that demonstrates how in that case Innovation Systems and Aerospace Systems are working together, with IS providing the bus and the integrated ground, and then AS building the payloads for the satellite. And so we\u2019re going to continue to see those kinds of opportunities that are pulling end-to-end capabilities from across our various sectors together in multiple mission areas. But certainly, we\u2019re seeing more of that in space than any other domain.","Peter Arment","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Doug Harnett with Bernstein.","Doug Harnett","Thank you. Innovation Systems, and you had what as we would consider to be very good margin performance in the quarter. At the same time, you reported that the percentage of cost-type work had gone up to 29% from 26%. So when you look \u2013 first, can you talk about what\u2019s been driving the good performance \u2013 the good margin performance that at Innovation Systems? And then as you look forward and think about how you take parts of that business and link it to other \u2013 to Aerospace and to Mission Systems to capture revenue synergies, how do you ensure that you can continue to improve margin there?","Kathy Warden","So Doug, let me start and then I\u2019m going to ask Ken to provide some color on some activities in the first half of the year, which won\u2019t be recurring, that did have a positive impact on the IS margins. But more broadly, the good margin performance we\u2019re seeing at Innovation Systems is due in part to their strong performance, and also in part to the cost synergies that we are realizing across the Company.","And the more that we\u2019re able to utilize the facilities, the footprint and the infrastructure that we have across the business as a whole, IS and other sectors are benefiting from that. So it\u2019s not just the costs that we\u2019re taking out that I referred to as cost synergy, but also starting to realize some of the operational synergy that\u2019s having a positive impact on margins as well.","In terms of our outlook for IS, we expect that strong performance to continue. But as I noted, there were a couple of events in the first half that increased their operating margins. And Ken, I\u2019ll ask you to share \u2013 shed some light on that.","Ken Bedingfield","Yes, I would just add that \u2013 you may remember, Doug, in the first quarter, we talked about the contribution of some commercial negotiations that we had planned to occur in 2019, but which occurred earlier than we expected driving the Q1 margin up. And then in Q2 largely, we had some positive adjustments on some of our contracts that drove some additional margin rate. And obviously, as we look at the second half of the year, we will work hard to manage risk and realize opportunities to try to continue to drive upside to margin rate, but we\u2019ve had a real successful first half of the year so far, and still need to fill it in for the full year.","In terms of the question specifically about the 26% versus the 29%, I would just remind you that the previous-year period only included about three plus weeks of activity. So probably not a material change in terms of the revenue then versus revenue now. But certainly we can perform on cost-type contracts and drive favorably as EAC adjustments there as well.","Doug Harnett","Okay, great. Very good. Thank you.","Ken Bedingfield","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much, and good afternoon. In Aerospace Systems, I guess, in the first quarter, we saw a step up in sales to about $3.5 billion and what you\u2019ve done in the first half and the guidance sort of implies that we\u2019re going to stay at about that level through the end of the year. When do we see the next leg-up in Aerospace revenue?","And then, Kathy, on the fourth quarter call, I think you talked in a little bit more detail about the three pieces, Manned, Unmanned and Space. And so maybe if you could talk qualitatively about the outlook, now that you\u2019ve got a few more of these words under your belt for the next couple of years for each of those?","Kathy Warden","I\u2019m going to ask Ken to start with giving you the outlook for the remainder of the year, and then I\u2019ll talk to our overall view of the three segments.","Ken Bedingfield","Yes. So Seth, just a couple of comments, I guess, I would make for AS. I would say that as I referenced in my remarks, we did have that some timing of some supplier costs that moves the rate a little bit from Q2 into the second half of the year. We did have a relatively tough compare for AS growth, which had grown 11% Q2 of 2018 on top of 11% the Q2 before that. So AS has been a solidly growing business and we continue to be comfortable that it continues to grow as we look forward. We\u2019re comfortable with our full-year guidance for AS, and feel good about where we are and where that business is going to be going in the next few years. And I\u2019ll let comment \u2013 I\u2019ll let Kathy comment more specifically on kind of the divisions within AS.","Kathy Warden","Yes. So we\u2019ve been seeing growth across the three segments of AS Manned, Unmanned and Space, and each quarter that varies a bit. This quarter, Manned and Space were up offsetting some slight declines and Unmanned, just largely timing of deliveries in that business. As we look forward and over the long-term, we see Space as likely the fastest growing segment of Aerospace. In that we see budget increases in that area, it\u2019s a key area where we\u2019re identifying and executing revenue synergies across the entire portfolio. So I do see that being one of our fastest growing segments in the Company over time.","I would say that Manned continues to benefit from a number of key franchise programs like E-2D, the additional work there with the U.S. Navy, but also it will be fueled by the international growth that we noted with Japan. And then of course, we continue with F-35 to see some decent growth in that Manned segment as well.","But Unmanned too, will has a nice growth outlook as we take Triton to early operating capability later this year. We\u2019ll be ramping up production on that program over time and we also as you know have strong international demand there with units going to Australia and some interest in Germany as well. So I really see nice opportunity across all three elements for the Aerospace portfolio.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good afternoon.","Kathy Warden","Good afternoon.","Robert Stallard","Ken, you mentioned that next year you should have some more flexibility for value-added capital deployment. I was wondering what your priorities might be in that area, and whether pre-funding the pension might have moved up the agenda there?","Ken Bedingfield","Sure. I\u2019ll comment on that. I would say that as we look at the value-creating capital deployment opportunities, I\u2019m probably not going to lay out the specifics for what 2020 might look like until we actually give guidance for 2020, but I would probably reference you to our consistent allocation over the past number of years. In particular, I would note that we\u2019ve been repurchaser of our shares for many years, dating back to 2003. We certainly expect that to continue. We\u2019ve talked about what our CapEx profile looks like. Certainly, we continue to invest in technology through R&D investment and things like that.","In terms of pension, pre-funding, I haven\u2019t seen that really rise too high on my radar screen at this point. I would say that we\u2019ve had pretty solid pension returns year-to-date and that should help us from a required funding perspective. And I think if you think back to our previous discussion, we didn\u2019t have a whole lot of funding required for the next couple of years on pension, so not necessarily high on my radar screen.","My previous commentary on the debt pay-off in August of this year, we do expect that after we pay that off and then we look forward at our growing EBITDA and cash flows, we have the opportunity to get back to our preferred BBB+ credit rating at that point. So lots of optionality on kind of managing the balance sheet, I would say, from that perspective and just lots of opportunity as we see again a growing set of cash flows to think about what the most value-creating capital deployment is.","Robert Stallard","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn","Good afternoon.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, Rob.","Robert Spingarn","So \u2013 hey there. Ken, just on that growing set of cash flows, you talked earlier about the strength of the multi-year awards, and that 2020 revenues could be at the high end of expectations. So it\u2019s becoming clear the double-digit growth for free cash flow per share is possible. So I wanted to \u2013 I know you don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of yourself, but how do you feel about the 15% to 20% growth implied in the consensus free cash flow for 2020 of $20 per share?","Ken Bedingfield","Great. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned previously, we\u2019re not ready to give guidance for 2020 at this point. But I think we\u2019ve been clear and I\u2019ll continue to be clear that this is a business that will be a strong generator of cash as we look forward. And let me just walk through a few of the drivers of that for 2020 and beyond.","First, as you mentioned, we expect to continue to see solid growth and that\u2019s for multiple years, given our portfolio alignment to what \u2013 our customers\u2019 needs and the changing threats, and also as evidenced by our strong backlog. We continue to expect to generate strong margins and convert those margins into cash. We invested ahead of the curve and we continue to expect our CapEx will moderate in future years. Pension plans are well funded to Rob\u2019s question previously, some of the best funded plans in industry, to be frank.","And as we look forward, we continue to think that working capital should moderate a bit starting in 2020, and with more opportunity in the out years. So with kind of that framework, I think you\u2019re hitting on the right issues or the right thoughts, and I wouldn\u2019t argue with your thesis or assumptions on solid free cash flow growth.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you. Good afternoon, Kathy and Ken.","Kathy Warden","Hi, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just on the missiles market, it\u2019s been a big focus lately. Maybe can you talk about Orbital ATK, what it\u2019s thought incrementally in terms of technology and the exposure? And how do you think about the opportunities going forward and maybe your market share today?","Kathy Warden","Thanks. So as we look at the missile space, there is clearly opportunity for us to continue to be key suppliers to Raytheon and Lockheed, which we\u2019ve been doing in more traditional cruise missile space. And as I noted on today\u2019s call, we continue with that partnering in the hypersonic weapons space as well. And then there are some select instances and I pointed to some of those in our prior discussions, AARGM-ER is a good example, where we are the prime provider for the missile.","We can provide that full integration and delivery capability, but we also have clearly the specialization and propulsion for other prime missile systems. And so when we think about the business, we really do focus ourselves on continuing to evolve the technology in not only the propulsion systems, but our ability to provide guidance and the other elements of the system, the composite structures, that we can offer to others or in select instances, provide through our own prime offering. We see that area growing for IS, as we see it growing for the other primes as well. And so we think that there is plenty of market opportunity for the three of us in that arena.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss","Thanks, good afternoon. Kathy, could you address your competitive win rate within TS, and whether you still think that TS as a whole, can return to growth in 2020? And could you also address your positioning within LTAM\u2019s competition and a sense of that\u2019s going on there? Thanks.","Kathy Warden","Sure. Let me start with Technology Services. Our win rate there in the first half of the year has been very solid, particularly on recompete for we\u2019ve been able to defend the business that we have. And as you know, at the beginning of the year, we laid out a trajectory for that business. The actions that we\u2019ve taken have stopped \u2013 stabilized the top line and you\u2019ll also see that we\u2019re increasing the margin rate in that business because the team is executing to that plan quite well.","As our guidance indicates, I expect that, that sector is going to be flattish for the remainder of the year and we still expect that the sector will return to growth in 2020. It\u2019s largely driven by still having some headwinds from programs that have exited the Global Services part of the portfolio, while we are growing the global sustainment and modernization part of the TS business.","And I just want to also note that TS is providing us affordable life cycle support and modernization for systems and platforms that we build as well. And so they\u2019re an integral part of many of the programs that we have and they offer us affordable options for that services component of the program execution for the bid.","So now, turning to the second part of your question around LTAMs, we are in an active competition there with submit to bid. And we feel confident that we have an offer that is competitive and is based on mature GaN technology. So we\u2019ll wait to see what the Army thinks. But we certainly are pleased to be able to participate in that competition and bring forward what we think is a good offer.","Steve Movius","Hey, Natalia, next question.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.","Jon Raviv","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Kathy, I know investments are very important part of the thesis and a differentiator for Northrop. One of your near peers would say, has engagement in M&A where investment is also a part of their thesis too. So, any thoughts or perspectives on size and scale in light of some of those M&A moves and the importance of size and scale in being competitive going forward in the defense market?","Kathy Warden","We\u2019re certainly assessing the implications of the consolidation in our market, but let me share how we think about our own strategy. I see that we have a strong portfolio, especially now with the addition of Innovation Systems, and the portfolio is well aligned to our customers\u2019 highest priority investment areas. As you noted, we have been investing to support value creation. We\u2019ve been investing in technology. I gave one example today, of a multi-year investment stream we\u2019ve had in open Mission Systems Electronics and some of the programs that we\u2019re now winning in Mission Systems as a result of those investments.","We, of course, have been investing in the facilities and equipment we need. Many of you have seen the expansion that we\u2019ve done at Palmdale and across our other aerospace centers of excellence over the last several years. And we have a competitive cost structure as witnessed by some of our recent wins and the fighting of our cost advantages in those.","So when I look at where we are today, we have that portfolio and a strong basis to support business capture. We also have a strong and improving balance sheet that\u2019s going to continue to allow us this investment optionality into the future. And we\u2019ve demonstrated the ability to compete and win at our current scale.","So I see often that the quality of investment choices is even more important than the pure size of the investment itself. And looking at where we are with a focused strategy, well aligned investments to that strategy, I feel good about where we\u2019re positioned.","Jon Raviv","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Yes, good afternoon. I was wondering Kathy or Ken, if you could go through some of the programs that are in unfunded backlog for Aerospace, since that was a big part of the jump in backlog this quarter?","Ken Bedingfield","George, to be honest with you on that one, I don\u2019t have the data in front of me, so I\u2019d have to get Steve to follow-up to you with the specifics on that after the call today. Is there another question, you wanted to go through?","George Shapiro","Yes. The EACs in Aerospace were down \u2013 were 54 versus 95 last year. Can you talk through what might have been negative in the quarter, or why it was down by as much as it was?","Ken Bedingfield","Yes, I\u2019d be happy to go through that George. I don\u2019t think there were really negatives of any significant consequence in this year\u2019s second quarter. You may remember that last year\u2019s second quarter, we did have an \u2013 a pick up EAC positive adjustments of about $69 million on a couple of restricted programs. So really, if you look at it, it was more positives in last year\u2019s second quarter. And if you think about this year\u2019s second quarter with a similar margin rate, that would tell you that the underlying baseline EAC rates that we\u2019re booking at is stronger than it was for last year\u2019s second quarter.","So we feel good about where we are. I\u2019m always careful to put too much credence into the EAC adjustments, because there\u2019s always timing and fluctuations and ups and downs. And I think the most important thing is, we continue to perform. We have not seen an uptick in negative adjustments and continue to deliver consistent, strong performance at each of the sectors.","George Shapiro","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, Kathy. Hi, Ken.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, Rajeev.","Kathy Warden","Hi.","Rajeev Lalwani","Just an F-35 question, Lockheed\u2019s been pretty vocal about getting the price down and it seems like they are successfully doing so, given that it\u2019s one of your biggest programs. How is that faltering down to you on the revenue and\/or margin side? And as a follow-up, can you just highlight any contracts that are maybe rolling over the next six months, 12 months, 18 months that could create a little bit of noise, if you will, as we start looking at growth rates moving ahead?","Ken Bedingfield","Sure, Rajeev. I\u2019ll start on that one, and then Kathy can add any color. But from an F-35 perspective, I would just say that we are performing well, we\u2019ve been delivering quality product on time or ahead of schedule. We do have four contracts across a number of sectors, actually we have more than \u2013 more than four contracts now with IS and TS starting to see some of the logistics activity and sustainment.","So it\u2019s a significant program for us and we\u2019ve been really working hard to support our customer Lockheed Martin, as well as the U.S. government to deliver to that target that has been established from a price per unit perspective. And clearly our cost is a part of the cost reduction that our customer is seeing. So we feel really good about where we are on that program and we\u2019ve seen really solid operational performance and we\u2019re pleased with where that program is at this point. And then with...","Kathy Warden","I think Rajeev, your second question was related to any recompetes coming up in the second half of the year, is that right?","Rajeev Lalwani","Yep, or just simply contracts that are rolling off. Yes, you got the right idea.","Kathy Warden","Right. So we have the remaining headwinds from the Virginia state outsourcing contract that is still in TS through the third quarter, and then we have in our Innovation Systems sector, a contract for Lake City Ammunition Plant and that is expected to be awarded in September of this year. That would be about 10% of the revenue in Innovation Systems and it does not currently have economic value. So there would not be a profit impact, but we are positioning to compete for that contract and are expecting to hear in the next couple of months.","Ken Bedingfield","I would just add that the Ammunition contract that Kathy talked about, has a bit of a longer phasing than most contracts. So probably start \u2013 it would start to transition in kind of mid-to-late 2020, although we\u2019ve put together a competitive bid and we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence that we\u2019ll see that production continue to be a part of our business.","And on VITA, I would just say that it\u2019s had a more significant impact in the first half of the year and we see it really only about $75 million of headwind as we look at the second half for TS. So not a significant set of contracts that could sort of move against us.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Thank you. Good afternoon. I\u2019ve got a follow-up on GBSD. Can you help us frame the long-term opportunity for that program, including some of the sustainment work? And then also, please tell me I\u2019m being too nitpicky, but Kathy, why did you include the phrase \"technically mature\" when you\u2019re talking about the offering in your prepared remarks? And the nature of the question is basically, now that you\u2019ve got a chance to review the RFP, is this less of a science project, if you will? Is there anything in there that would suggest that the customer is looking for proven technology as opposed to more sort of ambitious development work as they think about the award? Thanks.","Kathy Warden","So to frame out the opportunity for you, it clearly starts with the development of the modernized ICBM system and then moves into a production phase over a number of years to actually produce the capability and then would move to sustainment. But that sustainment scope is not part of the RFP for this offering. That\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s about the development and the production phase of the contract and transition to sustainment.","My phrasing on \"technically mature\" is because we\u2019ve been executing tech maturation and risk reduction program for the last several years on GBSD. And through that process, we have been able to retire risk and really mature our offering, and so we do feel that at this point in time, what we\u2019re able to offer has wrung some of that risk that we would have identified at the early stage of our designed concept out of our offerings.","Hunter Keay","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.","Pete Skibitski","Good afternoon. Kathy, I wanted to get your thoughts on this idea from kind of early on in the Administration that, we\u2019ve got to look at export control reform that could help with UAV exports. I think it gets to the Missile Technology Control Regime or some other controlling agreement. I was wondering, have you guys seen progress on that or is it still to come, or did it just kind of fall off the table in terms of a major priority for the Administration? So initially I thought that maybe it could be a big opportunity for you guys.","Kathy Warden","Pete, it certainly hasn\u2019t fallen off the table. We\u2019re still engaged actively with the State department and looking at MTCR, and also specifically looking at certain countries that have requested our unmanned systems capability. And I would say that we see much more opening to have that dialog and request from us to come forward with areas that have expressed interest and put some ideas on the table. It is slow to develop those into actual approval for export. And so, we\u2019re still working through a process that requires a lot of steps for us to get there. And so \u2013 look at MTCR also requires multi-national engagement to make a change to that policy. So that too, we expected and are seeing that\u2019ll take some time.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. So we should be patient on that front. Okay, thanks guys.","Kathy Warden","We are being patient, but not patient. We\u2019re pushing.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much. So Kathy, you mentioned you\u2019re supporting two of your peers on hypersonics. With IS, you now have capability and propulsion, you have capability and guidance. Are you aspiring to become a bigger prime yourself and if not, why not? And also, one of your peers talks about defensive hypersonics as a bigger market. Is that an area that you\u2019re focused on, because there you also looked like you have the technology capability?","Kathy Warden","Yes. Why don\u2019t I start with the second part of your question, because in the counter-hypersonics part of the market, we are establishing ourselves as the prime. We have capabilities in the Missile Defense Regime today and in the space regime that we believe will be highly relevant to counter-hypersonics. So that is an area that we are aggressively pursuing.","In the case of hypersonics, thinking of the offense of weapon systems themselves. As I noted today, we do have prime effort. We also are supporting both Lockheed and Raytheon, and that\u2019s an important part of our strategy. We have done an Orbital ATK prior to joining Northrop Grumman, had been a merchant supplier to Raytheon and Lockheed. We got into agreements to support them on certain programs and we are very committed to uphold those agreements and continue to support them with our best and brightest people and technology.","As we look forward over the long-term, we certainly will look at every new opportunity as one that we would make a decision, is it right for us to pursue that as a prime or continue to have partnerships and work through the prime of Raytheon, Lockheed and perhaps others that might emerge in this space as well, or both, and offer capability to everyone who is choosing to pursue the marketplace.","And so those are decisions we\u2019ll take one by one. We are certainly not looking to take an aggressive stance in that marketplace, because as I said, it\u2019s a growing market and it\u2019s one that we feel is big enough for three parties to adequately play, and we want to make sure that our technology is getting into the hands of the war fighter and that we\u2019re giving them the best capabilities in a timely fashion. And sometimes it makes sense for us to work with our competitors to do that.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much.","Steve Movius","There\u2019s time for one more question.","Cai von Rumohr","Thanks, Kathy.","Operator","Yes. Your final question is from the line of Joseph DeNardi with the Stifel Nicholas.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes, good afternoon. Ken, you talked about your confidence in the cash flow generation of the business and kind of the capital deployment strategy. You guys have one of the lowest dividend yields in the industry. Obviously there two components to that equation. But can you talk about how you think about the dividend either as a percent of kind of free cash flow or total capital deployed, and whether you have a more ambitious plans for that going forward? Thank you.","Ken Bedingfield","Sure, I\u2019d be happy to talk about that. Thanks, Joe. From a dividend perspective, I guess I\u2019ll start with \u2013 we simply don\u2019t chase yield and can\u2019t chase yield. That being said, we\u2019ve seen significant increases in our dividend every year for the last number of years. I think it\u2019s been six years or so with double-digit increases. And in fact, two increases. I guess, it was in 2018, two 10% increases or 10% plus increases in 2018.","So we\u2019ve been seeing a significant increase in our dividend per share. And I will say that you\u2019re going to think of us as \u2013 certainly continue to think about what our future dividend increase would look like. But again, that being said, we don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t chase yield and it remains an important part of our capital deployment strategy. We\u2019ve tended to think of it as kind of a range of 30% to 40% of our pension adjusted net earnings. And we\u2019ve tended to be in the middle of the pack to our peers in terms of looking at our dividend based on that measure.","And so we think from a yield perspective, we may be a little bit low. But we think from a \u2013 again, looking at relative to our pension adjusted net earnings, that we\u2019re pretty squarely in the range in terms of making sure that we have a competitive dividend.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you.","Steve Movius","Kathy, I would like to turn the call over to you for final remarks.","Kathy Warden","Thanks, Steve.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Stephen Movius","Thanks, Shelby, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are noted in today's press release and our SEC filings.

Schedule 4 provides backlog trend information by sector and Schedule 5 provides supplemental per share information to help the quarter-over-quarter comparison of pension and purchased intangible impacts.","On the call today are Kathy Warden, our CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy.","Kathy Warden","Thank you, Steve, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. First quarter results represent a good start to the year as the Northrop Grumman team continues to deliver excellent outcome for our customers and our shareholders. I want to thank our employees for their relentless focus on performance, agility, and profitable growth. Top line growth, strong segment performance as well continued effective capital deployment drove a 6% increase in first quarter earnings per share.","As a result, the first quarter performance and our full-year expectation, we are affirming sales guidance of approximately $34 billion and raising our 2019 EPS guidance. First quarter sales grew 22%, reflecting the addition of Innovation Systems and a 7% top line growth in Aerospace Systems. Strong performance at all four sectors generated a 27% increase in segment operating income and a 50 basis point increase in our segment margin rate.","The strong margin rates at all four sectors also reflect the cost synergy we are achieving through the Orbital ATK integration which is benefiting all the sectors. The realignment of the TS business areas continue to improve their cost structure and competitiveness as reflected in this quarter's margin rate and our TS guidance increase for the full year. As is our typical quarterly pattern, we were a user of cash in the first quarter.","We continue to expect 2019 free cash flow of $2.6 billion to $3 billion. Regarding capital deployment, our strategy continues to call for value creation through thoughtful allocation across our priority of investing in our business, managing the balance sheet, and distributing cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases. Looking ahead, we are on a solid growth trajectory supported by first quarter net awards of $12.3 billion or about 1.5 times book-to-bill ratio.","Total backlog increased 7% to $57.3 billion, reflecting 16% growth at Mission Systems and 6% increase at Aerospace Systems. Total backlog is up 35% when compared to March 31, 2018. That comparison reflects an increase of more than 30% at Mission Systems and 11% at Aerospace Systems. At Aerospace Systems, Q1 net award totaled $5.4 billion. In Space, we received a $3.2 billion restricted award.","In Manned Aircraft, we finalized the $740 million contract for the U.S. Navy and Kuwaiti F\/A-18. And, we were awarded $5.35 million for the F-35. And shortly after the end of the quarter, we signed a multi-billion dollar production contract for 24 U.S. Navy E-2D advanced Hawkeyes. The new multi-year contract includes an option for Japan's purchase of nine additional E-2Ds. Japan has also approved the additional 2Ds in their long-term budget, and we expect that we will be under contract by the end of 2019.","At Innovation Systems, the Navy awarded us a sole-source $323 million EMD contract for AARGM-ER, an extended range version of our current missile. AARGM-ER will initially be fielded on F\/A-18 Super Hornets and Growlers. It will also be the first supersonic long-range missile to be integrated on to the F-35. And it is expected to be the strike weapon of choice for both the Navy and the Air force. The President's FY 2020 budget includes a request for the Air force variants of AARGM-ER and is called Stand-in Attack Weapon.","AARGM-ER is an early example of revenue synergy. Innovation Systems leads the effort with two of our other sectors contributing to the program. This draws from the full breath of our technologies and capabilities for delivering high-speed missile system and demonstrates our ability to work seamlessly across the company to provide needed capabilities to our customers.","We expect follow-on production after EMD will be in the multi-billion dollar range. We are currently performing on a number of other high-speed and hypersonic missile programs at the prime contractor and sub-contractor levels which are contributing to IS backlog and sales growth. Turning to Mission Systems, net awards totaled $5 billion in the quarter in airborne radar. MS awarded -- was awarded a contract to equip five U.K. Wedgetail airborne early warning and control platform with our MESA radar.","The U.K. joins a number of other international customers in selecting the MESA radar for this capability. In commanding control, MS received a $633 million SMS award to supply our IBCS battle management system for phase 1 of Poland's next-generation air and missile defense. This award aligns Poland with the U.S. Army in utilization IBCS' any sensor, any shooter capability for next-generation air and missile defense. We continue to invest in expanding IBCS' addressable market.","For example, during the quarter we and MBDA funded the successful demonstration of IBCS' functionality with a non-U.S. missile system by integrating MBDA's CAMM family of missiles. We did so quickly and at a fraction of traditional missile defense system cost. MS was also awarded $117 million to develop the next-generation radar threat warning system to protect Navy rotatory aircraft. This sensor counters a new generation of highly mobile anti-aircraft weapon and has the potential for international sales.","During the quarter, our G\/ATOR program achieved initial operating capability and is now transitioning into service. We are currently negotiating a full-rate production contract with the Marine Corp, which we expect will be finalized in the near future. And at TS, we were awarded $52 million for KC-30 sustainment in Australia and $44 million for our battlefield airborne communications node. Companywide, these awards position us for accelerating growth and will be executed over the coming year.","Across the sectors on F-35, we are nearing completing of negotiation for center fuselage units, radars, CNI, DAS, aero structures and other equipment for the loss covering the next several hundred aircraft. We continue to aggressively drive affordability on this program while maintaining strong program performance. Now, I would like to spend a few minutes on a major area of opportunity for us, Space.","With this addition of Innovation Systems, our Space portfolio is an excess of $7 billion in annual revenue. Our capabilities address end-to-end mission needs including launch, satellites, payloads, ground systems, and commanding control. We are designing and manufacturing systems vital to our national security and continually pushing the boundaries of science and exploration.","We are taking commercial applications and technology and creating cost-effective and reliable solution for government partner using Agile processes. We established a resiliency and rapid prototyping space business unit to augment and sharpen our focus on emerging customer opportunities in the new space war fighting domain. A notable outcome from this unit is the R3D2, an experimental satellite for DARPA, which launched from a commercial launch pad in New Zealand in late March.","Our R3D2 demonstrated a new type of deployable antenna for small aircraft. This landmark program went from concept to orbit in 20 months. The successful demonstration will lend support to developing additional smaller, faster to launch and lower cost capabilities that can optimize the new commercial market for small inexpensive launch vehicle by both the DoD and commercial users. We're extremely proud of this effort, and I want to congratulate the entire team on its success.","I also want to recognize the innovation systems team for last week successful on schedule and on budget, Antares rocket launch of our Cygnus spacecraft. Cygnus delivered 7,600 pounds of scientific equipment and supplies to the International Space Station. This is our 11th launch under the first commercial re-supply contract and we look forward to continued successful missions under our follow-on contract. The President's FY 2020 budget includes increased investments in space, missile defense, nuclear deterrence, artificial intelligence and hypersonic. There is strong bipartisan support for these increased investments to support the National Security Strategy, The National Defense Strategy as well as the framework outlined in the Missile Defense Review. I'm confident that we have the advanced technologies, products and services necessary to support our nation's most critical security mission which are well-funded in the President's budget.","As CEO, I'm focused on sharpening our operational efficiency and agility, so that we capture and successfully execute the programs that are portfolio enabled. I'm very pleased at how the team is responding. Our ability to engage with and quickly address our customers rapidly evolving needs with affordable and innovative solutions is critical to achieving our growth potential, creating value for our shareholders and supporting global security and human advancement with our customers.","So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financial results and guidance. Ken?","Ken Bedingfield","Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon everyone. I also want to thank our team for a solid first quarter results. I'd note that our presentation includes an EPS bridge from first quarter 2018 to first quarter 2019, a bridge to our updated 2019 EPS guidance as well as a slide highlighting backlog trends. As you can see from the bridge on slide six, approximately $0.15 to $0.25 of the EPS increase is driven by a strong first quarter operational performance and full-year expectations with the remaining $0.15 primarily reflecting lower expected interest expense.","Let's turn to the sectors, Aerospace Systems sales rose 7% reflecting higher volume in all three business areas. Operating income increased 12% and margin rate increased 50 basis points to 10.9%. Manned aircraft and autonomous systems programs were the primary drivers of higher sales and operating income as well as margin rate expansion. Restricted F35 and E-2D programs drove higher manned aircraft volume. Higher autonomous sales reflect higher volume across several programs including Triton as that program moves towards full rate production.","We continue to expect AS sales to increase to the high $13 billion range with a mid to high 10% operating margin rate. No change to the prior guidance. At innovation systems, based on pro forma sales comparisons, first quarter sales rose 10% due to higher volume in all three business areas as we see the benefits of revenue synergy begin to kick in.","In space, higher volume on national security satellite systems drove the increase. Defense systems had higher volume in tactical missiles including the AARGM program as well as higher volume for precision munitions and armaments. And at flight systems, higher sales reflect increased volume on launch vehicles principally ground based Midcourse Defense as well as higher volume on aerospace structures.","IS operating income was $167 million and operating margin rate was strong at 11.6%. First quarter margin rate reflects favorable outcomes on certain commercial contract negotiations. We had expected these items later in the year and we're pleased they concluded in the first quarter. We continue to expect IS sales to increase to the high $5 billion range with margin rate in the mid 10% range. No change to prior guidance.","Turning to Mission Systems, first quarter sales were comparable to last year's first quarter. Operating income increased 3% and operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to 13.3%. First quarter MS sales reflect the headwind of approximately $100 million from JRDC and a restricted space program. The headwinds from these two programs are now hardly behind us. The first quarter was also low point from material. We are just beginning to accelerate on a long-term growth trajectory at Mission Systems. This positions MS well for the remainder of 2019 and in 2020 as volume ramps on airborne and space restricted programs F35 and IBCS for Poland just to name a few. We continue to expect MS revenue to grow to the low to mid $12 billion range with a margin rate of approximately 13%, no change to prior guidance.","Technology Services sales and operating profit declined in the quarter reflecting completion of the VITA IT outsourcing program, the KC-10 sustainment program and JRDC. The headwind from these three programs was about $125 million in the first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect TS sales will stabilize as these headwinds diminish and we continue to expect TS sales in a low $4 billion range.","First quarter performance, we are raising guidance for TS operating margin rate to approximately 10% versus prior guidance of mid to high 9%. As we roll all that up, we continue to expect 2019 sales of approximately $34 billion with a low to mid 11% segment operating margin rate. No change to prior guidance.","Guidance for total operating margin rate is also unchanged at mid to high 10%. We are reducing our interest expense guidance to approximately $560 million from our previous guidance of approximately $590 million largely reflecting a revision in our capitalized interest estimate. We are increasing our mark-to-market earnings per share guidance to $18.90 to $19.30. I should say to a range of $18.90 to $19.30 based on approximately 170 million weighted average shares outstanding.","Turning to cash, first quarter cash flow is impacted by an ERP system conversion to a single instance of SAP covering the majority of our businesses. My congratulations to the team for achieving this significant operational efficiency milestone. Although successfully completed, the conversion delayed billings and cash receipts of approximately $350 million. We expect full recovery of billings and cash collections in the second quarter.","First quarter cash use also increased due to the addition of Innovation Systems which drove $250 million of cash use in the quarter. This seasonal pattern mirrors the rest of the company. We continue to expect strong cash flow in 2019 with no change to full-year guidance of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion cash from operations and $2.6 billion to $3 billion of free cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion. We continue to play on share repurchases of approximately $750 million this year assuming current market conditions and as previously discussed, we intend to retire about $500 million in debt in the third quarter.","In summary, we expect to continue strong value creation through a combination of continued growth, strong program and a financial performance and robust cash generation, reflecting our growing business, normalization of CapEx and capture of working capital opportunities. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve.","Stephen Movius","Thanks, Ken. In the interest of time, I request each analyst to lift themselves to a single question. Shelly, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse.","Rob Singarn","Good afternoon.","Ken Bedingfield","Hi, Rob.","Rob Singarn","So -- hi, Ken, I guess the elephant in the room here is the sales growth, primarily ATS, but an MS2, so I wanted to ask about the recoveries for both of those. It sounds like from the bookings in your comments just before that, maybe MS starts growing here in the second quarter, but I wanted to check on that, see if that's correct. And then with TS and given that the book-to-bill was below one there, can you really see growth in 2020 is -- I think you said last time, and how do you think about that sector strategically, would you say that the first quarter was below your expectations?","Kathy Warden","So, Rob thanks for the question, and I'll start and then ask Ken to provide more details on the financial, and let me start with the second part of your question first in terms of the positioning at Technology [ph] Services. From a portfolio shaping perspective, and the program losses that we've experienced, which we've been talking about for a while, first West was indicating those and then more recently maybe we certainly saw that those were quite impactful this quarter. A tough Q1 compared to 2018 as we had multiple programs that have rolled off over the last year, including but not limited to KC10, JRDC, and Vito, which we talked about quite a bit.","So what we have been doing with that business is really repositioning it for growth. And you are seeing the impact of some of those changes that we made late last year, including the consolidation into two segments. This is positioning the business better for competitiveness in the marketplace and also margin rate performance. And they've delivered that this quarter. So we're going to continue to be a better profile from TS as those programs roll off several of them in this first quarter, and look toward a return to growth for TS late this year.","In terms of Mission Systems, you hit the nail on the head, we've seen strong backlog improvement at MS, 30% year-over-year for MS and they are positioned for accelerating growth. They too had two program headwinds that end in the first quarter of this year, and then, largely those headwinds are behind us, and I expect enough to return to a healthy growth rate in the second quarter.","Ken, anything you'd like to add?","Ken Bedingfield","I would just say that from a details perspective, TS, we were certainly hoping for a bit of a different outcome in the first quarter. We did certainly understand that there were the headwinds that existed and that represented about 11% headwind for the quarter. So, if you think of without those note items, TS would have been down about 4%, and we were hoping for less than that. So, we'll certainly continue to work hard there to generate the awards that will present for 2020 and beyond.","And at MS, I think I would just say, you know, I would reiterate strong backlog, whether you look at from last year's first quarter or even from your end backlog is up 16%. We did have some timing of material recedes [ph] that I mentioned, which had some impact, and I think we feel awfully darn good about how MS is positioned right now.","Rob Singarn","Thank you both.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Raviv of Citi.","Jon Raviv","Thank you. Is the implied -- when you talk about growth going forward, would you say the implied kind of exit growth rate this year is sustainable? And then, at least something accelerated 2020, and to what extent really can you do that? And then really admit that growth acceleration, how think about -- how should we think about margin from the mid-high 10 this year, since the margin that's usually mixed-driven, do you see a path to accelerating growth, while also expanding margin? Thank you.","Kathy Warden","So -- thanks, Jon, at the macro level, I certainly see the opportunity for accelerated growth, and we've pointed to backlog a couple of times, but let me also talk about other things that we've done in the business because I think it's important context. We talked earlier in the year about having added an element of our incentive compensation to focus on segment operating margin growth with the full impact that our team will be incentivized to capture profitable sales. We're also winning programs that represent revenue synergy from the IS acquisition, I talked to AARGM-ER this time in the last call; I talked about some of the opportunities in space. And we've started to make some structural changes that better position us for capturing growth. I talked about the TS consolidation, and earlier in this call, I mentioned the creation of the safe resilience and rapid prototyping unit.","All of these activities in combination are positioning us to continue with growth and accelerate it over the coming year. So, absolutely see that as possible, and expansion of margins also you saw in the results of this quarter. So, margin expansion, we are taking the cost synergies that are created through the integration of Orbital ATK, and those are benefiting all sectors, and you're seeing that in the result, not just solid program performance, which also continues, but the addition of these overhead reductions that are benefiting the sectors.","Ken Bedingfield","And I think what I would add to that, Kathy, is if I think about the acceleration or the implied exit growth part of the question, I would say, we do feel pretty confident about that, and I think I guess, there are a couple drivers there. One would be you know, we are a long cycle business, and it takes some time for budgets to turn into outlays, and then outlays to turn into our sales. And we certainly try to be careful and thoughtful in terms of how we generate those sales such that we are as efficient as possible and don't motivate [ph] production lines for short-term growth.","And then I would also say that where we are aligned within how the budget is positioning going forward, today and dealing with the threats that are identified and the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, Missile Defense Review, we feel good about our capabilities and technology alignment to the mission needs that our customer will face. So, I would say we do feel good about the long-term growth that we've talked about, 2019, 2020 and beyond.","And then on the margin expansion, I would say that a couple things, I think we have the opportunity for margin expansion. There are a few things that we need to think about in that regard. Number one, we've been I think effectively managing our cost structure, and that continues. That's a benefit. We also have strong growing production programs, I mentioned Triton getting ready to move into full rate production. That's a benefit. And then we also have a growing set of international opportunities, which should generate a nice margin.","Going the other way, we have some margin rate pressure in terms of continued growth and development programs, both in national security space and hypersonic, as Kathy mentioned. So that could put a little bit of pressure on the margins. And if there were a big win, like a GBSD, as we've talked about before, that could have some impact as well, but we do certainly feel confident about maintaining strong margin rate and having a nice set of growing margin dollars consistent with what we see on the top line.","Jon Raviv","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Yes, good afternoon. Could you tell us how much F35 revenues grew in the quarter? And then also, will this be one of the best quarters of the year because with your high-end of your guide at 1930, 506 is obviously more than 25% of the of the year, or are you just providing conservative guidance","Ken Bedingfield","On the first question, George, I don't remember the precise F35 sales growth number for the quarter, but I will say that, I believe our largest program in the range of 9% to 10% of sales, we do see F35 growth that all four of the sectors, AS with the center fuselage, MS radar C&I and other equipment and then IS with air structure is in TS for sustainment. And for the year, I think we see that growing across the company at a rate of high single-digit growth. And then with respect to your question on EPS, I would say that, look, we continue to try to burn down risks as we worked through the year and realize opportunities, such that we can find ways to look at where we can ultimately get to an EPS.","In terms of first quarter, I would say that we had solid operational results in terms of margin rate, and we look at that as giving us the opportunity to perform a bit better in our range, segment margin and total margin range that we previously talked about. And then, we had the reduction in the interest expense. So, Q1 is a solid quarter, a good EPS number, will continue again to try to find those risks to burn down. And I guess the only other thing to remind you of is that Q4 does tend to be a heavier quarter for corporate unallocated. And so that could drive a little bit more cost into fourth quarter than we normally see in the first three, so I would say that's the way to think about it, George.","George Shapiro","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey.","Kathy Warden","Hi.","Carter Copeland","Kathy, this may be somewhat of a too nuanced of a question, but I'm somewhat intrigued about the insertion of the word agility into your prepared remarks. And the press release. I went back and looked at that in terms of General, performance statement over the last couple years. And that's not a word that comes up. And so, it sort of strikes me as a particular point of emphasis. And I wondered if you might elaborate a little bit on what that means for all the simultaneous efforts you outlined in the previous answer to the question?","Kathy Warden","Yes, thank you. I would like to talk about agility in a couple of contexts. First, our ability to rapidly identify new solutions to help our customers and you've heard me talk about that and how important it is to the profitable growth in our company and also realizing the revenue synergy with the acquisition of orbital ATK. And I'm quite pleased to see the team responded in the way that they are to very rapidly put together the components of our portfolio and meet customer needs. I also talk about agility in the speed at which we are able to work with our customers today. I gave the example of our 3D2, and the fact that we were able to get something from concept on orbit in space in 20 months. So when we think about the way we deliver, we're also implying agility, to our operation. And this helps us to be more competitive in the marketplace. But it also aligns to what are our customers are talking about, in a need to address the threat at the speed of relevance. So as the threat is advancing speed of capability to mission is absolutely essential. And Northrop Grumman is well positioned to do that, with those components of our portfolio, and with our operations. We're just continuing to streamline those operations, so that we can move even more quickly.","Carter Copeland","How do you benchmark that?","Kathy Warden","The way I benchmark it is against the performance expectations that our customer has. So if a customer believes he should take a certain amount of time to get a capability, fielded, if we can beat that we're going to have a competitive differentiation. I benchmark it internally in terms of our own processes, in looking at the cost at which we deliver those services, but also the speed at which we deliver those services.","Carter Copeland","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays.","David Strauss","Thanks, good afternoon.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, David.","David Strauss","The 25% to 30% of the portfolio that's restricted. Could you talk about how that grew in the first quarter.","Ken Bedingfield","I'm not sure. I've got that number off the top my head, David, in terms of first quarter growth. What I will say is that a few things, one, we do believe that the restricted portfolio is particularly well aligned to our customers' needs in terms of what they are focused on today and those threats. And we do expect that for 2019 and for sort of the long run we believe that the restricted portfolio will likely grow faster than the unrestricted portfolio. And I would say we expect that at the macro-customer level as well as at the north of ground level. And it's -- I can't say a lot about it but it is a strong portfolio that will likely turn into continued opportunities both from a customer relationship perspective as well as the potential to accelerate what happens in those programs to future phases be at AMD to production or whatever it may be. And so we feel really good about the portfolio and maybe just to point out a couple of things, for Q1 and Steve can certainly follow up later on with the number, but we did talk about growth at innovation systems and national security space, most of which would be restricted and certainly growth at aerospace systems where we talked about restricted. And then also comments at Mission Systems with respect to a few areas where they will see restricted growth in the next three quarters of the year and into 2020.","David Strauss","And then you highlighted the backlog growth at Mission System. Kathy anything, I think you previously talked about mid single-digit top line growth in 2020. Would you expect MS to lead that growth among the three businesses, or sorry, business segments?","Kathy Warden","As we look to the remainder of this year, MS will be a strong contributor to the growth in the Company.","David Strauss","Okay, thank you very much.","Kathy Warden","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Good afternoon, Kathy and Ken. Thank you. Just on that, I guess on MS, you were awarded IBCS for Poland in the quarter. How do we think about the ability to leverage some of these programs to both grow the international business, and just when we think about other franchise opportunity?","Kathy Warden","Yes, I see good opportunity particularly in the Mission Systems portfolio. And I noted a few of them today, you mentioned IBCS as Poland and I talked about also the work we did with MBBA to demonstrate the ability to integrate an international missile with our missile defense system. I also see portability for gater [ph]. We talked about a new sensor that we're developing that has international applicability in MS as well. So across the board, we have had strong export business in Mission Systems and I see that potential continuing to grow. And we also have global operations, in particularly, Europe, and Australia that are continuing to grow across the portfolio, but particularly with opportunity in Mission Systems as well.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much, and good afternoon. So, I wonder if you could tell us, I mean historically you guys were a pretty good performer on working capital. I know things kind of move around quarter-to-quarter. So, this quarter is an anomaly. But now that we've got innovation systems in there, what's -- let's say, at year-end period, what's the appropriate level of working capital for the business, I don't know if you can size it as a percentage of sales or any way that you're comfortable?","Ken Bedingfield","Sure. Yes. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks we do think that there are working capital opportunities in front of us. As we look at 2019, we probably see more opportunity from a working capital perspective, quite frankly in 2020. I think as we grow the business in '19, we see the ability to either grow working capital at a similar rate or potentially slightly less, but we do see some opportunity to liquidate some working capital in 2020. And I would say that NGIS had a little different working capital structure than we did some of that is structural say NASA, CRS. Those payment terms are going to be, but they're going to be there's opportunity to burn some down -- some other programs and then we'll just continue to diligently work day to day to make sure that we get the right payment terms for the type of work that we are performing and the contracts that we're signing and just continue to stay focused on that.","And then also, we need to continue to work with our customer and make sure that their payment terms are appropriate again for the type of contract and the type of work. And we would like to see opportunity on that side, as we continue to work with them for again appropriate industry wide payment terms.","Seth Seifman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Thank you. Hi, everybody. I think you talked about this $1 billion submarine subsystems systems award. Is that really to Columbia class, I'm sorry. And can you remind me of your total exposure -company exposure to shipbuilding and how you expect that to trend over the next few years? Thanks.","Ken Bedingfield","Sure. I wouldn't be able to comment on specifically the class of submarine, but what I would say is that we did reach an agreement in the quarter for about $1.3 billion, some of that had been previously recorded as long lead to provide a number of units for our propulsion and turbine generators in support of the U.S. Navy Submarine production and we do expect that to be delivered over a number of years. In terms of the overall exposure to shipbuilding, I would for us probably frame that in the range of mid-to-high single digits in terms of sales maybe bit more like mid single digits.","Hunter Keay","And you expect that to stay roughly there over the next say five to ten years?","Ken Bedingfield","I don't expect. Based on what we do in that area, we don't tend to see a lot of volatility. I think there is an opportunity for growth as we think about the Columbia class as you asked about, there are some other areas, we will provide capability for surface ships, electronic equipment and things like that on surface ships as well as some seaborne radar capability and, may be some opportunity for growth, but probably not one of the fastest growing areas in the Company.","Hunter Keay","I see. Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good afternoon.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, Rob.","Robert Stallard","Ken, a quick question for you on cash, is there any way you can fix this seasonality that you see in this cash make it little bit level loaded throughout the year?","Ken Bedingfield","We're working on it Rob, I would say. There are some, I'd call them structural timing of certain payments and receipts that we see that make that a little bit of a challenge. There are just certain outflows that occur early in the year and we have always tended to have a strong fourth quarter and we're always working hard to pull more cash from next year into this year that means you're going to do it all over again. But we're looking at strategies, I don't see us ever get into a point where we're level but we can certainly be significantly better than we were this year we had a couple of notable challenges as I mentioned this year. And we can do better, but I wouldn't expect us to be kind of ratable across the year.","Robert Stallard","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ron Epstein","Hi, good afternoon, guys.","Kathy Warden","Hi, Ron.","Ron Epstein","Kathy, as we think about the next couple of quarters. Can you give us a little, maybe insight baseball on what programs we should be keeping an eye on? What are the shorter-term opportunities that could as outsiders, we should be keeping on eye on that you guys could potentially when?","Kathy Warden","So Ron, as is usually the case, a good bit of the work we continued to pursue and even what we talked about winning in this first quarter is restricted. So while I can't point to specific opportunities. We are seeing growth in Hypersonics and the programs that we have already won will continue to have opportunities for increased scope. We have national security space, which is a number of restricted programs, some of which we booked in the first quarter and we referenced in today's call; others that are pending awards later in the year. We also have opportunities that are more public. Clearly, the launch services agreement that we are under today and working with the year forced to compete for the down to be launched one of two launch services providers for national security launches. And then we have TBSD, which we are competing for and we expect the RFPM later this year that will be awarded next year are just a handful of areas that I would suggest that you monitor with that.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. And then maybe for follow-on related, when you think about the budget request from the administration and kind of maybe where we are through the process of the Armed Services Committee, House Armed Services Committee coming back with response, how do you feel about that budget relative to how you're positioned?","Kathy Warden","I feel very positive about our alignment to the budget even after we look at the Congressional process that is going to into. We have strong alignment to the threats and being able to address areas that are certainly of note. We've talked about a number of them today Hypersonics, artificial intelligence, the continual progression of sensors that can detect advanced threats which impact both our Mission Systems business, are continuing growth in the weapons and high-speed metals area. I talked about AARGM-ER today, and I see a strong alignment to the capability that will be needed in the future and both the Navy and the Air Force have expressed interest in that and full as a missile of choice. So, as I look at how those programs are supported in this budget, I see very strong alignment around the areas that we've been investing in and progressing our portfolio to fulfill and the budget. And the budget is very much based on the national defense strategy and that strategy is enduring and we expect it to continue to be the view of both parties that we need to align to that strategy and ensure that we're dealing with the threats of particularly China and Russia.","Ron Epstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, Kathy. Hi, Kenneth.","Ken Bedingfield","Hey, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani","Two quick ones, if I may. One, just curious on Algeria stay and how you're feeling about it as time has evolved and you've digested? Yes. Then unrelated to have become a back something you said earlier on the missile defense side, can you talk about Patriot and your involvement in the satin soften in the potential opportunity on the radar, that's a potential here on the domestic side?","Kathy Warden","Sure, I'll actually start with the latter. And as you might guess, there isn't a lot that I'm going to say about an active competition other than the fact that we are participating in the sense off. And so we're looking forward to offerings of competitive solution that meets the requirements. Shifting to GBSD, we have been working with the government as you know on the risk reduction contract EMR that is going well. We have received draft of the RFP for the next phase of GBSD and so we are in earnest working our proposal. There's nothing in the draft RFPs that have been a surprise to us. And we continue to work to put in place a very competitive offering for the Air Force and expect that proposal to go in later this year, and as I noted in the earlier comments to be awarded next year.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird.","Peter Arment","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, Kathy, and Ken. Kathy, maybe you could just give us a couple of comments or metrics that you can and the innovation and systems integration process? Where are you today? And are you on track for kind of the goals that you set up when the deal was achieved? Thanks.","Kathy Warden","Yes, the integration continues to progress exceptionally well. I'm proud of how that team is performing. We had set cost synergy targets to reach $150 million run rate by the end of 2019 going into 2020. We are on track to achieve that. And as I said, some of the performance improvement that we've seen across the sectors even in this first quarter, our results of those cost synergies starting to be reflected in the sectors. We also are starting to see revenue synergy realized and when we first laid out the business case behind the deal, we did not anticipate seeing revenue synergy quite as quickly. So both in Space and Missile we've pleased at how quickly those have progressed.","And then we also when we laid out the deal with all of you talked about operational synergies and these are areas like facilities overlap that we have within the portfolio that we have an opportunity now to rationalize with the addition of Orbital ATK and we are making good headway on those operational synergies as well, again even faster than I had anticipated. We've been able to identify some opportunities and realize those this year, so all-in-all, feel very positive about the performance of the business as well as the integration process that we're executing.","Peter Arment","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS.","Myles Walton","Hey, good afternoon. Kathy, I was looking at the changes of incentive metrics on new leaders come in and you mentioned one of those with the insertion of segment operating margin growth. And I guess there was a little bit at the emphasis on the weighting of margin rates, and I think Ken touched on that. But the other incentive you added was RONA [ph] and I'm curious, the last time this was in the mix was prior to the spin-off of shipbuilding and was probably a pretty good indication of how the company was thinking about relative asset returns. So I'm curious when you included this new metric, what exactly are you trying to motivate and sense with the addition of this particular one?","Kathy Warden","So, let me start and then I'll have Ken add a little bit of color on the measure as well. And what we are looking to do is incentivize the top team and I should note that this metric has been in place for most of our leadership as part of our incentive plan. We added it for the top leadership team has the component of the long-term in incentive and we are working to drive performance in the elements of the business that leadership can control in terms of both returns but also managing the assets of the business and we focused more on the operating assets of the business, so that we aren't penalized the team for areas like goodwill and the issues that come with making an acquisition as we just did. And all I can detail that a little bit more for you, but really it is getting the team is focused on the operations of the business. I also added another element of our non-financial goals on operational efficiency and that is meant to streamline our processes, speed, decision making, so that we're able to operate more efficiently and effectively inside the corporation and it goes back to the comments I was making and Carter questions about agility.","Ken Bedingfield","Yes, just a couple comments I would add there, Myles. We essentially focus our incentives around growth from a profitable growth perspective, not just growth for growth sake which is why we like the segment, margin dollars as a growth metric. We also have cash generation, as a significant measure in both our annual and long-term plan. And then with respect to your question on sort of RONA in the old days, I think what you maybe remember in the old days wasn't economic value add metric. We actually have had RONA for some period of time and then two years ago we moved from RONA to what we call operating RONA and think of operating RONA as essentially a return on working capital, and we didn't want to try to dilute the -- our ability to create value through managing the balance sheet by including things in there like goodwill and intangible assets and, and those things that are more challenging for the team to manage, obviously on a day-by-day basis. So, we essentially created a metric that is, return to, to working capital and we call that operating RONA.","Myles Walton","Okay\u2026","Stephen Movius","I think we have time for one more question.","Ken Bedingfield","Sorry, Myles.","Myles Walton","No worries.","Kathy Warden","Thanks, Myles.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thanks so much. So Kathy, on the fourth quarter call, you talked about B21 being flattish this year. And yet it looks like it was up in the first quarter. Has anything change their and secondly, you\u2026revenue growth is a key issue. What sort of backlog growth should we see in the remainder of the year to tell us this is going to happen in the future? Thanks.","Ken Bedingfield","Let me let me start on that, Cai, and then, Kathy can add some commentary. I would say that looking at Q1, we did see some higher volume on restricted programs within manned aircraft. And I wouldn't want to comment beyond that as to what that might be. In terms of the B21 program I would say, that's been one of our fastest growing programs for the last few years. And we continue to think that the profile we talked about for the full year 2019 is appropriate.","In terms of awards, I would say that, Kathy mentioned, a multibillion-dollar, multi-year award on the E-2D that we got in April, we're certainly expecting another significant award as we look forward on working with Lockheed on F35, and that would be across a number of sectors. And then, Kathy mentioned, an option for nine aircraft on E-2D over Japan. We do think that is likely to come later in the year. And then also, we did highlight a significant restricted award in the quarter, and we're looking at some continued restricted awards in the balance of the year. So I think there is a really solid story here, not just the first quarter. But as we look forward into 2019, and I'll just remind you that we are a long cycle business and in particular, multi-year awards will turn themselves into sales over a longer period of times. But, we're gaining confidence and our ability to continue to grow as we look forward.","Cai von Rumohr","Thank you very much.","Stephen Movius","Let's now turn the call over to Kathy for final comments.","Kathy Warden","Thanks, Steve. I'll end the call again by thanking the Northrop Grumman team for their outstanding performance and commitment to deliver growth and provide long-term value for our customers and shareholders, and I want to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. That concludes the call. I'll speak to you in July.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Chanel, and welcome to Northrop Grumman\u2019s Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially.","On the call today are our Chairman and CEO, Wes Bush; and our CFO, Jim Palmer. Please go to Slide 3. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush","All right. Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our second quarter conference call. This was an outstanding quarter in a challenging environment. Segment operating margin rate, EPS, cash from operations and free cash flow all improved over last year. And new business awards totaled $8.8 billion, a book-to-bill of 140% which increased our backlog to $41.5 billion. Our focus on superior program performance, cost reductions and customer affordability, in combination with effective cash deployment, continues to generate solid financial results and create shareholder value.","All 4 of our businesses performed well. Together, they generated segment operating income roughly equal to last year's second quarter despite lower sales. And segment operating margin rate increased 50 basis points to 12.5%. Earnings per share increased 4% to $1.88, and on a pension-adjusted basis, earnings per share increased 13%.","Cash was also a highlight for the quarter. Cash from operations totaled $876 million, and after capital expenditures of $51 million, we generated free cash flow of $825 million. During the quarter, we continued to execute our balanced cash deployment strategy. In the second quarter, we repurchased 4.9 million shares of common stock for approximately $295 million. Year-to-date repurchases totaled 9.3 million shares for approximately $560 million. We also announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend in the second quarter. Maintaining a competitive dividend payout ratio on a pension-adjusted basis continues to be a priority in our cash deployment strategy. Year-to-date, we've returned $820 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which is consistent with our pattern of returning more than 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders over the last several years.","Turning to guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we're increasing 2012 earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.05 to $7.25 from the prior range of $6.70 to $6.95. Our sales guidance for the year is unchanged. 2012 guidance assumes a continuing resolution in the fourth quarter, but our guidance does not contemplate extraordinary customer actions in anticipation of a potential sequestration at the beginning of 2013. We continue to see modest organic sales growth in key domain areas, which is being offset by our portfolio-shaping actions and lower volume for other programs due to ramp downs and cancellations.","We continue to capture new business in our key focus areas of C4ISR; Unmanned; Cyber; and Logistics and Modernization based on our competitive discriminators in these areas. Our $8.8 billion in new awards included several large awards in our strategic focus areas. These include: $1.6 billion for NATO AGS; as well as multimillion dollar contracts for the next-generation Fire Scout unmanned helicopters; F-16 airport fire control radars for Thailand, Iraq and Oman; Cybersecurity projects; and a contract to upgrade the U.S. Air Force's electronic attack pods. We also recorded $1.4 billion in awards for the James Webb Space Telescope. This quarter's awards resulted in a 6% increase in our total backlog.","So overall, it was a very good quarter. But as we look ahead, we see an increasing risk profile due to budget uncertainty. This uncertainty becomes more critical as we progress through the year, and we recognize that it's also a major area of concern for all of our stakeholders. As the government formulates future Defense budgets, we are preparing for various potential scenarios, including sequestration. Like others in our industry, we are very concerned about sequestration's serious negative consequences for national security and the Defense Industrial Base, and the shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and all the communities that rely on the Defense Industrial Base.","While we've not received planning guidance from the government on how sequestration would be implemented, we are developing contingency plans. There are many variables in how the law could be implemented that will determine the specific impacts. However, we expect that as currently provided for under the Budget Control Act, sequestration would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows for our company.","We appreciate the work that some in Congress are undertaking to ensure the capability and readiness of our nation's military under the specter of a potential sequestration. We believe that a solution that avoids sequestration and its destructive impacts is in our best national interest.","In addition to sequestration, we're also planning for various other budget scenarios, all of which call for a heightened focus on innovation, cost reductions and customer affordability initiatives.","Over the last several years, we've improved our performance for shareholders and customers by driving program performance, reducing costs and enhancing our portfolio alignment. Our year-to-date results demonstrate the positive impact these actions are having on our existing portfolio of contracts. They also position us to compete in a more challenging environment. We believe that we're taking the right steps in the current environment and that we can continue to create value for our shareholders by remaining focused on our key priorities: performance; effective cash deployment; and portfolio optimization.","Now before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to provide some perspective on Monday's leadership succession announcement. These organizational changes take effect in 2013 and are the result of thoughtful and thorough succession planning as well as extensive internal leadership development. We decided to announce these changes now in order to enable a seamless leadership transition over the next 5 months. At Aerospace and Electronics, Gary Ervin and Jim Pitts each informed me of their intention to retire, Jim at the end of this year and Gary in the first quarter of next year. Both Gary and Jim are outstanding leaders whose contributions to Northrop Grumman, our industry and our nation's security are too numerous to name here. I want to personally thank Gary and Jim for their support and their leadership over these past several years. They have been instrumental in achieving the superior program performance and affordability improvements demonstrated in our financial results.","Linda Mills, the President of Information Systems, will join the corporate office as Corporate Vice President for operations. Linda has done an outstanding job at Information Systems, both in shaping our portfolio and improving financial performance.","In her new role, she will have a focus on our operational efforts that we have underway across the company to support our drive for sustained performance, even as our environment becomes more challenging.","Gary, Jim and Linda will continue to lead their organizations through the end of the year, which will support a smooth transition for our incoming sector leadership, all of whom are current Northrop Grumman leaders.","Tom Vice, the current President of Technical Services, will become President of Aerospace Systems. Tom joined what is now Northrop Grumman's Aerospace sector in 1986 as an engineer on the B-2 program. He's held a variety of AS leadership positions of increasing responsibility in operations and program management as well as business development. Before assuming the TS Presidency, Tom led the Aerospace Systems Battle Management and Engagement Systems Division, which encompass the E-2, LEMV and BAMS programs. And he also served as Vice President for Navy Airborne Early Warning and Battle Management Command and Control programs.","Gloria Flach, current President of Enterprise Shared Services, will become President of Electronic Systems. Gloria joined our Electronics business in 1981 and held numerous positions of increasing technical and management responsibility before leading our Shared Services organization. Just before assuming her current role at ESS, Gloria was Vice President and General Manager of the ES Targeting Systems Division and she also served as the Vice President and General Manager of Engineering and Logistics for Electronic Systems, which included executive responsibility for engineering and manufacturing operations and logistics services across the ES sector.","Linda, Tom and Gloria are current members of Northrop Grumman's Corporate Policy Council, which is our senior leadership team, and as such, they will provide additional continuity to the management of the company in their new roles.","Kathy Warden will become President of Information Systems. Kathy currently leads Information Systems Cyber Intelligence Division, which provides cyber capabilities to national and military intelligence programs. Kathy joined Northrop Grumman in 2008 as Vice President, Strategic Initiatives, where she was responsible for ISR market strategies, including key growth campaigns in cyber and intelligence information sharing. Kathy joined Northrop Grumman after having worked at another defense company as well as having worked in the commercial sector. Her breadth of experience is well aligned with the breadth of market focus at IS.","With the transition of Tom Vice to Aerospace Systems, Chris Jones will lead Technical Services. Chris currently leads the Integrated Logistics and Modernization Division at ES. Chris joined Northrop Grumman in 2004 as the Director of product support and international programs for the Airborne Early Warning Program at AS. He managed personnel located in several U.S. states and countries and was responsible for all domestic E-2 Hawkeye support and international E-2 programs. In addition to his program execution responsibility, he also was a key member of the business strategy development and capture teams.","In addition to these changes in our sector leadership, Mark Caylor, our Treasurer, will assume the presidency of Enterprise Shared Services. And Prabu Natarajan, Vice President of Tax, will continue with those responsibilities and also take on treasury responsibilities.","Dave Perry, whose appointment is effective immediately, will become Corporate Vice President and Chief Global Business Development Officer. Dave previously served as Vice President and General Manager of the Naval and Marine Systems division and Electronic Systems.","Each of the individuals chosen to lead our businesses has broad and deep industry experience and superior expertise and domain knowledge in their business areas. One of Northrop Grumman's strengths is our leadership bench and we are fortunate to have such talented leaders within Northrop Grumman to take on these roles.","All of these individuals have been important contributors to the operational performance improvement we've achieved over the last several years and I'm looking forward to accomplishing even more as we move ahead next year.","So now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?","James F. Palmer","Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The highlights for the quarter were the strong new business awards and our 12.5% segment operating margin rate, which combined with share repurchases, generated a 13% increase in pension-adjusted earnings per share.","On a pension-adjusted basis, operating income was comparable to last year's second quarter and pension-adjusted operating margin rate increased 50 basis points to 11.8%. Operating income for the quarter included a $64-million reduction in the net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment. Our improved results reflect, in part, the aggressive cost reductions we've taken to improve our affordability in anticipation of likely budget declines. We are realizing the benefit of those cost reductions on our existing backlog of contracts. Based on our year-to-date performance, we now expect a 2012 segment operating margin rate in the high 11% range with a total operating margin rate in the mid 11% range. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was equal to last year's at 34% and we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 33.75% for the year. We do not assume an extension of the R&D tax credit in that guidance for tax rate.","As Wes mentioned, cash results for the quarter were outstanding and reflect lower retirement benefit funding, as well as lower working capital requirements than in the prior year period. Our team's efforts to accelerate cash flow within the year are yielding benefits. However, we still expect cash flow to be weighted towards the second half of the year, as is our typical pattern.","Guidance for cash from operations is unchanged at $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and we continue to expect free cash flow to range from $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion.","Turning to the sectors. Sales in Aerospace Systems declined by $69 million or 3%. Adoption of the units of delivery revenue recognition method for the F-35 LRIP 5 contract impacted sales by approximately $30 million this quarter. The loss of the DWSS sales due to its cancellation last year also impacted year-over-year sales by about $56 million. F-18 volume was lower due to 2 fewer deliveries this year and B-2 volume declined, reflecting reduced modernization efforts on that platform.","Lower volumes for each of these programs more than offset the higher sales in the E-2D program and our Unmanned programs.","Aerospace operating income declined by 9% and resulted in an operating margin rate of 12.1%, compared with 12.9% last year. The 2 major drivers of these changes are the transition to the lower margin multi-year 3 contract for the F\/A-18 and the absence of last year's favorable imposed performance adjustments.","For the year, we continue to expect AS sales to range between $9.7 billion and $10 billion, with a mid 11% margin rate for the year. AS awards totaled $5.1 billion this quarter, which brings our total backlog up to nearly $21 billion. In Electronic Systems, sales declined by $47 million or 3%, reflecting the de-emphasis of our domestic Postal Automation business, which had reduced sales by $34 million.","We also experienced lower volume for international Postal Automation, laser systems and infrared countermeasures. Declines in these areas were partially offset by higher volume in our Space business programs.","ES operating income declined by 3%, consistent with sales, and the margin rate for the quarter was comparable to last year at 15.8%.","For the year, we continue to expect ES revenues of $6.9 billion to $7.2 billion, but we are increasing our ES margin rate guidance from mid 14% to low-to-mid 15%. This guidance reflects a margin rate of approximately 14% for the second half of the year, roughly in line with our original ES guidance for the year.","At Information Systems, sales declined by $175 million or approximately 9% on a year-over-year basis. The cancellation of the JTRS AMF program as well as the wind-down of the F-22 and last year's sale of the County of San Diego IT outsourcing contract altogether impacted sales by approximately $75 million. The balance of the sales decline reflects the general market softening due to the uncertainty of the budget environment and the shorter cycle nature of our IS business. Despite the lower sales, Information Systems' operating income increased by 7% and operating margin rate expanded 160 basis points to 10.9%.","Favorable performance on civil systems programs more than offset the impact of the lower volume. For the year, we continue to expect IS sales of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion. Although based on year-to-date results, I think 2012 sales will likely trend towards the lower end of that range. And we now expect 2012 operating margin rate at IS of approximately 10%, which is an increase from our prior guidance of mid 9%.","Turning to Technical Services. Second quarter sales increased slightly during the quarter due to higher volume for Integrated Logistics and Modernization programs. This more than offset the impact of portfolio-shaping actions and lower ICBM volume. Operating margin rate expanded 150 basis points to 9.5%, principally due to a favorable performance adjustment for risk mitigation on a Department of Homeland Security contract.","For the year, we now expect TS sales of approximately $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion with a mid 8% operating margin rate. So on a consolidated basis, our 2012 sales guidance remains unchanged at $24.7 billion to $25.4 billion. But based on the first half results, we are increasing our guidance for segment operating margin rate to high 11% from mid 11%, and total operating margin rate is increased to mid 11% from low 11%.","We now expect our share repurchases to reduce our annual weighted average share count by approximately 10% versus the prior assumption of 9%. And as well we disclosed in our 10-Q filing, second quarter net cume catch-up adjustments were $222 million, which is an increase of $21 million from the prior year. The improvement reflects a slightly higher level of positive adjustments as well as a slightly lower level of negative adjustments than in the prior year. The improvement is the result of our risk management process and affordability initiatives. Individually, none of the contract adjustments were material.","Before we begin the Q&A session, I just thought I'd take a few moments and talk about the impact of the pension relief legislation that was recently passed in the highway bill. As many of you may know, the legislation impacts the timing of mandatory pension contributions. Our analysis indicates that our mandatory contributions will decrease over the next 3 years and then those deferred contributions are paid back over the following 5 to 6 years. We estimate that the law reduces our otherwise required cumulative contributions for the years 2013 through 2016 by approximately $1.5 billion on a pretax basis or about $900 million on an after-tax basis. The change in law does not impact 2012 required contributions of $65 million.","Now we want to maintain the financial health of our benefit plans. We view it as a competitive advantage for us. So depending upon investment performance or tax planning strategies, we may elect to use some of this additional future cash flow provided by the legislation to voluntary fund our plans.","So in closing, our second quarter results demonstrate just outstanding operational performance. We remain focused on generating shareholder value through performance improvement, effective cash deployment and portfolio optimization. So Steve, I think with that introduction, we're ready for some Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Jim. Chanel, we are ready to begin the Q&A process.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In the past, you had said there would be about a $500 million impact this year from the combined impact of the change on the F-35, LRIP 5 and portfolio shaping. Can you just talk a little bit about that? I'm trying to just understand at what point do I look at your revenue year-over-year and say, \"This is what the organic trend is versus the portfolio shaping.\" When do we anniversary all of that? And do you still feel comfortable at $500 million is the right number for this year?","James F. Palmer","Yes, I'm trying to remember. I don't think the F-35 alone, the transition to units of delivery accounting was $500 million. I think it's more like a couple hundred million. And essentially, the revenue will start reversing here in the -- in second half of the year as we begin deliveries on LRIP 5. The balance was portfolio shaping and other actions, but the F-35 itself units of delivery was a couple hundred million dollar impact on 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Carter Copeland, Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just -- Wes, I'm interested in your comments around sequestration and the various scenarios you're planning for. I wondered if you might speak to some of the differences in those scenarios, what some of the key factors are and that you are looking at and judging the potential severity of some of these impacts. Any color would be helpful.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, we're in a just a fascinating situation here today. We have this law on the books that mandates that sequestration will occur on January 2, so that's the law. And I want to be clear that we will be ready to address that environment should that occur, but as I said in my remarks, that environment would represent lower revenues, profits and cash flows for our company. That said, we also know that the President and the Secretary of Defense, and to a very large extent, the leaders of both parties in Congress have said they do not want sequestration to occur. So exactly how this is going to play out is anybody's guess right now. And there are a lot of different scenarios floating around and everybody has their own view as to what might happen and when such things might happen. What we're doing is making sure that we're ready, and that means both planning for a variety of scenarios, both the sequestration scenario itself as well as other scenarios that might involve potential compromise positions on the part of the different parties that are taking part in this debate. We're doing that so that we're ready for a variety of outcomes. And we're doing it mindful that as we are making those plans and actually taking steps today to make sure that we're ready, we're doing that while ensuring that we're continuing to meet our customers' needs. And keeping all of that balanced as we go through here is going to be very, very important. The other part of this that's also very, very important is making sure that we're doing the right things to have a very talented and capable workforce for the future. And we're mindful of all of those dynamics as we are planning our actions as well as taking some actions today to preserve our flexibility and to make sure we're ready to really take this on however it goes. One thing I would point out that we see some constants in here and I think those constants, while we're all concerned about the coming months this year, looking past that at the longer term is really important. And one of the big constants that we see goes to the way that we've aligned our portfolio. We believe in just about any scenario, there's going to be a continuing priority for Unmanned capability, Cyber capability, C4ISR and this whole arena of modernization and its focus through Logistics and I see that, too, as being an important part of our portfolio for the future. So when we think about what's going on in the world, when we think about the environment that our national security customers are having to deal with, that part, I think, is a very important perspective as well. Trying to determine which exact path we're going to take to get to that longer-term just takes [ph] a little bit of a challenge, but we're going to be ready for it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Howard Rubel, Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You have pretty darn good Information Systems margins. And Wes, I know you\u2019ve worked very hard to have that portfolio, I'll call it, realigned, changed and you\u2019ve sort of solved a number of problems there. Can we -- can you say that you\u2019ve fundamentally changed it in a way that maybe your profit expectations for the business unit are higher?","Wesley G. Bush","Well, I would say that what we've done is we've changed it in a way to support the profit expectations we've put out there. If you turn the clock back a number of years ago, we had a fairly large fraction of that portfolio that was in what I would describe as more commodity services business. And today, if you look at the portfolio, and I have to give Linda Mills and her team the credit for this. They've just done an extraordinary job of managing their way through portfolio alignment here that it has a very large part of the content that is C4ISR and Cyber, and if you look at the parts of the portfolio that are more service-oriented, those typically have significant engineering content so we're bringing value-added and it's not a competition that's solely on the last penny. It really is around bringing the value of the engineering content. So those actions have given us the confidence to talk about margin rates that we put out there for this business as being the appropriate margin rates for the longer term, just given the broader character of how we've repositioned this business","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You mean -- it just seems to me that when we think about a government services business, this is really not that; it's something different and it fundamentally offers different value.","Wesley G. Bush","I agree, Howard, very much so. This does not any longer fit that model of a traditional government services business. And as you know very well, we actually spun out or sold off, I should say, the primary part of that business that we used to have, the task organization, and that was a big part of this portfolio realignment, was to take that out and put it into a different construct. So it's no longer a part of our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was interested in -- Jim and Wes, you've talked about the cost-reduction efforts you've had and how that's contributed positively to margins. Could you -- when you look forward, I mean, the margins have been very, very strong in the first 2 quarters this year, particularly in Electronics. Now as you look forward, is there -- not just necessarily the normal margins, but is there more to come in terms of ability to get margin expansion through these initiatives or is this all, I would say, managing to a point where you're expecting some weakness later and we'll see margins revert back to a lower level?","James F. Palmer","Doug, as I think about it, we clearly have gotten some benefit from the actions that we've taken over the last few years, not just last year, but over the last few years. It's really been a concentrated effort, beginning going back to 2009 when we combined what was, at that time, 6 different businesses down to the 4 businesses. And in that process, we made some really significant improvements in our basic infrastructure cost. For example, I use 2008 as a benchmark. 2011 revenues were up 1% over 2008. Square footage, on the other hand, was down 6% and the infrastructure that goes with the business, largely people-related, was down 11%. So in a continual process to think about the business, the organization that supports it, the infrastructure that's required and you get the benefits of that on your current backlog of contracts, but it's very important that you do those things because it goes to the affordability of your products and then a down -- likely down scenario on a budget affordability is a key driver on being able to compete and effectively win. So we've gotten a benefit, at the same time, we have really emphasized the management of our individual contracts, identifying risk and opportunities. And our program management organization, I think, has done a really good job over that period of time, in a better position today than they have been in the past. So it's a combination of all those factors that I think lead to the improved performance that we've seen.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And when you look forward, do you continue to see some ability to improve on the margin side?","James F. Palmer","Clearly, that's what we incentivize our people to do and so we are driving towards that. I -- you may be asking about the long-term objectives, margin rates for the businesses. I continue to believe in those, that those are long-term margin rates that are sustainable through the cycle. Clearly, we want to do better than that kind of peer-average type margin rates and we're working very hard to do that. It's interesting they -- we normally get a lot of questions around cume catch-up adjustments and having spent a lot of time with us over the last 5 or 6 quarters and many times those items relate to either contractual issues or maybe some testing issues associated with individual contracts that largely are not resolved until the contracts are fairly well complete. So -- and at that point in time, you feel comfortable in making those adjustments and recognizing them. But that having completed or largely completed, these contracts does not necessarily imply that those will be the margin rates on a go-forward basis. So I guess a long way -- winded way of saying I feel comfortable about our guidance for the year, obviously, as well as our long-term margin objectives for the company and we will clearly work to do better than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, I've got just a quick question, following up on a statement that you made earlier about the competitive positioning of Northrop relative to competitors, given your pension position. The question is, I guess, twofold. One, I know that starting on February 27 of this year, yourselves as well as some of your competitors were able to begin booking higher rates -- higher billable rates into the government. So I just want to get a sense of what type of activity you're seeing on that front from success or lack of success in being able to do that? And then the second part of the question is where do you think this is going to have the most impact as you look at your various businesses? Does it weight toward services, where you get the competitive advantage, or is it Electronic Systems? If you could just give us a sense of where you think this competitive advantage is going to have the biggest impact, I'd appreciate that.","James F. Palmer","Yes. You're referring to CAS harmonization, Jason, just to make sure everyone is up-to-date on it; and CAS harmonization actually serves to increase everyone's CAS cost, everyone in the industry's CAS cost in relation to what they had previously. So it is a factor that allows us to recover those increased costs but it does also drive to the competitive nature of the affordability of our cost. So it's great that we're able to recover those increased CAS costs, but it is an affordability negative and so we are working real hard to offset that. In terms of the competitive nature, obviously to the extent that your plans are better funded than industry as a whole, your costs are less on a go-forward basis and so that is something that, as I've said, we've worked really hard to address over the past years, either through our investment performance, which has been positive. I think our investment management organization has done a really good job in relationship to the uncertain investment environment that we've had over the last 3 or 4 years. It's certainly been a difficult environment, but they've done very well in terms of performance versus the major indices, all of which, again, go to reducing our costs on a go-forward basis. So it's a combination of all of those factors, Jason, that I think is a competitive advantage for us on a go-forward basis. Although, as I said, it's great to recover that increased CAS cost, but it does become a negative that we're working hard at try and offset.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Which business do you think it's going to have the most impact on for you?","James F. Palmer","It's really going to depend on individual plans. We talk as if this is a huge one plan, when in reality we have about 20 different plans. So it depends on the funded status of each plan, but the area that we're most focused on has been the Aerospace segment, largely because the plans that support that have historically been very well funded and for many years did not have any CAS cost at all so we're dealing with that in our Aerospace segment, largely. But it does affect some of the other segments as well, both ES and IS.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr, Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Jim, could you update us a little bit thinking about pension for next year. First, how was -- just 2 general questions. What's your investment performance year-to-date? And secondly, given that discount rates are down today from where they were at year end, and I know it only depends on where you close out the year, what sort of leverage does that have? And I know you have kind of your own indices; how should we think about the change in discount rate and what that might mean for next year's FAS cost?","James F. Palmer","Yes, so Cai, the investment performance through June is, in round numbers let's call it 5.75%. So again, the organization has done a good job relative to the indices. They always tell me I can't annualize that number so I won't do that but reasonable performance on a year-to-date basis. And as you know, I think everyone knows, interest rates are down from where they were at the beginning of the year. We're probably looking at, if we were setting interest rates today, anywhere from maybe 75 to 100 basis points of decline. And just a reminder that, that sensitivity around that change in discount rate is that every 25 basis points change in the discount rate is, let's call it, $75 million to $80 million of a change in FAS cost. So if we were setting it today, we would be looking at a decline in interest rates, let's call it, 75 to 100 basis points. And that equates at this point to, if I can do my math here real quick, $300-plus million. But again, it's kind of meaningless to talk about this at a point in time that is...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was hoping to drill down just a little bit into ES. Margin performance, of course, of the company has been great. It's been, I think, particularly strong here, though. You have the 5 business areas you've laid out within ES and I was hoping maybe, either Wes or Jim, you wouldn't mind walking through the business a little bit and telling us where the margins, relative to the segment average, are above or below in each of those 5 units. And just maybe helping us understand a little bit the complexion, the profile of the segment.","James F. Palmer","Yes, Joe, I'm not going to do that because I don't want to get into competitive -- I don't want to give out competitive information here. The performance in ES has been strong in a couple of areas, in particular, but that -- having said that, that doesn't mean that the performance in the other areas are weak, if you will, as expected, but the performance in a couple of areas had been particularly strong.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, let me rephrase -- well, I was going to say maybe what we -- what I could ask then on that, if it's been a couple of areas in particular, you must have visibility on how much of that is sustainable. So as we look forward and we think about -- and we know your long-term margin target for the segment, but how much more opportunity is there to -- for performance adjustments in those couple of areas that have been really strong?","James F. Palmer","As I said in my prepared comments, Joe, the guidance for the year for ES essentially assumes a second half margin rate in the, let's call it, 14% range consistent -- actually a little bit better than what our guidance initially was for all of the year for ES. So we have brought it up a little bit but again, the performance adjustments, as I said, in many cases, tend to be towards the end of that contract life, reflecting the resolution of contractual issues or other kind of testing or acceptance types of issues, and if they occur towards the end of a contract life, do not have much of an impact on a go-forward basis.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the implication is that you think you've kind of reached the end with the first half.","James F. Palmer","The implication is, I think, 14% margins for the second half of the year is great.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping to focus on a separate segment, Aerospace, for a minute. The segment\u2019s had great bookings over the last several quarters, really the last 4 or 5; maybe even gets a boost on bookings from the Space area in the near term. So I'm just trying to understand, it sounds like a lot of the 2012 issues were anniversary-ing some things, whether that was ICBM or the change in accounting for F-35 deliveries or lower F-18s. Are those or other areas kind of headwinds to '13 or have we anniversary-ed those, and this kind of increase in backlog that was seen is putting in a pretty good posture for actual growth in a tough environment in '13 in that unit?","James F. Palmer","Myles, we're -- for example, on F-35, we're kind of in this sine wave, where we essentially had no sales or very little sales on the current production contract, the LRIP 5 contract, but we will have sales and margins as we go forward into the second half and '13 as deliveries on that contract occur. As I look at that business, I think that, that business is reflective of the long-term margin objectives that we've seen, that I've talked about for Aerospace. Clearly, they've had some benefits on their existing backlog of contracts from the actions that they have taken to streamline the organization at AS. That's had a benefit on this year's margins to the extent that -- and it's true the Aerospace segment has longer-cycle contracts than probably most of the other business segments, so we're going to see some of that benefit continue as that existing backlog of contracts is worked off. So again, I feel good about where the Aerospace sector is in terms of their margin objectives.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I guess -- maybe I'm misusing words. I was actually looking to backlog and the bookings from a standpoint of actual orders. The backlog\u2019s risen 23% in the last 6 months and 25 in the last 12 months. And a lot of this -- and just focusing on top line, the sales headwinds you face this year, you have illustrated pretty well. So I'm just curious, I mean, '13 if I'm just looking at those 2 metrics, would seem to be pretty well positioned for top line growth and just wondering is there any pushback outside of the obvious sequestration?","James F. Palmer","Besides that, I would say no.","Wesley G. Bush","I'd say there's a good balance perspective here. Clearly, Unmanned continues to be a very, very important part of the portfolio. The manned parts of it, as Jim indicated, on F-35, we have to kind of see what the program outlook appears to be. We're going to have to watch how, even if we're not in sequestration, how some of the other budget decisions continue to get made as they affect other programs, both in Unmanned and Space side. So we're delighted with the robust growth in the backlog. I think that positions us very, very well for the future here. I just would not want to get ahead of potential budget decisions that may ripple through the process here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Wes, I have a broader question for you. As highlighted on this call, your margins are actually very strong. You've also brought down your headcount in recent years, and now the customer is paying a higher CAS rate for you. Do you think that there's the potential for political pushback as you and your peers try to avert the sequester as politicians point out that the Defense industry is actually doing quite well at the moment?","Wesley G. Bush","There's always a potential for people to misuse facts, I would say. If you look at our Defense industry, we only do well when we're performing well. And our customers have been very clear and I think we've all seen that in our contract negotiations over the last several years that we only have the contractual opportunity to do well when we perform well. And a lot of that's baked into the FAR. So when we think about our industry relative to other industries, we're not talking about extraordinary margin rates in the Defense industry. We're talking about margin rates that -- well, you can see what they are when you look across our industry compared with others. So I think if there are those who forget that connection between performance on programs and profitability, then you could say well, perhaps we're making too much somehow. But the facts are, as I've said, we only show good numbers when we actually perform well. And as Jim has been indicating in much of his discussion around our margin rates, a lot of this comes down to our ability to not only execute, but to look at things in advance and take the actions we need to be taking to manage risk on behalf of our customers. So I'm not overly concerned about that. I -- in interacting with the seniors in the Department of Defense, they are very clear across the breadth of seniors on the acquisition side and I would say on the policy side, that if we're performing, we ought to be able to make money. And clearly, if we're not performing, we ought to be penalized, and that's kind of where I see that discussion sitting today. Now clearly, when we get down to the contract terms and conditions, there's a lot of pushing back and forth on the specific terms around profitability and cash flow and many of the other terms. But all that being said, from a kind of the 50,000-foot view and a policy view, I think we're in a very reasonably place here, where that connection between contract performance and financial performance is a pretty straight connection. Jim, any other perspective?","James F. Palmer","Yes, I just want to clarify the -- Rob's CAS comment because essentially, because of the transition rules, higher CAS cost begin in 2014, not before.","Wesley G. Bush","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions there, guys. Wes, you've had some of the best bookings so far this year and you talked earlier about abetting CR into your guidance but because of that and the difference in your service business, which you highlighted earlier, are you less exposed to the CR than some of your peers?","Wesley G. Bush","We have difficulty telling the degree of exposure of all of our peers, so I'd be reluctant to make a comparative comment in that regard. Clearly, our Information Systems business, and to some extent, our Technical Services business is a higher turnover business in terms of the rate of -- at which contracts come onboard and get executed and closed out. And so that higher rate on a relative basis between those businesses and our AS and ES businesses cause us a little bit more concern as we look at the CR environment. But we've actually gotten pretty good at navigating the CR environment and I'd say most of us around our industry have been dealing with this now for a while. And our ability to plan and forecast the CR aspects of the environment, I think, is pretty good. So I'm having difficulty answering your question with regard to others in our industry, but I feel pretty good about our own outlook and forecast in that regard. The challenge, I think, here isn't so much around the management of a short-term CR. I think the challenge is how does the framework of a CR play into the concerns around sequestration, particularly as we head into the fourth quarter. And part of the struggle that we're seeing in our customer community is that the political system, as I indicated earlier, is very focused around is there an approach that avoids sequestration? Is there a broader perspective that can be taken looking together at the tax law changes or the current law coming to effect at the end of the year, the issues around the debt ceiling and everything the country went through last year and struggling to deal with the debt ceiling? Is there a mechanism where all this can be brought together or not before the end of the year? And the customer community is trying to figure out how they do the right thing to navigate through all of this, so I'm not as focused on the CR in terms of its variability as I am on the potential variability of customer actions in anticipation of a potential sequestration and...","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So at the very least, I think one of the things you're perhaps suggesting is we may see Q4 looking a lot different than Q3.","Wesley G. Bush","It's hard to tell. I wouldn't want to speculate on that. I would simply observe that there are environmental conditions that could potentially cause that to happen.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just a final question on this for both of you. For Wes, are you seeing any difference in the way the services are obligating funds these days? And then Jim, do you think that cash collections could become a problem as we get to the end of the year?","Wesley G. Bush","Let me just say on the obligations part of it, our understanding is that the guidance to contracting officers is for them to continue forward now and we see them working hard to get things under contract. Clearly, there are some areas that are under more pressure than others, from a total budget perspective, and so they're struggling with this a little bit more than others. And so I'd say it varies a little bit across the portfolio, but in general, we see our customers working hard to hold everything together here.","James F. Palmer","On the cash collection question, I think probably the best way to put it with, whether it's debt ceiling, all these different things that we potentially could be dealing with in the fourth quarter, we have really emphasized, as I said in my comments to our team, the importance of aggressively working our cash collections, billing and cash collections on a timely basis so that we can accelerate all the cash, as much as cash is possible into the earlier parts of the year than when it traditionally has occurred. Again, since there's a lot of uncertainty around exactly what's going to happen and how it's going to happen, it's hard to tell whether or not cash collections are going to be affected in the fourth quarter, but the best medicine is essentially move everything up if you can.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So it doesn't really impact your buyback plans.","James F. Palmer","No, I wouldn't think so.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","I wanted to try and get at this margin question maybe a little bit differently. You had in your release that you got a lower margin on the F-18 multi-year as it transitions. Now it could just be for the transition, but I'm assuming also that the overall realizable margin is probably less on the multi-year 3 than it was on multi-year 2. If you could go through, is there a number that you could provide in terms of how much lower the margin potential might be on some of the new contracts that you're winning versus the current ones that you have in backlog?","James F. Palmer","George, the -- you're looking at a situation where multi-year 2 at completion, you obviously know what you ended up doing. You had a multi-year contract; you have the benefit of the multi-year and taking cost-reduction actions and affordability initiatives to improve the overall performance. Multi-year 3, we\u2019re at the very front end, and so it's not unusual to have a much lower earnings rate on the very front end of a contract, particularly a multi-year contract before you've had the opportunity to implement a number of the performance improvements and affordability initiatives. So I think we're at a point in time where we're comparing something that is known to something that has been negotiated that is a good contract. But we have in front of us all those other opportunities that we can take to improve the profitability, and it's too early to call whether all of them are going to be successful.","George Shapiro","No, I recognize all that. My question really was you've seen what you did from multi-year 1 to multi-year 2, and my question really is, is the potential on multi-year 3 in that regard less? And also if I could generalize to all of your other new contracts whether the potential is less in terms of margin and what you've made or can make on the existing backlog, just to get a sense of the pressures you're feeling from -- if any, from the contracting people.","James F. Palmer","Clearly, the environment is a little bit more difficult today than it was a couple years ago and we're responding in terms of our cost affordability initiatives, and so it's hard to say whether each of those are going to balance each other out over the longer term.","Wesley G. Bush","But it really comes down to us to continue to execute on the contracts, to drive affordability just as we've been doing over the years. Each time we take on a contract, it's -- as Jim indicated, there's uncertainty as to how far we'll be able to go in performance improvement and affordability improvement over time. And what we're seeing is our team across the company working really hard on this and it shows in our results, and we're really proud of that.","George Shapiro","No, you've done a great job in showing. I'm just trying to get at how much steeper the hill may be going forward here.","Wesley G. Bush","It always looks steep when you stand at the bottom.","Operator","Our final question comes from David Strauss, UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Back to margins, I don't think you've addressed this. You've gotten about 30% to 35% of your segment profit from cume adjustments in the first half. What does the guidance assume specifically in -- by the way, in terms of cume adjustments in the second half of the year?","Wesley G. Bush","A more normal level, if you want to call it that. Actually, if you look at the quarter, the second quarter, and you compare the cume adjustments to the segment operating margin rate, it's 28% this year, 26% last year. So there really isn't that big a change in terms of the cume catch-up adjustments as a percent of the overall segment margin rate. So overall margins in the second half, in terms of my guidance, is a little lower. That's true, which essentially implies a little less of those potential favorable adjustments. But we'll go through a process every quarter of looking at our estimates at completion and making the adjustments, if necessary, up or down to reflect the actual -- what we see is actual performance and resolution of any risk and opportunities at that point in time.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then one on the revenue side. I think when you started the year, you talked about having about $700 million in contingency or cushion in your revenue guidance. Does that still exist or do you aim into that and does that specifically relate to assuming a continuing resolution in the fourth quarter?","James F. Palmer","I don't recall any conversation around $700 million of contingency. There is $700 million of variance in the range, if you will, $24.7 billion to $25.4 billion. But essentially, that range reflects the possibilities for each of the 4 sectors and where we think they may end the year.","Stephen C. Movius","This concludes our Q&A session, and I'd like to turn the call over to Wes for closing comments.","Wesley G. Bush","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me just summarize by saying we had an outstanding quarter, reflecting our continued focus on performance. We face a challenging environment and we're certainly concerned about sequestration and the broader budget environment. That said, we have a team that is focused on creating value for our shareholders, our customers and all of our stakeholders, and we are prepared to deal with this environment.","Thanks for your continuing interest in our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation.

Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially.","Matters discussed on today's call might also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in today's earning release. We will be posting updated company and sector overviews that provide supplemental information on Northrop Grumman and our four sectors. You can access our updated company overview and the sector overviews on our Investor Relations webpage.","On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We're off to a good start in 2015. Our team generated solid operating results, and I want to thank our employees for their continued focus on execution.","We generated earnings per share of $2.41 comparable to last year after adjusting for the $0.23 non-recurring tax benefit in the first quarter of 2014. These results reflect solid operational performance and the effectiveness of our cash deployment strategy. Sales rose 2% and reflect higher revenue at Aerospace, Electronic Systems and Technical Services.","During the quarter, growth on existing and new domestic programs and double-digit international sales growth more than offset declines in mature production programs like the F\/A-18. Sales for the quarter also benefited from a few more working days in this year's first quarter.","In the first quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares for $859 million. In total, we distributed nearly $1 billion to shareholders this quarter through share repurchases and dividends. As of March 31, we've repurchased 47.5 million shares or nearly 80% toward our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of this year, market conditions permitting.","Before our $500 million pension contribution, cash from operations was a use of $329 million, an improvement over last year's first quarter. After capital spending of $117 million, our pension-adjusted free cash flow was a use of $446 million. The first quarter is typically our lowest in terms of cash generation. We continue to expect healthy cash for the year, and we are maintaining our full-year guidance for cash from operations and free cash flow.","Total backlog increased to $38.4 billion, a modest increase from year-end and a 6% increase from total backlog at the end of last year's first quarter. Net new awards totaled $6.1 billion, and we had a solid 1.03 book-to-bill for the quarter. Electronic Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.17 and Technical Services had a book-to-bill of 1.90.","You'll recall that on last quarter's call, we mentioned a large international award that Technical Services booked at the beginning of the year. Electronic Systems received an award to supply our SABR radar to Taiwan, received long-lead material awards for F-35 lots 9 and 10 and won the contract to develop SEWIP Block 3, the next-generation electronic warfare upgrade for U.S. Navy surface ships.","During the quarter, Aerospace Systems received awards for E-2D and restricted space programs. And Information Systems received awards for additional restricted cyber work, and we won the recompete for the follow-on to our IDENT program in the UK. We continue to see healthy demand for our products and services, and we have a robust global opportunity set for all four of our businesses.","International opportunities for Aerospace Systems include Global Hawk and Triton for sublimations. We are underway on Global Hawk for Korea. Japan selected Global Hawk and included it in their budget. And Global Hawk made its international air show debut at the Avalon Air Show in Victoria, Australia. Japan also selected the E-2D and included it in their budget. And we are realizing international sales opportunities for F-35 and for Electronic Systems' SABR radar.","Information Systems' C4ISR and cyber capabilities and Technical Services' logistics and modernization offerings are also attractive to our international customers. We are competing for U.S. programs like long-range strike, common infrared countermeasures and long-range discrimination radar to name a few. And we are ramping up on production programs like the F-35 and E-2D.","In unmanned, we continue to expand autonomous technology with our X-47B unmanned combat air system. In addition to being the only unmanned vehicle to autonomously perform aircraft carrier takeoffs and landings, last week, the U.S. Navy successfully demonstrated fully autonomous aerial refueling with the X-47B, marking the first time an unmanned aircraft has refueled in-flight.","In combination these achievements are a major step forward in unmanned autonomy with potential for both manned and unmanned aircraft applications. Autonomous launch, recovery and refueling have the potential for reducing operational costs in the future. We're proud to have again made aeronautic history and we congratulate the X-47B on another major accomplishment.","The fiscal year 2016 budget process is underway in Congress, and we're pleased that there is a growing recognition of the need to support national to support national security in the budget. At the same time, we are concerned about the long term implications of the discretionary budget constraints imposed by the Budget Control Act. We continue to support the perspective put forward by the Administration that a return to the sequester levels and certainly the sequester mechanism would have a negative impact on our country.","Congress is now negotiating a joint budget resolution. But we remain cautious on the budget process and customer spending later in the year. If a budget isn't passed, we expect we will begin fiscal year 2016 with a continuing resolution and sequestration may be triggered again next January.","Based on first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance to a range of $9.40 to $9.60 from our prior range of $9.20 to $9.50. We are maintaining our sales guidance of $23.4 billion to $23.8 billion and our outlook for cash from operations and free cash flow is unchanged.","So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Wes. I also want to thank the team for a job well done. It was a solid quarter. Sales were higher, due in part to four additional working days in this year's first quarter. We generated strong segment operating income, awards totaled $6.1 billion and cash used during the first quarter was consistent with our historical pattern, although slightly better than last year.","Turning to sector results. Aerospace Systems sales rose 3%, driven by double digit growth for unmanned programs and high-single digit growth in the space business. Volume was higher across a number of unmanned programs including NATO AGS and Global Hawk. Activity is ramping up on Global Hawk for Korea and Lot 11 for the U.S. Air Force.","Growth in our space business reflects higher activity for restricted programs. These increases were partially offset by lower manned military aircraft sales, primarily due to fewer F\/A-18 deliveries as that program continues to ramp down.","Aerospace operating income and margin rate were strong relative to guidance for the year. First quarter operating margin rate of 12.6% reflects the timing of performance adjustments across our portfolio. For the year we expect AS will have a margin rate in the high 11% range on revenue of $9.8 billion to $10 billion, no change from prior guidance.","Electronic Systems' first quarter sales increased 2%. The increase was driven by higher volume for space sensors, marine systems and tactical sensors, partially offset by declining volume for combat avionics. ES' operating income and margin rate reflect the changing business mix, which includes lower volume on mature fixed-price production programs like combat avionics. And higher volume for cost type development programs. As our portfolio evolves, we expect to continue to generate a strong, but somewhat lower margin than we've seen over the past few years. For the year we expect ES sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion with an operating margin rate in the low- to mid-15% range, no change from prior guidance.","Information Systems' first quarter sales were comparable to last year's first quarter and include higher volume for programs in ISR, integrated air and missile defense, communications and cyber. These increases were offset by lower volume for C2 and civil programs, including impacts from in-theatre troop drawdowns and lower volume on the CANES program.","IS first quarter operating income rose 2% and operating margin increased to 10.5%. The quarter-over-quarter improvement is primarily due to improved performance resulting from risk retirements associated with program completions.","Information Systems is off to a good start for the year, but as we look at the rest of the year, our guidance does contemplate some continued U.S. Defense budget risk. We expect short cycle customer spending may be cautious in the second half of the year due to budget uncertainty, particularly if we are operating under another continuing resolution in the fourth quarter. For the year, we expect sales of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion with a margin rate in the mid- to high-9% range, no change from prior guidance.","Moving to Technical Services, higher international and intercompany sales generated a 10% sales increase in the quarter. Higher international volume reflects the Ministry of National Guard Training Support award received at the beginning of the year as well as a full quarter of revenue from our IDS acquisition in Australia.","Operating income for the quarter was unchanged. The lower margin rate reflects the fact that last year's first quarter included higher income from an unconsolidated joint venture. Excluding that item, operating margin rate was consistent with last year.","For TS, we expect sales of $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion with a margin rate of approximately 9%, again, no change from prior guidance. The 2015 outlook for TS reflects lower volume for the ICBM, CNTPO and other logistics and modernization programs, which will be partially offset by growth in international.","On a consolidated basis, first quarter segment operating margin rate was 12.3% which includes a higher level of research and development spending, which you'll see reflected in our G&A expense for the quarter. We take a total cost structure approach to our business, and we are managing this cost within our existing rate structure. This quarter's results support our guidance of a segment margin rate of approximately 12% for this year.","Our total operating margin rate declines to 13.1% and reflects lower segments operating income, lower net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment and higher unallocated corporate expense. This quarter's net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment is higher than the guidance we provided on our fourth quarter call, primarily due to the $500 million discretionary pension contribution we made in the quarter which reduces FAS expense for the year.","Our updated estimate for net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment is $320 million versus our prior guidance of $290 million. You will recall that in early February we issued $600 million, 3.85%, 30 year notes. The proceeds of which were used to fund that contribution.","The contribution generated a non-recurring increase to state deferred tax expense on our pension liability which is the primary driver of the quarter's higher unallocated corporate expense. One final note on pension, as is our standard practice, we will finalize our demographic survey in the third quarter and those results may impact that $320 million net FAS\/CAS estimate.","A quick note on taxes. Our first quarter effective tax rate increased to 31.3% from 26.3%. Last year year's first quarter rate included a benefit related to the partial resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2009 tax returns. I would also note that the first quarter tax rate was considered in our 32.5% tax rate guidance for the year.","Looking at our EPS guidance for the year, we expect EPS between $9.40 and $9.60. The higher range reflects first quarter performance, the lower FAS expense resulting from the pension contribution, as well as our expectation that our weighted average share count would have climbed by about 9% versus prior guidance of an 8% decrease.","Turning to cash, cash from operations was a use of $329 million in the quarter before the after-tax impact of the voluntary pension contribution. Cash used during the quarter was principally driven by changes in trade working capital. This is typically the case during the first quarter of the year, and we are seeing the same trend this year. Free cash flow before pension pre-funding was a use of $446 million, slightly better than last year despite an increase in capital expenditures to $117 million in the quarter.","We continue to expect cash from operations of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion before the impact of the after-tax pension pre-funding. This also results in free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $2 billion after expected capital spending of $700 million for the year, no change from prior guidance.","In conclusion, it was a solid quarter and a very good start to the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, I would again ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question, and if you have any more questions, to get back in the queue. So, Kaitlin, can you open it up?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. It's actually Jon Raviv, on for Jason.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jon.","Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Wes, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the growth outlook. Obviously, this quarter seemed to be \u2013 had some nice upside here. How do you think it trends going forward, what surprised this quarter and where could you see things going over the course of the year and into next?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we maintained our sales guidance for the year, I would say almost despite all the ups and downs that we see out there. I would say that this is a period of time where we do see a nice set of opportunities for our company, both domestically and internationally. I mentioned some of those in my prepared remarks.","But when I think about what we're seeing \u2013 let me start with international, around the globe on unmanned infrastructure, our unmanned systems as well as our manned systems and more broadly, I would say, interest in the C4ISR capabilities that our company has to offer, I do see a nice continuingly positive trajectory for our international activities.","As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I also see some really good domestic opportunities, long-range strike. I mentioned the Kirkham program at ES is also a really interesting program for us as is LRDR. So, we have our guidance out there for the year. We obviously are addressing a lot of opportunities.","But on the domestic front, I would also caution and I've mentioned this in my remarks as well, continue to caution about the budget environment. We need to work our way through this, see where we really end up as a country with respect to how we're going to be investing in defense and security on a go-forward basis.","While I've been pleased that there is a growing recognition of the importance to appropriately fund defense and security, I am concerned about the budget process. And I think it's going to be a bit more time this year before we have any clarity as to how that's going to resolve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Morning \u2013 actually, afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You went through kind of a laundry list of opportunity set, but you didn't mention T-X, and I think you guys are kind of \u2013 got a horse in that race \u2013 it sounds like it's a home-grown horse. Could you talk about that opportunity? And then just a clarification, in terms of mix between fixed pricing\/cost plus at the company level, the last couple of years, you've been running with a pretty favorable mix, 47% versus kind of used to be 40% fixed price. Are we trending back towards the kind of 40% fixed price over the next few years?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Well, let me hit both of those. On T-X, yes, that is a very important opportunity for us. Timing on that one is out a little bit relative to some of the others that I mentioned. But we believe we're going to have a very competitive opportunity on T-X. We see the development of the requirements that the Air Force has been going through to be very positive relative to the nature of the offering that we're putting forward. We're developing some really good partnering approaches in the program. So, it is an important opportunity for us.","And we're certainly going to be very focused on this. With respect to the mix equation, as I've said before \u2013 and we saw some of this already in ES this quarter. We are delighted to be winning new program opportunities on our company. And we know, we all know that when we win these new opportunities, they start out cost plus. And that inevitably pushes that mix equation, Myles, that you're asking about back in the direction that it can have some near-term impacts on our margin rates. We're seeing that right now at ES.","But this is exactly what we want to have happen. We want to be successful in capturing these new opportunities. And as we all know, over time those turn into production and that's clearly the longer-term margin opportunity.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Wes, maybe I'll just add that we've seen a pretty tight band in terms of our mix of fixed price and cost plus for the last few years. It is down a couple of percentage points this quarter and as Wes mentioned, particularly at Electronic Systems as we see some development opportunities there. But we do have a number of programs where production is ramping up, so it could be that we see that start to come back in the next or I'd say in the not too distant future. As we look at F-35 ramping, we look at E-2D and then...","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Mostly our international programs, our production oriented programs.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Right. And as Triton moves out of development into production in the near future as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Rich.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Wes, I guess, I just wanted to ask you about your remarks at the beginning of the call on \u2013 and your outlook recently for defense spending. I'm sure you're aware several of your peers are talking about FY 2016 spending coming in maybe above the spending caps. Some talked about like some type of another Murray-Ryan deal or something, some such.","If we did assume that spending did come in above the caps, just based on what you get, do you think this is going to impact the short cycle under your business or long cycle business? Do you get any sense of where the government priorities will be if there is incremental spending above the caps?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Rich. I appreciate the question. Let me first address the if we assume part. I want to be very careful about that because we have \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, we have a long way to go from here to there in terms of getting a real budget outcome that is above the BCA levels. I have optimism in that we are hearing more of the \u2013 what I think is the right kind of discussion about the need to relieve the BCA caps quite frankly, both defense and non-defense, to make sure we are not under-investing in our country either from a security perspective, a social perspective or a long-term economic development perspective. But we've got to get there. And I want to be careful about sounding too optimistic about that given the amount of time we still have in front of us to sort this out.","But your question had an assumption behind it. If we assume that we end up slightly above the caps. I do think it will help the short-cycle business, as you mentioned, and that there is a fair amount of pent-up need for the capabilities that the shorter cycle businesses provide. And as you know, they took a harder hit in the downturn of spending. And consequently \u2013 historically anyway, they tend to more quickly show some recovery.","But this is an interesting period of time, as well. The sequester and these BCA caps that we've been operating under have also impacted the nation's ability to actually go and do what we've been needing to do for a long time which is to fix the aging force structure that we have. We are at a point in time where our Air Force is the oldest it's ever been in terms of the age of the aircraft that are in the Air Force. And you can make similar comments for the Navy and for the Army as well.","So, there is also a very large pent-up demand for actually buying new things, new capability, whether it's aircraft or ships or whatever it is, because we have been squeezing every ounce we can get out of these old systems. And so, that, I think, is also weighs heavily in the minds of those who are setting spending priorities in the Pentagon that we've got to fix this problem too. And I think it just reinforces the need for Congress to get on with it to address this unnaturally low position relative to a percentage of GDP that we're in in our discretionary spending in our country. So, I actually think getting relief can help both the short cycle and the longer cycle business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Rob.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Wes. I don't know how much you can answer on this regarding LRS, but there has been some suggestions that whoever wins this, there could be some industry consolidation that occurs subsequently. What's your view on that?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I wouldn't even begin to speculate on things like consolidation or how other parties might react to particular outcomes. I would only say with respect to LRS, clearly it's an important program for our country. And consequently, all of those in our industry with the capability to support it are stepping forward to put on the table our very best. We feel good about our heritage in that regard. The B-2 program provides a great capacity within our organization to have a great currency of knowledge and understanding about what's really needed here.","And we're doing that. We're working hard to provide the Air Force our very best offering on this. And we'll see with the outcome what it means for how different parties think about it. But I would also caution, LRS is \u2013 from our perspective, it's a really great program, it would be a wonderful opportunity. But it would just be one more part of a very diversified portfolio that we have in our corporation. And that, actually, is something I like very much about our portfolio; the breadth of capability that we have and the breadth of our programs. No single program is out there driving us in a direction. I think that our biggest today is 5% or 6%. So, I think that's also a healthy place for us to be for the long term.","So, we would eagerly embrace the opportunity to go and execute on LRS for our nation should we be awarded that contract, but I would be careful about making prognostications that that alone has a reshaping impact on the industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the question.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","So, you're going to hit your $60 million share repo target by this year as you laid out. And sort of help us think about how we should think about modeling that going forward. You've been taking on about 9% of your shares over the last couple of years \u2013 I think this year and last year I should say. And the year before it was 8%. How are you going to manage that going forward? Is it going to be maybe to that percentage of share count level or is it going to be on a percentage of free cash flow? How should we think about modeling that when this particular authorization runs out? Thank you.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hunter, let me start off on that one. We do plan to finish our 60 million share repurchase that we announced a few years back now. We are looking, market conditions permitting, to finish that out this year. I will say that we have not made a decision on what we're going to do after that. We've got some upcoming board meetings and that will be something that we discuss with the board on what the future capital deployment looks like.","But I will say that we've been repurchasers of our stock since 2003. Since that year we've repurchased I think about 48%, 47% to 48% of our outstanding shares. Can we continue to return capital to our shareholders at the same rate that we have been this quarter and last year? Probably not sustainable over the long term but you can think of us as a company that does return excess cash to shareholders.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll just add a perspective as well. When we think about this, we do take the long-term view of the company. And we take a look at our ability to generate cash and how we best deploy that cash. And we take a very positive view of that. We see ourselves as an enterprise that should be able to generate healthy cash flows as we look into the future. And to Ken's point, if you look at our history, we have been a very proactive returner, if you will, of cash to our shareholders, both in the forms of share repurchase and dividends.","So, I think you should think about us in terms of our history. We are a company that tends to continue to act in the way that we have been acting. And I think that's probably the best way of thinking about our future here. And we'll have to figure out the exact rate, as Ken pointed out, as we go forward.","But if I turn the clock back to 2013, that was sort of an interesting opportunity for our company. We saw a place in the market where we could go and access the debt market and take advantage of that for our shareholders. And that's what we've been doing. So, that type of thinking on how we look at our overall capital structure and our use of cash proceeds, I think characterizes the nature of the decision-making that we have at the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. On Aerospace, you said that the margins were down 80 basis points, and that was due to the less favorable performance. Could you talk about, is this a single-quarter issue or is there a mix change at all here? What's driving your margins and how do you see those playing out over the course of the year?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Doug, I would say that as we look at our performance in the first quarter of 2015 at AS, it was what I would characterize as strong performance for the AS sector, simply stacked up against a quarter in 2014 that was particularly strong. And we continue to think that our margin rate targets for the year at AS, the segment margin rate in the high 11%s continues to be appropriate. I think this is a good solid start to the year at 12.3% \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 12.6% in this quarter at AS. So, we're off to a solid start. As you compare it to 2014, it doesn't compare as favorably as we started off the year, really, really strong last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, Wes, and welcome, Ken.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I will stick to the one-question rule, but I want to have a part A and a part B, and it's with respect to the programmatic commentary you had in the release. And your comments on space and the double-digit growth there, I wonder if you might give us some color with respect to that double-digit rate restricted versus unrestricted, what was \u2013 were they both up? And restricted was just up more than the average or were they directionally different? And then secondly, in ES, I wondered if you might give us some color on if there were any specific programs that the combat avionics declines were related to? Thank you.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Carter, just to clarify, at Aerospace, the double-digit increase was at unmanned systems and the largest driver in that, as we mentioned, was NATO and Triton. But the space business, again, it's a healthy business. It's growing in the single-digit range in the quarter, largely driven by restricted. I believe that as we look at the space business, that clearly was the driver for the quarter. In terms of ES, I wouldn't want to get into specifics on a product line basis, but the lower volume at ES is in combat avionics, and I probably wouldn't want to dig any deeper than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","How are you doing Noah?","Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Doing well. How are you, Wes?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Clarification on the share count guidance, the 60 million is net of share creep, correct? And is that off of 241 million that you ended in the first quarter of 2013 with? I think the release back then said 235 million. I guess another way of (33:15) fourth quarter of 2015?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. No. I would say that the 60 million share is a target repurchase number. As far as creep, I think we try to manage that pretty carefully. But the 60 million does not reflect offsetting creep, but we certainly take a look at that and manage that carefully. Essentially, if you think about it in round numbers, we were around 240 million shares at the time we announced it. We said we were going to reduce it 60 million or we were going to repurchase 60 million of shares, which was about 25% of the then outstanding shares.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much, Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Howard.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","How are you?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good. How are you doing?","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Great. The change that you are making seems to be a little bit more of an emphasis on internal development and taking advantage of opportunity. And just as a preface, it seems that if you're managing the business such that there's an incremental to R&D and you're finding offsets, some of that could come about through use of IRAD to pick up might be the difference between a bid and an expected award that you end up receiving. So, I know it's a little bit of a lengthy question, but how do you think about making sure you're tracking this incremental risk? And who do you sort of make sure brings you bad news if, in fact, you do find there is some?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Howard, it's a great question, and I very much appreciate you asking it because it is \u2013 I think it's indicative of the thinking that we all have to go through as we go through these cyclical processes in our industry. And to the extent that we see meaningful opportunities in front of us \u2013 and indeed we do \u2013 it is incumbent on us to take the actions to invest, to ensure that we can approach those effectively. We have that responsibility both to our shareholders and to our customers, to make sure that we are making the prudent investments. And we want to be very disciplined in how we make those investments, but the prudent investments to position us well to both capture and, of course, to execute on what we see in front of us.","And I'll go back to some of the announcements we made last year and even a little bit earlier with respect to the investments that we've been making in our centers of excellence. We see those as fundamental investments for our long term to really get much of the promised benefit out of the acquisition of the various companies that we did over the years to really consolidate our footprint down, to co-locate our specialists who are working on these different opportunities, and to get the synergy that comes from having them really working these things together, and it takes money to do that. And those are investments that we've been making.","With respect to managing the risk on these, we have a multi-faceted approach to doing that. First and foremost, we work hard to create a culture in our company where everyone feels not only the opportunity to put their hand up if they see a risk that we haven't been addressing aggressively. They also feel the responsibility to put their hand up. And so, we have a culture inside the company that is quite transparent in terms of folks at all levels focusing on risk management and also making sure that we are thinking as broadly as we can about both the risk and opportunity side of all of the things that we're taking on.","So, in addition to the culture, we also have a very disciplined approach to doing risk management in the enterprise that encompasses management at all levels, making those risk assessments and communicating them forward. And our operating rhythm in the company is essentially based on reviewing both the risk and opportunity framework that we see across each and every one of our businesses.","So, it's a baked in part of how we do business and to your question of who do I rely on, I rely on our team, our whole team. It is a core part of the way that we think about running the business, managing the risks. And I would point out because sometimes I am concerned that when I talk so much about risk management people, will hear in there risk aversion. It is not risk aversion. It's risk management. We know that to generate great returns, we've got to take prudent risks but we also know that we have to manage them appropriately. So, it is a key part of how we run our company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So, you mentioned that there were four additional workdays in the quarter. Could you give us some numbers in terms of how many workdays you have, each of these four quarters than last year? And in a rough sense, sometimes when you have more working days, you don't necessarily have more shipments. A rough estimate of how much that added year-over-year to your revenues. Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks for the question, Cai. I would say that in terms of the additional workdays this year over last year's first quarter, we did have four additional workdays. Essentially 66 days versus 62 days. I would point out that we will have 365 days in the year and we'll give up those four workdays on the backend in the fourth quarter.","In terms of identifying the amount of sales that came from those four additional workdays, we don't have a system that calculates revenues on a daily basis. I would say that probably had a larger impact on IS and TS as they are more labor-driven, but certainly could have had an impact on AS and ES if certain material receipts came in. But likely higher impacts on the IS and TS business. Again, we don't look at revenues on a daily basis, so I can't give you a precise number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Sam.","Sam J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I hope you don't mind me asking a two-part question about capital allocation because the first one just \u2013 in terms of your decision about whether you continue beyond the 60 million shares, is it dependent on what happens with the outcome of the CR sequester or is it independent?","And secondly, I didn't know if you could comment about the cyber business. Just that there's been a couple of transactions like Websense and Fidelis. And just thinking about \u2013 is it the type of thing you would have looked at and been interested in but not at those prices? Just anything you can share about that.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sam, let me touch on each of these and I'll ask Ken to provide any other commentary that he may have on it. With respect to our future outlook on share repurchases, clearly, budget has an impact on the overall financial state of the company. A difference between the actual budget levels isn't going to necessarily suggest that we turn off all of our ability to return cash to shareholders. It's more a matter of degree. And as I said earlier, we really do look at our approach to share repurchase over a long period of time, and we take a look at our future cash flow projections and see where that puts us and how we think we can best deploy that.","With respect to the cyber business, we always are looking at the full set of opportunities. We have, for some time and I see us continuing to do this, been very focused on ensuring that we are first and foremost supporting our U.S. government and, to a lesser extent, some of our international customer governments in cyber.","So, that focus of ours that it tends to be on the high end of the cyber capabilities does not lead us down the path typically of looking at some of the properties that have come on to the marketplace that tend to have a little bit more robust component towards the commercial sector.","So, I think this is really about portfolio philosophy and where we are focused, and we like our focus on the government side of it. We believe that that is helping us to continue to stay at the forefront of this technology.","And as I've said over \u2013 actually over the years in this regard, where we find something that appears to have real commercial applicability, our first instinct is to go look to find the right partner, to use whatever capability we have in an approach that has a real channel to market and is operating within a company that's focused on commercial channels to market. We're a company that's focused on serving our government customers both here in the U.S. and around the globe.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Wes I'll just add on the corporate allocation, I think I would simply say we haven't made a decision on what is beyond the 60 million. I certainly wouldn't want to get ahead of the board, but we do expect to be long-term generators of strong cash flows.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","How are you?","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Well, good. Good. Wes, you've obviously been very aggressive about taking floor space out, taking head count down during the downturn. Potentially looking forward, as we get to a point where potentially the budgets start to grow again and potentially, with some of these programs coming through to you, how do you think about floor space, head count as we go forward? I know you're spending heavily on CapEx centers of excellence, but just more broadly kind of how are you thinking about that? Thanks.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, David, on the floor space part of it, I would say that what we were able to do over these last few years was to actually not only reduce floor space but drive efficiency. We've taken a very careful look at how we are populating the floor space we've had in the company and have used the current environment as really the opportunity to take a set of actions that, in hindsight, perhaps we should have taken years ago. But we took those actions to get us into a place where we are more efficiently utilizing the floor space that we have today.","As we look at new program opportunities, we will have to look at how we increment, where appropriate or, even in many cases, even better utilize the floor space that we have. So, for every one of these new opportunities, we actually have a strategy that goes with the ability to use the floor space we have as well as, oftentimes, nearby or adjacent floor space. But what I think is nice is when we're looking at those strategies today, we're looking at them through the optic of the efficiencies that we're operating with today versus where we were some years ago.","On head count, this is, I would say, oftentimes, the most challenging part of any activity that we take on in the company. The head count that \u2013 the employees that we hope to find, the new employees that we got to find in this space, are traditionally some of the most talented individuals in our country and now as we're becoming more international, some of those talented folks in each of the countries where we operate. So, we have to have a continued focus on making sure that we are bringing that talent in and retaining that talent.","I will note that even though over the last four years or five years now, our total head count is down about 20%, because of the demographics in our company and in our industry, we've actually been hiring and hiring aggressively through this downturn. In fact, last year we hired just about 5,000 people in our company.","So, our hiring machine is running and running well. And as we go forward, we're going to want to make sure that we are continuing to focus on bringing in the very best talent and keeping that talent. So, we've been giving a lot of thought to where this takes us over the next few years. But I think more importantly, we actually have systems operating within the company which I have confidence in producing the results we're going to need as we take on some new opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yeah. My question is in the Q, you talk about unfavorable adjustments that's almost like double what they were last year. Is that one or two specific programs or just spread around or if you could just provide some more color on it?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hey, George. Thanks for the question. I would say that the unfavorable adjustments in the quarter are spread across a number of programs with no adjustment being significant. If there were a material adjustment in the quarter, we would disclose what that adjustment was and be discussing with you. So, no major issues, just we're continuing to work through the contracting process.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Pete.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hello.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, Ken, previously you guys gave a FAS forecast for 2016 and 2017. I'm wondering if the decrease in FAS for this year on the contribution, does that apply \u2013 can we extrapolate that to 2016 and 2017 as well or is the math not quite that linear?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","The FAS expense benefit that we received this year generally would apply, going forward, in 2016 and 2017. But it depends on a number of other factors including our investment performance for this year, including the discount rate at the end of the year. So, I don't know that it would be fair to take that benefit; essentially we had guided $290 million, now, $320 million. So a $30 million benefit this year, for nine months of the year after we made the contribution. I don't know that it would be fair to take that and simply carry it forward given the multiple assumptions that impact the analysis.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe DeNardi with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joe W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Joe.","Joe W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Wes, I'm wondering if you could just provide us an update on F-35 and kind of where you stand, how performance has been recently. I think you said last quarter that margins were below the corporate average. I mean, what's the trajectory on that program? Is it volume that really is what you need to drive margins higher?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Joe, yes. F-35 continues to go well. We are delighted to see, finally, that we are beginning to come up the production ramp because, ultimately, at the end of the day, coming up the production ramp is what brings the cost down, makes the aircraft more affordable, and enables all of our partners around the globe to actually acquire the quantity that they need for the F-35 to become the cornerstone of their force structure as they envision it to be.","As the production ramps up, it is our expectation that the F-35 margins should have the opportunity to improve over time. To your point, yes, they are typically below our average margins on the program, in part because of the place we've been in now for a number of years, of relatively low rate production, and quite frankly, contracting that matches that lower rate of production. But as we move on into real rate, we would expect that that rate and the approach to contracting it should enable us to have margins that are more traditional in terms of production rate margins.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. It's Jon Raviv, again. Thanks so much for allowing the follow-up.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Jon.","Jonathan Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just a question on CapEx. You ran \u2013 you underran the first quarter versus $700 million, I suppose, we generally see things ramp up towards the end of the year. So, if you could confirm that as being the case again this year. And then, just kind of looking out farther, should we see some (50:50) $700 million stick around, what do you think is normalized, is it all depending on what you win or you don't win over the next few months and maybe a couple of years, any further color on CapEx would be much appreciated.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi there, Jon. Thanks for the question. If I can just talk about the Q1 number, I will say that if you look at our CapEx timing during the year, we do tend to start off a little bit slower as budgets are released. And I will say that last year, as an example, I believe in the first quarter we spent $60 million in CapEx towards a full year number of $560 million. This year, we started out Q1 at $117 million towards what we think is going to be $700 million. So, I think we're still comfortable with our $700 million target for the year.","In terms of beyond 2015, I'll tell you that we don't give guidance beyond that point. We have talked about the fact that it will stay \u2013 capital is likely to stay elevated from where it was historically for a few more years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dihora with Morningside (sic) [Morningstar] (52:02).","Neal Dihora - Morningstar Research","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on that F-35 thought process. I think you guys have given out sort of higher than 11% F-stream long-term Aerospace margins, and I'm just wondering if at what point in the production process of the F-35 would it actually be higher or lower. So, is that 11% inclusive of F-35 production or was it before that timing got sort of laid out there? Thanks.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Neal let me just be clear. The 11% is a long-term benchmark that we talk about that is reflective of how we see industry performing over a long cycle in the Aerospace sector, just as we've given benchmarks for our other sectors. Our team is performing above that benchmark and is incentivized to perform above that benchmark. So, you can see in the quarter, for example, we're performing better than the 11%, the 12.6% that we reported in this quarter is an example of that.","The point that we've been making on the F-35 and because we have F-35 in each of three of our sectors, Aerospace, Electronics and Information Systems. When we look at that in the aggregate and compare it to our aggregate margin rate, that's where we see that offset. So, it isn't so much a sector by sector view. It is more of an aggregate view that the F-35 program isn't quite yet carrying its weight relative to delivering the margins that we have across the company.","So, when will we get there? Hard to call. As I said, we are delighted to see the ramp up in the production as we go forward into LRS 9 and 10, but we really need to get to I think probably the place where we're really more routinely operating at this what we would envision to be full rate production before we are able to see the types of margins that we have historically seen in aircraft production programs.","Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Kaitlin, I think we'll do one more question.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for the follow-up guys. I'm not sure if you said it and I missed it but I wondered if you could comment on what international growth was in the quarter and then I don't know if you disclosed it but what restricted sales were in the quarter year-over-year. Thank you.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Corporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Carter, thanks for the question. I don't believe that we generally discuss restricted sales on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And in terms of international I think what I'd be comfortable saying is that we believe full year sales for international are going to be around 15% of our total sales and we're not discussing the quarter-by-quarter impact of that. But we continue to believe 15% of our total sales that we've guided in the range of \u2013 for the year, the $23.4 billion to $23.8 billion is about where we see 2015 international.","Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. This concludes our Q&A. So, Wes, final comments?","Wesley G.

I would also note that after the call, we will be posting an updated company overview to our Investor Relations homepage.","On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It was a very productive quarter, and I'd like to extend my appreciation to our entire team. We continue to generate strong financial results, higher total sales, higher operating income in all three of our sectors, strong EPS growth, and strong cash generation, while taking strategic actions to further strengthen and enhance Northrop Grumman's long-term profitable growth vector.","I'll first provide an update on strategic actions and then discuss our third quarter financial results and 2017 financial guidance. On September 18, we announced our agreement to acquire Orbital ATK for $134.50 in cash per share, approximately $7.8 billion in cash plus assumed debt of about $1.4 billion. On October 13, the company issued $8.25 billion of unsecured senior notes to finance the acquisition and pay related fees and expenses. This combination represents a compelling value creation opportunity for the customers, shareholders, and employees of both companies.","We fully expect our complementary portfolios of leading technologies, along with our aligned and innovation-focused cultures to yield significant value creation through revenue, cost, and operational synergies. We believe all of our stakeholders will benefit from expanded capabilities, accelerated innovation, and greater competition in the critical global security domains of space, missiles, and missile defense. In addition to these compelling strategic benefits, we expect Orbital ATK will be accretive to our earnings per share and free cash flow per share no later than the first full year after acquisition.","I want to provide brief updates on our efforts with Orbital ATK to meet the closing conditions. First, we understand Orbital ATK is scheduled to conduct its shareholder meeting on November 29. Second, the acquisition of Orbital ATK is subject to regulatory approval by authorities in the U.S. and in the EU.","The FTC is reviewing the proposed transaction in the U.S. in consultation with the DoD, and the European Commission is reviewing it in Europe. We expect the transaction to receive thorough reviews, and we are engaged with the agencies in an effort to facilitate those reviews. We continue to expect the acquisition to close in the first half of 2018.","We also announced several leadership transitions that will be effective at the first of the year. Gloria Flach, our Chief Operating Officer, and Sid Ashworth, Corporate Vice President Government Relations are retiring at the end of the year. Gloria and Sid have made tremendous contributions to our company and to our nation, and I want to thank them for their leadership in our company.","Kathy Warden will assume the role of President and Chief Operating Officer at the beginning of the year. Kathy has led Mission Systems since 2015 and prior to that she led our former information system sector. Our sectors will report to Kathy and she will also be responsible for the integration of Orbital ATK when that transaction closes.","As we've previously announced, we plan to initially operate Orbital ATK as a fourth sector to ensure a strong focus on program performance and operational stability. With Kathy assuming her new role, Mark Caylor will be the new President of Mission Systems. Mark has successfully led our Enterprise Services, corporate strategy and M&A functions, and previously served as our Corporate Treasurer. Shawn Purvis our current Chief Information Officer will lead our Enterprise Services team and Lesley Kalan will head our Government Relations team. All of these transitions will be in place at the beginning of the year and we'll ensure we continue to have a strong operating environment through the duration of the Orbital ATK integration process and into the future.","As I indicated earlier, we had another strong quarter in terms of financial performance. Sales rose to $6.5 billion, a 6% increase resulting from higher sales at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. Year-to-date total sales are also up 6% and based on these results, we now expect 2017 sales to increase to approximately $25.5 billion. Higher sales drove a 4% increase in third quarter segment operating income and 3% growth year-to-date. We continue to expect a mid-11% segment operating margin rate for the full year. Total operating margin dollars increased for both the quarter and the year. Operating margin rate was 12.9% for the quarter and 13.2% year-to-date.","We continue to demonstrate that we can grow operating income through a combination of sales growth and performance as we execute on a portfolio of important new development programs, as well as ongoing production programs. We generated strong earnings per share growth for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Earnings per share rose approximately 10% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date. Based on those results, we now expect 2017 diluted earnings per share of $12.90 to $13.10.","Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong for the quarter and support our guidance for the year. Capital spending reflects our continued investment in support of long-term profitable growth and affordability for our customers. Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in the business, managing the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.","The Orbital ATK acquisition and our robust capital expenditures represent substantial investments for long-term profitable growth. During the third quarter, we paused our share repurchases as we were considering the Orbital ATK acquisition. Year-to-date, we've spent $393 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares. $2.3 billion remains on our current share repurchase authorization. Returning cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases remains a priority for our company.","Ken will address the operating performance of the sectors. But I wanted to touch on several of the business capture efforts with significant activities during the quarter. The Air Force chose Northrop Grumman as one of two teams down selected for technology maturation and risk reduction contracts for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent.","We received a $328 million contract to perform work in advance of full-scale development on the nation's next-generation ICBM system.","Northrop Grumman has played a critical role in the U.S. Air Force's intercontinental ballistic missile system since its inception. As a trusted partner and technical integrator, we've mastered the complexities of its flight, launch, and command and control systems. We're very pleased with this win, and we look forward to the opportunity to provide the nation with a modern strategic deterrent system that is secure, resilient and affordable.","With respect to other new platform opportunities, I know that many of you may have questions regarding the Joint STARS Recapitalization and the MQ-25 programs. We have notified the Navy that Northrop Grumman will not be submitting a bid on the MQ-25 program. Our assessment of the final RFP, which required a fixed price incentive bid for this development work, was that we could not put forward an attractive offering to the Navy that would represent a reasonable business proposition for our company.","We continue to work with the Navy on a variety of important autonomous systems programs, and we look forward to addressing future opportunities to support the Navy in this regard.","We have submitted a bid for the Joint STARS Recap program as prime, and our Mission Systems sector has submitted proposals for its radar to all the primes competing on this program. With respect to our bid as a prime, we feel that we, together with our partners, General Dynamics and L3, have put forward a compelling offer.","We understand that the U.S. Air Force is conducting an assessment of whether to proceed with this program. We presently do not have any information regarding their evaluations, and we stand ready to support the Air Force as needed going forward on this important mission.","I'll close my remarks by noting that we are still operating under a continuing resolution that expires on December 8, with fewer than 30 days remaining in the current congressional session.","As our customers address a variety of national security issues, the readiness of our forces, the aging of our strategic deterrent, the increased vulnerability of our space assets, to name just a few, it's critical that funding to fulfill our national security missions is adequate, timely, and predictable.","In summary, it was a very productive quarter in which we continued to generate strong financial results while taking strategic actions to enhance Northrop Grumman's long-term profitable growth and value creation for all our stakeholders.","So, now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for a strong third quarter and year-to-date results. My comments will cover our financial results, updates to our 2017 guidance, and I'll also provide some color on our recent debt offering.","Starting with the quarter results, our strong operating performance combined with a lower share count generated another strong quarter of EPS growth. Positive earnings trends continued in the third quarter. Sales were higher at two of our three sectors, and all three sectors had higher operating income and solid margin rates.","Moving to sector results and guidance. Aerospace System sales were up 11% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. Manned Aircraft was again the primary growth driver for both periods as we ramp up on restricted activities. Higher F\/A-18 and F-35 deliveries contributed as well. Autonomous Systems and Space also had higher revenue for both periods.","Growth in restricted space activities is more than offsetting lower volume for programs like the James Webb Space Telescope and Advanced EHFs. In Autonomous Systems, the ramp-up on Triton and other programs continues to more than offset lower NATO AGS volume.","Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing our 2017 sales guidance for AS to a range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion versus our prior guidance of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion. Operating income at Aerospace Systems is up for both the quarter and year-to-date with operating margin rates of 10.8% and 10.7%, respectively.","The trend for both periods relative to the prior-year periods largely reflects mix as we ramp up on Manned Aircraft development work. The mix impact on margin rates and Manned Aircraft was partially offset by improved performance in other areas, including a $56 million positive EAC adjustment on a restricted program.","As you know, EAC adjustments at AS can be lumpy. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the increase in net EAC adjustments at AS was $14 million. For 2017, we continue to expect a high 10% margin rate at AS. No change to prior guidance.","Moving to Mission Systems. Sales rose 5% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Increased volume for sensors and processing programs contributed to higher sales for both periods and included increased volume on electro-optical, infrared self-protection and targeting programs, F-35 sensors and the SABR program.","During the third quarter, Mission Systems also had higher volume on air and missile defense programs and their Advanced Capabilities business. Mission Systems' operating income increased 3% for both the quarter and year-to-date, driven by the higher sales volume. Operating margin rate was 12.8% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date.","For 2017, we now expect MS revenue will range between $11.2 billion and $11.3 billion versus our prior guidance of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect an MS margin rate of approximately 13%, no change to prior guidance.","At Technology Services, third quarter sales were slightly lower than last year and year-to-date TS sales are 2% lower due to the completion of several programs, as well as lower volume on the KC-10 program. Operating income was up slightly for the both the quarter and year-to-date, and TS continues to achieve a very strong margin rate of 11.2% for both periods.","Based on year-to-date performance, we are increasing TS sales guidance to approximately $4.7 billion, the high end of our prior range of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. We are also raising TS operating margin rate guidance to approximately 11% versus our prior guidance of mid-10%. Our total segment operating income increased 4% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. And we continue to expect a mid-11% segment operating margin rate for the year. No change to prior guidance.","Total operating margin rate was 12.9% for the quarter and 13.2% year-to-date. I would note that we had a $90 million increase in third quarter unallocated corporate expenses. The most notable single part of the increase was $27 million in Orbital ATK transaction costs. In addition, last year's third quarter unallocated was relatively low and included a $30 million benefit for state tax refunds. For the full year, we now expect unallocated corporate expenses of about $225 million due to transaction costs, as well as the higher run rate we usually see in the fourth quarter. This is a $25 million increase to our prior guidance of approximately $200 million.","Higher third-quarter unallocated corporate expenses were partially offset by a higher net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment. During the third quarter, we completed the demographic study that allows us to finalize our cash pension expense for the year. Based on the study results, we now expect CAS of approximately $1.02 billion versus our prior estimate of $960 million. We now expect 2017 FAS will be $435 million.","In the third quarter, we conformed our methodology of accounting for administrative expenses across our various plans, which reduced FAS expense by about $25 million. So, we now expect the 2017 net FAS\/CAS adjustment of about $585 million versus our prior estimate of $500 million.","At the beginning of the year, we provided a CAS estimate of approximately $1 billion for both 2018 and 2019. We'll update our pension estimates on our fourth quarter call, but for your modeling purposes, barring a major market dislocation, we would now expect CAS recoveries will be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion annually for 2018 and 2019, as well as for a few additional years.","At the beginning of the year, we estimated 2018 and 2019 FAS would be $400 million and $350 million, respectively. Holding our current discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions constant, we would expect 2018 and 2019 FAS of $375 million and $275 million, respectively, due to the upgraded demographics and the methodology change I mentioned earlier.","FAS should continue to decline post-2019, again, keeping all assumptions constant.","I would remind everyone that a 25-basis-point change in our discount rate changes 2018 FAS by approximately $70 million and a 100-basis-point change in plan asset return around our 8% expected rate changes 2018 FAS by approximately $50 million.","I would note that our plans have a strong net asset performance of approximately 12% through September 30, and as you know, interest rates are lower now than at the end of last year, which would impact our 2018 discount rate.","Regarding required CAS contributions to the pension plans, as we noted earlier this year, we expect approximately $100 million in each of 2017 and 2018 and $400 million in 2019. Holding assumptions constant, including our 8% expected rate of return, our 2020 required contributions would be almost $900 million.","If our plan asset return hold at 12% this year, our $400 million required contribution in 2019 would decline modestly and our required contribution in 2020 would be reduced by about a third to roughly $600 million.","I would also note that for the foreseeable future, we expect our CAS recoveries will continue to be greater than or equal to our annual funding requirements. We continue to monitor progress on tax reform, and if it makes economic sense, we would consider making a voluntary contribution to the plans this year.","Moving to taxes; you saw in our release that we had some credits and deductions that reduced our year-to-date effective rate to 22.3%, and for the year, we're now expecting effective tax rate of 24.5%, which implies a fourth quarter tax rate of around 32%.","As Wes said, we now expect 2017 diluted earnings per share will range between $12.90 and $13.10, which assumes that we will have weighted average shares outstanding of about 175.5 million versus our prior expectation of 175 million.","Moving to cash; cash from operations totaled $938 million in the quarter. And after capital expenditures of $217 million, third quarter free cash flow totaled $721 million. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $1.8 million to $2 billion, after capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. No change to prior guidance. This guidance excludes any potential voluntary contribution I previously discussed.","Just a quick comment regarding the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. We currently expect 2017 sales under the new standard will be modestly higher than 2017 as reported under the existing standard, roughly in the 1% to 2% range. This is driven by the conversion to cost-to-cost accounting from units of delivery on growing programs.","Before I move to Q&A, I wanted to briefly touch on a debt offering we completed earlier this month. We issued $8.25 billion in senior notes in 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, 10-year and 30-year tranches at a blended rate of 3.14% to fund the Orbital ATK acquisition. Given the favorable interest rate environment, we were comfortable issuing the debt now with the provision that $6.25 billion of the debt has a mandatory redemption feature with respect to the completion of the Orbital ATK acquisition. The debt has a $0.15 per share net negative carry in the fourth quarter of this year and $0.20 per quarter next year.","So, in summary, it was a great quarter, and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team for the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to start Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Ken. Prepared comments run a little bit longer today than usual. So, I'd ask each participant to ask a single one-part question. Natalia, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Ron.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Ron. Are you there? Natalia, let's keep moving.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Carter.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Wes, I know you don't want to provide guidance for 2018. This isn't a question to ask to get it. But I wondered if you might be able to give us some insight into the planning process? I mean, is that time of year to put together the plan if nothing else? You guys are meticulous planners. But you got a lot out there in terms of trying to manage growth. You're trying to close and integrate an acquisition. There's a very wide range of budget scenarios out there from caps to bigger numbers and what not. There's just a lot of moving parts as you put together that 2018 plan. Can you help us understand maybe what some of the risks and opportunities are, as you try to put all that together and manage it, just give us a sense of how you're looking at that for 2018 in terms of what the risk and opportunities are?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Well, thanks, Carter. I really appreciate that question. It's clearly an exciting dynamic time at Northrop Grumman, and quite frankly, across our industry. And as you pointed out when we look at the timeline in front of us, and by the way, our planning is not just for 2018. We are a long cycle business, we think about things over a much longer cycle than year-to-year.","And as we think about our business, it is a process that has, as you framed well, finding the right balance, and making sure that we are planning and allocating resources appropriately, while also being very clear-eyed about the opportunity set that is in front of us, and my experience over the years in the defense industry is that it's easy to become enamored with opportunities, it's much more difficult to have a discipline to look at them through the lens of both being assured that we can deliver for our customers, which we take incredibly seriously in our company, as well as being able to deliver for our shareholders and for our team over time.","And so, our annual process is very thoughtful on in that we force ourselves to take a really hard look at things, and do it without attachment. It's easy to get attached to things that you've been working on and feel that you just want to keep going down the road, but sometimes it's better to get off that road.","So, we are in that process now. We, as I mentioned during my remarks, announced some leadership transitions, we tend to announce those a bit before the end of the year as we did with these transitions in that we want those who will be in the seat at the beginning of the year to own the plan, and be both responsible and accountable for the execution of the plans, and that process is going well.","You asked about risks and opportunities. Clearly, we're in an environment where our customers are asking us to do a lot of new things, and so that's a very good opportunity environment. We've been pleased to see the bipartisan support broadly for better supporting our customers then perhaps has been done over the last number of years with respect to budgets. The attendant risk with that is of course the process. We are unfortunately still operating under a continuing resolution. We have yet to get to a place where Congress has been able to figure out how to move past the Budget Control Act which it needs to do.","And so, consequently, that imposes all source of challenges from a planning perspective not only for our company, but even more importantly for our customer community, and inherently, that drives risk. It drives risk into current operations and it drives risk into future acquisitions. So, that's an area that we pay very close attention to.","We are growing as our other companies, not just in our industry, but around the country and around the globe, and with that growth comes the demand for talent, and as I think about the big important things in front of us over the next few years making sure we get it right on talent is right there at the top of the list. We are a company driven by the intellectual capacity, the hardworking commitment of our team, and making sure we continue to build that with the right team members as we go forward is just incredibly important.","We had a good year last year and it looks like we're going to have a good year this year in terms of our recruiting efforts. I'm just absolutely delighted with the talent that we're able to bring into the company, both those with significant experience, as well as the talent that we're seeing coming out of universities, both here in the U.S. and around the globe as we're recruiting. So, I'm excited about that.","And I'm also excited to see our customer increasingly focused on the more advanced class of technologies. That's an area of strong focus for our company. Clearly, there is an attendant risk that goes with that in terms of being able to mature and realize the technologies as we pull them into the programs, and it's another thing that we do in our planning process, is to really take a hard look at where we stand.","We have a great group of technologists in our company. Pat Antkowiak, our Chief Technology Officer does a fabulous job of leading us through a clear-eyed look at those things.","So, it's an environment that does represent quite a few opportunities for us, quite a few challenges to make sure we get it right, but I have a lot of confidence in our team in being able to sort through those things and come out with the right balance.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Great. Thanks for the color, Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Carter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Wes. This almost infrequent \u2013 or frequent occurrence of announcing no bids on contracts is interesting. And I wanted to probe a little bit. This is a third major program where you've chosen to not bid, and despite having what I'd view is better than average chances of winning. And I wanted to take it from a level of what is the government walk \u2013 effectively by Northrop turning down, entertaining these bids as a qualified bidder, what is it in these proposals that's turning the company off and is it a detriment to the industry and how are they going to attract those companies outside the industry if Northrop Grumman is kind of saying no to some of these?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, Myles, let me give you a little flavor on that because it's I think important to look at each of these things in its own context and also through the lens of the individual companies, which are different lenses. And so, what I'm about to say, it doesn't suggest \u2013 is not intended to suggest that other companies don't follow similar principles. I can only say how it is that we think about things.","When we're looking at one of these opportunities, let me be really clear, our objective is not just to win. Winning is great. It feels good on the day of an announcement. But if you can't really execute on it and deliver on it for your customer and your shareholders, then you've done the wrong thing. And we've worked hard over a long number of years in our company to have great clarity around what our objectives are. When you're entrusted by the U.S. or any one of our allied nations to do something in the defense arena, that's a real bond of trust you cannot afford to break. And we really look hard at executability under the terms of the RFPs that come out to make sure we can really execute.","And so, sometimes, you might say we're a little tough on ourselves in that regard. But I just demand and our leaders across the company demand that we are clear-eyed about that. We do a lot of our own independent, whether you want to call them, black hats or red teams, or whatever we may happen to call them on individual bids, where we question ourselves aggressively to attest, can we really do this?","And if we feel confident that we can, if there is good compelling evidence that we can, then we're going to go forward and make offerings that are intended to be attractive both for the customer and for the company. And in those cases where we don't see that outcome, then we feel we actually have a real obligation to be very clear with our customers about not only our decision, but the rationale for our decision. And in each of the cases that you mentioned, that has been our approach.","And I would say in general, our customer has been appreciative of the feedback, not so much that they want to change things for any particular bid because they've made their decisions on how they're proceeding. But it helps them understand the way that industry is looking at these things, and I would say they've been very inviting of those conversations.","So, I don't see anything particularly negative in all of this. It is simply a reflection of getting the right matches, so that the customer gets what they need and industry gets what it needs. And I intend for us to continue to have that high degree of discipline as we go forward.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Just to be clear, I'm sure you're making the right decision from the company perspective, I just hope the customer is kind of cognizant of the decisions they're driving for rational companies as well. Thanks. Thanks, Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Myles. And as I said, that's why we feel that it's so important to be as clear as we can when we make one of these decisions to fully explain ourselves to our customers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hello, everyone.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Noah.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Wes and Ken, in looking back at the \u2013 at what you said when the OA announcement was made with regard to synergies. It looks like you actually broke out multiple buckets of synergies. So, there was \u2013 you had quoted $150 million run rate by 2020. But it looks like that was actually just in what you're calling cost, which it sounds like is primarily or maybe entirely just where there's duplicative cost between the two organizations, and then there's an additional bucket of operational, and then there's the additional bucket of revenue. Is that the right interpretation and can you size, even if it's directional or even in a really wide range of how those other two buckets could compare to that $150 million of duplicative cost?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Noah, for the question, and I'll start off. And if Wes has anything to add, he can jump in at the end here. We did. You got it exactly right. We did bucket into three parts, the first being cost savings. And I would say that is sequentially the first that we will expect to see. So, we're estimating about $150 million of annual cost savings by 2020. And we have modeled some cost that we will incur in order to get there. So, we've modeled \u2013 I believe we talked about $75 million in the first year and a half or so.","We are looking beyond that at operational synergies. And you can think of those as being in the areas like supply chain and manufacturing where beyond the initial cost savings, we would look to find some additional synergies that certainly we would work to make sure that those drive cost savings as well, but we are not able to quantify that at this point in time.","And then the third bucket is the revenue synergies. And what I will tell you is that that's probably the piece that's going to take the longest, both of us being long-cycle businesses, but we do expect that as we start to pass the cost synergies back to the customer over three to four to five-year period we would see the revenue synergy sort of filling in that reduction in the cost savings that accrue to us versus to the customer, and we will see the revenue synergies start to kick in and generate the margins to again fill in the gap of the synergies at that point in time.","So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it. I hope that answers the question.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I mean, is it something...","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Noah. It's Wes. I would just to add. When we think about the value creation over time, clearly, the cost synergy part of it is important. It enables us to be more efficient, more affordable. As Ken pointed out, as time progresses and we enter into new contracts, we pass those cost savings back directly to our customer, which is a great thing. And if you look back over, at least, our history of the creation of our company and the cost synergies that were created, there was a lot of savings passed back to the customers over the years.","But from a shareholder perspective, clearly, the reason you do something like this in our industry is not so much the cost savings. It really is the revenue synergies that get generated over time. And that's where we see this opportunity to develop new innovative offerings for our customers, offerings that might be harder for them to see in the marketplace absent this combination of very complementary capabilities. And to me, that's where the real excitement is.","Clearly, we're going to be disciplined and focused on generating those cost savings. It's something that as a company over a long period of time that we've been good at doing and I intend for us to excel at this as well. But it's really in the domain of revenue synergy creation where we see the long-term value creation opportunity, both for us as a company and our shareholders and our employees, but also as important for our customer community that really relies on our industry to aggressively innovate and put new ideas forward for them and to create the ability to have even broader side of competitive offerings.","So, that's where I think the most excitement is as we look forward to the future. Orbital ATK is just an outstanding company when it comes to the quality of the innovation, the ability of their team to continue to advance the state of technology and turn that into applications for their customers. And if you put that together with those similar qualities within our company, that's exciting.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I understand. Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you, Noah.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Noah.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I want to follow on that discussion because, Wes, you've been in and around space for a long time. And when you looked at ATK, Orbital ATK, and you think about opportunities \u2013 revenue synergy opportunities, what are the capabilities that you think are most important that they can bring to Northrop Grumman's portfolio?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Well, thanks, Doug. As remarked a couple of times, what's great about this is, is so complementary. We have almost no overlap between the two companies. And let me just pull the thread on the space part of it first. As you noted, and you said it nicely without saying I'm getting old, I've been around the space business for a long time, seen a lot of transitions over the years. And we are in a period of dramatic change in terms of space architecture for such a long time or forever throughout my career, we've operated with the notion, which is now becoming an incorrect notion that space is somehow a permissive environment where we don't need to be so much concerned about the actions of adversaries.","And today, we know, everybody else has gone to school on what the U.S. has done over so many years. The strategic importance of space is recognized and consequently the vulnerability of space assets is understood.","So, we're at the dawn of a dramatic shift in the way that our architecture for our space assets is being assessed. And as you think forward in that regard, it's really going to take the combination of different classes of capabilities to create in space what we've essentially done as a nation with our allies over many areas in the air domain, and the sea domain, and other important domains, which is to create a diversity of capability and a strength in terms of the way that we not only execute our mission, but we defend our assets, and we create a real operating domain.","If you look at the Northrop Grumman portfolio space capabilities, we tend to focus on the really big things. Think about us as observatories or in the national security domain, we tend to focus on the very large assets. If you look at the portfolio at Orbital ATK, it's more the smaller, in many case, more agile response capabilities that are going to be core to this future. And just as in these other domains, the answers, the architectures are going to require that it'd be combinations of both of those different types of systems to make it work. So, that's why we're so excited on the space side.","In the missiles arena, that's a marketplace we're not really in today in a significant way. And, yet, we see the technology is there progressing quickly. Orbital ATK clearly has a very strong competency in that class of technology and in the manufacturing production of those systems.","And as we think about the future, obviously continuing to support what they're doing today with the set of customers they have is going to be important, but we also see opportunities to bring technologies at Northrop Grumman into that mix. And, again, it's a very complementary way of supporting our customers and enabling the U.S. and our allies to continue to advance.","So, those are just a couple of the very exciting things we see going on. But I would say more broadly, I'm excited about the full breadth of the Orbital ATK portfolio, and we're looking forward to getting through this process that we're working our way through now, so that we can get on with it and start helping our customers more broadly.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Sam.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about technical services just \u2013 when I look at the competitive environment, I know last quarter, you talked about Iris. We've seen DOMino, seen some of the secure data network stuff from Homeland Security. I'm trying to understand these businesses where \u2013 from the discussion before about how you approach the bids that perhaps you're looking at the business differently that your competitors. Is there is a reason why it seems like you've not been winning as much? And, really, what does it mean for the prospects for that segment's revenues and margins as we look forward?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Well, thanks, Sam. Let me just kind of give a broad view on that. TS, for us, is a critically important business. It's core to our strategy. It's tightly interlinked with the programmatics across the company both at AS and MS, but above and beyond that, we have customers who are in need of new ideas, the application of new technologies, when it comes to sustainment, when it comes to logistics, when it comes to training, that whole domain.","And, yes, to your point, there are parts of that world that have tended towards more commodity types of provision, and as we've talked a little bit about on some of our prior calls, the work we've been doing at TS has been to rebalance the portfolio, so that we are more focused on the higher end of that class of services.","And you can see it reflected in the margin rate that sector is delivering. It wasn't that long ago when TS was in the mid-single-digit margin rates, and none of us liked that. We did not see that as reflective of the quality of business that we ought to be able to address with the extraordinary team that we have at TS.","And so we've asked them to do what is hard. Basically, they had to trim back the top line, focus on the areas where we're really generating a lot of value, and where it's an appropriate application of the human capital that we have in that business, to also invest in technology for the longer term in that space, and that's what they're doing.","So, yes, there will be some of these bids where customers are making decisions to go with more of a commodity type approach that simply are not going to work out for us, and we're fine with that. That's not what we want to do. We'll have to test some of the customers to understand where their decision-making is. I wouldn't be surprised, over time, if that decision-making moves around a little bit, but we're going to continue to focus TS on the part of that market space that is the higher end and fits with our strategy. So, I'm pleased with where we are, pleased with where I see that team going, and wanting to stay on that vector.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Wes, I would just add that while we have lost a couple of, what are viewed as large contracts, we've also won a number of large contracts in TS as well. And some of that contracts that have been lost are IDIQ types where you don't necessarily see the full value ever getting exercised. But TS has had some nice wins this year, and I think you can see that reflected in our third quarter where revenue is down only less than 1%.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Even as we're doing the portfolio shaping.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Sam.

Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, George. How are you doing?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","My question is on the EACs, the $56 million. I mean, it says in the Q it's largely performance incentive. Can you talk about how frequently these incentives come around? And then also, year-to-date, EACs are down about 20% even with this $56 million. Is there a different strategy? I mean, you're being a little more aggressive in core margins, so we're getting less EACs, or maybe if you can just describe a little bit what might be going on there as a general question as well? Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Sure, George. Let me take that one. I would say that, look, AS is a business that's a long cycle business. The programs last \u2013 span over multiple years. And relative to our other sectors, they have got a relatively small number of large programs. And so you see incentive recognition or earnings adjustments that are similar to this in nature on a relatively frequent basis, this is not an unusual item, certainly the amount is larger on a single program than we have seen often in the last number of years, but nothing unusual about it.","And I would say it again, as you point out, not a large increase in our EAC adjustments this year over last year. And given their restricted nature I can't really say too much about it other than nothing out of the ordinary and the way we manage the business to try to realize as many opportunities and incentives as we can.","But to your second part of the question, I think you are getting it right, we are working to try to make sure that we're recognizing our margin on a timely basis. And therefore, more of the margin is moving into kind of the baseline margin rate, I would say, and we're seeing less impact of the total EAC adjustments over and above those baseline margins that we've been recognizing.","And we're working to make sure that we continue to do that, that we're \u2013 as we're realizing risk reductions, we're reflecting those and as we're able to harvest opportunities that reflect those right into the baseline EACs, and therefore, less large adjustments as we look forward. So that is certainly a part of the strategy and making sure that we're appropriately recognizing our earnings on a timely basis.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. I might have one quick one for you, Wes. Would you care to comment on the projections on OA that are in the current proxy filing conservative, realistic or...","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","George, I would not have any commentary there.

Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Ken, I just wanted to review pretty quickly here some of the cash dynamics that you talked about on pension funding to the out-years. With regard to the cash in and the cash out, you got a net benefit of, I guess, around $900 million or so this year and with an 8% return, that goes down to a fairly small number in 2020, but with the 12% return you have year-to-date, it's about $350 million positive in 2020. I want to make sure, A, that's that correct and B, the 12% return if you could hang on to that for this year, is that $600 million contribution in 2020, is that pretty much locked in or is that number going to bounce around a lot the next couple of years based on where the returns come in and where the discount rate goes?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, I would tell you, Seth, that first of all, it sounds to me like your math is correct largely. I would say that \u2013 I will just remind you that those are pre-tax numbers, so just make sure you're tax effecting them as you have worked through those calculations.","In terms of the returns year-to-date, we're really proud of the performance of our investments and trust organization to generate a nice set of returns and certainly while managing risk and managing volatility. And if we're able to hold on to those returns, this year we would expect to project lower CAS and some amount of lower FAS as we look forward. But certainly, market trends or market dislocations out into 2018 or 2019 can certainly impact those contributions. So, we're just giving you the numbers with the best estimates we have today and with the given assumptions as we went through in the prepared remarks. But we do feel that we're pretty confident that as we look forward our CAS recoveries should offset our funding for the next number of years as we project forward.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard T.

So, it's been a really busy year for program wins for Northrop Grumman. We still even have a few pending competitions out there. You mentioned JSTARS Recap previously. So, I'd like to ask you a staffing question here. I want to know if you could discuss how you're thinking about head count.","Yesterday, for example, your competition noted they were hiring about 1,000 engineers to support new programs. And in your response if you could also get into any challenges you're facing staffing up. New programs like the B-21 and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent are pretty large development efforts. And just want to know if you think you have sufficient critical mass to support all of these new programs. Thanks.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. Rich, it's a really good question. And just reflecting on the question that Carter asked a little bit earlier. You have your finger on one of the key things that is an important success factor in our business, and that's the talent equation. We've been doing really well in terms of attracting talent into the company. We grew head count last year, and we will this year despite the shifting demographics that we have across our industry. And it just makes all of us be very focused on the talent side of the equation.","But I would say things are going really well. The one thing I have concerns about with respect to talent is the clearance cycle. I'm sure you've heard many talk about that as an ongoing issue in our industry, and not only on the industry side, but also quite frankly on the government side, just the time it takes to get people through the clearance pipeline.","But all that said, so far, so good for us. We see a really strong pipeline of talent in our company to apply to all of these new initiatives. And it's just something that we're having to manage very, very closely, pay a lot of attention to, and it's working well for us. So, if you know good talent, send them our way. We're hiring.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Sure will. Thanks for that, Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, Wes, have you stepped back from the MQ-25 program? I guess can you talk about the outlook for unmanned and maybe the opportunity set for Triton?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Sheila. As I think about the future in unmanned, and we've gotten to the point where we'd like to use the word autonomous because most of the real capability is increasingly autonomous capability where there really isn't somebody sitting on the ground flying the vehicle with a joystick.","We're just incredibly excited about it. It is a class of capability that is finding an application across the spectrum whether you're talking about reconnaissance, which has sort of been the traditional application of that class of technology to a whole new set of mission forms.","And it's not just in the U.S. as you've heard us discuss on the calls in the past. Our partners around the globe need this technology. The U.S. is working hard to be supportive of our allies' needs, and we have active efforts in this regard in a number of countries around the globe.","We are making \u2013 we continue to make significant investments internally in continuing to advance the technology. We want to make sure that it's not only mission effective in terms of, if you will, the aerodynamic capabilities of what it's delivering its mission. We also want to make sure that these systems are highly secure. And that they can have the degree of confidence and trust that one would normally apply to a manned aircraft.","So, we continue to see this as a great growth area for our company. As I mentioned, and as you referenced, we did make a decision to not bid on MQ-25 just around the particular nature of that final RFP. But, broadly, things are going really well for us.","You asked about Triton. That program continues to move forward very well. We're into the stage of discussions on the next LRIP on Triton. So, this is just a good growth opportunity for the company and a demand that I think is going to be increasingly important for our customers.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And, Natalia, one more, please.","Operator","And your final question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, Wes, Ken.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Peter.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Ken, maybe just a quick one then. Thanks for the color on the notes issuance. Once you folded it in, what's the plan for \u2013 I guess maybe update your plans on the deleveraging efforts once hopefully the Orbital deal closes with the new notes.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. And I appreciate the question, Peter. So, as we look forward from a cash perspective, certainly investing in the business remains the number one priority. We have a nice set of growth opportunities in front of us, and Orbital ATK has a nice set of growth opportunities in front of it as well. So, we are going to be looking to invest in a business, number one. But after that, we will be focused on some amount of deleveraging. We've got some debt coming due in 2018. We've got some debt coming due in 2019, and we will be highly likely refinancing or using some of the debt we raised to refinance their debt, so that will be taken care of at or around closing.","And then you can see that we laddered our debt with some near-term maturities as well that we would look at from a deleveraging perspective. That being said, we do expect that together we will be strong generators or a strong generator together of cash flow. And after we invest in the business and do that delevering as planned, we will certainly have sufficient cash leftover to continue our strategy of paying a competitive dividend and looking at some share repurchases.","So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. A really nice scenario with strong generation and the ability to really stay focused on the same cash deployment strategy.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","All right. Wes, I'll turn it over to you for final comments.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","All right. Thanks, Steve. I'll just wrap up by again thanking our team for their incredible focus on performance. Everyone's hard work is serving our customers and our shareholders incredibly well.","Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today and for your continuing interest in our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

My name is Kara, and I'll be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Kara, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's second quarter 2017 conference call.","Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are detailed in today's earnings release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call may also include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release. I would also note that we have posted an updated company overview to our Investor Relations homepage.","On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our business has continued to deliver solid results. Our entire team remains focused on strengthening our foundation for profitable growth over the long term. And I want to express my appreciation to our team for their great work. We're pleased with our results at the midpoint of the year.","Second quarter sales totaled $6.4 billion, a 6% increase over last year's second quarter. Aerospace Systems continues to be the primary growth driver as we ramp up on Manned Aircraft deliveries. Based on our year-to-date sales and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our sales guidance to the low $25 billion range versus our prior guidance of approximately $25 billion.","Segment operating income also rose in the quarter and our businesses combined to generate an 11.8% segment margin rate. Our year-to-date segment operating margin rate was 11.7% and we continue to expect a mid 11% segment operating margin rate for the full year. Ken will provide additional sector level guidance later in the call.","Total operating margin rate was 13.4% for the quarter, and we continue to demonstrate that we can grow operating income through a combination of sales growth and performance as we continue to succeed in bringing on new development work.","Second quarter earnings per share rose 11%, reflecting higher sales, higher operating income and a lower share count. Based on the strength of our second quarter and year-to-date results, we're raising our full-year 2017 earnings per share guidance to a range of $12.10 to $12.40. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $507 million in the quarter; and after capital spending of $217 million, free cash flow for the quarter was $290 million.","Capital spending during the quarter reflects our investment in support of long-term profitable growth and affordability for our customers. We continue to expect free cash flow for the year will total between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. Our capital deployment strategy calls for investing in the business, managing the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. We expect to distribute a healthy percentage for our free cash flow to shareholders after capital expenditures of approximately $900 million.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 550,000 shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to about 1.5 million shares. Year-to-date, we spent approximately $370 million on share repurchases. We also raised our quarterly dividend 11% to $1 per share, our 14th consecutive annual increase. Year-to-date, we've distributed approximately $700 million to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.","We had a number of operational and capture highlights during the quarter. The U.S. Air Force announced its selection of SABR for its F-16 radar upgrades. In addition to the international F-16 upgrades currently in production, we are now in the engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the U.S. Air National Guard F-16 upgrade program, which we expect will be followed by an upgrade of 72 AESA radars.","SABR extends the operational viability and reliability of the F-16, and provides pilots with 5th generation fighter radar capabilities to counter and defeat increasingly sophisticated threats. We foresee a robust growth opportunity for SABR going forward.","We also delivered the first low-rate initial production G\/ATOR system to the Marine Corps after the program successfully completed its system acceptance test procedure ahead of schedule. This was the last of the program's required milestones in the production test phase. Five additional systems will be delivered to the Marines under our current contract.","Our MQ-8C Fire Scout autonomous helicopter successfully completed its first flight from a littoral combat ship, proving its capability to fly from multiple ship classes. On May 30, our Advanced Battle Management and Launch Control System, an integral part of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense System successfully supported an important intercept of an intercontinental ballistic missile target. We're a strategic partner on this program that provides our nation's defense against long-range ballistic missiles.","We were awarded a $169 million contract to build and support a new satellite communication system for Australia, which will enable deployed Australian forces to connect to strategic information networks. The technology is aimed at assisting with a range of Australian Defence Force (sic) [Australian Defence Force] (05:54) operations, including border protection, humanitarian and disaster relief missions.","And lastly, after the close of the quarter, we received a follow-on competitive award to provide logistics product support for four Battlefield Airborne Communications Node or BACN aircraft, as well as subsystems and support equipment in support of overseas contingency operations.","Looking ahead, we're competing for several important near-term opportunities, including the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent and the Joint STARS Recapitalization Program. On GBSD, we expect two technology maturation and risk reduction contracts will be awarded before the Air Force begins full scale development on the nation's next generation ICBM system.","Northrop Grumman has played a critical role on the U.S. Air Force's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile System since its inception. As a trusted partner and technical integrator, we've mastered the complexities of its flight, launch and command and control systems. We look forward to providing an affordable and technically-robust system design that combines our legacy ICBM expertise, core capabilities across multiple domains, and demonstrated ability to deliver secure, resilient integrated systems.","On the Joint STARS Recapitalization, we believe our team has the unique experience and capability to execute a low-risk plan for a seamless transition from the legacy platform, on which we are the prime, to a new system based on a smaller, more efficient and more capable platform. Our offering includes the right-sized, high-altitude aircraft, and the highly capable battle management command and control and communication system. We're also competing separately for the AESA radar portion of the program. We believe that we're well-positioned for both competitions.","I would mention that in addition to these competitions, we also have the opportunity to address a growing set of restricted programs. As we look ahead, adequate and reliable defense funding will be critical to executing our country's national security missions and maintaining our military superiority.","As we address a variety of national security issues, the readiness of our forces, the aging of our strategic deterrent, the increased vulnerability of our space assets, to name just a few, we're encouraged that Congress avoided a year-long continuing resolution and passed the FY 2017 budget, which together with OCO fund, provided needed increases in defense spending. Both the Senate and the House are working on the FY 2018 appropriations and the House Appropriations Committee has completed its markup of the defense bill. We encourage our government leaders to work together to avoid the negative impacts of a long-term continuing resolution in fiscal year 2018, as well as avoiding a triggering of sequestration under the Budget Control Act.","We continue to expect a modest upward trend in national security spending for the foreseeable future. Industry must play its part in supporting national security by investing in capacity and capability, and focusing on affordability for our customers to ensure we're delivering value for our customers and the tax payer. This is our focus at Northrop Grumman, and we believe this will create value for our shareholders, customers and our employees.","In summary, we're pleased with our results and our outlook at the midpoint of the year. Again, thanks to our team for their continued focus on performance and execution, which supports our strategy to drive profitable growth over the long term.","So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to add my thanks to our team for a good first half of the year. As compared to last year, 2017 second quarter results included higher sales, higher segment operating income, solid margin rates and higher net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment. Segment operating income includes the benefit of the cost claim.","These improvements were partially offset by increases in our unallocated corporate expenses and our effective tax rate. These results, along with our lower share count combined to drive a 11% increase in second quarter EPS.","Moving on to sector results and guidance, Aerospace Systems sales were up 14% for the quarter and 13% year-to-date. Manned Aircraft was the primary growth driver for both periods as we ramp up on restricted activities and had higher volume for the E-2D program.","We also had higher volume in Autonomous Systems and Space. In Autonomous Systems, the ramp-up on Triton and other programs continues to more than offset lower NATO AGS volume as that program moves toward completion. Space was also higher as additional restricted activities are now beginning to offset declining sales in non-restricted programs like Advanced EHF.","Based on year-to-date AS sales of approximately $5.9 billion, we are increasing our sales guidance for AS full-year sales to a range of $11.5 billion to $11.7 billion, largely due to our growing development work. Operating income at Aerospace Systems is up for both the quarter and year-to-date with operating margin rates of 10.6% and 10.7%, respectively.","The trend versus last year reflects higher development volume for Manned Aircraft. We expect this trend to continue for the rest of the year. For 2017, given our increased sales outlook, we now expect AS operating margin rate will be in the high 10% range versus our prior guidance of approximately 11%.","Moving to Mission Systems. Sales rose approximately 3% for both the quarter and year-to-date. Higher sales volume for both periods reflects increased sales for combat avionics as we ramp up on F-35 and SABR, as well as higher volume for communications programs. Operating margin rate was 13.4% in the quarter and 13.2% year-to-date. Operating margin benefited from the cost claim, partially offset by a provision for cost reduction initiatives. Cost claim adjustments are not unusual. In last year's second quarter, our unallocated corporate expenses benefited from the finalization of prior year incurred cost claims.","Thus, while some benefit the segment operating income, net of the cost reduction provision, the net impact of this quarter's cost claim is only a modest increase to total operating income. For 2017, we now expect MS revenue will range between $11.1 billion and $11.3 billion versus our prior guidance of low $11 billion.","Based on year-to-date results, we are increasing our expectation for MS margin rate. We now expect MS operating margin rate will be approximately 13%, an increase to our prior guidance of mid-to-high 12%. At Technology Services, second quarter sales declined 3%, and year-to-date sales were down 2% due to the completion of several programs as well as lower volume on the KC-10 program.","Operating income was up slightly for both the quarter and year-to-date. Based on year-to-date performance, we now expect TS sales will range between $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion with a mid 10% margin rate, a modest increase to our prior guidance of mid $4 billion sales with a margin rate of approximately 10%.","Total segment operating income increased 3% for both the quarter and year-to-date, and we continue to expect a mid 11% segment operating margin rate for the year. No change to prior guidance.","Total operating margin rate for the quarter was 13.4% and 13.3% year-to-date. Both periods reflect higher net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment partially offset by increased unallocated corporate expenses. For the full year, we continue to expect a net FAS\/CAS adjustment of $500 million. Keep in mind that estimated CAS won't be finalized until we complete our annual demographic study in the third quarter.","In addition, we continue to work on CAS affordability items, particularly, to the extent, they also reduce required funding over the next few years.","Our corporate unallocated costs are typically weighted toward the second half of the year. We continue to expect 2017 unallocated corporate expenses of approximately $200 million, with the total operating margin rate in the mid to high 12% range versus our prior guidance of mid 12%. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of about 27.5% and a weighted average share count of approximately 175 million.","Just a few comments on our cash results and our expectations for the full year. For the quarter, cash from operations generated $507 million and we spent $217 million on capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the quarter was $290 million. Year-to-date cash trends reflect working capital growth in support of higher sales. We expect working capital to decline in the second half of the year, consistent with our typical pattern. We continue to expect cash flows will be weighted heavily toward the end of the year with free cash flow in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion after capital expenditures of approximately $900 million. No change to prior guidance.","So, in summary, it was a solid first half, and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team for the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to start Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Ken. As we open the line for the Q&A, I would ask each participants to limit themselves to a single question. You are welcome to return into the queue, if you have additional questions. Kara?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Afternoon.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, David.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, David. How are you?","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. My question is so if I take a look at your guidance, it looks like you're guiding for sequentially flat Q3\/Q4 with Q2. Typically, from a seasonal basis, you ramp up in the back half of the year. What is different about this year that we won't see some sequential growth in the back half of the year?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I would say, if I look at history, we are historically relatively flat in the second half of the year. We're also seeing a tougher compare in the second half as you look at 2016 as we were really starting to grow the business in the second half of 2016 as well.","I would say that in terms of the guide itself, we may see some additional volume at the Mission Systems, essentially the legacy ES business on some of their units of delivery sales.","But, largely, I don't see this as inconsistent with our historical pattern and relatively consistent with.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And, David, the one thing I would add, too, on that is \u2013 and I mentioned this briefly in my remarks. As we look at the September or October timeframe for the year, there is some uncertainty out there right now on the whole budgetary environment. And I think many in our customer community are of a mind that we are likely to have continuing resolution at the end of the year. And so we've seen a variety of customer behaviors in what will be our fourth quarter. And that would be the first quarter of a new fiscal year.","We've seen a variety of customer behaviors over the last number of years as we've dealt with this budget uncertainty. So until we get a little bit better resolution on that, we factor some of that into our thinking as well.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","I appreciate that. Thanks, Wes. A quick follow-up probably for Ken. The 10-Q, it looks like you went through and ran the rev-rec on 2016, and it looks like it was a positive for revenue, but a negative for EBIT. Can you just comment a little bit on that, Ken? Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Sure. Thanks, David. I would say, we did disclose in the 10-Q the impact \u2013 the expected impact upon adoption on the 2016 P&L. You did see that there was higher revenues of about $200 million. That largely relates to the change from units of deliver to cost to cost, as we pull some cost forward on some of the growing units of delivery programs. That would tend to increase the operating margin in 2016.","We did have a couple other contracts that had some impact as we looked at 2016 that resulted in a lower margin in 2016 of about $70 million. And I'll just give you an example. On one case we changed the performance obligations of a particular contract to push back some profit prior to 2016. We also had another situation where a change in performance obligations resulted in some margin moving out into the future from 2016.","So it's just one of the vagaries of the adoption of the rev-rec standard. I wouldn't take 2016 and assume that when we ultimately adopt in 2018 that it's going to be similar, that was relatively unique impacts of those two particular programs at that point in time. We will certainly keep you updated and be able to provide full information on our year-end call. But definitely don't read that situation into our ultimate adoption in 2018.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Ken, thanks a lot.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Jay.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Very good afternoon, everyone. Good morning or good afternoon. Wes, I was wondering if you could just spend a few minutes updating us all on your supply chain strategy. Affordability is obviously key for duty at this point. I know you've done quite a few things over the last several years particularly with your centers for excellence.","But I was wondering if you've had any further thoughts on the overall strategy and whether there's a greater inclination towards further vertical integration for yourselves and others in the defense world. And I appreciate the thoughts. Thanks.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Jason. Yeah, it's clearly a really important part of our enterprise. If you just look at the mix of things that we do, I think this year, we'll probably acquire slightly in excess of $10 billion worth of our content from parties outside of our company. And we're proud of our supply chain. We worked hard over a number of years to drive on quality and to make sure that we're driving on performance in our supply chain the same way that we're driving on performance within our company.","And at the end of the day, those are the kind of the biggest levers when it comes to making sure that we are getting the outcomes that we need in our programs for our customers. And I've seen great reaction across our supply chain to step up where we've identified some issues in that regard.","And also to invest ahead with us as we are investing in our company robustly because of the opportunities that we see and the focus that we have on ensuring we're going to be there for our customers around the globe. Our supply chain has stepped up with us as well. You mentioned a really important aspect of our engagement with our supply chain, and that's affordability. And I want to be clear about our approach on this, because I know there are some different perspectives out there in industry on that equation.","From our perspective, affordability is all about getting better designs that are inherently lower cost. It's not about squeezing the death out of our teammates trying to get them into a place where they might be even potentially unviable for the long term. We don't do business that way. We are focused on helping our teammates get to a place where the products they're providing us are inherently more affordable because we're addressing cost. And I think that's a really important perspective, because that's the only thing that's really sustainable over the long term. If you're just squeezing for the sake of a near term deal, you're really not going to help yourself for the long term.","So that's been our focus to drive on affordability. The other aspect of it is \u2013 and I mentioned this briefly with respect to investment \u2013 is we really like being engaged with the most innovative members of our supply chain, those who are bringing their ideas forward, who are pushing us as well in thinking about how we can do things differently.","And because we so much appreciate that innovation and the fact that our supply chain members do invest along with us, we always work hard to keep that appropriate balance on how much we do inside versus how much we do outside. And it really is a set of business decisions each time. If we can do something more effectively, that is more affordably, with more innovation outside, that's our first choice. And it makes all the sense in the world to manage an enterprise that way.","Because we do participate at the very high end of technological spectrum in the work that we do, there's just inevitably a fair amount of our effort that is internally focused and derives from the internal investments that we make and the capacity and capabilities of our extraordinary team at Northrop Grumman.","But even there, over time, we attempt to take a lot of that and place it in the hands of able suppliers that we trust to not only perform on it, but to continuing to invest in it as we go forward. So we do not have in place an overt strategy to drive more vertical integration. That's not the way we think about it.","We think about it element-by-element to make sure we're making good business decisions and decisions that will ensure the viability and capability and capacity for serving our customers for the long term.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's great. Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can I ask about your mix of business, and in particular your cost-plus development mix of business this year. I think if I've got the numbers right, about 58% of your total sales are in the cost-plus category that's up obviously 7 points or 8 points from where it was a couple of years ago. Is this the peak year for that mix? I know you want to start give 2018 guidance yet, but clearly, one of the concerns in the market is around margins and compression of margins. Do you feel comfortable that this is the peak year for cost-plus development mix, though?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, Myles, let me start on that one, and I'll hand over to Ken. Let me just say, I know you'll hate this kind of answer. It all depends. We are out there aggressively pursuing some businesses, some new business opportunities that are development in nature that we believe represent good, positive, value-creating opportunities for our company. And to the extent that we are successful in capturing more new development work, that mix will continue to go up a bit.","And as I've said in the past, I'm delighted to see that happening. We've been quite successful for a while in capturing the development work. And you're exactly right that would put pressure on margin rates. The test that we continue to apply to ourselves is, can we grow both the top and the bottom line? And if we're doing the right things taking on that development work that positions us well as it transitions into production, and we're growing our net income as we do it. That's really the way we're thinking about goodness here.","Margin rates are important. We continue to use them in our incentive plans because we like that measure as a measure of goodness. We have a very strong, strong focus on that as we run a downturn environment because that's a really important time to make sure you're completely optimizing yourself around those metrics.","But you'll notice that in our incentive plan, we've also added net income growth because as we're looking to ensure that we're building the right foundation for long-term profitable growth, we want to make sure that we're thinking about this equation through that lens. So, again, I apologize for having to tell you it depends, but it depends on how successful we are in capturing some of the new things that are in front of us. But, Ken, if you want to add some color to that?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. Myles, let me see if I can maybe add a little bit more to that. And I would say that if you look at 2016, it was a 2 points, maybe 3 points higher in terms of mix than 2015. And if you look at 2017, probably a couple points higher from 2016; could be the peak. I think to Wes's point, we've got a number of opportunities in front of us for growth, some of that being fixed price production and some of that being cost-type development work.","I would also point out that not all cost-type work is the same. Certainly, in general, fixed price margins are greater than cost-type. But as we take on new programs, there are obviously a number of risks and opportunities that are identified. And the goal there is to burn down the risks and harvest the opportunities and make sure that we're able to drive the margin rate up.","So more mature cost-side programs where we've been successful in that regard can be strong generators of margin. We do have some cost-type programs that are still in the process of getting through some of those risks and capturing some of those opportunities, and we'll work diligently to try to maximize every dollar margin out of those.","But I think it's a nice place to be where we've got a growing set of opportunities in front of us for both production and development. And ultimately, we will see our mix come back to more historical norms. I'm just not sure I can predict if this is for sure the year for you.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I also thought the rev rec adoption would also help that to some extent in 2018. But thanks for the answer.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you, Myles.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein Research.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I wanted to ask about Mission Systems. If I exclude the cost claim in the quarter, the margins looked a little weak to us. Can you talk about what's going on there? You referred to the cost reduction effort in Advanced Capabilities, but what's happening there? And how should we think about the mix of that business going forward? And what are kind of the normal margin would be?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Let me start on that one, Doug, and I would say that we certainly had the cost claim, noted that it was partially offset by some provisions for cost reductions as we always look to make sure that we are able to run our businesses as efficiently as possible.","I don't see necessarily any major mix changes at MS. I would say that we have seen in the last 18 months or so a bit more in terms of some cost-type work at MS. But I don't see a major change necessarily this quarter. We've talked about some additional space restricted opportunities there that we're performing on and a couple others. But I don't think there's anything particularly huge from a mix perspective.","I would say that as we look at that business, we'll work hard to have a strong second half of the year. And we continue to think of that business as one that compares to its peers, and we've talked about kind of the 12% range as a benchmark for that business, and we continue to incentivize the team to perform better, and they have, and we'll certainly work hard to continue to do that in the second half.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And, Doug, I would just add this is a business that's our highest performer in terms of margin rate. We see a very strong performance trajectory there, and I feel good about seeing that continue. So I don't have any concerns at all on that.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. Just to quickly follow up on Doug's question, if you could tell us, Ken, what the cost reduction provision was there so we could net that out and get a better picture of what the underlying margin actually was in Mission Systems?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, George, I don't think I want to get down into that level of detail. Obviously, the cost claim impact at MS we discussed was in the range of $30 million, and this was a partial offset to that, and to be honest, I don't have the number in front of me. But we look at MS as performing well, and certainly we'll continue to focus and make sure we maximize that as we look forward.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","But let me ask another one then, can you give us what the overall classified growth was in the quarter? You had mentioned how that was a big contributor.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I don't think I'd be able to go there, George. I would just say certainly a big contributor, certainly a big contributor at Aerospace, but also a contributor as we look at the MS business as well.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. And, George, just along those lines, as we go forward, and we see our customer very appropriately become a bit more sensitized to the security environment and the nature of the threat profile that we're addressing, we do see the possibility, and I would say we framed it a little bit more strongly the likelihood that an increasing fraction of our business may become restricted. And as you might imagine, there are some sensitivities to how much information, even when it comes to percentage types of information, that we can discuss along those lines. But we do see our customers increasingly thinking about how they classify their programs.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Let me ask an easy one that you probably can answer then. The F-35 growth in the quarter and what kind of growth are you (34:26) for the year?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Regarding F-53, George, I would say I don't have the quarter numbers in front of me, but from a full-year perspective, we're looking at AS being relatively flat from an F-35 perspective. Last year had some EMD volumes still in it. We don't see that this year, and the units are largely starting to ramp in 2017. And I'll remind you that certainly the price per unit has been coming down nicely as well.","But at Mission Systems, we are looking an F-35 increase and probably $0.25 billion range and that's across all three of its F-35 contracts, the radar, the DAS, and the CNI. So nice growth at MS and we see that trend continuing at both sectors. And to Myles' point probably something that will be impacted by the rev-rec standard as we look at the 2018 and beyond.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good afternoon. Wes, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the IBCS program. And I know it's not necessarily the biggest turning driver of the company, but it's one that got singled out a little bit in the Authorization Act and \u2013 in some of the articles about the development of Patriot and the ability to sell it to foreign customers. What's your feeling on where you guys stand on that program and how much risk there is around it?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. I appreciate the questions, Seth. IBCS is a program we've been working with the Army for some time. It addresses some really tough challenging problem for the Army. And so inherently, as the effort has moved forward, the view of the capabilities that's required and the way that it needs to be tested and implemented does evolve a little bit.","So we're partnered closely with the Army on this. I see today from the Army a strong conviction of its importance and the need to continue move forward with it. And over time, there are likely variants of this \u2013 of interest to our international partners around the globe. And so we are absolutely committed to this program. It's getting many of our best and brightest in the company in terms of its focus. And I believe we're going to see over the longer term, it will take a little while to get all this aligned with where the army and then ultimately the international market will want it to be. But I see over the long term a really nice opportunity here.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Seth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Howard. If you're there, we can't hear you.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Kara, why don't we move on?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Wes and Ken.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Peter.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Just on Technology Services, the guidance there for mid 10% margins, you're running north of 11% now implies obviously a high-single digit in the back half of the year. Is there anything unique there? Or is that conservatism or just timing? Maybe just a little more color there on how we're thinking about that.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, I would say, Peter, part of this goes to Wes' remarks earlier about the second half of the year in terms of CR and funding and things like that and impacts that could have on the shorter cycle business as well as customer challenges and behaviors and things like that.","TS has done a really, really nice job of managing the business in the first half of the year and finding ways to generate some additional margins. And we're continuing to look under every rock to see if we can find more in the second half of the year.","But this is a business that performs very well relative to its peer group. And I would say looking at the second half performance, what we're looking at now is not shabby but we'll certainly work hard to outdo it.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Rob.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Rob, how are you?","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks. I thought I'd just follow up on your comments about SABR and then some idea from how big this market could be for you over the next few years and how the margins on this might compare to the rest of the division that it's in.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","That's a great question. SABR is specifically right now targeted to the F-16, and as you know, there's a lot of F-16s out there. So the question obviously is how far this goes. How many of those would be aligned on this type of replacement and it's kind of hard to tell. All I could say is if I were an F-16 pilot and I was offered the opportunity to go up against the adversary in an aircraft with a SABR versus an aircraft that didn't have one, I know which one I pick. So we'll have to see how many of the services that are deploying F-16s are aligned on those types of upgrades versus other alternatives of a different aircraft they might be looking at. And obviously, there's a budget (40:29) affordability side of this.","So it's a little hard to call right now. I would just say that the adoption that we've seen so far has been great, both domestically \u2013 primarily domestically, but the international interest on this is significant. We have a good partnership with Lockheed Martin on this, where both companies are committed to continuing to make the F-16 a very strong capable platform for a long time. And we just have to see where this goes.","You also asked about the overall profitability, and like most of these things, volume improves with the profitability on that program over time. And over time, it's certainly our desire that this demonstrates a level of profitability in excess of what MS demonstrates in aggregate. But we need to see the production volumes move in that direction over time.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I would just add to that, Wes, that we were excited to be awarded the NORTHCOM G1. (41:31) That will certainly help from a volume perspective. We're moving out of the EMD phase, and moved in to production late last year. So that is an exciting phase of the program as we move into full-rate production. And some of the international customers Wes referenced and the NORTHCOM contract are certainly helpful towards that volume ramp that we're looking for, and we look to continue to support Lockheed on future opportunities.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's great. Thanks so much.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So excuse me if you've already answered this, but $54 million was the cost claim, $32 million was at MS. Where was the rest of it? And in addition to the cost reduction at Advanced Cap, were there any kind of one-time items in the Q2?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Cai, let me see if I can run through that. $54 million was the cost claim, $32 million at MS, the rest of it was at the other sectors and across the corporation. I think if you saw the 10-Q, there is a reference to some of the impact at TS, not largely material to any other part of the organization, and to be honest, don't have the numbers in front of me.","In terms of the cost reduction initiatives, that is a \u2013 I hate to use the term, but a one-time effect that should be behind us, and as we look forward an opportunity to run that particular business in a more efficient manner and generate stronger margins in that regard.","Was there any other piece of your question I didn't get to?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","It wasn't really \u2013 And, Cai, you'd asked about it, were there any other big one-time moving things and nothing that was material at all.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, just a quick one on foreign sales. You have less growth than some of the others. But it looks like the environment has improved for a number of your peers. Are you seeing any pickup in terms of discussion activity or likely sales?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, Cai, the international marketplace is robust right now for us and our peers. The question always is when does the discussion and the interest translate into sales. And it takes a little bit longer to get over the hurdle on a few of these things. But we're quite excited about what we see internationally. We're focused around the globe as you know. The three major areas of focus for us are Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East.","Just from a longer term outlook and in terms of the growth rates, I continue to see Asia Pacific as having the higher long-term growth rate, just given the geopolitical dynamics of that region, the need to significantly enhance the security capabilities and the focus of the governments that \u2013 from a partnership perspective and our international partners, the focus of those governments that we see underway.","But clearly, Middle East and Europe are going to be quite important as well. We see the NATO countries seriously re-examining their investments. And it's also clear that our allies in the Middle East are taking very seriously their security needs. So I do see this as an important part of the overall global security picture. We're actively engaged in it. And it's just \u2013 you have to play these things through on the timeline that they actually materialize.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And Howard, (sic) [Cai] (45:32) maybe just to add to that, I would say, we did see a growing international sales number in not only the second quarter, but also the first half of the year, both the quarter-to-date and the full year or the six months to-date up about 4% from an international perspective.","But to Wes' point, we've got a growing domestic business. We've got a growing international business. And what moves first will determine how it looks forward. But we're excited to again have a nice robust and the first set of opportunities as we look forward.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Cai.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Cai.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Pete.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Pete.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","I wanted to follow up on Seth's earlier question, IBCS, because I've seen some of the news there. And I also noted \u2013 I think there were some news on AOC 10.2 cancellation in the DOMino cyber loss. And so I started to get a little bit worried about the midterm outlook at MS considering some of that news. And so I'm wondering, Wes, whether or not the percentage of problem for (46:47) MS is on the rise. And also, from a sales perspective, the headwind that maybe AOC and DOMino may provide.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. As I mentioned on the IBCS, we continue to see a very good long-term outlook on that program. You mentioned the AOC. AOC was the case where the Air Force's request to the Congress for continued funding was not supported, and so the Air Force is regrouping and figuring out what it wants to do in that regard. And I think you also mentioned DOMino was another one of the moving parts.","MS has a very broad portfolio. And as you recall, we put together two large sectors to make an even larger sector. So many of the elements of that portfolio are these medium or smaller programs that are going to have puts and takes over the course of a year. But when I stand back and look at all of those puts and takes, I see a nice growth trajectory for MS. You could see it in the quarter. It was growing well, and as we look forward, we continue to see MS as very, very well-positioned and growing nicely.","I don't see any particular shift in the percentage of programs that might fit the label, I think you gave a bread. And there's always a mix in the portfolio of things we're having to put more attention on than others. But I think the sector is being managed exceptionally well. We have a team that is both very operationally focused as well as strategically focused. And I'm delighted with the portfolio mix that we have there, and the way that it's been integrated into this new sector. So I feel good about the outlook for MS.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Wes, I'll maybe just add that from a cyber perspective, with respect to the DOMino question, we do view cyber as one of the areas of business that should see some growth, and that's pure cyber business as well as cyber-enabled. And I think we're uniquely positioned from a cyber-enabled perspective, given our expertise both with platforms and systems and cyber. And that's certainly somewhere where we see \u2013 we should see some nice growth over the long term.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","No, cyber continues to be a very good positive robust business for us.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Great. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you, Pete.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Good afternoon. This is Joe (49:24) on for Rob.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Joe (49:26).","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Joe (49:27).","Unknown Speaker","Hey. If I could follow up on David's question from earlier on the implied sales targets for the second half of the year specifically in Aerospace Systems. I know you're limited in what you can say about classified, but B-21 funding went up from the mid $700 million level in fiscal 2016 to about $1.4 billion in the fiscal 2017 budget.","So we would have expected to see some of that come through in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. So can you just help us think about the timing on the ramp in B-21 sales given the ramp in funding there?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","(49:59).","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","We can't say anything about that at all. But just to say that things continue to go well.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. I won't comment on the B-21 specifically, but if I can just talk about maybe AS at a broad level for a second, I would say that we've seen a nice growth trajectory in AS over last year. It was at 14% this quarter and 13% year-to-date.","Again, it's a business that historically flattens out a little bit in the second half of the year and particularly if you think about development work that largely tends to be driven by a large engineering workforce, we do see that we'll have a lower number of work days in the fourth quarter. You've got Thanksgiving. You've got Christmas in there, and that does tend to have an impact on the late year sales.","Not a ton of units of delivery work that's driven out of Aerospace where you tend to see maybe some additional units toward the end of the year. They do have a couple of units of delivery contracts F-35 and F-18, but the preponderance of their business is on cost to cost. And so we look at it \u2013 there's the possible for some upside there. But as we look at it given the work days, we think the guide is pretty squarely in the middle of the fairway.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Kara, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","Thank you very much. Sorry about before. Wes, it's really a risk management question","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","And there's two parts to it. Thank you. First, what we've seen recently is that you enter into a number of competitions, and then for a variety of reasons you step aside and let somebody else use price as a way to win or something else, and what I've seen is you'd be very successful where you are. Could you talk about that a little bit, and how you go through the program selection, and how it's integral to your core?","And then just to finish the question, the other part is you've got a balance sheet that you've used very successfully over time to leverage earnings, but now you're at a point where \u2013 what other tools can you use to enhance earnings growth?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Howard. Two great questions and glad your connection worked. Sorry for the earlier issue there. Let me first take on your first question about how we think about the program selection process. It's a process that we have continuously refined over the years. We have a set of areas that we see as those that are most likely to be areas where we can add value to our customers, and that the programs will actually be sustained and supported over the longer term.","So we start with that and do a very comprehensive assessment of what it takes to be in a position to really add value and our participation in those programs and sometimes early on that means getting ahead on the investment curve a bit to position ourselves well for that.","We interact extensively with our customers through the development of the request for proposals, and give them a very candid feedback both on the capabilities that they're asking to be created as well as the business terms. And sometimes the customers are eager to engage on all of those aspects. And in other cases, and this is not a negative towards the customers, they see the marketplace offering them so many alternatives that they elect to take business terms or pursue business terms that we find unfavorable.","And so there are times when even though we believe we're well-positioned technologically and the program is likely going to be supported that we'll decline to bid, because we simply don't see the business terms to be aligned with our view on how we create value over the long term. And we've been selective in that regard. I believe our customers would tell you that we've been very candid with them around that, so that we're not surprising our customers when we make a decision to not pursue something.","If it is something that is a re-compete work that we're doing, we're very thoughtful about making sure our customers are not left hanging in anyway. We don't do that to our customers, we stick with them until we transition appropriately. But we work hard to be very transparent with the customer community around the terms that we think will make sense \u2013 reasonable sense for us to pursue versus those that don't, and we move on.","There's a quite a wide space of opportunity that we're addressing. So there's no sense at all that we've just got to bid something for some reason. And I think I've been clear in the past that we're a company that does not drive itself from a perspective of the top line. We really think about the value creation and the flow-through of how we're generating net income and how that gets converted into cash, and then, ultimately to your second question, how we use that cash in terms of the strength of our balance sheet.","And you're right, we've taken a variety of approaches over the last number of years. In capital deployment we've, I think, been good steady payers of a good dividend. We've been very focused on share repurchase as an important tool. But the most important thing that we do for the long term is invest in our business so that we have the opportunity to grow profit and to make sure that we're delivering good value through that profit growth.","And that's really our primary focus. And you can see that in our current capital deployment. We are at a bit of an elevated level of capital expenditure because we see those opportunities to drive on affordability and to invest for the opportunities in front of us. We have been, I think, very thoughtful in that regard. We're going to see a continued elevation of our capital probably for the next couple of years in reflection of that opportunity space.","We also do look at opportunities outside our company. Over the last few years, there haven't been any significant ones that really met our criteria for deploying capital towards M&A, but it is an area that we continue to look at. I think it's a responsibility on our part to continue to test those opportunities. And should we find one that we have strong conviction that we can apply capital in that direction and grow value, then you should expect us to proceed in that direction.","So we look at that full suite of opportunity, but I would just cap it off again by saying our strong desires to put our first dollar towards organic growth opportunities because we see a large number of them. We've had good success in converting those investments into outcomes. And I'm just very proud of how the team drives that discipline.","I will tell you that for \u2013 back to your first question, some of the things that we've elected not to bid, those recommendations have actually been coming up from the teams. That's not something that just a big corporate decision. It's reflective of the discipline that's embedded within the operations of the company. And I'm really proud of that. So thanks, Howard, thanks for asking that question","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","If I can just add, Wes, to the second part of the question, we talked about the capital and investing in capacity and the capability, but I would also just point out it's beyond the balance sheet, but also down to the rate structure, our ability to invest in R&D for the technology and the capabilities and we invested in that R&D through the downturn and we continue to find ways to enable us to invest as much as we can into R&D. And I think that's a big component of it that \u2013 it's a little bit nuanced from the balance sheet side of things, but really that goes to how we manage our rates and our total cost management and really getting to managing every dollar of cost that we run through this business.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. Absolutely.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Co.","Thank you, gentlemen. I get it. Thank you.","Wesley G.

This team is fully committed to building the next bomber for our nation and they are truly an exceptional group of individuals.","I know that many of you have questions about the program. Given the classified nature of the program, we will not be answering questions about it on our call today. The Air Force released a set of information regarding the program yesterday when it announced its decision. We will not be in a position today to provide any more information than has been released by the Air Force. So in our Q&A session, we will decline to address the program in any more detail.","This win also validates that we are successfully positioning Northrop Grumman for innovation and affordability in support of our customers' missions. Part of that positioning for the future is the organizational realignment we announced earlier this month. We announced a realignment of our businesses into three sectors effective January 1, 2016. Our new structure is aimed at better focusing our innovation and affordability efforts to provide our customers enhanced mission capability at a reduced cost. By more effectively aligning and aggregating our product and services businesses, we are enabling greater synergy in the way we operate and we are enhancing our ability to develop, produce, sustain and upgrade our products over their lifecycle.","The majority of our Information Systems portfolio focuses on sophisticated systems architecture and engineering including both advanced software and hardware capabilities. These elements will be combined with our Electronic Systems portfolio to create a more integrated platform to support development of new capabilities for our military and intelligence customers around the globe. Kathy Warden, currently President of Information Systems, will lead the new Mission Systems sector.","The services elements of Information Systems will be combined with Technical Services to create a new sector, Technology Services. Over the years, we have deemphasized commodity-based services and we focused our existing TS sector on lifecycle support and modernization of systems and platforms as well as advanced training. The IS services portfolio will complement this work, as it also focuses on advanced support and services. Technology Services will better integrate the breadth of our capabilities to enable us to provide differentiated and value-added offerings to the U.S. and to our allies.","Chris Jones, currently President of Technical Services, will lead our Technology Services sector. Tom Vice will continue to lead Aerospace Systems. Tom and the AF team have a tremendous set of current programs and new opportunities. Gloria Flach will become Northrop Grumman's Chief Operating Officer with responsibility for operational excellence and risk management and our corporate-wide activities for programs, engineering, global supply chain and quality. Gloria, Kathy, Tom and Chris will all continue to report to me.","I'd like to address some of the speculation that this realignment is perhaps aimed at separating our services businesses. It is not. We've demonstrated that we actively manage our portfolio and we continually evaluate our portfolio to assess value creation opportunities. We have over the last several years reshaped the content of our service offerings to reposition us at the higher end of the market.","Our margin rates show that those efforts have been successful. The reorganization of our services business is intended to strengthen this capability within our company. So we're happy with our portfolio today and look forward to the work that Chris and his expanded team will do to further improve our position.","Looking at third quarter results, our team delivered another solid performance. Third quarter EPS increased 22%, reflecting strong operating income and the benefit of share repurchases. Share repurchases continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment strategy. In May of 2013, we announced a goal of retiring 25% of our then outstanding shares by the end of 2015. I'm pleased to report that we have achieved that goal shortly after the end of the quarter. We completed the planned repurchases at an average price of approximately $125 per share.","Since initiating share repurchases in 2003, we have reduced our share count by about 50% at an average price of approximately $75. Our capital deployment strategy, with share repurchases being a significant component, has successfully created shareholder value.","During the quarter, our board approved a new $4 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the third quarter, $4.6 billion remained on our share repurchase authority. With this new authorization, share repurchase will continue to be an important element our strategy, but we do not intend to announce a new target for share count reduction. In 2013, we took the approach of announcing a specific target because we were going to the debt markets to support achievement of that target. Going forward, we will return to our prior approach of assessing our repurchases from time-to-time in the context of our capital deployment strategy, which has not changed.","That strategy is to invest in our businesses, manage our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases. Our first priority, of course, continues to be investing in our business. We have increased our IRAD and capital spending to support our customers' needs for innovation and affordability. We also have greater visibility into a more favorable opportunity set ahead of us. We believe our portfolio is well aligned for long-term profitable growth.","The global environment of continually expanding and evolving security threats drives an urgent need on the part of our customers for innovative and affordable technologies. We are investing to support their missions and we are encouraged by the news that the administration and congressional leadership have reached the two-year budget deal that provides some stability for federal budgeting and helps to minimize the threat of a government shutdown or a debt-ceiling showdown. This type of action is needed to provide stability and to support our customers' ability to plan for and properly execute our nation's security strategy. We hope that Congress quickly implements this agreement as we are rapidly approaching a debt-ceiling deadline and the CR we are working under expires on December 11.","In summary, it was a solid quarter. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect 2015 sales between $23.6 billion and $23.8 billion. We are increasing earnings per share guidance to between $9.70 and $9.80. And we are refining our cash from operations guidance to approximately $2.6 billion and we expect free cash flow of approximately $2 billion.","So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter results and our guidance. Ken?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Wes. I want to thank the team for a job well done and also congratulate our team on the LRS-B win. It was another good quarter. Overall, we continue to perform well with sales comparable to last year's third quarter and strong margin rates.","Earnings per share grew 22%, driven by strong performance and a 10% decline in weighted average share count. I would note that our third quarter results do not reflect the impact of the tax methods change we discussed on last quarter's call and previously expected to occur in the third quarter. The IRS notified us of their acceptance of the change this month and those impacts will occur in the fourth quarter.","Turning to sector results. We had strong performance across the board. Aerospace Systems sales for the quarter and year-to-date are up about 1% and reflect higher F-35 and E-2D production volume as well as higher volume for our unmanned programs. These increases were partially offset by declines in a number of other programs, the largest of which was the F\/A-18, as deliveries on this program continue to ramp down.","Aerospace third quarter and year-to-date operating income and margin rates are lower than last year due to one-time items in last year's third quarter which added about $90 million of operating income. You recall that last year's AS operating income included $75 million for settlements and also benefited from lower CAS pension cost due to the HATFA legislation. Based on year-to-date results, we expect full year Aerospace sales of approximately $10 billion, the high end of our prior guidance, and we continue to expect a margin rate of about 12%.","Moving to Electronic Systems, third quarter sales increased 2% and on a year-to-date basis are comparable to last year. Third quarter operating income was consistent with last year. The slight decline in operating margin rate is due to the HATFA driven reduction of last year's pension cost, which increased margin rates in last year's third quarter. Although year-to-date operating income is somewhat lower than last year due to the mix of mature production and cost-type development work, operating margin rate continues to be strong. We expect full year ES sales of approximately $6.9 billion, the high end of our prior range, and we continue to expect ES operating margin rate in a low to mid 15% range.","Information Systems third quarter and year-to-date sales were down about 3%, consistent with our expectations. Third quarter operating margin rate was comparable to the prior year period. The sector continues to perform very well and is maintaining strong operating income and margin rates. Based on year-to-date performance, we expect IS sales of approximately $6 billion, the midpoint of our prior guidance range, and we now expect an operating margin rate of approximately 10%.","Technical Services third quarter sales rose 1% and year-to-date sales are up 3%. Third quarter operating income was comparable to last year, with a decline in operating margin rate due in part to lower income from an unconsolidated joint venture. For the year, we continue to expect sales of about $2.8 billion with a margin rate of approximately 9%.","Turning to consolidated results. Segment operating margin rate was 12.1% in the quarter, and 12.4% year-to-date. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 13.3% and 13.4% year-to-date.","Operating income and margin rates for both periods reflect lower segment operating income offset by higher net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment and lower unallocated corporate expense. The increase in net FAS\/CAS is driven by the impact of HATFA legislation last year.","As I mentioned earlier, third quarter corporate unallocated expense does not include the impact of the tax methods change which will now increase fourth quarter unallocated corporate expense for state taxes by approximately $45 million. In addition to this state tax item, when we complete our state tax reporting process later this year, we expect it to result in a lower future state effective tax rate. This would reduce our state deferred tax asset by between $15 million and $40 million with $25 million being the most likely. This amount will flow through corporate unallocated.","Based on these tax items, and our historical pattern of higher unallocated at the end of the year, we expect 2015 unallocated corporate expense of approximately $200 million. As a result of the methods change approved by the IRS this month, we expect our fourth quarter tax rate will move above the statutory rate due to lower deductions for domestic production activities. For the year, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 31.5%, absent an R&D tax credit extension for 2015. We continue to expect a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 192 million for the full year.","Looking at our EPS guidance for the year, we now expect EPS between $9.70 and $9.80. The higher range reflects strong year-to-date performance offset by the additional state tax impacts on unallocated corporate expense.","Turning to cash. Before discretionary pension contributions, year-to-date cash from operations totaled $854 million and free cash flow totaled $520 million. Year-to-date cash is lower than last year due to timing of program collections. We now expect cash from operations of approximately $2.6 billion and free cash flow of approximately $2 billion. This considers $600 million in capital spending versus our prior estimate of $700 million.","Just a quick update on pension items. Based on the demographics update completed in the third quarter, we are increasing our net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment to income of approximately $335 million. Net plan asset returns through the end of last week were a bit above 1%. However, assuming 2015 plan asset returns of zero and a 4.5% discount rate for 2016, we would expect net FAS\/CAS pension income of approximately $240 million versus our prior 2016 estimate of $475 million.","Under these assumptions, FAS essentially doubles to about $600 million and our CAS estimate increases by about $75 million to $840 million. Our prior estimate was based on our actual 2015 discount rate and expected plan asset returns of 8%. We have a couple of months to go before we finalize our assumptions but further for your modeling purposes, a 100 basis point change in return on assets impacts FAS expense by approximately $50 million and a 25 basis point change in our discount rate impacts FAS by about $70 million.","Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ken. As a courtesy, each participant should limit themselves to a single one-part question and return to the queue for additional questions. Kaitlin?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good afternoon. Congratulations on...","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Myles","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Hey, Myles.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...those contracts. Wes, on the reorganization, can you talk to the financial side, the logic of if there is cost savings and if there is cost to do it, and also any go-to-market strategy that's also underlying the reorganization?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Yeah. The go-to-market strategy I think is the most important part of this, so I'll address it first. As we've looked at the vector that we see our customer needs traveling along and we project forward on that vector, it's pretty clear that we're going to continue to see a convergence of capabilities that are needed in all of the solutions that our customers are going to be requesting or requiring. I think it's a sort of a natural vector of technology, if you will.","So we want to make sure that as we think about our internal structure, there isn't anything that is in anyway inhibiting, of course as a first priority, addressing those technology opportunities and capabilities. But more importantly, we really want to make sure the structure that we have actually enables our company to be in a great position for creating those future offerings. And that's really the underlying strategy here and it's offerings both in terms of the products themselves as well as the service offerings, which are increasingly complex because of the nature of the capabilities that are being fielded.","So that's the underlying strategy around the reorganization. It better integrates and aligns our capabilities in the directions that we see our customer community going for the long-term. And I will tell you it's generated a lot of excitement within our company. I think our employees have been seeing this vector and are delighted to see the opportunity to take a fresh look at how we are coming together as an enterprise to ensure that we are very, very well positioned for the future.","The second part of it, I'll let Ken address in a bit more detail. Let me just say at a top level, generally, in our industry, our cost savings translate into affordability advantages over the long-term. But Ken, let me ask you to comment specifically on this situation.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. Myles, appreciate the question. And we certainly do expect that the realignment will result in cost savings over the longer term. I will remind that we don't give guidance on 2016 or beyond at this point and we will give 2016 guidance in January. And at that point, we should be able to further address longer term impacts. But we do not expect a material impact on cost for 2015, and I will say that any cost impact is reflected in our guidance.","Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Kaitlin, next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hello, everyone. Good afternoon and congratulations.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jason.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I just have a bigger picture question. One of the things that we heard from the Secretary of the Air Force last night in the press conference was the idea of open architectures and mission packages that can be competed. So I know you're not going to talk about Long-Range Strike, but I was wondering if you could talk about those comments in general, as it impacts the industry. What's DoD trying to do with all of this and what risks and opportunities does this present for industry and more specifically Northrop?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're excited about the vector that the Air Force is taking on open mission systems and open architecture in general. And in fact, Northrop Grumman for many years has been strong proponent of that architectural strategy. And primarily because we see it as an important avenue for the insertion of technology over the lifecycle of any system, be it a platform or any other system actually that our customers are procuring.","When you have an open architecture, and think about it in terms of some of the capabilities we all purchase on the commercial marketplace. In the cases where there really is an open architecture, it's much easier to get the apps you need. It's easier to do the upgrades that you need and, over time, it makes the capability that you initially acquire sustainable for a much longer period of time. So it becomes really an avenue for innovation and creates new engines of innovation within the defense community. And I think we're all excited about that because we know that we need those avenues of innovation to ensure that we maintain long-term technological superiority.","So I think this is all integrated into the broader strategic thrust that we see taking place with our DoD customer and, quite frankly, with our intelligence community customers as well, that we need to make sure that we're doing the right things today with respect to the fundamental way that we're building things, so that we can take full advantage of this very rapid pace of technology progression, take full advantage of that in our security systems as we go forward.","So we are strong proponents of it. It keeps us all on our toes because it takes off the table a lot of what historically had been proprietary systems that sort of locked one contractor into a particular configuration for a longer period of time. It creates a more ongoing competitive environment. But I think that's healthy. I think it's healthy for our industry. I think it's healthy for technology innovation, and I think it's really healthy for national security.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Doug.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I'm going to ask a very similar question to one I asked last quarter, which over the last few years and you just talked about it. You've completed the repurchase of 25% of your shares and that's been one of the great things that Northrop Grumman's done. But as we look at the balance sheet today, the cash on hand dropped below $2 billion a quarter ago and now it's down below $1.3 billion. Just trying to picture how this plays out in the future. What is the level of cash that you'd like to have on hand in general? And does this impact at all the way you think about share repurchases in the future?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Doug, for the question. I would say that we have been burning down our cash balance as we've been executing on the repurchase program. And we have had some delays in cash collections in the first three quarters of 2015. We've historically had a significant chunk of our cash collections coming in the fourth quarter of the year and we see that trend coming again this year. So I think you'll see that we will build up additional cash balances between now and at the end of the year.","We certainly like to maintain enough cash on the balance sheet for liquidity purposes and I probably won't throw a number as to what that is, but I believe we'll be strong generators of cash going forward. I believe we'll generate a fair amount of cash in the fourth quarter and I think, as Wes mentioned earlier, you can think of us as sticking with the same strategy in terms of deployment of cash and in particularly investing in the business, maintaining the balance sheet, and then returning excess cash through a competitive dividends and through share repurchases, and that doesn't change.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think Ken said it well. I mean the focus for us, number one, is generating cash. And so we're very focused on that across the enterprise. And secondly, being really smart on how we deploy it. And we think a component of being really smart is to make sure that we've got good cash return to our shareholders as part of the broader (25:25) equation.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Wesley G.

Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you very much.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Any initial thoughts you'd be willing to provide on the direction of 2016 revenue and the segment EBIT margin compared to the current year?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","No, I would say that again we are updating our guidance today for 2015, for the full year of 2015, and we're not going to give guidance on 2016 until January.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Ken, are you able to elaborate on where your underrunning the CapEx plan and any directional comments on what the trajectory looks like on a multi-year period?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","I don't think I would be able to comment on particularly where the CapEx is lower. I would say it's just been lower across the board. And in terms of longer term, again we don't give guidance past 2015, but I will say and I think we've said in the past that we expect our CapEx to stay elevated for a number of years, and that continues to be our plan. That being said, we do also expect to generate a lot of cash in the coming years as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with RBC Capital.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, afternoon, or whichever time you think it is there.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Afternoon; sorry. It is afternoon. Wes, congratulations again on the win. (27:34)","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Thanks very much.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","...talk about detail. But I was wondering looking say more broadly if you thought that this may lead to some rejiggering of the industrial base in military aerospace, and whether you might be interested in participating in that.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's always hard to project how the vector of the industrial base will go over time. As I've said before, I do not believe that we are in a situation that perhaps we were in in the 1990s where single program decisions can cause precipitous actions by any of the players in the industrial base. We are today in a very different configuration because of the consolidation that occurred through the 1990s and the early part of the last decade. So I think that some of the commentary or speculation out there is perhaps rooted in an old way of thinking about our industry. We're in a very different place today.","So I wouldn't be particularly focused on single event triggers. But that said, we're in a industry like every other industry that continues to shape, continues to change and, over time, I think it's really important that the industry itself figures out what is the best way of providing its products and services to its customer community. So I think that's the context for thinking about the world on a go forward basis, nothing is every stagnant. To think that it is would be putting your head in the ground.","And it's important that the context of how to best serve the customers is front and center and, of course, the context of shareholder value. So, those are the considerations I think that will come into play as we continue to look at the future. Another really important avenue of thinking in that regard, though, to some of the earlier questions which I thought were really good questions goes to what's the vector of technology and what are the customer needs going to be. And as we are participants in a very high-technology industry here in aerospace and defense, the vector of technology has a lot to do with what the shape of the industry should look like just as it does in every other technology-driven industry, which is increasingly so many industries around the globe today.","So, simply a view that things will continue to shape and change and it's important that companies that have a bright view of their future, like we do, think about that broadly and are proactive in that that regard.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to get two quick ones. Wes, on the reorganization, you had operated with four sectors and no COO, now we got three sectors and a COO. Should I conclude anything about how long you intend to stay around as CEO from that announcement?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","George, let me say this. I am excited about our new organizational structure. We constantly evaluate our organization and I think you've seen over the course of my tenure that we've made a number of organizational changes. And we make those adjustments from time to time based on the approach we think's going to enhance our overall performance for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. And as we looked at this transition into a three-sector configuration, it became apparent to me that having a COO could be really helpful, particularly given the number of opportunities that we're looking at as we go forward.","And that thought was also enhanced by the fact that we have such an exceptional leader in the person of Gloria to take on the role. So I am just excited as I can be about having Gloria come and join our team here at the corporate office to play such an integral role in helping us to move forward.","Your question went to a little bit, I think, in regards to was there any implication there about me and my role. Let me just say this, I am so honored to have the privilege of working with the amazing people in this company. And that is something that I just absolutely enjoy thoroughly. So no one should read anything into the organizational changes that we announced with respect to my future plans.","It's again from our perspective collectively, this organizational approach is the approach, we all collectively believe really positions us best to perform, because that's our number one priority in our company is to execute and perform. And also to be able to effectively realize the opportunities that we see both here in the U.S. and around the globe. So we're all excited about moving into this new operating structure and really excited about the future opportunities it represents for our company.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning. Ken, you talked a little bit about delays in cash collection. I wonder if you could elaborate on that a little more, and if it's just kind of a timing issue, or we've heard that from another company as well, and whether it represents a different way of thinking on the part of your customer?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks for the question, Seth. I would say that, for the most part, we're dealing with a timing issue in terms of cash. We've had some protracted negotiations that have taken a little bit longer to get closed. And we have seen some changes in cash terms from our customers and that's having a little bit of an impact in terms of delaying the cash flow on some of our programs. But I would say for the most part, it's really driven by just some protracted negotiations and a few things that have moved out to the right on us.","We continue to believe that our full year guidance for both cash from ops and free cash flow is where it will end up. So, I think, we'll make it back in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, David.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Just one clarification question, I guess, for our modeling purposes and then I have another question. Will the LRS-B program be reported within Aerospace Systems on a go forward basis?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I think I can safely say that Aerospace will report LRS-B when it finds itself in our numbers.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, beyond that, just think about Aerospace Systems going forward, can you just talk about maybe from a revenue perspective and a margin perspective the kind of transition that's going on there with F\/A-18 coming down, F-35 ramping up, E-2D ramping up, kind of where are we in that transition both from a revenue and margin perspective? Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","So, David, again, not giving guidance beyond 2015, but I will say that a lot of moving parts in the company and certainly a lot of moving parts at AS. You mentioned some of the things, F\/A-18, yes, is coming down, F-35, E-2D ramping up. Some international opportunities starting to ramp as well. So a lot moving parts. Some of it is more mature production, some of it is developmental. And I would say that we always strive to perform and deliver higher margins and I think you'll see us continue to do that, but I wouldn't want to give you a specific number for sales or margin beyond 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","...very much. Wes, the change that you talk about in the organizational structure can only be done if you also get your customer to work with you and I'm going to use the JSTARS program, if I may, just for a paradigm for half a second. You clearly have a compelling solution from what we can see, you're ahead of schedule on it, you could provide the product tomorrow or one would think come darn near close.","It clearly saves the customer a lot of money in operations and improves his capability. In the commercial world, it's a no-brainer what's going to happen. In the world of the Pentagon operations, they talk about better buying power, 4.0 or whatever, which is just a bureaucratic solution. So how do you break through these barriers so that, in fact, you can operate with more speed and agility and deliver both value to your customers, your employees, and your shareholders?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Howard, I would just say, as always, your question is very perceptive. The challenge that we collectively face in our defense community is the challenge of sometimes inertia that's driven by the budgetary instability that our customers are having to deal with. I will tell you that when I get out and interact with the seniors in our defense community and the juniors in our defense community that there is an appetite and a strong desire to see new capabilities introduced much more quickly. And this inability to plan that we've been stuck with now for several years is, of course, impacting that in a negative way.","So as we think about this repositioning of our company, we are taking the view that, of course, we've got to continue to perform and execute in the framework of the acquisition arena in which we are operating today. So there's nothing about the reorganization that slows our ability in any way, in fact I think it actually helps even in the current acquisition environment that we have today. But we, like others in our industry I would say, are anticipating that things are going to change again. And we see some early indicators of that.","The work that's being done in each of the services to think in a different way about how some of the technologies and capabilities can be introduced, it's not at the rate any of us including those in the services would like to see happen, but it's happening. And it's happening in the intelligence community as well. And so as those of us who have been involved in our industry for a long time, can generally forecast a little bit, when you start to see the beginning of the things happening, they're on that vector. And again, we'd all like to push faster if we could and I think generally speed is one of our challenges collectively, but it's going to go in this direction.","And we want to make sure that we are out in front of it. We want to make sure that customers are never in a place where they're having to pull us along when it comes to technology and architectures and systems. We want to be in front and helping them and see the future. And that's exactly what the structure is organized around.","What I experienced, I think a little bit more directly to your question with respect to the how you do it. I think what you have to do is you actually have to put the new thinking on the table as alternatives. And it has to get introduced early enough into the acquisition process where they're seen as viable alternatives, alternatives that can be pursued with manageable risk. And that's really the challenge that we all have is to get some new thinking on the table, get it matured in a manner that the risk can be understood and be seen as managed and in reality be managed and therefore enable some different acquisition approaches. And I think there's great enthusiasm for this.","And hopefully \u2013 and this is, I think, the hardest part \u2013 hopefully, we'll get to a place in the budgetary environment where we're actually enabled to support our servicemen and women at the speed of technology that increasingly our adversaries are doing now every single day. So I think it's actually a national security imperative that we get this on the right track.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.

LLC","Given that the decision came out yesterday after the markets closed, is it fair for me to assume that it is not included in your guidance for this year?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We gave guidance today, not yesterday. So, our guidance today is our guidance. So I would say it that way. But we obviously have had plenty of time to think our way through all of the implications, and that's where we are.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And so, it is included \u2013 I think you mentioned to David that it is included in Aerospace. It would be \u2013 if and when everything moves forward, it will be included in Aerospace.","Wesley G.

That's the home of the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, that's the right place to put the new one.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Hi, Sam. How are you?","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. I'm going to try and sneak two in, which was just one, Ken, have you mentioned in the past what the CAS growth looks like into 2017 just so that if we use the new baseline for 2016 to just think about that?","And then secondly, just in two of your segments, both Aerospace and Electronics, you're coming in at the high end. So, I'm just trying to think about what you might have, I guess, factored differently. What's coming in forward or is this being pulled from 2016 or is something else coming in a little bit better?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Okay. Sam, in terms of the CAS growth question, we did \u2013 on our prepared remarks earlier, we updated our 2016 CAS estimate and I mentioned $75 million increase for 2016 based on where we see the market today in terms of returns and in terms of discount rate. We are not updating our guidance beyond 2016, but last year, we did have 2015, 2016, and 2017 on our Investor Relations webpage, but we are not updating that at this point in time.","In terms of your second question about AS and ES coming in at the high end of the range, I think at this point, it's really just better visibility into what we see the year is going to look like. We've had some risks in the plan that have been burned down. So nine months into the year, I think really it's just about better visibility. We're satisfied with the volume as it's coming in at all of our sectors and looking forward to completing the year and getting ready for 2016.","Operator","Your next question in queue comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. And once again, congratulations.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","You know what: it's not \u2013 it's somewhat related to LRS. Wes, last quarter, we talked about things like JSTARS recap, T-X, UCLASS, things like that, et cetera. Given the resource demand for the LRS-B program, I just wanted to know if this win maybe precludes you from bidding on other work near term. What I'm just trying to wonder here is if you think your plate is full with this contract. Any color you could provide on how you're looking at new opportunities now would be helpful.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's a really good question and we are a very responsible company in that regard. We take a careful look at our capacity to take on anything that we're bidding and we will never go out and make a bid on something where we have any reservations about our ability to execute.","And so we thought a lot about this actually now over the last several years: how do we think broadly about that range of opportunities? And our conclusion is that we do have significant capacity, in large part because of sort of the natural transition that we've seen in development to production. And in fact, I will tell you that one of the concerns on the downside of some of these programs has been that if they slip too long or were delayed too long, what the implications would be not only in our company but in other companies around the inherent design capacity that's such a national asset.","So take for example, F-35, we've been very, very active in the overall design activities on F-35 both in our role in the center fuselage as well as our role in sensors and in comms and navigation equipment, and we've been shifting that well into production now. So the design capacity from that activity has been available. Look at E-2D, E-2D in a similar state where we had been rather substantially focused on design activity for some time and we've moved E-2D successfully into production.","Triton, we are now going through the test program, so our teams that had been focused on our Triton programs from a design perspective are tailing off on the design side of the activity. So when we go through our portfolio and look at these transitions from design to production, which are great, that's exactly what we want, that's the reason we take these programs on, so we actually produce things. But when we look at that capacity that we have inherent in our company, we see substantial capacity.","So we are very interested and very eager to continue to support our customers in pursuit of programs like Joint STARS and the new trainer and UCLASS across the board. And we think it's important that we continue to leverage that very extensive design and manufacturing production capacity that we have in the company to support these activities because we all know when we are operating with our capacity very productively employed, we're going to be operating much more efficiently and that efficiency brings affordability. So, we continue to be very excited about those new opportunities as well.","Operator","Your next question is queue comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, thanks for getting me in, appreciate it. Have you guys gotten a chance to have an early read on whether or not some of the language included in the pending budget legislation is going to have an impact on some of the pension assumptions? I know you said that you're not going to talk about 2017 FAS\/CAS just yet, that's fine. But just in terms of the language in the budget itself, I believe there's some language relating to pension smoothing. Does that going to impact any of the HATFA legislation or the FAS\/CAS timing or anything like that or is this sort of unrelated to how FAS\/CAS rolls through for you guys?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks for the questions, Hunter. I think that \u2013 we have looked at that language, there's a couple things in there that would impact us. One being the pension smoothing and the other being the change in the rate that you pay for the \u2013 the premiums paid. We don't believe the impact of the premiums is material to us going forward and as far as the pension smoothing, haven't fully analyzed it but I think it's good news and likely results in funding that would be required in the out years moving out another year.","Operator","Next question in queue comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert M.

Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Wes, I wanted to go back to something you addressed early on in the monologue, which is the services side and your commitment to the business in the context of the realignment. And what I wanted to get at here, we know you've de-commoditized the business, but what are some of your objectives here? Is it more of a revenue, a cross-selling opportunity to drive a higher growth rate in that business as the budget inflects? Or is there at the same time a margin opportunity, does the combination allow you to get to double-digit margins consistently going forward with these two businesses combined? Thanks.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a good question. Yeah, and let me just say it is primarily a strategy driven decision in that we see this class of service and solution offerings that often go with it on the backend of program deployments when we're thinking about modernization and other activities. We see this as integral to our offerings and the way we do business with our customers. We never want to be in a place where we're unable in some way to support our customers post-delivery, nor do we want to be in a spot where we have customers who are seeking some of these higher end services that ultimately over time translate the thinking into what the next systems will be. We never want to be in a spot where we can't support them.","So your question's right on target because it is a really important part of our overall company strategy to be in the high end of the services market. We think it's important for any company that's going to be a full provider to those customers to have that capability and to be active in the marketplace. And as we look at where those service offerings are going as we look into the future, we think it's going to be important to have that breadth of capability that we'll have in our new Technology Services organization that encompasses both the hardware and the software domains. And again, this is thinking about more the integrated offering that we'll be providing.","Now, we are going to be constantly challenging the team on their margin rates, because we are participating in that higher end of the marketplace. It's clearly an important focus of this new Technology Services organization to generate the margin rates that we see are attainable in that space. As Ken said earlier, we're not going to guide for our new configuration yet, we'll do that at the beginning of the year. But just as we have challenged all of our businesses to compare themselves to the marketplace that they are strategically positioned in, we'll be doing that with the services part of the portfolio and incentivizing the team to do better than what the market suggests they should be able to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hi, guys.","Wesley G.

Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Joe.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Wes, I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the focus on the international business just in terms of what the pipeline looks over the next 12 months, maybe remind us how much of the business right now is international? What the bookings have been year-to-date and maybe how much of the backlog is international? Just some more color there would be helpful?","Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That continues to be a really important part of our \u2013 not only our business today, but our future in our company. And I've mentioned on some of our calls in the past the importance of international to us is a core element of our strategy. Today, it's right around 15% for 2015. And as we think about the opportunity set that's out there, I think I've mentioned many of these in the past, we're especially excited about the growth vector that we see in Aerospace Systems internationally both our unmanned systems, Global Hawk, and then over time Triton being the standouts there, but also with some of our manned platforms and in particular, E-2D. So if I look at \u2013 let me go back to the unmanned for just a moment, as we look forward, we're excited about the opportunity in Japan on Global Hawk and Australia continues to be very, very interested and positive on Triton. We are seeing some increasing interest in Triton from our European allies.","So, we believe there is a very good trajectory internationally in our unmanned business. And E-2D Japan is probably the first up with respect to our international opportunity set on E-2D and I think that's going to be a really important part of it. So, we like the growth trajectory, the potential that we see for AS internationally. We also see really good opportunities around the globe in what we now call our ES and IS businesses which are going to be coming together into our new Mission Systems business at the beginning of next year.","With respect to the Electronics component of that, I think you're familiar with many of the things that we've been doing with radars around the globe. And when we're looking at the F-16 fleet in particular, the SABR radar capability that we now are moving out with several parties already. We are seeing continuing growth in the interest in that. With respect to our current Information Systems business, we also see a lot of opportunities whether we're talking about C4I or some of the air defense capabilities that IS has.","TS is also very active internationally and we have a long-standing global footprint in our Technical Services business and we see opportunities for growth there, both in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific that we're pursing quite aggressively. So, this is a really important part of our business, an important part of the way that we are working to create our future. And I've been delighted with the focus that we've been able to achieve across the company in finding the right avenues for growth internationally.","Stephen C.

Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, I was just wanting, Ken, there was a big drop in EACs in both Aerospace and Electronics, now does that have to do with the gain last year? Maybe you could explain a little bit further?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks for the question, George. I will say that we've been working to get more of our EAC adjustments into what we kind of refer to as our baseline. So, as EAC adjustments occur, they get into your run rate margin. And so we've seen some of that. Our baseline margin rate without EAC adjustments has been going up, which I think is a positive thing. And in terms of the comparison from last year to this year, I would say I don't think there is anything particularly significant. It's just timing of items that hit in last year and items this year as well as the increased baseline earnings.","We look at our business really in terms of our operating margin and operating margin rate and not with respect to what our EAC adjustments are. Just thinking back to the comparison, I guess the biggest impact last year to this year in terms of EAC adjustments would be the HATFA legislation last year that resulted in reduced pension expense for our sectors last year and therefore higher earnings and those EAC adjustments occurred in third quarter. But other than that, I think it's just timing across the sector and continued good performance in our baseline EAC margins.","Stephen C.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wes Bush","Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our second quarter results reflect our team\u2019s focus on delivering top performance for our customers and our shareholders. As a company, we continue to focus on superior program execution, affordability and innovation. I'm proud of our team's performance and their dedication to serving our customers. This strong sustained operating performance combined with favorable pension trends and share repurchases contributed the higher second quarter earnings per share. We are very pleased with the results of the half way point of the year. Based on year-to-date performance we are raising guidance for segment operating margin, total operating margin and earnings per share. Our year-to-date segment OEM rate is 12.6% slightly higher than last year's results.","For 2014 we now expect a low 12% segment operating margin rate and a low 13% total operating margin rate. We are increasing our EPS guidance to a new range of 9.15 to 9.35. Second quarter and year-to-date sales are consistent with 2014 sales guidance which is unchanged at 23.5 billion to 23.8 billion.","We continue to see growth in our international business partially offsetting the impact of domestic budget pressures. We expect this trend to continue in the second half of the year. Cash from operations totaled $572 million for the quarter and we ended the quarter with the cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. We continue to expect healthy cash flow this year and our guidance for cash from operations and free-cash flow is unchanged.","Turning to cash deployment. During the quarter we repurchased 6.1 million shares for 741 million. Year-to-date we've repurchased 10.9 million shares at 1.3 billion. And our weighted average diluted share count has been reduced by 9% year-over-year. And we've now passed the half way mark toward our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015 market conditions permitting. Over the last five quarters we repurchased 31.7 million share toward that goal.","In may we increased our quarterly dividend 15% to $0.70 per share again demonstrating the importance of a competitive dividend payout ratio as part of our cash deployment strategy. In addition to returning cash to shareholders we have also announced plans to increase investments primarily in our longer cycle more capital intensive aerospace systems and electronic system sectors.","We\u2019re investing in our Aircraft Integration Center of Excellence in St. Augustine, Florida and increasing investments in our Manned Aircraft Design Center of Excellence in Melbourne, Florida. And we are increasing electronic systems capital expenditures by $50 million this year. These AES and ES investments are examples of our ongoing effort to improve our strategic alignment with our customers\u2019 need for increasingly innovative and affordable products, services and solutions.","In addition to capital expenditures, we\u2019re investing in new business opportunities and investing in our ongoing programs to reduce costs, improve affordability, and enhance competitiveness. We and our F-35 partners are investing in a blueprint for affordability initiative aimed at significantly reducing aircraft cost. This type of investment strategy represents a win-win opportunity for industry and our customers.","Industry has incentivized to reduce cost and improve affordability. As we demonstrate cost reductions, we will recover our investments and have an opportunity to earn a return on that investment. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $35.6 billion, which includes new awards of $5.3 billion. I would note that this does not include the $3.6 billion E-2D multiyear award that we received after the close of the quarter.","Through the first six months of the year, we\u2019ve captured new awards of $10.2 billion including $665 million for the F-35; $552 million for our work on Virginia-class; submarines $460 million for the F\/A-18 and $299 million for the B-2. New awards for the first six months of the year represented 86% of sales. Electronic systems and information systems had book-to-bill rates close to or more than one time sales. Aerospace systems book-to-bill for the first six months of the year was impacted by the timing of the E-2D award.","Looking ahead, we continue to have a robust opportunity set across the company including significant international opportunities for platforms like Global Hawk, Triton, F-35 and E-2D and in domains like C4ISR, cyber and logistics and modernization. We're pleased that our programs continue to be well supported as congressional budget negotiations progress. While we are encouraged by the tone of fiscal year 2015 budget negotiations, we remain cautious regarding the longer term vector of U.S. Defense spending, given the likelihood of another continuing resolution at the start of fiscal year 2015 and the potential sequestration in fiscal year 2016, if Congress does not act to avoid that outcome.","Despite these continuing uncertainties, we are confident that the actions we\u2019ve taken to reduce costs, drive innovation, and enhance program execution have positioned Northrop Grumman to compete and succeed over the long-term.","In closing, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the first half of 2014, performance that enabled us to raise our full year guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Jim?","Jim Palmer","Thanks Wes and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As Wes said, another solid quarter. Our team continues to execute very well and I want to add my sincere appreciation for their efforts. My comments today will focus on our quarter and year-to-date sector results and I'll provide a little bit more color on our EPS guidance for the year.","The increase in our EPS guidance essentially reflects our strong second quarter performance and our current expectation for a 9% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the year.","Turning to the sectors, Aerospace Systems second quarter sales declined $111 million or 4%. On a year-to-date basis, sales were down 3%. Lower volume for both periods reflects declines in unmanned systems and space programs with lower Global Hawk production activity and lower development activity on Fire Scout being the two biggest drivers of the trend. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume on the NATO AGS program. ","I would note that we continue to see unmanned as a long-term growth driver for our company, particularly as international opportunities emerge. Current unmanned revenue trends reflect a normal pattern we would expect as mature production activities ramp down like the Air Force Global Hawk program and transition to and ramp up on development programs like NATO AGS and Triton.","AS second quarter operating income and margin rates declined due to lower volume and quarter-over-quarter differences and risk retirement and performance improvements. But on a year-to-date basis AS operating income rose slightly and operating margin rate was very healthy at a 12.5% rate. For the year, we continue to expect AS sales between $9.7 billion and $9.9 billion and based on the strength of year-to-date results we now expect an operating margin rate of approximately 12% versus our prior guidance of high 11%.","Electronic systems second quarter sales declined slightly and are 3% lower year-to-date. Both second quarter and year-to-date results reflect fewer deliveries of navigation and maritime systems as well as fewer deliveries of infrared counter measure products.","Year-to-date results also were impacted by the timing of combat avionics deliveries, during both the second quarter and year-to-date declines in domestic progress will partially offset by higher international sales which have increased 12% year-to-date.","ES operating income declined 10% for both periods due to lower sales and quarter-over-quarter differences in risk retirements and performance improvements. You will also recall that during the first half of 2013, ES had a benefit from a $26 million non-programmatic reserve reversal. ","For the year, we continue to expect ES sales of $6.8 billion to $7 billion, with an operating margin rate in the low to mid 15% range. Our current guidance reflects second half ES margins in excess of 14%. ","Information Systems, second quarter sales declined 8% and year-to-date sales are 7% lower. As you know Information Systems is our shorter-cycle business and has a greatest in-theater exposure of our four sectors.","The lower government funding levels continue to impact a broad range of programs in both periods and in-theater troop dropdowns reduced sales by $43 million in the quarter and by $86 million on a year-to-date basis. Despite top line pressures, IS increased operating income and margin rate in both the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Second quarter income rose nearly 9% and margin rate expanded by a 150 basis points to 9.8%. Year-to-date operating income rose 1% and operating margin rate expanded 70 basis points with trends for both periods reflecting improved performance. For the year, we continue to expect IS sales of $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion with an operating margin rate in the high 9% range.","Moving to Technical Systems, second quarter sales improved due to higher international sales, principally due to the Qantas defense systems acquisition which more than offset lower ICBM volume. On a year-to-date basis, sales are comparable to last year and also include higher international sales offset by lower volume across several other programs including ICBM and Hunter. For the year, we continue to expect sales of approximately 2.7 billion and we\u2019re increasing our guidance for operating margin rate to approximately 9%. On a consolidated basis, segment operating margin rate was 12.3% in the quarter and 12.6% on a year-to-date basis.","Our year-to-date 12.6% segment operating margin rate reflects improved performance partially offset by lower net favorable adjustments. As a result of year-to-date performance, we now expect a segment operating margin rate in the low 12% range, slightly higher than our prior guidance of approximately 12%. And with the higher segment operating margin rate we now expect a total operating margin rate in the low 13% range versus the prior guidance of approximately 13%. We continue to expect the tax rate of about 31.5% and I would point out that this does not include the potential renewal of the R&D tax credits. I would also note that we now expect a 9% decline in our weighted average diluted share count for the year, versus the prior guidance of about an 8% reduction.","Turning to cash from operations, we generated $572 million in the quarter and a $170 million on a year-to-date basis. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $456 million with our year-to-date cash performance reflecting higher trade working capital than we had in 2013. Consistent with our historical pattern we do expect our cash flows in the second half of the year. On a year-to-date basis, capital spending increased by about $90 million and we continue to expect capital spending of about $600 million for the year.","Capital spending to support the establishment of our centers of excellence has begun ramping up and we will continue to increase as we go through the second half of the year. Given our historically strong second half cash flows as well as the expectation for the ramp up in the second half of capital expenditures we remain comfortable with the outlook for our 2014 cash from operations and free cash flow guidance.","A final item before I turn the call over to Steve, last quarter I mentioned the Society of Actuaries was expected to issue new proposed guidance for mortality assumptions. Those proposed changes have been issued. They\u2019re receiving a great deal of comment and discussion and so the logical question is what does it mean? So, in holding all other assumptions constant and no change in accruable regulations the new mortality assumptions when fully implemented will likely result in increased liabilities, increased annual FAS and CAS pension expense and potentially increased funding requirements dependent upon the funding status of the company\u2019s pension plans. The timing of the ultimately agreed upon mortality guidance and adoption requirements are uncertain but regardless of these timing issues we expect to update our mortality assumptions.","Our preliminary review of our own mortality experience would suggest an increase in liabilities in the 4% to 6% range. For the applying purposes we are currently assuming that the new mortality assumptions will be in effect at year-end 2014 for the measurement of the projected benefit obligations. And if that\u2019s the case, these new assumptions would then impact 2015 FAS pension expense. Holding the discount rate constant and expect the rate of return and all the other assumptions, we would expect that mortality rates to increase FAS expense by approximately $50 million for every 1% increase in our liabilities and cash cost would increase by about $40 million for every 1% increase in the liabilities.","We don't expect adoption as a new mortality tables to impact, 2015 or 16 require contributions given our plans funded status than our product contributions and of course holding all other assumptions constant.","In addition to the potential impacts of the revised mortality tables, we also need to keep in mind the Congress is currently considering a new Highway and Transportation Funding Act that which at this point includes extending the previous MAP-21 provisions that smooth pension funding requirements. An extension of the MAP-21 discount rates that would result in for example a 100 basis point increase in our CAS amortization rate would likely offset much of the near-term impact of the mortality changes. At this point, we would not expect at the MAP-21 extension that have an impact and our funding requirements for either 2015 or '16. And we do anticipate that resolution and these potential changes would occur yet this year. Just to remind you everyone of our other FAS sensitivities, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate, changes FAS expense by about a net 60 million and a 10 million basis points change, 100 basis points change in our expected rate of return on plan assets will change FAS expense by about 45 million.","And finally, I would note that we expect to finalize our 2014 plan demographics in the third quarter which may impact our 2014 CAS cost.","So to summarize, we now have potentially four major variables that can impact FAS and CAS cost: The discount rate; the plan returns; new mortality assumptions; and possibly a MAP-21 extension.","So a lot of moving parts; obviously we are following them very closely. And we will provide updates to our assumptions and estimates as all of these elements become better known.","So Steve, I think with that we are ready for questions.","Steve Movius","","Thanks Jim. As a reminder, each participant should limit themselves to a single question. Jasmine will open the line at this time. Jasmine?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","","Hey. Good morning, gentlemen or good afternoon I should say, and good quarter.","Wes Bush","","Thanks, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","","Wes, I wanted to ask a big picture question for you, because it's getting to be that time of year where everybody gets engaged in their strategic planning process. And when you look at where we are this year and where we've been in the past couple years, you were obviously doing some planning with considerable amounts of uncertainty. And I realize that per your comments, there's still a good bit of uncertainty about what may happen in \u201816 and where the \u201815 budget may come out. But when you sit down and you start crafting that long range plan, how is that different this year relative to perhaps some of the scenario analysis and stuff you've done in the prior years, and how much more emphasis are you putting on revenue growth and benchmarking on things like that as opposed to what you saw in the planning process of the prior years?","Wes Bush","Well Carter, I guess I would just provide a kind of broad view of how we see the overall environment. Clearly, the deal that was reached at the end of last year that looked out for two years that was very helpful. It provided a little bit more stability compared certainly to where we had been in the prior years. But the reality is our customers of necessity plan over a much longer cycle than two years. And I would say that they are still struggling to plan effectively, given that we have a law on the books that says the sequester returns at the beginning of 2016.","Now you\u2019ll notice, everyone else did that when the President put forward his budget recommendations, he was pretty clear that to support national security, we could not be operating at a level that was dictated by the sequester.","So, there are kind of two benchmarks out there right now, one is the President's budget and the other is the sequester. And it does create some fairly substantial uncertainty in the planning arena, particularly from the customer optics as they are trying to profile out these multiyear programs and investment cycles and quite frankly as they are struggling to deal with everything that's going on around the globe, given the budget pressures that we have in place today.","So, I would say that there remains a fair amount of uncertainty out there. Clearly the events around the globe, I think are highlighting the importance of strong national security capability. And hopefully as we move along through this year and get into next year, we'll have a congress that can tackle some of those challenges and come to grips again with how to really go forward on a budget perspective.","In the more near term as we're thinking about next year, I am glad to see the committee is appearing to make some progress as we're going through the appropriation cycle. But I think it's increasingly clear that we're going to be in the CR as we migrate into FY15; hopefully that CR doesn't last for long time but it's hard to predict exactly how that's going to go.","So there is even little bit of consternation in the near term on this process. I know there have been a number of folks out trying to make a call on what -- which year will be the trough. Just given that range of uncertainties that I just described, I think it's a little bit too early to call that. So we're thinking about this as we have continuously throughout this process with a longer term perspective, making sure that we are doing the right things that continue to position us well for the longer term, working hard on our cost structure, making sure that we're performing well and making the right investments to ensure that we\u2019re going to be able to support our customers\u2019 needs as we go through inevitable cycles in our industry.","Jim, do you have anything you would like to add to that?","Jim Palmer","","Yes, just since we have probably a good portion of the Northrop team listening, and they all know that we're doing multiple scenario planning for our plan; I just want to reinforce your comments and the level of uncertainty that as you look at a multi-year planning process that range of uncertainty over the years dramatically escalates. And so, yes, Carter we are continuing to do multiple scenario planning even in today's environment.","Wes Bush","","I think it's just a healthy thing for any enterprise to do as well because it allows you to be prepared for a variety of outcomes and to test your decisions and your assumptions against a variety of outcomes.","Carter Copeland - Barclays","Thanks guys.","Wes Bush","Thank you Carter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.","Wes Bush","Hi Jason.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi it\u2019s actually John. Hi, good afternoon guys. It\u2019s actually [John Aviv] on here for Jason sorry to disappoint.","Wes Bush","Good afternoon John.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, how are you? Quick question on about IS in the in-theater exposure. I was wondering if you could size that for us in terms of what you\u2019re so close to there because revenue perspective and also which program that might be and given the fact that should surround the way out over the next couple of years. How much more downsize is there than at what point and what altitude do you see there for some longer-term growth?","Wes Bush","We\u2019re going to turn to our information systems expert Mr. Movious to answer that question.","Steve Movius","Sure. The in theater for the company which is a combination of efforts over in theater as well as those contracts funded with OCO funds was about $1.1 billion last year we expect it to be about $900 million this year and IS does have the biggest piece of that. Of the $200 million decline the bulk of that is coming out of information systems. We have four programs that program areas that make up like two thirds of that sales volume and IS holds at least a couple of them. So the bake in program which quite frankly will have legs even after the in theater effort is over. The CRAM effort which will probably drop-off more materially as the in theater efforts wind down and then our electronic systems has a product area in IRCM as well as the laser business which again will drop-off somewhat, but has the long-term viability in the marketplace. So the $900 million, is it going to decline in the future yes, but a significant portion of that will continue into future year periods.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Yes, thank you.","Steve Movius","Hi Doug.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. I was interested in unmanned because now when you look forward and if you\u2019re looking at some of the opportunities out there, I\u2019d love to hear how are you seeing them in, now that includes Navy U-Class variance of the global product platform. But what I am interested in is as you see unmanned aircraft industry mature do you see certain segments where you\u2019re best positioned to compete perhaps others that may not suite you as well. How do you look at this market going forward today?","Wes Bush","Well that we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities in the future on unmanned. It\u2019s still a capability really an industry in its infancy in many respects. The great success that unmanned has enjoyed in the past decade I think is testament to the potential, but we\u2019re really just at the very beginnings of that. At global hawk clearly kind of set stage for where things can go from our perspective. The ability to really see a large area and see it perceptively to deploy a variety of different censor capabilities and to the common integral part of the operational doctrine of how things get prosecuted. And I think really helps at the stage and then building on that with the Triton program for the Navy, the Triton program moving along very well which had some really good recent progress completing the initial flight test program and for looking forward getting into [RF] as we get into next year.","And then on top of that the success we\u2019ve enjoyed with the UCAS-D program and lending an unmanned aircraft on the deck of an aircraft carrier, all of those things I continue to see as real-stage setters for where this can go. And go not just domestically but internationally as we talked about on some of our calls and at the conferences in the past we\u2019re seeing a growing demand by our allies around the globe for this class of capability and we\u2019re looking forward to supporting that particularly given the support for that outcome that we\u2019re seeing from the United States government with DOD policy focusing substantially on making sure that our allies can have this class of capability and use it in a way that\u2019s highly integrated with U.S. operational doctrine.","So there is a good path forward here, the exact timing of when particular opportunities rollout is a little bit hard to predict especially if we\u2019re talking about international as it\u2019s always a little bit of uncertainty and all the steps you\u2019ve got to get through on the international side. But clearly with Global Hawk and Triton we\u2019re seeing great interest in those capabilities in Korea, Japan, Australia and other countries and we\u2019ve got the NATO AGS program underway in NATO today and that\u2019s moving ahead very nicely.","You mentioned the U-Class program there is a draft RFP that\u2019s been released for comment, that\u2019s a program where there continues to be quite a bit of discussion in both the navy and at the OSV level about the mission and its requirement so a little early to call how that one is going to go quite yet.","But I think it\u2019s just another indicator that this is an area, an arena with a lot of dynamics and a lot of opportunities. We tend to position ourselves more on the higher end of the capability and I think that serves us well in terms of being able to look ahead what our customers are going to need and invest in the near term, to make sure those capabilities are going to be present for them. There is a whole range of unmanned capability out there, everything from what you might think of as remote controlled airplanes, some people call those unmanned systems all the way to the high end of robotically flown aircraft which is really where our focus has been.","And quite frankly, I think there will be some good opportunities across that spectrum of unmanned capability as we look into the future. But we will tend to be focused more on the higher end of the capability.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","And do you see it as a steady source of growth in revenue, or is this something where we may have to wait a few years to really see it move?","Wes Bush","I think, there are clearly some near term things that are moving ahead in terms of driving some growth. I mentioned Triton going into LRIP, that's an important part of the process for us. I mentioned the international ones. So, I think it's, it won't be every single quarter, that we've got some great news, but if I think if it on an annual basis over the next few years, I'm continuing to be optimistic about the vector for this. And clearly over the longer term if you take a (inaudible) look, I think this will be transformative.","Doug Harned - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Well, thank you.","Steve Movius","Thanks Doug.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","Great. Thank you. So book-to-bill looks like it would have come in close to 1, had the E-2D contract signed in the second quarter. How are things looking for the back half of the year?","Wes Bush","So book-to-bill at E-2D had been an earlier would have been closer to 1.5 fleet. And I think E-2D is just another reminder that the long cycle businesses that we have such as AS and ES tend to get their awards in lumps. And so we have to think about that over the longer period of time.","Jim Palmer","","As well as international.","Wes Bush","","And Jim\u2019s right, international as well comes in lumps. So we don't guide on awards to book-to-bill for the year so I won't give a projection for the second half. I would just say we're pleased with how things are going.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","Great. And then if you could just rephrase or try an earlier question again about the budget trajectory. I guess if you look at even the lower budget that's out there, the sequestered budget looks like 2015 is a bottom. Obviously there is a disconnect between when there is a budget authority and when there is an outlay. But it seems that there is, things that are bit different about the cycle, there is little bit of noise from OCO and so forth.","Is there a reason to think that your DoD revenues are going to be substantially different than what we see in the budget authority?","Wes Bush","","Always hard to tell. Again you made a point and the difference between budget authority and outlay. Ultimately what this comes down to is the customers\u2019 confidence and taking a longer term view that if they start meaningful program activities they're going to be able to get then done. The last thing they want to do is get started and have a calamity on the budget side that creates great efficiency.","So there are tough decisions that our customers are going to need to make over the next couple of years as best they can given the haziness of the crystal ball right now. And we'll see where that goes. I continue to see our portfolio as very well aligned with strategic directions that our customers are moving and will need to move given what's going on around the globe whether it\u2019s unmanned, the work we do on a variety of manned aircraft systems, the work that we do in C4ISR and Cyber as well as the work we\u2019re doing in logistics and modernization; I am really pleased with how the portfolio is aligned for the longer-term, but this business is trying to call a trough I think is time (inaudible) right now.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much.","Wes Bush","Hey Howard.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Good afternoon. You\u2019ve talked about changing your investment profile or I mean frankly it\u2019s a portion of capital that you expect to have reasonable returns on going forward. Could you elaborate on some of the decisions that went into building these new facilities and are there multiple solutions to having these facilities available to you and how is it proved your competitiveness wise?","Wes Bush","Yes, thanks Howard. Any time you make a decision to invest in a new facility you can have to test it against a variety of potential outcomes. And Jim talked a little bit earlier about the scenario work that we do and that\u2019s an important part of it. The facilities that I mentioned in my remarks that ones in Florida in particular are locations where we not only have a great legacy of doing really good work, they are also increasingly centers where we\u2019re able to pull our teams together and really focus the benefit of having collocated teams to come up with new ideas and propel the current programs that we have underway.","So, I would say that none of the facilities that I have mentioned so far are speculative facilities on some future opportunity. These are activities and facilities and capabilities that will both benefit our ongoing business as well as positions incredibly well for some of the things that we see on the horizon. There is a natural benefit and we\u2019ve seen this time and again across the company, a natural benefit of pulling together these steps of capabilities with people who can bring a wide variety of discipline to address some of these increasingly complex problems.","And if I look at for example what we're doing in Melbourne today and the manned aircraft design center of excellence that we're establishing there, we've had a long-term just tremendous set of capabilities in Melbourne, but we've had other capabilities that we have scattered around the country. And this gives us an opportunity to pull some of those things together, get that people together in a more focused manner to drive some different outcomes for us. And I'm excited about what we already have going on there and what it will represent as we get that activity completed.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","So just a follow-up, not only does this sort of position you for some business, future business opportunities, it also may and I don't want to use the word lower cost, but maybe improve productivity or enhance some other, I mean that\u2019s sort where you\u2026","Wes Bush","Yes, absolutely. From an affordability perspective, it is almost always more efficient to have teams collocated in facilities that we optimize the use of those facilities as opposed to widely distribute where we have sub-optimal utilization of multiple facilities. So there is a really important affordability and competitiveness perspective that goes into this center of excellence architecture.","Jim could you?","Jim Palmer","Yes. Just our most valuable resource is our people. Allowing our people to be collocated where they can share experiences across a wide range of programs is invaluable. There is no way to really quantify the benefit that comes from being able to utilize the resources on a more effective basis across multiple programs rather than having dedicated to individual programs and then just the sharing of experiences and ideas that comes from being next to the person and seeing what they are working on and how they are approaching the problem. So yes, there is capital that\u2019s going into facilitate the sharing of the resources but it really is how do we best utilize our people resources.","Wes Bush","","Just one last perspective on this Howard and I don\u2019t want to beat it to death but as you know we are a company built of acquisitions. And so there are -- have still over time been sort of the reminiscence of doing things in different locations that sort of came along to the acquisitions. In some respect this is another sort of next natural step of really integrating the company in a tighter manner and standing back and looking operationally at how we are getting things done and asking ourselves the question is, is that really optimal and in some cases it wasn\u2019t. So we are fixing that and we think we are going to get a really good benefit from that.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Maybe just to conclude, I mean getting the money out of Jim, I recognize probably was quite a challenge. There must be a very -- there has to be a good hurdle here, is what I'm\u2026","Wes Bush","","Absolutely, the discipline remains high.","Howard Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you.","Wes Bush","","Thanks Howard.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Wes Bush","","Hello Myles.","","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","","Thanks, good afternoon guys.","Wes Bush","","How are you?","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","","Good. Wes, I was wondering if we could take a path down the cyber lane. And I want to ask the question in a way of what are the enablers for you, or any defense company to succeed in moving away from the national security tier of cyber security and more into the business or even the personal commercial tier of cyber security, so more looking at it from the blockages that exist today and the potential for those blockages to be removed in the future that would open up markets for you or companies like you.","Wes Bush","Let me give kind of a broad perspective on that. First and foremost on the cyber side, our expertise and focus continues to be on the national security side of it. That's what we have been doing well for many, many years. And we see an incredible demand for that both in the U.S. government as well as in the governments of a number of our allies around the world. As you know that there is hardly a domain that is as boarder less as cyber. So, when it comes to thinking about the needs of both our country and that of our allies, those needs really do spend in a very broad way. So, we see that as a very important dimension and really I would say focusing our efforts in that direction.","There are clearly concerns within our country around how this plays and broader realm; either we\u2019re talking about the critical infrastructure or domains beyond that and I mentioned all the way to [bookings]. And we are obviously focused on how we can help in that regard. We have a lot of work that we do with U.S. government organizations, particularly with the Department of Homeland Security that has principal responsibility for the critical infrastructure and the implications of cyber vulnerabilities to the critical infrastructure. So, we're channeling a lot of our energy and capability and to making sure we're supporting DHS as effectively as we possibly we can.","When it comes to more of the commercial side of this, over time we like other companies in our industry take a look at how we might use some of our technologies to help beyond our core emission area. In each of those areas, our history as we tend to find the right partners and figure out what makes the most sense; we are typically not a company on the forefront of a commercial side of markets. So we test that from time to time, we look at it from time to time and spend a lot of time talking to others who are in that marketplace to see if there is an avenue which we can both be helpful to generate some value.","But I would just reinforce that our company is primarily focused on the business we're in. And we see a big opportunity there. And I want to be careful that we don't get too diluted in chasing things that really aren't up our rally.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","That makes sense and I appreciate the color. Thanks Wes.","Wes Bush","","Thank you, Myles.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Rob Stallard with RBC Capital. Please proceed.","Rob Stallard - RBC Capital","Thanks very much. Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","","Hi, Rob.","Rob Stallard - RBC Capital","Quick question on information systems; Wes, you mentioned this is your -- probably your shortest cycle business. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of what sort of trends you'll be seeing there in terms of better proposal activity and those bids actually being turned into awards.","Wes Bush","Well, it\u2019s certainly our shortest cycle business. It took the quickest if you will hit when the federal budget pressures came into play and we've seen that across the industry for similar businesses. It continues to be extraordinarily competitive. Our team in information systems is doing an absolutely great job of picking up the competitions that we want to go out and pursue and being successful on them. We had a reasonable quarter in terms of awards in IS so..","Steve Movius","Actually reasonable to six months.","Wes Bush","Actually that\u2019s right, for the last six months has been quite good. So I am very satisfied with how we\u2019re positioned in that area. It is a business that I see is very important to our company for the long-term not only in its capabilities in the cyber arena that we were just speaking about with miles but also broadly in C4ISR and the work that we do in that domain or all of those domains that are embedded in C4ISR. IS is an absolute leader in our industry and those capabilities are core to what we do more broadly across the enterprise. So we\u2019re testing it out like everyone else in that side of the space, but I am very, very pleased with our competitiveness the portfolio of capabilities that we have in IS, I think is strong in terms of the breadth of the support. Like all of our businesses, we continue to assess all the pieces of it and we look hard at where those are and how we see them for the long-term. But on a relative basis, I think IS is doing well.","Steve Movius","In a dead environment they\u2019ve performed very well. ","Wes Bush","They have.","Rob Stallard - RBC Capital","","Okay. Thanks very much.","Wes Bush","Thank you Rob.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Wes Bush","Hi.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Yes. Thank you very much. Couple of questions so with the situation changing in the mid-East and Iraq and some of the other conflicts we have. Is that have any impact either positive or negative on your international sales in the near-term and as you look forward?","Wes Bush","You know, Cai I think its just a reminder that there is instability in our world and that both we in the U.S. and our allies around the globe need to be capable of dealing with those things, and does that translate into something in very near-term I really don't see that, it's hard to tell. Might there be some things that pop-up as a result of it? Yes, potentially and we do stay in very, very close contact with all of our customers around the globe to make sure that we are as responsive to as we possibly can be to their emerging needs and are looking forward for them and bringing ideas to them from a security perspective. But I would characterize what we're seeing around the globe right now as more of as having more of an impact on the (inaudible) I'm thinking about use for a more capable and robust global security environment.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Okay. And then switching to Aerospace, your margins were down I guess your EACs were down some 58 million. That is not excluding new potentials like long range striving new class. It looks like your business is switching from development to more production E2D, NATO AGM et cetera F-35. Should we on an ongoing basis expect that EACs in our sector might be coming down as you've completed the development, but then that as you move into production and as you get more form mix that maybe your inherent profitability would improve so the margins would be stable or maybe moving up excluding those two new programs I mentioned?","Wes Bush","That's great Cai. I would agree with everything that you said that could be happening. As we get, as we transition from more of a development activities into production margins generally are improving, adding more international content normally would improve margins as well. But as the major new development opportunities ahead of us well. Ultimately what happens with both the international opportunities and the new domestic development opportunities will influence what the overall aerospace margins are going to be on longer term basis.","Steve Movius","","And Cai I would add as I have said before I am delighted to have the downward pressure on our margin rates that results from taking on new development programs what that means we are being successful in competing for the new opportunities. So that\u2019s the way we are focusing as a team we see there is substantial opportunities out there and we intend to compete for them and hopefully are successful in a significant number of them.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Clearly, you do. But if we just think about the core business, excluding those two to three programs, is it fair to assume that the profitability should start to -- should improve ex- EACs, as we move forward? Because you will have more production work and you will have more foreign work?","Wes Bush","","I don\u2019t think you get ever to think about margins ex-adjustments, adjustments are a normal part of the business they occur every quarter at every company, even in production. So you there are always risk and opportunities that a program is looking to manage and control and the nature of estimating cost over a multi-year period to which our airplane programs that we received today take about three years to perform on them. So there are going to be risk and uncertainties, opportunities associated with every single one of those contracts and in some cases we are going to do better than we thought and maybe in other cases not as well. We are really working hard to make sure that our team understands first what are the risk and opportunities, so that we can manage them to reduce the risk and harvest the opportunities. But ultimately you're always going to have EAC adjustments.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Wes Bush","Thanks Cai.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Wes Bush","Hey Sam.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Hello. I wanted to go back to a comment you made about the buyback during the initial remarks, which is you went from down 8% to down 9%. And it just seems like looking at where you are at the end of the quarter in the queue, add back a lot of options, if it just stayed there, you would get pretty close to 9% for the year. So I'm just trying to think about how you're thinking about buyback. Because the second half cash flow is clearly much stronger than it was in the first half. And why wouldn't the underlying share count be going down more than the 9%, just given where you are year-to-date?","Steve Movius","Well, recognize that we are talking about the weighted average shares outstanding for the entire year. As you go through the year, every month is worth less to that average for the year. And compared to last year, we were fairly heavy in our share repurchases in the second half of last year. ","So, that is a 9% reduction off of last year's average influenced by the timing of last year's share repurchases. So at this point, our ability to get substantially greater reduction in weighted average shares for this year is relatively small.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Okay. That's fair. And if I can just follow up on the E2D multi-year that was just signed. When does that, when does work on that contract start and is it the type of thing where you do get a margin degradation kind of going back to the question just before, when you first start and then you have to work your way back up to a better margin?","Steve Movius","","Actual work has started on that multi-year contract and it will typically has a traditional U-shaped approach associated with it. So start off small as we get into the more production and deliver aircraft, again we're recognizing aircraft when recognizing revenue when aircraft are delivered here. So the revenue recognition is going to be more back and loaded.","And we're estimating costs for a multi-year contract five years we're likely to start off at a somewhat conservative margin rate and then as we go through time and realize the opportunities and minimize the risk have the opportunity to step up margins.","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. ","Wes Bush","","Hi, John.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","","Hi, thank you for taking my question and congrats to Steve on his extended responsibilities. I wanted to talk a little bit about revenue. It just seems like on a few of these segments aerospace ISPS you're tracking high versus the full year guidance. You didn't revise the revenue guidance in those segments and I am just curious if there is any kind of specific puts and takes that would highlight that might be driving a sequential downtick?","Wes Bush","","The revenue is always influenced by timing of deliveries or on the cost to cost contracts by the timing of cost and cost is many times influenced by sub-contracted deliveries. And so those kind of factors when are deliveries actually going to occur and we obviously have a schedule we can predict based on the schedule but we work hard to try to accelerate to the schedule and at times if we have supply issues or other issues, we may slip the schedule for a few days and or a month weeks whatever. We\u2019re talking about multi-billion dollar products then it take too much to affect revenues.","And then just the cost, cost as I said largely influenced again we have a pretty good sense of our cost of people, people related cost, timing of sub-contractor cost can have a significant impact on revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Got it. So you wouldn\u2019t flag anything in particular driving\u2026","Wes Bush","Not at all.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thanks guys.","Steve Movius","Hey Jasmine, this is Steve. I think we got time for one more.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Thanks guys.","Wes Bush","Hi Joe. ","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Hi. So, Wes your backlog has been ticking down a little bit still but the rate of decline seems to have abated quite a bit over the last few quarters. I was wondering if you felt the same way if you feel a little bit more a little better about the bookings environment more generally. I know you\u2019re not going to give a target you already answered that question you\u2019re not going to start giving bookings guidance but maybe just some big picture color. And then specifically you have an E2D that you already have in Q3, obviously the LRSB looking into next year, what are the other big opportunities domestic and international if you look over the next 6 months to 12 months?","Wes Bush","Yes, thanks Joe. It\u2019s one of those environments where well it\u2019s tough, it makes everybody focus a little bit more on competitiveness and I\u2019ve been pleased with the competitiveness of our enterprise. It's delightful to see that we're being successful on a wide variety of fronts and what we're taking on. But as I said in my earlier comments, I am a little bit reluctant to get out ahead of what we see going on in the budget cycle because there is just a lot of uncertainties there yet. And it's important that we all be as clear as we can about the uncertainties that we see.","We do have a number of great opportunities in front us. I spoke a little bit earlier in response to Doug\u2019s question on unmanned about some of the international opportunities we see there on the unmanned side. On international, historically electronic systems has been our primary business with about 20% to 25% depending on the year, the sales that ES being international and ES is doing very well and pursuing its international business. And I think this year there will be some place around 25% on their sales internationally.","So kind of the new story for us on international is on the Aerospace Systems side of things, both unmanned that I spoke about earlier as well as some opportunities on the manned side whether we're talking about our part of F-35 or the E-2D international opportunities. So we're excited about that. And I also mentioned a little bit earlier in response to Myles question on cyber that cyber also represents some interesting international opportunities for us.","So, we do see international is continuing to be a growing part of our business this year, as we've said before are up on international relative to where we were last year, last year was around 10% income our sales and we expect to be about 13% this year on international. Domestically, clearly there are some big and meaningful opportunities out there, one of the most important of which is long range strike. But in addition to that at AS we are looking hard at the U-class opportunity that I talked about a little bit earlier. And at ES there are a number of upcoming decisions where there is three dealer program that we may yet hear about this year or the (inaudible) program which looks to be on track for decision in the early part of next year. Those represent great opportunities for us as well.","So there is a lot that we are out there pursuing but to be successful of that we have to continue to perform on our programs that we have today. We have to continue to work on our competitiveness, some of the investments that I talked earlier in response to Howard\u2019s question, our focus on that very thing making sure that we are going to be competitive for the future and can bring forward very affordable offerings for our customers. So we continue to see a nice profile of opportunities out there.","Joe Nadol - JPMorgan","Thanks.","Wes Bush","","Thank you, Jeff.","Steve Movius","Well, this concludes the Q&A portion of the call.

I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Movius, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Stephen C. Movius","Thank you, Erin, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and year-end 2011 conference call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com.","Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially. ","On the call today, are our CEO, Wes Bush; and our CFO, Jim Palmer.","Please go to Slide 3.  At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush","Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'll start this morning by first reviewing our 2011 results, then I'll address our outlook for 2012. Fourth quarter and full year results for 2011 were outstanding. They demonstrate that our focus on performance, portfolio alignment and effective cash deployment continues to create value. Despite the challenging top line environment, we delivered strong results by nearly every measure. Segment and total operating margin, earnings per share, cash from operations and free cash flow all were higher than our 2010 results. Our team continues to build on our strong record of program execution and performance, which is essential to meeting our customer needs for affordable, high-quality products and services.","I'm very proud of how our team has come together these last several years to really drive performance improvements in our business. Achieving these improvements has required some tough decisions across our company, but these efforts have positioned us to be successful well into the future.","Turning to our results, fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations more than doubled to $2.09 per share, and for the year, earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17%, to $7.41. ","Segment operating income rose in both periods. For the quarter, segment margin rate increased 100 basis points, to 11.9%. And for 2011, segment margin rate expanded 90 basis points, to 11.6%.  Pension adjusted operating income also increased for both periods. And for 2011, our total operating margin rate, adjusted for net FAS\/CAS pension, expanded 90 basis points over 2010, to 10.9%.","Cash from operations and free cash flow were outstanding for both the quarter and the year. Before discretionary pension contributions, 2011 cash from operations totaled nearly $3 billion and free cash flow totaled $2.5 billion. For the year, conversion of earnings from continuing operations to free cash flow, before the effect of discretionary pension contributions, was 120%. Our strong cash flow and the $1.4 billion Huntington Ingalls spin-off contribution allowed us to return substantial cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In total, we spent $2.3 billion to repurchase more than 40 million shares, and at year-end, approximately $1.7 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.","We also raised our quarterly dividend by 6.4% last May, our eighth consecutive annual increase. And we paid our shareholders $543 million in dividends in 2011. Through share repurchases and dividends, we returned cash of $2.8 billion to our shareholders in 2011, 150% of our free cash flow from continuing operations. And through the Huntington Ingalls spin-off, we distributed an additional $1.8 billion of equity value to our shareholders. ","During the quarter, new business awards totaled $7.1 billion, a book-to-bill ratio of 109%. For the year, new business awards totaled $25.3 billion, a book-to-bill ratio of 96%. We ended the year with a total backlog of nearly $40 billion. ","Looking ahead, we remain focused on aligning our cost structure with our customer's affordability and efficiency objectives. Actions to date to support affordability have included consolidating business units across the enterprise, reducing overhead in our operating businesses, restructuring our debt to reduce interest expense, streamlining our corporate office and redesigning our benefit plans. ","Looking ahead for this year, we expect 2012 earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.40 to $6.70. Our 2012 guidance calls for sales of $24.7 billion to $25.4 billion, double-digit segment and total operating margin rates, cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. ","Let me focus for a moment on our top line guidance. As we discussed in our third quarter call, our 2012 sales outlook includes about a $500 million impact from our portfolio shaping and the adoption of units of delivery accounting for the F-35 LRIP 5. In addition, approximately $1 billion in revenue reduction is driven by changes in a number of our large programs, including the DWSS termination, the transition from F\/A-18 multiyear 2 to multiyear 3, the wind down of B-2 upgrade programs, lower in-theater sales and lower ICBM volume. ","Beyond that, we expect growth of about 2% in our core portfolio, which brings us up to the top end of the range. This includes continuing growth in our Cyber business and unmanned programs such as BAMS, Fire Scout and Navy UCAS. From there, our guidance considers a range of uncertainty that recognizes the potential for additional program changes resulting from budget decisions and timing issues such as potential award delays, the pace of in-theater troop drawdowns and potential continuing resolution funding for the 2013 budget.  We see this range of uncertainty representing up to about 3% of sales off the top end of the range.","Based on Secretary Panetta's outline of our nation's new strategic security direction, we believe we are well-aligned with the priority investment areas to support a smaller, more agile, technologically advanced security force. We expect about 75% of 2012 sales to come from our 4 strategic focus markets: C4ISR, Unmanned Systems, Cybersecurity and logistics, plus our business focused on manned strike aircraft.","While we were generally encouraged by the elements of the defense budget discussed by Secretary Panetta last week, including continuing support for our Global Hawk Block 40 system, the Navy's BAMS program and other Unmanned Systems such as Fire Scout and Navy UCAS, we were disappointed by the Air Force plan to cancel the Block 30 program on Global Hawk. We will be working with the Pentagon to assess alternatives to Block 30 termination that will ensure a more cost-effective transition into production for the other programs that are based on Global Hawk.","Aside from Global Hawk Block 30, the elements of the President's budget introduced last week demonstrate an increasing alignment between Northrop Grumman's core capabilities and priority areas of customer investment. Overall, it validates the portfolio shaping we've done over the last several years to increase our focus on C4ISR, Unmanned Systems and Cybersecurity, and it also supports some of our long-standing core competencies in space and of course long-range strike.","Cyber, both defensive and offensive, is one of the budget areas that is expected to increase. The DoD also expressed a strong commitment to the new bomber as a critical component of our nation's ability to project power in denied environments. The budget also protected funding for space systems, including the Space-based Infrared System and the advanced extremely high-frequency communication system. Both are programs in which we participate. And sea-based unmanned ISR systems such as our Fire Scout were specifically cited for increased investment.","We also view this military strategy as supportive of our efforts to market our products internationally so that our allies can build their capacity to more effectively play an increasing role in global security.","We expect the 2013 budget process will be long and contentious, with another continuing resolution likely as the administration and Congress balance the need for fiscal restraint with the need to protect against a wide range of national security threats.  It's unclear how the issue of sequestration will be resolved, but we certainly share Secretary Panetta's view that the budget cuts mandated as a result of the failure of the Super Committee would seriously endanger national security. ","Despite these uncertainties in our environment, our 2011 results demonstrated that we are building a high-performing portfolio that aligns well with our customers' priority investment areas. Our leading capabilities in these areas will be essential to securing our national interest for the smaller, more agile force structure and reduced defense budgets.","We have a diversified government customer base that includes substantial exposure to the Air Force, the Navy and restricted customers, and we provided a slide that depicts our estimated 2012 revenue by customer.","In conclusion, creating shareholder value in this environment means that we must continue to be absolutely focused on our key priorities, driving performance, effectively deploying our cash and optimizing our portfolio for the future. Our record these past few years demonstrates this view successfully, and I'm delighted to be working with our company's talented team to create long-term sustained value.","So now, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?","James F. Palmer","Thanks, Wes, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My comments will focus on our 2011 results and then 2012 guidance. But first, I'd like to reiterate Wes' comments relating to 2011 results, which, in my view, were outstanding. We again challenged our team to significantly step up performance, and they did, delivering higher earnings and converting those earnings into strong cash flow, all done in a challenging environment.","Turning to the Sectors on Slide 5, Aerospace Systems had a strong finish to the year with solid sales and higher operating income. AS margin rate expanded 60 basis points to 12.1% from 11.5% in the prior year through a combination of improved performance on several programs and lower purchased intangible amortization.  Now we are also doing some additional portfolio realignment in Aerospace, and as of January 1 of 2012, the Missile business, principally the ICBM program, will transfer from Aerospace Systems to Technical Services. Schedule 6 of the earnings release provides a reconciliation of historical results and results adjusted for that transfer.  So with that adjustment, AS has 2011 sales of about $10 billion. And based on what we know today regarding our programs, we would expect Aerospace 2012 revenues to range between $9.7 billion and $10 billion, with low to mid 11% margin rates. Estimated 2012 sales reflect higher volume for programs like Fire Scout and E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, which are being offset by the DWSS termination, lower F-18 volume during the multiyear 3 start up and declining volume across the number of other programs.","Electronic Systems 2011 sales declined 3%. Force reductions and overseas contingency operations reduced volume for programs like LAIRCM and the Vehicular Intercommunication Systems, or VIS. We also had lower domestic postal automation sales as we began to deemphasize that business in '11, in 2011. Operating income in 2011 increased 5% and margin rate expanded 110 basis points to 14.5%. The 2011 trends reflect improved program performance and positive adjustments for several programs in our Land & Self Protection business and our ISR business. 2011 was particularly strong due to positive performance adjustments on mature programs and programs nearing completion.","For 2012, we expect modest decline in ES revenues to a range of $6.9 billion to $7.2 billion, reflecting the deemphasis of the domestic postal automation business and continued troop drawdowns that will impact programs like VIS, the Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinder and some of our C4ISR networking for the Army. We expect ES to continue its strong performance with margin rates in the mid to high 13% range, exceeding our long-term guidance target of 13%.","Information Systems 2011 sales reflect lower volume in our -- in civil agencies and our Defense businesses, including reduced funding for existing programs and program completion. As our shortest cycle business, IS has most been impacted by our customers' cautious spending in this uncertain budget environment. Operating income, on the other hand, improved by about 1%, and IS margin rate expanded 70 basis points, to 9.7% for the year. The higher margin rate reflects improved performance in civil programs, including the impact of the County of San Diego contract sale, both of which more than offset the impact of lower sales.  For 2012, we expect IS sales of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion due to lower volume for in-theater programs like the Command Post Platform and FBCB 2 I Kits, lower civil revenues resulting from the 2011 sale of the San Diego contract, which contributed $50 million of revenue in 2011 and then just the overall budget uncertainty.  Due to their improving business mix, however, we expect IS will sustain much of the margin rate improvement that we saw in 2011, so we are forecasting a mid-9% margin rate for IS in 2012.","Moving to Technical Services, 2011 sales declined 16% but operating income increased by 5%. Margin rate expanded 160 basis points to 8%. These results reflect the impact of the reduction in the participation in the Nevada Test Site program as well as portfolio-shaping actions to reduce our exposure to base operations programs. For 2012, we expect sales of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, which reflects our continued portfolio-shaping actions, the addition of the Missile Systems business at volumes that are about $100 million less than what we saw in 2011 due to the wind down of a major hardware upgrade program in the Missile business, as well as lower KC-10 volume and lower volume for several other programs. We expect Technical Services 2000 [2012] rate will be in the mid-8% range, reflecting the improving business mix, the transfer of the Missile business from AS and just overall performance.","Now our 2012 margin rate expectations for all 4 of our business exceed our long-term target rates for each of the 4 businesses, which, as you know, are 11% for Aerospace, 13% for Electronic Systems, 9% for Information Systems and 8% for Technical Services.","Moving to Slide 6, a summary of our 2012 guidance, Wes discussed the impacts of 2012 sales and how we establish our guidance. So I'm going to move on to the balance of the chart. On a consolidated basis, we expect the sectors to generate a segment margin rate of about 11% and we expect a total operating margin rate in the mid- to high 10% range, which reflects a positive net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment of approximately $130 million and corporate unallocated expenses comparable to 2011. ","Earnings from continuing operations are expected to range between $6.40 and $6.70 per share. We expect cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, and free cash flow of $1.8 million to $2.1 billion. And again, we expect that cash flow will be weighted towards the second half of the year as has been our historical pattern.","I would note that we are currently not planning any discretionary pension contribution in 2012, and that our required 2012 pension contributions are about $65 million.  I should point out that in the fourth quarter of 2011, we made an additional $500 million discretionary pension contribution, bringing our total 2011 discretionary contributions to $1 billion.","Slide 7 provides a bridge or walk between 2011 earnings per share and our 2012 guidance. Lower sales had an impact that ranges between $0.30 and $0.45 and lower segment margin rate accounted for another 35% -- to $0.30 to $0.35 of the variance. Our net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment for 2012 is declining from a positive adjustment of $400 million in 2011 to a positive adjustment of $130 million, which impacts 2012 earnings per share by about $0.65. 2012 net FAS\/CAS adjustment is based on our plan asset returns of about 6.5% in 2011, a 75 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 5% from 5.75% last year, and a 25 basis point reduction in our expected long-term rate of return to 8.25% from the 8.5% that we previously had used.","The net pension adjustment also reflects a planned design change that reduces both FAS and CAS cost in 2012. That design change takes out significant future cost, thereby improving our competitiveness and affordability. This is an example of how we are adjusting our cost structure in response to our customer's need for affordability.  I would also point out that even with the 75 basis point reduction in the discount rate, the funded status of all of our plans at year end was 88% on a GAAP basis. ","2012 earnings per share assumes a tax rate of 34.25% about a $0.15 impact due to the expiration of the research and development tax credit. And lastly, our guidance includes continued capital deployment activities that result in a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding of about 9%. This reflects our lower share count at the beginning of the year due to the substantial 2011 share repurchases, the issuance of shares in 2012 for incentive compensation and stock option exercises and anticipated 2012 share repurchases. The lower share count positively impacts 2012 earnings per share, ranging from $0.60 to $0.65.","In summary, we continue to expect solid performance from our businesses in 2012, with margin rates that exceed our long-term targets and continued strong cash flow. So Steve, with that introduction, I think we're ready for some Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Jim. Erin, we are ready to start the Q&A process.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm interested in Information Systems, and in the quarter, your backlog was down about 18%. And could you talk about where you're seeing the decline in the backlog across Defense Systems, Intelligence Systems and Civil? And where you think that's going to go longer-term? And I ask that specifically because with the strong position in Cyber and some other priority areas, one might expect some strength there. But can you talk about the subsegment trends?","James F. Palmer","Doug, the reduction that you're seeing in Information Systems backlog is principally due to the adjustment we made across the portfolio, but largely concentrated in Information Systems around our future expectation for amounts remaining on contract to be converted into future sales. And so, we went through a process this year that looked at amounts that were put under contract, for which the period of performance had largely expired and there'd been very little activity. So on one hand, there was amounts remaining on backlog, but it just felt like, to us, that in the current environment they may not be converted in the future sales. And so we made a -- an adjustment, or a reserve, against some of that backlog to reflect our view that some of that may not be realized as future sales. So that's the largest adjustment.","Wesley G. Bush","Let me give you a little bit of flavor, Doug, too, by some of the business areas. If you just look at our progress over last year, in terms of awards in the business, we're doing quite well. And the 3 components that you mentioned, Civil, Defense and Intel, civil's about 20% of the top line, defense is about 50% and Intel is about 30%, just very rough numbers for the makeup of the business. And as you might imagine, we are seeing some pressure on the Defense side in particular, and Jim mentioned that in his commentary with some of the changes relative to the needs in theater, the defense area is where the majority of that work has been performed for in-theater support. But when we strip that piece of it away, your earlier comment about our position on Cyber, which plays through actually all 3 of those areas, puts us in a place where we think that this business is quite well-positioned for the future. So we're not overly wringing our hands around either the component makeup of the business or how we're doing in the business calendar. But Jim's point was a very important one, about if you just look at that total backlog number, it reflects a very specific set of decisions we made this year in terms of our convention for reporting the backlog.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And that decision -- but that decision is essentially made to reflect some of the trends that are -- that I would say are weaker going forward, I assume.","Wesley G. Bush","I know this was largely a thought process. There's a lot of different conventions for reporting backlog that we see in our industry. There are those who report their future expectations towards the awarded on task orders for ID\/IQs for which they've qualified. We don't do that. There is -- there are sort of a standard convention for one's you've captured an award, it goes into backlog and stays there unless terminated or other action is taken. We've gone through, I think a really rigorous process of going through a scrub, that Jim mentioned that we think is appropriate given the environment, but most of that cleanup was not necessarily a reflection of just this past year's decision.","James F. Palmer","Or even 2010.","Wesley G. Bush","That's right. It's more of a look long-term look back on the clean up that we felt was appropriate in light of all of the pressures that we see our customers facing. So it would be inappropriate to read that as an indicator of the success of the business in either capturing awards or at least over the last couple of years, and fulfilling those awards.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well then, is there a point here from what you described about declines in certain areas such as those related to current overseas operations? You see declines in certain areas, you see growth in others. Is there a point where you're really seeing the transition where you expect this will turn around in terms of a top line trend?","Wesley G. Bush","It's hard to call that over the longer term. We're guiding for this year. I think we're going to learn a lot by looking at the details of the President's budget that's due out here over the next couple of weeks, the details of the '13 budget, to see how that all parses out into the pieces. But I wouldn't want to be in a spot of trying to call it in terms of where that begins to turn around. Obviously, a big factor in that will be the transition of the overseas deployments. And how that actually plays out, I would say there's still some uncertainty surrounding that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I want to sort of ask one -- make one comment and then ask a question that's probably totally fair, Wes. The comment first is I like the presentation that Jim does with respect to pension contributions after cash -- after taxes, rather. Most people don't do that, so I think that's a very good and fair and balanced true-up approach, and I appreciate that.","Wesley G. Bush","That's good.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The other question, or the question is, we measure kind of performance on earnings per share, and you're going to have down results for this upcoming year. And while I recognize, if we look at the free cash flow yield for this upcoming year, it's, call it, 13%, give or take a little bit. So on one measure, great number going forward. On another measure, it's not really value-creating. How do you square that, Wes, and how do you think a little bit longer term on this challenge of growing earnings?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, clearly there's a couple of components to it, and I think it's a very fair question, Howard. The pressures on the top line are the reality. That's the budget environment that we're in. It is imperative on us to make sure that our portfolio is very well-aligned as best we possibly can. And part of the reason for that extra chart that we included in the presentation today, the little pie chart, was to help you, help everyone, make their own assessment of how well they think that is aligned. We think it's a good alignment, but we wanted to provide a little bit more detail in the way we see our portfolio. And everyone can certainly make their own assessment of that. So focusing on the alignment to really manage our way through the budget pressures is very important. But the other really big lever, I would point out, too, there are very big levers in this process, are how well we're actually executing on the business. And we look at that, I think most perceptively in terms of margin rate and cash conversion. The margin rates are going very well. We've made a lot of progress in our company these last several years, and delivering more effectively on the opportunity that's inherent in the contracts. That goes to risk management, that goes just good old downright program execution and it also goes to cost management. And those are all areas that we've taken on very aggressively, and we are seeing the benefits translate into EPS. And then I mentioned, of course, free cash flow, converting earnings into cash. If you can't do that, then it's sort of empty to start with. And then, on the backside of that, what you actually do with a cash. So when we think about value creation, and because I think that was inherently the essence of your question, from my perspective, it means getting the best alignment with where things are going so that we can manage our way through the budget pressures, it means executing very, very effectively so that we're generating good earnings, and we're converting those earnings into good cash, and that means being very smart about what we're doing with that cash. That's the way we're thinking about the value equation in our company.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So a question about pensions, so you have contributions of $65 million required, and yet kind of by what you said, it looks like you're underfunded by about $2.8 billion, and the government's writing you checks for $500 million. So essentially, pension is the cash flow plus on a pretax basis of over $400 million. So is that sustainable cash flow? I mean, if we look to the future, are you going to have to put more money in either this year in the future, or is the CAS going to come down so that your free cash flow that you're talking about this year in a steady-state environment is going to erode?","James F. Palmer","Actually, Cai, good questions. Frankly, my view would be over the foreseeable future, CAS costs are actually going to go up, largely because CAS amortizes what we all remember as the significant negative investment performance in 2008 over 15 years. So we're just beginning to -- on the front end of that amortization process, CAS costs likely are going up. You have the benefit of CAS harmonization that it will be stepped in over the next 5 years as well. So on a look-forward basis, I think we all would see CAS costs large largely going up now, to the extent that we have really great investment performance over the next couple of years. Again, that would be amortized over that 15-year period on a go-forward basis. So those are all offsets. I do think that, as I said, CAS costs go up over the next few years, looking forward. You are correct that if we don't make any voluntary contributions this year, we do have a cash flow benefit that comes from essentially recognizing the past actions we've taken to fund the plant -- plan ourselves, ahead of when we got reimbursed for the CAS cost.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then does that mean in the future, your -- if CAS is going up, your cash contributions also will have to go up, or how will that work?","James F. Palmer","That -- so as I think many of you know, we have 3 sets of different rules that we have to deal with. And essentially, cash contributions are governed by the ERISA rules and PTA funding. And they -- the cash contributions required there are a function of how well-funded you are. And again, at our 88% funding on a GAAP basis on an ERISA-funded basis we're close to 100%. In fact, you really have to look at every plan itself, but when we do that, our ERISA funding for purposes of cash contributions, the lowest funded plan is probably in the 95% range and some of them are well over 100%. But on an aggregate basis, just about 100% funded. So, and again, that ERISA funding is a function of how well-funded you are under that ERISA determination with a big factor being interest rates and they use a different set of interest rates that we need to use for FAS purposes or for CAS purposes. So I know that's a long-winded answer, but different set of rules, but it is affected by how well-funded your plans are to begin with. So we have a huge step up in that regard, and then interest rates pay -- play a factor as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jim, on the segment margins, you indicated that in each of the segments, they're expected to run this year at slightly above your projected long-term average. And I was wondering if you could maybe characterize at a high-level why you think you're going to be able to sustain that this year. It is down about 60 basis points off of a great performance in 2011, but maybe something around mix, is the mix more favorable? And also, I would imagine that you are probably spending some money below -- in there somewhere around restructuring, given the sales declines. And that's probably negatively impacting you. So some color there would be helpful.","James F. Palmer","Yes, well, we are -- it's true, Joe, that we're spending some money on restructuring. We try to manage our overall overhead rates to accommodate that. But it's also very important to get out in front of those activities so that you don't have a negative impact on your programs. And so there's a delicate balance there. It is costing us some in terms of the efforts that we need to undertake to restructure. And in -- on terms of just margin rates overall, we do have some programs transitioning from one to another. I'll point to F-18 multiyear 2 to multiyear 3. So, a mature program, mature finishing production, to although a mature product on the front end of the new development or new production of the multiyear 3 contract. So we have instances like that across the board. And as I pointed out in my prepared comments, the Electronic Systems guys had just a fabulous year in 2011. Margin rates well above what I view as the target for that industry. I do expect that they're going to maintain some of that momentum, but I don't think they can maintain all of that momentum that we saw in 2011. So that's why you see their margin rates essentially declining from, let's call it around 14.5% in 2011 to the mid-13s that we guided to for our mid to high 13s that we guided to for 2012.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And from a mix standpoint, just thinking through what one more level maybe, you're cutting it certainly differently. From a mix standpoint, would you characterize domestic versus international as consistent with the long-term trend and then also maybe fixed price versus cost plus or mature versus R&D-oriented?","James F. Palmer","I don't know, Joe, that there's a significant shift in the overall mix. Our fixed-price content of the aggregate portfolio on a year-over-year basis. So I think it is much more, as we're seeing, some decline in the revenue base. Programs that are nearing completion, that are mature, having reduced volume on a go-forward basis. And so that's reflected in some reduction in margin rates. Essentially you have to absorb more cost with a lower volume on the remaining programs.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe to go back to Cai's question for a second, Jim, on pension and then we'll move over to the operations. On the funding side, ERISA, 100% today, but I think that's more of an ABO basis. As you look out, when did the required contribution start to more tie back to the 88% funded status? So is it '14, is it '15? And are those sizes kind of in the $300 million to $500 million range?","James F. Palmer","Yes, all of -- you're asking for this huge crystal ball that has perfect clarity. So let me give you a perfect clarity answer. Obviously, it's going to depend on investment earnings in '12 and '13. It's going to depend on interest rates in '12 and '13. But if I were able to hold all of everything constant and achieve my long-term investment rate of return, I would be looking at contributions, required contributions in the 2013 timeframe of around $300 million.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great, that's -- I think that clarifies it. And then on the operations, I think the NRO surprisingly publicly stated a couple of weeks ago they were going to award the follow-on imaging satellite sole source to Lockheed this year. I think you guys are payload for that. I'm curious, 2 things. One is, would that be a booking sizable in 2012 and second, would be a source of growth in '13 or beyond?","Wesley G. Bush","Myles, I think we will refer you to the NRO to get the best response to that question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Doug touched on the backlog decline in IS, and you went through that in detail. But from a higher level, could you talk about the 12% decline year on year in total backlog and the unfunded piece of that is fairly significant. And you're -- and now your total backlog, both funded and unfunded as a ratio of sales has come down quite significantly over the last few years. So is this timing-related or do we have a -- is there a bookings issue coming?","James F. Palmer","I don't think so, Rob. So let me try to review again what went on in backlog. First, as Wes said in his comments, $25.3 billion of awards this year, roughly equal to sales. Let's start there. So we did have some backlog adjustments. We had this reserve that I talked about that aggregated about $3 billion across the portfolio, but largely in IS. In addition to that, we did have a restructuring of the NPOESS contract and another a couple of other space contracts where we took $1.5 billion of backlog out of backlog at the beginning of the year to reflect the cancellation of the NPOESS contract and then some change in some space programs. If you want, you can go back and look, and as I recall in the second quarter when we disclosed that. And then in the first quarter last year, with the decision to reduce our participation in the Nevada Test Site joint venture, we took the backlog that was -- because we're no longer consolidating sales, we no longer consolidate the backlog, and we took $1.7 billion out of the backlog to reflect that. Those are the 3 principal unusual activities, if you want to call it that, that occurred in backlog during the year.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is there a way for you, Jim, to quantify the duration of the backlog today versus what it used to be?","James F. Palmer","The best way that I would do it is to take each of the amounts for the 4 sectors and divide by revenues, and that is kind of a rough approximation. Obviously, the IS, the shorter cycle business, has a lower backlog to sales ratio than any of the other segments of the business.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just one other thing, we've heard from some of your peers on foreign military sales orders being pulled forward into the fourth quarter here and out of Q1. Anything there for you in that sense?","James F. Palmer","I think the foreign market is an opportunity for us on a go-forward basis. I think the Secretary's comments are encouraging. Obviously, we have to work through export control issues. But there is a demand or interest in a number of our products across the portfolio. And just logically, as U.S. defense budgets are constrained, it would seem that we would want to rely on our allies to do what we may have done in the past. So I think that is ultimately an opportunity for us in a go-forward basis.","Wesley G. Bush","All right, Rob, you were asking about some pull forwards out of potentially this quarter into the last quarter of last year. Is that --","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Only because we've seen it elsewhere.","Wesley G. Bush","I -- we didn't -- we did not see anything unusual in that regard in our company.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and then just lastly, Jim, I might've missed this because I joined the call late, but in terms of your buyback for '12 which was like about 8%, something like that, rough number, what's the cadence on that? How are you assuming that goes forward?","James F. Palmer","Generally spread throughout the year, consistent with largely our historical practice. So I wouldn't say it's exactly ratable through the year but spread throughout the year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jim, can I go back to pension one more time, and can you talk a little bit about what that design change means?","James F. Palmer","Yes.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Did you change the benefits? What did that mean?","James F. Palmer","We essentially put a cap on what is called final average earnings, for the people who participated or partly participates in the defined benefit plan so that after a point in time, final average earnings will not continue to grow, which essentially reduces the liability on a long-term basis, reduces cost starting in 2012 and going forward. Rather, it was important that we do that. We got a significant cost benefit out of it and essentially got our plans into what we thought was current market conditions.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Does that mean there's a liability is peaking now as well?","James F. Palmer","The liability is dramatically affected as we saw by the change in discount rates. So if you tell me what discount rates are going to be, then I guess I can tell you whether it's peaked or not.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, all right, that's fair. And then separately, can you just talk a little about Global Hawk, Wes? You mentioned about the Block 30 termination. Can you just talk about how the Block 30 to 40 transitions? And obviously, I'm not expecting you to give me total Global Hawk sales, but can you just talk about directionally in percentages, how it looked from '10 to '11, then '11 to '12 as we're seeing some of those pieces?","Wesley G. Bush","Well, let me just say in terms of this transition, that's something that we're -- we are beginning the discussions with our customer community around. There's an important set of transitions from the production work we're doing on Block 30, certainly with Block 40, but also in the BAMS. And it would not be appropriate for me to get out in front of those discussions that we're having with our customer in that regard. I would say, naturally, that we were, as I said in my comments earlier, we were disappointed with the plan on Block 30, but we were also at the same time, very, very pleased with the very strong statement of support that we got from the Department on BAMS, and of course Block 40 and a number of our other unmanned missions, including Fire Scout. So I don't want to get out ahead of exactly how this will play out. We want to obviously work with the Department to make this work the right way. With respect to the numbers, I would just simply say that we spent some time thinking about the range of outcomes and that's included in the range of the guidance that we provided.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jim, at Aerospace Systems, a lot of moving pieces there in terms of F-35 and the transition of the Missiles business. Can you just walk through all the different moving pieces and roughly how much they each account for? And then on F-35, just an update in terms of exactly where you stand, what's under contract at this point and what LRIP you're delivering on at this point?","James F. Palmer","So, let me grab a couple of things here, David. We had 10.1, 10.4 for revenues this year. The Missile business takes us down, the transition of that business takes us down to about 10, as I've said in my comments. And then as we look at some of the other parts of the business that are moving around, we saw some growth in Fire Scout and E-2D. The DWSS contract termination reduces revenues by about $200 million. And the lower volume on F-18 is probably about another $150 million or so. So all of those and then consideration, as Wes said, to what may happen or when something may happen on Global Hawk Block 30 allowed us to get to our thoughts around $9.7 billion to $10 billion of sales guidance for 2012. But those are the big pieces that moved from year to year.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And on F-35 units of delivery, how much is that impact?","James F. Palmer","It's about $100 million.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And as a follow-up, on the share repurchase, the 8% assumption, or the 8% down in terms of the assumption on share count, it doesn't look like, based on where you are at the end of the fourth quarter. It doesn't look like you're actually assuming that much more additional in terms of share repurchase for 2012.","James F. Palmer","Well, actually, I said 9%. I guess someone else had said 8%.  And as I said in my prepared comments, you start at the beginning share counts. We're going to issue some shares here through stock incentive plans at the end of February. We anticipate, as been the historical practice, that we'll have stock options that are exercised during the year, and then we're going to spend some money during the year as well to buy back shares. You got to remember that the share count is based on a weighted average share count. So you spend a dollar in January, it counts as, let's say if you bought it -- spend $1 that was 1 share. That counts as 1 share. If you spend that dollar in December, it counts as $1.12 for this weighted average share count. So the timing of when you spend the money when you buy shares back is really important to its overall impact on the weighted average shares outstanding for the year. And as I said to an earlier comment, my assumption is that we spend the dollars not exactly ratable but generally spread throughout the year. So those are the moving parts that get us to an -- about an overall 9% decline in weighted average shares.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, I was wondering, first of all, if you could give us a number for what your OCO, or operations exposure, was in 2011, and where you see that trending in '12.","James F. Palmer","We had, hard to quantify, but as we go and look at -- try to find all the pieces, we think it's about 3% of sales.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And where is that heading in '12? Because you mentioned that there's a headwind in a couple of areas.","James F. Palmer","Well, we see a couple of hundred million dollars down.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then secondly, there's a lot of goodwill on the balance sheet. I was wondering if you've done a year end sort of impairment review on that valuation and how close some of the goodwill items were to a write-down.","James F. Palmer","Obviously, we have to do that every year. It's part of the normal procedures. We have, let's call it, a little bit over $12 billion. And if you look at the financials, the largest part of that goodwill is in the Information Services business. And so we do take a good hard look at all of our assumptions around that. We're comfortable that there's not an impairment as of the end of the year. We'll have to watch what happens in terms of the future revenues and all of that associated with the overall budget, what it means to each of the businesses. But as I said, with the Information Services having the largest piece of the goodwill, if there's any area that might have any exposure, it would likely be in that area. All right?","Stephen C. Movius","Erin, I think we have enough time for one more.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wanted to ask the capital deployment question and get some updated thoughts from you there. Obviously, you've got a pretty balanced approach up to this point between dividends and share repurchases. I'm just curious what you think going forward clearly on the acquisition front. I don't mean to necessarily get into the details about where you want to make acquisitions, but just the importance of acquisitions going forward.","Wesley G. Bush","Now, Jason, in terms of -- broadly on thinking about acquisitions, for us it always comes down to the value creation equation. I said a number of times and I continue to say it, we really like our portfolio. and I don't feel like we have large gaping holes that we got to rush out and deal with. So it allows us to be very thoughtful, very disciplined in how we think about acquisitions. At the same time, we do engage in looking at a wide angle of alternatives we think we have an obligation, certainly to our shareholders, for the long-term to be active in our thought process and active portfolio managers. Yes, but ultimately, it comes down to value creation. And I will tell you that of late as we've looked at what's going on in the M&A space, there are some transactions out there that would be hard for us to solve the equation on value creation if we were looking at it ourselves. So we have biased our cash deployment towards the areas that we talked about, the share repurchase and dividend. And I think that's been serving us quite well. But we're going to continue to look, and the market obviously will have some ebbs and flows and we will be effective assessors of what those opportunities will be.","Stephen C. Movius","Thank you very much. Now that concludes our call. Wes has a couple of follow-up comments to close, and then I'm obviously available for additional questions.","Wesley G. Bush","Now let me just wrap up with a few thoughts. I think it's helpful, given the dynamics of the environment we're in, to stress some fundamentals. When I think about our company, and I mentioned this during my remarks and in response to a couple of questions. I think there are 3 things that are really critical. First, in a time of increasing pressure in our top line, it's even more important that our businesses are delivering on profitability in cash conversion across all of our operations, and I think we've demonstrated some nice improvements over the last few years. It shows that this focus is paying off for us. And secondly, the large amount of capital that's returning, that we are returning to our shareholders demonstrates our focus on delivering shareholder value. And that is the way that we are thinking about the overall value equation in our company. And thirdly, as we've talked about, a fair amount of portfolio shaping is going to continue to be key in this emerging environment, making sure that we're well aligned for the future. When I think about it a little bit more broadly and look at the world around us right now, it's clear that our nation's military strategy is going to continue to depend both on the extraordinary capability of our servicemen and women, as well as our ability to ensure absolute technological superiority. And the strategy recognizes that we will have to address a range of threats to our nation's security. We think we're well-positioned to deliver that technological superiority to support our nation and our allies. We expect a lot of turmoil in the budget environment in front of us, especially over the course of this year. But I think it's going to be really important as we go through that to keep these fundamentals in focus.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. My name is Katelyn and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Steve Movius, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Movius, please proceed.","Steve Movius","Thanks, Katelyn, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's third quarter 2014 conference call.

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings.

You can access our updated company overview and our sector overviews on the Investor Relations page at www.northropgrumman.com.","On the call today are Wes Bush, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Jim Palmer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wes Bush","All right. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our teams focus on execution continues to deliver strong performance as demonstrated by this quarter\u2019s earnings, cash flows and backlog expansion. Earnings per share increased 6% to $2.26. In addition to strong operating performance, we have two items that affected results in the quarter.","Third quarter EPS was reduced by $0.30 to reflect passage of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. We also realized $75 million for settlements of certain legal claims, which increased EPS by $0.23. Jim will provide more detail on these items later in the call, but together they reduced third quarter earnings per share by $0.07.","Based on our year-to-date results, we\u2019re increasing our EPS guidance to a range of $9.40 to $9.50 from our prior range of $9.15 to $9.35. This is an increase of approximately 13% over 2013 EPS. We\u2019re also increasing our 2014 sales guidance to approximately 23.8 billion, the high end of our prior range. Growth in our international business continues to partially offset the impact of domestic budget pressures.","Cash from operations totaled 933 million for the quarter. Free cash flow totaled 824 million and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $3.4 billion. Based on these results, we remain comfortable with our free cash flow guidance of 1.7 billion to 2 billion for the year.","As you\u2019re aware, the fourth quarter is typically our strongest in terms of cash collections. We\u2019re particularly pleased to report that total backlog increased 8% from 35.6 billion at the end of the second quarter to 38.5 billion. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 150% and book-to-bill for the nine months was 107%.","Third quarter bookings included a $3.6 billion contract for 25 E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft, which was the primary driver of the strong book-to-bill. We also received a $354 million award for three additional Global Hawks and a $422 million contract for the sensor payloads for the fifth and sixth SBIR satellites. We were recently awarded another 300 million for Global Hawk contractor logistic support.","Third quarter book-to-bill was 200% at Aerospace Systems reflecting the large E-2D award, 122% at Electronic Systems, 109% at Information Systems and 87% at Technical Services. While we are encouraged by this quarter\u2019s overall trend, we\u2019ve recognized that our customers are now working under a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2015 and sequestration can be triggered again in fiscal year 2016.","Turning to cash deployment, we repurchased 6 million shares for 753 million bringing year-to-date repurchases to nearly 17 million at a cost of $2.1 billion. Over the last six quarters, we bought back 37.7 million share or more than 60% toward our goal of returning 60 million shares by the end of 2015 market conditions permitting.","We take a long-term view of the company\u2019s value and continue to view share repurchases in combination with competitive dividend as an effective way to deploy our cash and to create shareholder value. We continue to have a robust set of domestic and international opportunities across the company for our unmanned and manned platforms and in our C4ISR, cyber and logistics and modernization domains.","Global Hawk and Triton have attractive strong international interest. We\u2019re currently negotiating a Global Hawk sale to Korea and the technical progress we\u2019ve made on Triton including our second plane\u2019s successful completion of its first flight bodes well for future international sales for that system.","In the international arena, we expect significant growth in the F-35 program and the E-2D also has potential for international sales. There are important domestic opportunities as well such as long-range strike and CIRCM. When Congress returns after the elections and fiscal year 2015 budget negotiations resume, we believe our programs will continue to be well supported.","In light of growing global security challenges, it\u2019s especially critical that our nation focuses on maintaining our technological leadership and our military superiority. We would encourage Congress to find a way to avoid sequestration in fiscal year 2016. Our Pentagon leadership must be able to strategically deploy its increasingly limited resources without the limitations of sequestration.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Jim?","James F. Palmer","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My comments will cover this quarter\u2019s results and I\u2019ll also discuss our updated 2014 guidance and provide a first look at 2015 pension items. But first I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to our team for their continued focus on execution.","As Wes mentioned, our third quarter EPS of $2.26 included two items that collectively reduced EPS by $0.07. Before these items, third quarter EPS would have been $2.33 or 9% higher than last year\u2019s third quarter due to strong operating performance and share repurchases.","But first on those two items was the passage of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act in August. The Act extended higher discount rates instituted when the prior bill known as MAP-21 was originally passed in 2012. The higher rates were retroactive to January 1 of this year and are a significant factor in determining CAS amortization pension expense.","The MAP-21 extension impacted third quarter results in two ways. First, we recognized $132 million year-to-date reduction in expected 2014 CAS pension expense, which drove an $81 million decline in third quarter net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment. This is a cumulative amount representing nine months reduction in expected CAS expense.","The large change is driven by the improvement in the funding status of our pension plans on a CAS basis due to the higher discount rates. Our largest plan essentially became fully funded with no 2014 CAS costs as a result of MAP-21 extension. We don\u2019t expect the situation will repeat itself in 2015 due to the expected increase in mortality assumptions.","Secondly, the $132 million reduced CAS pension expenses charge to our contracts thereby increasing our segment operating margin rate by a rate of segment operating margin dollars by $37 million. Second operating margin didn\u2019t increase by the full 132 million reduction since we share cross savings with our customers on the majority of our contracts. So only a portion of the savings flowed through to segment operating margin.","The net impact of these two items related to the MAP-21 extension was a $95 million pre-tax reduction to operating income and a $62 million decrease in net earnings or $0.30 per share reduction in EPS. Also, during the quarter, we realized $75 million for settlements of certain legal claims related to the use of company\u2019s intellectual property and a terminated program. This benefited Aerospace Systems sales and operating income and improved third quarter earnings by $0.23 per share.","So turning to the sector results, Aerospace Systems third quarter sales increased by 2%. The increase was driven by the $75 million realized for the settlements. Excluding the settlements, AS sales were slightly lower for the quarter and reflect lower volume for manned military aircraft and comparable sales for our unmanned and space programs. Manned military aircraft had lower volumes for programs like B-2, Joint STARS and the F\/A-18. Those declines were partially offset by higher sales for the E-2D program.","AS operating income increased 22% and operating margin rate rose to 15.8% principally due to the settlements. AS also benefited from increased margins and lower CAS costs. And excluding those two items, AS margin rate would have been 12.7% for the quarter. We now expect AS 2014 sales will reach approximately $10 billion essentially matching last year\u2019s top line with an operating margin rate in the low 13% range versus our prior guidance of 12%.","Electronic Systems third quarter sales declined 2% due to lower deliveries for combat avionics and infrared countermeasures programs partially offset by increases in space, marine and undersea programs. ES operating income was comparable to the prior year and they experienced a 40 basis point improvement to operating margin rate to get to 15.8%. The higher margin rate includes performance improvements as well as the benefit of additional margin resulting from lower CAS costs related to the MAP-21 extension. For the year, we expect ES sales of approximately $6.9 billion and we now expect an ES operating margin rate of approximately 16% for the year.","Information Systems third quarter sales declined by 7%. Lower government funding levels and in-theater troop dropdowns continue to impact sales particularly for our command and control programs. Operating income at IS declined in line with sales and IS continued very strong operating margin rate. For the year, we expect IS sales of approximately $6.2 billion at the high end of our prior guidance range, for the margin rate in the high 9% range, which is unchanged from our prior guidance.","Moving to Technical Services, third quarter sales declined due to ramp-downs in the ICBM and Combined Tactical Training Range programs and was partially offset by higher international sales. For the year, we are now increasing sales guidance to approximately $2.8 billion for TS versus our prior guidance of $2.7 billion. And we\u2019re increasing our operating margin rate guidance to the low 9% range.","On a consolidated basis, our third quarter segment operating margin rate was 14%. But if I adjust sales and operating income for the settlements and the additional margin resulting from the lower CAS costs due to MAP-21 extension, our third quarter segment operating margin rate would have been 12.3%, which is consistent with the trends that we had in the first half of the year and comparable to that of last year.","Based on year-to-date results and our updated CAS expectations, 2014 segment operating margin rate should be in the high 12% range and with higher segment operating income and our updated net FAS\/CAS pension adjusted, our total operating margin rate should be in the low 13% range. We now expect a slightly lower tax rate of approximately 30.75%, down from our prior estimate of 31.5%. And finally I would also note that we continue to expect a 9% decline in our weighted average diluted share count for the year.","Turning to cash from operations, we generated $933 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow for the third quarter was $824 million. And consistent with our historical pattern, we anticipate strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date capital spending increased by approximately $100 million and we continue to expect capital spending of approximately $600 million for the year. As Wes said, we are maintaining our guidance for cash from operations of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion and for free cash flow at $1.7 billion to $2 billion, despite the negative impact of the MAP-21 extension.","Before we begin Q&A, I want to update 2014 pension guidance and discuss 2015 pension and all of its elements; CAS, FAS and cash. So due to MAP-21 extension, we now expect that our 2014 CAS pension expense will be approximately $380 million versus our prior estimate of approximately $560 million or a reduction of $180 million for the year. This gives us then an updated estimate of our net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment of $260 million versus our prior estimate of $440 million.","Looking ahead, the extension of MAP-21 results in higher future CAS amortization discount rates, which will likely impact our CAS pension expense for a number of years. We estimate that the cumulative increase in CAS amortization discount rates will be about 100 basis points over the next couple of years. You\u2019ll recall then in our January conference call, we expected CAS amortization would increase our CAS recoveries by $200 million to $225 million each year for 2015 and 2016. Those estimates will now be impacted by both the higher discount rates in the MAP-21 extension as well as the expected update from mortality assumptions.","I\u2019ll remind you though last quarter we said that beginning in 2015, we expect that the updated mortality assumptions will increase our FAS expense by approximately $50 million and CAS expense by approximately $40 million for every 100 basis point increase in our pension benefit liability. We currently expect an increase in our pension liability of approximately 6% pending finalization of the society of actuary study later this year. The CAS impacts from the higher discount rates and updated mortality assumptions will be largely offsetting over the next few years. But as MAP-21 extension wears away over time, the mortality impact will be the principal driver of future CAS expense.","So, if I hold all other assumptions constant, we would now expect our CAS expense to be approximately 700 million in 2015 and approximately 800 million in 2016. Those estimates incorporate the higher CAS amortization discount rates, updated mortality assumptions and the estimates of the resulting funding status of the plans under CAS. These estimates compared with our prior estimates are approximately 750 million for 2015 and approximately 950 million in 2016.","Now, I\u2019m going to spend a few minutes discussing the impacts to FAS, so by updating for the expected changes in mortality assumptions as well as for discount rates, we would now expect FAS expense of approximately $550 million for 2015 and approximately $500 million for 2016 versus our prior estimates of approximately $100 million each for those years. Those amounts assume a discount rate in the 4.25% range versus the 2014 current rate of 4.99%.","As I think many of you know, rates have obviously been very volatile particularly recently and that assumption on interest rates will likely change based on where we are at year end. Other than the change to mortality and year-end discount debt rate, all other assumptions such as investment returns are held constant in those estimates. I will point out that through the end of last week, we estimate that our planned investment returns were approximately 7% versus our long-term rate of return assumption of 8%. As all of you know, we will further define our future year estimates on our year-end conference call when we have actual 2014 planned investment returns as well as year-end discount rates.","Just to remind everyone, a 25 basis point change in our discount rate changes 2015 FAS pension expense by a net amount of $60 million and 100 basis point change in our actual planned investment returns compared to our 8% long-term rate of return assumption changes 2015 FAS pension expense by $45 million. Lastly, looking at cash impacts, we don\u2019t expect that the updated mortality assumptions or higher discount rates required to be used for CAS and for funding to impact our near-term funding requirements. Over the next couple of years, we continue to expect minimal required funding for our plans.","So Steve, with that, I think we\u2019re ready for Q&A.","Steve Movius","Thanks, Jim. As a courtesy, we ask each participant to limit themselves to a single one-part question, so we can hopefully get through the queue. Katelyn, we\u2019re ready for Q&A","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks so much. Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","Hi, Bob.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks for the pension stuff, Jim. I know you love that.","James F. Palmer","All right.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","On the cash front, this might be a question [Wes] (ph), do the changes in the CAS recovery have any implication for your cash deployment plans going forward, particularly on the buyback?","Wes Bush","No, we don\u2019t see any changes in our plans based on anything that we\u2019re seeing in CAS at this point.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","On the \u2013 sorry, continue.","James F. Palmer","I would just point out that the numbers I just gave you for CAS recoveries compared to our prior estimates are up a few $100 million over a three-year period, so not --","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, not a lot of impact.","James F. Palmer","Yes.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets","And just to follow up on the cash front, Wes, are you seeing any change out there in the M&A market given that we now have a bit of stability in the DoD base budget. Are you starting to see more interest in Defense acquisitions?","Wes Bush","I would say that there continues to be a fair amount of interest in the technology side of the space, just everyone wanting to make sure that collectively we\u2019re thinking ahead and highly engaged on the technology end of it. But do I see a big uptick relative to kind of where we\u2019ve been for a bit of time? Not on the near horizon do I see that. As always, we continue to be active and taking a look at things that are out there. I haven\u2019t of late seen very much that really triggered us to be that engaged in it, but we\u2019re going to continue to look just as we always have. We think it\u2019s an important part of our overall strategic management process to be engaged in that aspect of development.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Good morning.","Wes Bush","Hi, Doug.","James F. Palmer","Hi, Doug.","Douglas Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Your Electronic Systems backlog has come up a lot, I mean you\u2019re above $10 billion there and that\u2019s the highest that you\u2019ve seen in quite some time. Could you talk about what\u2019s been driving that higher backlog and does that suggest to you some growth going forward over the next few years?","James F. Palmer","Yes, Doug, you\u2019re right. I think we had an all-time high in our Electronic Systems backlog for our number of multiyear deals that affected the backlog as well as some of our marine programs. As you know, we had a multiyear deal on E-2D aerospace. Electronic Systems also has some activities on that program. So all of those are part of that impact to the backlog.","Wes Bush","Doug, it\u2019s Wes. I\u2019d just add that across the board, the business continues to do well with Electronics. We have such a wider array of capability there that continues to be in demand both domestically and internationally. You may recall that Electronic Systems has our biggest fraction of international sales running around 25% or so this year. So it\u2019s a fairly broad, just outstanding performance by the team at ES.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Wes Bush","Hi, Noah.","James F. Palmer","Hi, Noah. How are you?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Good. How are you?","James F. Palmer","All right.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Terrific. Always good after you read off that much pension material.","James F. Palmer","Yes, I live for it.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Wes, you mentioned talking to those in Congress about the potential for more changes to sequestration. Just big picture on that, can you provide us a little bit more color on some of the conversations that are taking place on the hill and where do you see or how you see the actual likelihood of more changes to sequestration actually occurring? It seems like we kind of see in the press certain congressmen talking about the possibility of doing that, but it doesn\u2019t seem like there is anything particularly serious or certainly eminent. Just wondering if you can give us a little more color on the latest there?","Wes Bush","Noah, I sort of see both sides of it. I clearly see a much better informed discussion on the hill around both near-term and long-term jeopardy that our national security is being placed under with this continuing pressure downwards on the Department of Defense and quite frankly other federal agencies that are being asked to do a heck of a lot more to deal with the variety of threats around the globe that are being asked to do that greater amount of scope, if you will, at a much reduced budget. It simply doesn\u2019t make any sense and I think there is a growing recognition of that dramatic imbalance that we have from a national security perspective. Now, whether or not that recognition translates into action depends on a lot of politics and I would not want to be in the mode of speculating on politics, but I am encouraged by the growing thoughtfulness of the discussion, the growing recognition and I think the genuine desire on the part of folks on both sides of the isle and both sides of Congress, both houses of Congress to kind of step back and rethink this. But again, there are so much political dynamics associated with the budget these days that it would be difficult to put a stake in the ground and say, yes, this is going to change. But I am encouraged by the improvement in the dialogue around this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone.","Wes Bush","Hi, Jason.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc.","Wes, I was wondering if you could just spend a few minutes thinking about the operational tempo in the Middle East today. It\u2019s obviously increased here of late and maybe just describe to everybody here on the call the types of products and solutions and services that Northrop has on offer that might eventually get used in this new operational tempo that we have over there just so that we can begin thinking about impacts that this may have on Northrop if this ends up getting sustained higher level of operations over there?","Wes Bush","Thanks, Jason. Clearly, our capabilities get deployed around the globe and are addressing a whole set of issues that are evident not just in the Middle East as you\u2019re well aware. But with respect to that particular theater, some of the things that we\u2019re well known for and support our customers with a very focused approach are things such as intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance. We deploy a wide variety of systems that help our customers understand what\u2019s happening, where it\u2019s happening, when it\u2019s happening and do that with a very high degree of precision, so the ISR part of our business is really an important part whether we\u2019re talking the platforms that provide the presence to do it, the sensors that provide the inherent system capacity on those platforms where they\u2019re processing that sits behind the sensors, whether it\u2019s on the platform or to ground processing and quite frankly the sustainment of those systems. So it\u2019s a full company effort behind the ISR mission that\u2019s so important to all of four structure to be able to have that perceptive understanding of what\u2019s going on. The other place we play a big role is on the command and control side. Our work that we do both at our Information Systems business and in Aerospace Systems and in Electronic Systems plays an integral role in the command and control architectures that are deployed to help address this type of situations. So I wouldn\u2019t say that what we\u2019re seeing right now in the Middle East represents a big uptick in any way for us, I would not want to leave that impression. But I would point out that our systems and capabilities are integral to the nation\u2019s ability to go and conduct these types of activities and again not just in the Middle East but around the globe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","Hi. Good morning, guys.","James F. Palmer","Hi, Carter. How are you?","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital","Great. I just had a couple of questions around the margin. Obviously, the contract activity, the order activity around several of these new big awards imply your changeover on several of these big programs. I wonder if you could comment on the switchover to new contracts on some of those platform and what it might mean for the margin? And then just as a point of clarification, Jim, the CAS dynamics you outlined in the quarter related to the 37 million. Are those just cumulative catch-ups that are retroactive or are the pension changes going to have some sort of offsetting benefit in next year\u2019s segment margin rates? Thanks.","James F. Palmer","Let me take the second piece of that first. The CAS benefit are essentially nine-month impact of lower CAS costs applied against the whole portfolio of contracts, some of those contracts being cost types, so the benefits flow entirely to the customer. Some of them being fixed price incentive, where we share in the benefits; others being fixed price where we capture the benefits. There will be some small benefit that continues but largely be realized I think basically this year. So there will be a small fourth quarter benefit as well that\u2019s essentially covered in our guidance for the year.","Wes Bush","But respect to the platform activities, I would just say that each time we start out on a new contract we have a risk profile in front of us on execution and we recognize the retirement of that risk as it occurs over time. So, nothing unusual about the new contracts that we have in that regard, but I think to the point, Carter, you were making because we have a number of these new activities and E-2D is a good example of that. As we retire the risk, either we succeed at retiring the risk or we fail to retire the risk over the course of the premium, that will be reflected in the way that we booked the margins on the program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","Hi, Myles.","Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank","Just following up on that line of questioning though, you\u2019ve been running 12.3 here in the last couple of quarters. We\u2019re going to touch higher than that. You\u2019ve seen kind of a turn for the better in the backlog. And I think one of the things you\u2019ve talked about is you\u2019d love to see the backlog grow and the top line start to show some signs of life, but also be mindful that that might come with some margin pressure. So as you look at '15, I mean is that the point where some of the flow-throughs of the new wins are going to start to put downward pressure on these margins that you\u2019ve been able to drive so well?","Wes Bush","We won\u2019t give any guidance, right, relating to '15 other than the pension outlook that Jim provided, so I wouldn\u2019t venture into being prescriptive about '15. But I think the broader perspective is correct. As we bring on additional programs, there\u2019s always a path, if you will, to the full margin opportunity. The commentary I\u2019ve made in the past relates though a bit more to our capture of development work as I think everyone on the call understands, development programs generally carry a lower margin rate opportunity than do our production programs. So the extent that our backlog reflects the capture of development activities, that would tend to have more of a downward pressure on margin rates than when the backlog growth reflects the capture of additional production work.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Christopher Sands - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. It\u2019s Chris on for Joe.","Wes Bush","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Sands - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hi, guys. Wanted to ask about the improvement in funded IS backlog. This has been one of the businesses that has been under some pressure, because of the short cycle. Does that improvement signal that things are improving or at least that the pressure will start to decelerate?","Wes Bush","I would characterize it as good performance, good competitive performance by the IS team. I think it\u2019s too early to call a turn in the shorter cycle side of the marketplace. I think we\u2019re going to have to see how the budget environment shapes up over the course of this year before we\u2019re positioned to call that. But we are very pleased with the backlog performance and capture performance of the IS team. They\u2019ve continued to make sure that we\u2019re focused on the parts of the portfolio where we think we can really create value and are very focused on the competitive side of that. So it\u2019s good work by the IS team that you\u2019re seeing here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Good morning.","Wes Bush","Hi, George.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Hi. How are you doing?","Wes Bush","Good.","James F. Palmer","Good.","George Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Jim, if I divide the 37 million by the 132 million, you get about 28%. So in a certain way does that give me some attempt at what your mix of business now is between fixed price, cost plus and FPI? And going forward into next year, would that mix substantially change much based on what you just said, Wes? It seems like there might be more development next year.","James F. Palmer","George, I remember back to the 10-K and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the mix that\u2019s changed much. We\u2019re a little bit more than 50% cost type, maybe 52%, 53%; 47 fixed price. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed awful lot. The other factor as you appreciate in terms of the flow-through of the 132 million June catch-up reduction in CAS expenses just a percentage completion of the various contracts that it applies to. So I said to an earlier question, there will be some smaller fourth quarter benefit and maybe some that leads over into 2015 as well, but really not that significant in terms of the overall margin impact on a go-forward basis. And to your question basically around the overall mix, based on what I\u2019ve seen so far in our planning process, I don\u2019t see a lot of change in the overall mix between development contracts and production contracts as we look forward here.","Wes Bush","In particular, I would just add because we see a good set of opportunities on both the production and on the development side, if I look at our national opportunities, many of those are more production-related if we\u2019re selling a Global Hawk or a Triton or an E-2D overseas, those would be additions to our production line. Generally, our domestic targets, the new targets, tend to have more development opportunity and I mentioned both long-range strike and some of the other things that we\u2019re pursuing domestically would tend to have more of a development mix. So in terms of the overall opportunity set, I would align with what Jim said that we really don\u2019t see much of a change in the mix of opportunities. Of course, it will depend on which ones we actually capture and turn into the sales [engineer] (ph) in the company.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David Strauss - UBS","Good afternoon.","Wes Bush","Good afternoon, David.","James F. Palmer","Hi, David.","David Strauss - UBS","Jim, can you talk about EACs in the quarter, what they look like overall? I know you had the settlement (indiscernible) factoring, but what do EACs look like in the quarter and maybe any color thinking about Q4 and into next year? Thanks.","James F. Palmer","Yes, I think you all know but I think you are making too much out of these EAC adjustments. The underlying margin rate is really the key factor here. EAC adjustments were down in the quarter, as I recall correctly from the Q that was filed this morning, upper 30s, low $40 million range on a year-over-year basis and quarter-over-quarter basis. And we basically look at the underlying fundamentals of our various contracts when we do our planning process and not so much how we expect to come from the underlying performance of the contracts versus EAC adjustments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Good morning.","Wes Bush","Hi, Rob.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Good afternoon, I guess I should say. Hi, guys. I wanted to talk a little bit about an aspect of Better Buying Power and the sense that we\u2019re getting the DoD is now perhaps taking a deeper look at major subcontracts in addition to the primary prime contractor contracts. And to what extent, if any, this has started to happen on F-35? My understanding is they\u2019re really doing this with the largest programs, so clearly that would be F-35 in your position there. Are they getting involved in the negotiations and trying to help identify cost savings directly as you work with your customer?","Wes Bush","This is Wes. I wouldn\u2019t say that that was so much a reflection of what\u2019s going on in Better Buying Power. I think historically we\u2019ve seen on very, very large programs where there are subcontracts that are major fractions of the acquisition. We\u2019ve seen the government have a strong interest in understanding what\u2019s going on and frequently the subcontractor works through the prime to support what the prime needs to get done with the government customer to provide greater insight into that larger fraction of the cost. But all that said, ultimately, the subcontractor just that there are contractual agreements between the supplier and the prime and the government\u2019s actions need to respect that and understand it. And ultimately, they are holding the prime contractor responsible for the outcomes. So we are an industry that works very closely together to get things done. It\u2019s kind of one of \u2013 I think the very strong positive attributes of our industry that we\u2019re able to partner so well while we also complete. And part of that partnering process is to support whoever happens to be the prime on an individual contract, support them enabling them to get done what they need to get done with the customer community. So I don\u2019t know that I would characterize it as a big departure clearly on something, the size of F-35 where individual companies that are not the prime have a big role. The government needs to understand what\u2019s going on in great detail and the subcontractors need to support the prime and providing that type of insight. But ultimately, the relationship is between the subcontractor and the contractor and that has to be maintained. Since you raised the question though about Better Buying Power, I thought it might be helpful just to give a little bit of perspective on this. Our industry has been very active in working with the Department and helping to provide feedback and help to shape the ongoing evolution of the Better Buying Power initiatives. We\u2019re now to Better Buying Power 3.0 and I think there\u2019s a lot of good things that are coming out of this process. And clearly the opportunity to work with the Department in helping to shape what\u2019s going on and improving the acquisition process I think is something that we all welcome. The focus that we\u2019re seeing in Better Buying Power 3 around innovation and driving technology I think is very, very much on point and necessary for where we need to be going as a country. And as I\u2019ve said earlier, I think I speak for most folks in the industry. We really appreciate the Department\u2019s approach to working with us and shaping where these things go. So I think there are a lot of positives here. We have to of course make sure that the implementation of the policies that get put out really is in alignment with the intent and there have been some issues in that regard whether it\u2019s in the appropriate use of different contract types or other aspects of it. But I think in general, this is a good architecture, a good approach to trying to improve \u2013 continuously improve what\u2019s going on in DoD acquisition and we\u2019re supportive of what the Department\u2019s working to do here.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Thanks for getting me on, I appreciate it.","Wes Bush","Hi, Hunter.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Hi. How are you? A little bit of a schematic follow up to an earlier question I think relates to assets deployed in the Middle East right now. I\u2019m wondering if you can be a little more specific and tell us \u2013 you talked about ISR before about how Global Hawk is being utilized and whether or not DoD or Congress is taking note of its capabilities and whether or not you think this might provide a little bit of a catalyst to get some sensor work upgrades done on Block 30? And also maybe comment how the U-2 fits into this sort of puzzle that we have here? Thanks a lot.","Wes Bush","Thanks, Hunter. I really can\u2019t. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me to comment on how specific systems are being deployed in an operational context. I would just say broadly that as the world continues to get more challenging, we see a constant increase in deployment of assets like Global Hawk and Global Hawk specifically around the globe. The number of hours of operation continue to rise, the cost per hour continues to fall, the clarity that the commanders have around the benefits of that asset continues to improve. So we see all the things pointed in the right direction for the broad support that the DoD has been providing for Global Hawk. So we\u2019re continuing to be very confident about its future and very supportive of what our customers are working to do to continue to enhance its operational utilizations. So, we see things as being on the right track there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Wes and Jim, we\u2019ve heard about international opportunities from both of you, but I was hoping that perhaps we could put some numbers around it. Could you just update us on where on an enterprise level basis international is as a percent of revenue now, what it looks like as a percentage of the backlog and is a big opportunity, if there\u2019s anything you can tell us about where you think as a percent of revenue could go in the coming years as sort of a general trajectory, I think that would be very helpful?","James F. Palmer","John, this is Jim. As you know, international has gone to about 13% of sales for 2014, up from 10% in 2013. Backlog is about 14% at this point and obviously the backlog percentage is always influenced by the timing of these large international awards. Both Wes and I have said a number of times, we see some significant opportunities in the international marketplace for our capabilities. They always take a long time to bring to fruition. Projecting exactly when they\u2019re going to occur is frapped with problem and I\u2019m not going to get into that.","Wes Bush","Jim, I listed a few earlier, maybe I can just reiterate some of that and perhaps add a little perspective. With respect to what we have underway at Aerospace Systems, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we see opportunities for our Global Hawk, Triton and E-2D and of course broadly around the company where we\u2019re a participant on F-35, we see that growing. In Electronic Systems, we\u2019ve been pleased to see how our SBIR radar program continues to perform well on schedule. We see that as a very, very competitive offering that we have in the marketplace and it\u2019s generating a lot of interest around the globe. So the SBIR radar is I think going to be a nice opportunity for a number of countries that are looking to upgrade their F-16 capability. In Information Systems, we have an extensive capability in cyber that a number of our allies are quite interested in figuring out how they work with the U.S. and U.S. government in taking their steps forward where we can helpful. And I mentioned earlier the work that we do domestically in command and control out of Information Systems and there too we\u2019re seeing an increasing interest around the globe in some of that capability to help deal with the growing complexity of the systems that many nations are acquiring now. You have to be able to network these systems together and manage them as a more integrated approach to dealing with the battle space and that\u2019s a real expertise that we have at IS that I see a nice international opportunity. And with respect to TS, we do a fair amount of sustainment work around the globe today and we see sustainment as a growing international opportunity for TS. So every one of our four sectors has a set of meaningful opportunities as we look out over the next few years. We generally have not been in the mode of trying to set goals as a percent of revenue. I don\u2019t see that as a necessarily productive thing to do. We are looking at each of these opportunities to see whether or not they are value creating and whether or not we\u2019re the right company to be pursuing them, and we make our decisions on that basis. So as we go forward, given the breadth of opportunities, clearly we\u2019re looking at a growing international business but we\u2019re not setting specific percent of revenue targets to describe that growth.","Steve Movius","This is Steve. I\u2019d like to thank all of you for your interest. This concludes our Q&A session of the call and I would like to turn it over to Wes for final comments.","Wes Bush","Thanks, Steve.

We continue to strengthen our company's foundation for a long-term profitable growth and I want to thank the entire team for their continued focus on sustainable performance.","First quarter sales grew 5% over last year's first quarter driven by higher Manned Aircraft volume at Aerospace Systems and higher Sensors and Processing volume at Mission Systems. We're very pleased that our focus on program performance continues to demonstrate that we can grow segment operating income dollars as we both ramp up on early phase development programs and implement volume increases on several production programs.","Net earnings and diluted EPS each increased 14% in the quarter, driven by sales and segment operating income growth and improvement in other items particularly pension and taxes which more than offset additional net interest expense. Based on the strength of this quarter's results, we're increasing our full-year 2018 earnings per share guidance to a range of $15.40 to $15.65. This guidance, of course, excludes the pending acquisition of Orbital ATK which we continue to expect to close in the first half of the year. We're very excited about the opportunity to bring together the capabilities of Northrop Grumman and Orbital ATK to offer new innovative capabilities to our customer community. Kathy will provide more information on the status of the acquisition.","For cash, our typical first quarter pattern is the use of funds but we're pleased that this quarter cash from operations showed about a $200 million improvement over last year's first quarter. Capital spending during the quarter reflects our continued investment in support of long-term profitable growth and affordability for our customers. We continue to expect capital expenditures will be approximately $1 billion in 2018 and free cash flow will range between $2 billion to $2.3 billion.","Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in the business, managing the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our strong cash generation continues to allow us to strengthen our foundation for long-term profitable growth, as we invest capital to expand our workforce, ramp up on large new programs, and pursue new business opportunities.","At the same time we remain focused on a strong balance sheet with some near-term debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We previously announced an off-cycle 10% dividend increase in January which was paid in March. We will consider the dividend again in May, as is our typical pattern. We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter as we are continuing to pause our share repurchase program during the Orbital ATK transaction process.","Before, I turn the call over to Kathy, I'd note that we're pleased that the bipartisan budget agreement provided for a significant increase in fiscal year 2018 defense appropriations, established the fiscal year 2019 top line for national security at $716 billion and extended the debt ceiling expiration until March of 2019. These actions should provide our customers a more stable and near-term funding environment in which to execute their important missions.","Now I'll turn the call over to Kathy for an update on the pending Orbital ATK transaction as well as some operational highlights. Kathy?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to share the results of our operations this quarter, and I want to thank our team for the outcomes they delivered for our customers and our shareholders.","Before, I talk about our current operations, let me touch on our pending combination with Orbital ATK. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the first half of the year. We received European Commission approval in February and we continue to support the regulatory process in the U.S. We also continue to make good progress on integration planning including potential cost, operational and capability synergies. We're excited about the innovative future offerings, we expect our combination to yield for our customers.","Turning to our sector highlights for the quarter, each of the sectors captured business and achieved program milestones that position us well for the long-term. At Aerospace Systems in Manned Aircraft, we continue to ramp up on restricted activities and the F-35 program. F-35 sales increased by nearly 30%, and we delivered 20 center fuselage units this quarter versus 15 units in the first quarter of last year. We are demonstrating that we're successfully moving up the production curve required by our customers.","In Autonomous Systems, Global Hawk celebrated its 20th anniversary and has now recorded more than 250,000 flight hours with missions flown in support of military and humanitarian operations. Triton, our next generation high-altitude, long-endurance platform is continuing to progress through low rate initial production.","The Navy expects its first two operational Tritons will be deployed to Guam by the end of this year. To perform ISR missions for the Navy's 7th Fleet in the Pacific. Australia continues to make progress towards procuring Triton to support critical maritime ISR requirements. And we're very pleased that the State Department recently approved Germany's request to buy Triton.","Space, we continue to make good progress on NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. With the arrival of the optical telescope and the Integrated Science Instrument module, all major elements of JWST now reside in our integration facility in Redondo Beach. The SBIRS Flight 4 satellite successfully launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in January and our payload is performing well as it is undergoing calibration.","And on Advanced EHF we continue integration and test activities for our payloads for flights four, five and six. At Mission Systems, the Government of Poland signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance for our Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command system or IBCS. Poland is the first international partner country to purchase IBCS and it will transform their integrated air and missile defense capabilities. With its truly open systems architecture, IBCS enables incorporation of current and future sensors and weapon systems to deliver an integrated air picture and command and control which provides a more capable missile defense system.","Also at Mission Systems, our Ground\/Air Task-Oriented Radar or G\/ATOR achieved initial operating capability and has been approved for early fielding by the Marine Corps. This milestone follows the delivery of the final Lot 1 and Lot 2 LRIP systems to the Marines. Mission Systems has now delivered six G\/ATOR systems to the Marine Corps. And we look forward to entering full rate production and getting G\/ATOR's unprecedented capabilities to our war fighters.","At Technology Services, we were one of three awardees on a 10-year recompete of the Information Technology Support Services contract for the Social Security Administration. Under this contract TS will continue to support the Social Security Administration's transformation initiatives and IT systems modernizations efforts. And we also successfully transitioned the Special Electronic Mission Aircraft or SEMA, a program for the Army, after our competitive capture of that program last year.","We're addressing numerous new opportunities in the U.S. and with our allies around the globe and we're excited about the long-term growth prospects enabled by our portfolio.","We continue, however, to be very disciplined about the opportunities we select to bid. For example, we recently elected to not pursue two bids, GPS satellites and the next generation of F-35 DAS, as we determined that they were not attractive for us. We believe that applying strict assessment criteria in selecting our business pursuits is critical to long-term sustained performance.","Now I'll, turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our financials.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Kathy, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for their efforts so far this year. Today I'll briefly review our first quarter results and update our 2018 guidance. Before I get to our first quarter results, let me just comment on the number of moving parts in the first quarter.","During the quarter, we began operating in a new tax regime and we adopted the new revenue recognition and the pension standards. We also implemented the new FASB guidance on presenting the impacts of the Tax Act on certain items recorded in equity, largely on amortized benefit plan costs. We did this all while working on integration planning for the Orbital ATK combination. I would also remind everyone that our guidance does not reflect the closing of the Orbital ATK transaction. However, guidance does include six months of net interest related to the debt issued last October related to the acquisition, and $50 million of transaction costs. We will update our guidance after the transaction closes which, as Kathy mentioned, we continue to expect in the first half of the year.","Turning to sector results, Aerospace Systems sales were up 10%. Manned Aircraft was the major growth driver, primarily due to higher volume for restricted activities and the F-35 program. We also had higher revenue at Autonomous Systems and Space. Aerospace Systems' first quarter operating income grew 6% and operating margin rate was 10.4%. In addition to higher early phase development volume this year, last year's results benefited from a modest non-programmatic benefit that we didn't have this year. For 2018 we continue to expect AS revenue in the high $12 billion range with a low-to-mid 10% margin rate. No change to prior guidance.","Turning to Mission Systems, sales and operating income both rose 3%. Margin rate was slightly higher than last year's first quarter at 12.9%. Sensors and Processing, which represents about 50% of MS sales, continues to be the growth driver for the sector. Higher volume is primarily due to electro-optical\/infrared, self-protection and targeting programs as well as F-35 sensors and restricted activities. For 2018 we continue to expect sales in the mid-to-high $11 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 13%. No change to prior guidance.","Revenue at Technology Services was slightly lower than last year's first quarter due to the headwinds we've previously discussed. Declines in programs like KC-10 and JRDC are being partially offset by ramp-ups on new programs like SEMA.","For 2018 we continue to expect Technology Services sales will be in the mid $4 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. No change to prior guidance. As we roll all that up, we continue to expect sales of approximately $27 billion and a segment operating margin rate in the low to mid 11% range, which reflects a portfolio that continues to have a higher percentage of early phase development work in the contract mix.","We continue to expect our total operating margin rate will be approximately 12% reflecting the new pension accounting presentation. As you're aware, starting in 2018, we're required to split FAS into two pieces. First quarter FAS service expense reduced operating income by $99 million and FAS non-service benefit moves below operating income and increases earnings before income taxes by $120 million. I would also note that we are increasing our guidance for 2018 total net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment to $960 million from $940 million. This update reflects an increase in our CAS estimate to $875 million from $855 million in our prior guidance. There were no other updates to our pension assumptions.","While unallocated corporate expenses was comparable to last year's first quarter, we continue to expect 2018 unallocated corporate expense of approximately $250 million which contemplates the $50 million of Orbital ATK transaction expense and $200 million of ongoing corporate unallocated expense. I would also remind you that our unallocated corporate expense is typically higher in the second half of the year.","Our guidance contemplates net interest expense of approximately $390 million, which is comprised of $300 million for our pre-Orbital ATK debt and approximately $90 million or six months of net interest expense on a debt we issued last October to fund the acquisition.","Turning to tax, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.2%, reflecting the statutory rate reduction as well as a $26 million excess tax benefit related to employee share-based compensation. We now expect our 2018 effective tax rate will be approximately 18% in 2018.","As Wes noted, we are increasing our 2018 EPS guidance by $0.40 to a range of $15.40 to $15.65. This assumes no change to our weighted average diluted share count.","We continue to expect free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.3 billion after capital spending of approximately $1 billion. I would also note that we expect capital spending will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. So, it was a good start to the year and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team for the remainder of the year. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Ken. As a reminder, we ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question. You can re-enter the queue, if you have additional questions. Jamie, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon everybody.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Noah.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","On the capital expenditure, I heard what you just said, Ken, it's front-end loaded and so the big increase in the first quarter doesn't sustain through the year. But I guess it will be up again year-over-year from a level that had already step functioned higher. So one, I mean how is that build out going? And two how much longer do you need to be at this level, what do we do beyond 2018?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Appreciate the question. I would say that, I think the CapEx investments that we are making are yielding the dividends that we expect them to. We've been I think taking a diligent approach to investing in capital, making sure that the business cases all deliver what they need to. So we're looking at the business case upfront and then we're again taking a look back to make sure that we're in fact making smart investments and that we're delivering on the investments that we're making. I think we're quite happy with what's going on there.","In terms of the profile I would say, you know we've been talking about the fact that we've got to invest for the growth of the business. We also talked about the fact that the benefit of tax reform result in us allocating a little bit more to capital in 2018 than we had initially planned about another $100 million. And we continue to be comfortable with the $1 billion estimate for 2018. It was a little bit front-end loaded as we mentioned. Not a surprise to us. I think it was pretty consistent with our plan. We think that 2019 stays elevated as well and then we'll start to return to a new normal in 2020. And I would just remind you that the new normal is not necessarily consistent with where we were in the downturn a number of years back, we will be a significantly larger company at that point in time.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And I would just add just as we think about those out-years, to a large extent it also depends on the degree to which we are successful in capturing new business. If we find ourselves in the fortunate position of being very, very successful that may require further additional investments over time. So we simply have to give you those updates as we get more information and have more insight on what our actual capture success turns out to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hey, good morning, guys.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Ron.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Ron.","Ronald J. Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, Wes, I was going to ask you sort of the unaskable question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. When you think about the opportunity that Northrop could have in classified space beyond kind of what we know GBSD and some of the other contracts. When we when we think about the combined company and I'm not asking you for kind of like post-merger guidance, but how \u2013 what framework can you give us to think about the opportunity space that's open to you guys after the company is combined with Orbital ATK versus today, because it's my sense there's a bunch of opportunities out there that you just have a better chance of getting as a combined company if you could do that.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, your question is right on the mark and really goes to a big part of the reason that we are so excited about the pending transaction. It's a very complementary match in terms of what the two companies today do in space. As you know, Northrop tends to focus on the more \u2013 the larger systems that have a set of mission applications that is attendant with that class of platform whereas Orbital ATK has demonstrated a very, very significant capability in the small and medium size. And I would say more agile class of spacecraft. And if you think about what is happening in the space environment today, we are clearly moving into an arena where we need a mix of those capabilities to address the set of missions that we need to address, particularly given the contested environment that is not only the future of space, it is today of space that's on us already.","So if you think architecturally about the capabilities that are needed to both address the threat that we have in space and to do the mission that we want to conduct in space those architectures are inherently a blend of those classes of capabilities. So our ability to bring to the customer set a full range of offering will be significantly enhanced with this coming together of the companies, because as I said it is very complementary. So it's a sort of very much of an opportunity to create, we believe significant revenue synergy as we go forward by having that full set of capabilities available to us to make our offerings to our customers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hello, Wes, Ken, Kathy.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, Wes. Maybe just on Technology Services, just trying to get a better understanding of how we should think about the growth profile. I know there is some one-time programs that are winding down, KC-10 you mentioned and some others. If we're just looking out and given the backdrop of the budget now in place, how should we be thinking about kind of the long term growth of that business.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. Kathy, why don't you address that for us?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Wes. So, Peter, as we look at that business there is a significant portion of the business that is growing as a result of their support and sustainment to other parts of our portfolio in our company accounts for about 20% of the Technology Services portfolio. And we've seen that grow year-over-year. So the offset to that is some of the programs that we've talked about in the past that have been winding their way through the portfolio, a wind down of KC-10 most recently and the wind-down of the VITA program anticipated this year. However, we are replacing that with good quality business and you see that sustaining the margins of the Technology Services organization at a very healthy level. So we're still really pleased with our portfolio and the synergy that it has with the rest of our business, particularly as we look forward to their ability to sustain and support modernization of the systems we build.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. And good afternoon.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Kathy mentioned the decision that that you guys made not to bid on some additional work on F-35. And I wonder as you look out on that program and you're in a bunch of different places on the aircraft, as you think about maybe some of the challenges between wanting to have a level of returns and profitability that you target versus holding on to work that you have, how do you think about balancing those things given the direction that the program's gone?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks for the questions, Seth. We look at each of those opportunities as they come. As you know, we have a significant portion of the F-35 program, not just the center fuselage that AS builds, but within Mission Systems three of the electronic components. You specifically are referencing my comment about the DAB, the upgrade of that system and we did take a look at that and decide that that was not an attractive business to us.","And so even when we've been building the sensor for a number of years and doing it quite well as we have with DAB, we continue to deliver 100% on time with that sensor. We looked at the future procurement and decided that it wasn't a good attractive business deal for us. And so we'll continue to apply that same discipline and not just to the F-35 program and the modernization efforts that we see there, but across the portfolio generally we are using that discipline.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I would just add, Seth, that when we think about the mix of things on F-35, there's a wide array of activities that we perform and they each have their own sort of unique business arrangements and business profile and we continue to be very optimistic and are positive on F-35 as an important part of our business. We are delighted with the approach that we've been able to bring to, as Kathy pointed out, very high quality and on-time delivery of all of our elements. We are delighted to be taking on additional work through the sustainment activities that are in front of us on F-35.","So F-35 is a very, very important program to us. The partnership is very, very important to us, but as Kathy points out, we do take a look at every aspect of our portfolio from a business case opportunity and in a broad sense and make very discrete decisions on those. But I would not want you to and I wasn't quite sure where you were going with your question. I would not want you to see that particular decision as somehow reflection of our view of the F-35 program. We're very positive on that program. See it is as absolutely critical to the future security of the nation, our allies and we're big supporters as you know of F-35.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","On Aerospace Systems margins, they've been quite strong despite mix. Can you maybe give us some color on the moving pieces in the quarter? And then just more broadly, how should we think about progression of margins in that program when it comes to development programs? Is it productivity in year two or do development margins stay flat throughout until you enter outright production?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks for the question. I'll start and if Wes or Kathy wants to jump in, feel free. I would say that AS margin is largely being driven by mix. We know that the biggest impacts on margin are mix and performance and I would say that largely the sector is performing on its programs and we're seeing a bit of compression from where they've been in the past from largely the early phase development work that we've taken on and the volume that that's driving. And we're pleased that they do have a strong portfolio of production programs that are performing well and are enabling us to hold strong margin in that sector while taking on the early phase work that we have.","In terms of looking forward, I would say, I'd reference back to Wes's comments. In some respect, the margin profile for AS, as we look forward, is going to be driven by our success on some of the future early phase pursuits that we are working on. GBSD probably being the largest, but certainly other opportunities, some in the restricted space at that sector as well.","So we're excited about the performance at AS. Significant growth this quarter at the top line, 10% sales growth, growing margin dollars and maintaining strong margins and really driven by performance at all three of the divisions within Aerospace. So we're excited about how it's performing and where it's going. Kathy?","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I'll just add that, as Ken said, when we look at early stage development and production programs that mix can change the margin profile, but execution is really the core of delivering strong margins. And I've been very pleased with our Aerospace Systems sector performance on their contracts that is allowing us to deliver with this mix, strong margins in each of those programs, whether they're early phase development or production.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey, good afternoon.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Wes, I wanted to \u2013 if I could ask you briefly about James Webb and the \u2013 not necessarily the contract there. I mean, I realize the contract type means that you don't have much exposure financially. But you think about the performance and execution, clearly some of the commentary from NASA around things like quality escapes and training deficiencies and stuff like that (00:31:04) it just seems sort of un-Northrop-like, I think, given what you guys have done over the last several years. Can you just give us some color on how that evolved and if that's an isolated kind of performance issue or how seriously you're taking that and how we should think about it? Just any color would be really helpful. Thanks.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Carter. I'll take that. As we talk about James Webb, it's really important that we think about what that system is. It's a one of a kind and the first of a kind; it's a real technological leap in the mission to explore space. For those of you who aren't familiar with it, it actually will help us look back 13.8 billion years to when our universe was formed at the earliest stars and galaxies to understand the origin. And so when you think about a program like that, it is quite an engineering phenomenon. And the good news is now we have all that flight hardware, it's fully complete. The new launch date does reflect additional time for integrating and testing the telescope and the spacecraft. And it's important for us that mission assurance is the top priority; that we continue to work diligently with NASA to make sure that when we launch, we have full mission success. So we are partnering with NASA to ensure adequate steps are being taken to do that.","You asked about some of the challenges that we've encountered and when people are doing things for the first time ever, there is learning that happens. And so we are ensuring that all of the training that we're giving our people continued to be a focus so that we can give them the best chance of success here. But doing something for the first time does come with some inherent risk and we and NASA are partnering to identify that and successfully mitigate it so that we can get this successfully launched and able to fulfill the space exploration mission that we all want to see be successful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thank you, guys. We saw some incremental prioritization of NGAD (00:33:31) with the most recent budget request and I'm kind of curious to know how Northrop is positioning itself on that program. Or maybe more broadly, how you're thinking about that program developing over the next 5 to 10 years? Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hunter, let me just sort of say broadly and I will not get into any specifics on that class of future activity, but broadly as our nation looks at the set of things that we're going to need to be able to provide our military to ensure that we continue to have technological superiority, this is going to be an important effort. We clearly have very significant capabilities that will be supportive of that effort and we intend to be engaged in this in a very serious way. So the details of all of this will be emerging over time and not, again, something that I can say anything in particular about today. But I see it as a very positive reflection of the Department's serious intent to ensure that we as a nation are doing the right things to maintain technological superiority.","So I'm really happy to see the support for it and we of course will be engaged.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to go back to follow on Sheila's question because if you look at a lot of the development work you've won, the Aerospace and Mission Systems, they've each moved to a point with more development work where they've been in more than 50% cost plus. And so if you look at where you are today, what does the mix look like in those two production versus development or cost plus versus fixed price? And given that you've got some big long-term contracts, how do you see that mix evolving over the next few years?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, Doug, let me take that on. I would say and we don't normally put a lot of numbers at the sector level around some of the mix, but I would say that AS is heavier cost type than the other sectors, probably 60% plus given the development work that they've taken on. And at the same time they do have a strong portfolio of production programs that are delivering solid margins that are able to offset some of the development work.","Now, we've tried to focus on the fact that not all cost-type work is the same. And the earliest phase cost-type programs where you've got still the most risks to burn down are generally where you see the highest margin pressure. And in fact there are some cost-type programs that have very good solid margin booking rates. So I wouldn't try to think of cost-type programs as being homogeneous in terms of margins or risks or things like that.","As far as Mission Systems sector, Mission Systems continues to run more than 50% fixed price and I don't remember the exact number. But if you go and look at some of the new revenue recognition disclosures in the 10-Q, I think they're in the last footnote. There is a couple of charts on kind of revenue breakdowns and you can find some more information there in terms of how the sectors break down. But largely that's the way I would characterize it. I think its representative of the power of our portfolio. We have a strong mix of programs and there's a strong mix of programs across not only different customers, across the different sectors but across the lifecycle in terms of development, production and sustainment. So I think it's very healthy and you know we're seeing the benefits of that as we look at our results even as we've taken on the development work that you reference.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And, Doug, one thing I would add is it's pretty clear that this administration is intent on addressing the modernization issues. And consequently I do believe that they are going to work hard to get some of these new activities underway here over the next couple of years in particular. And the natural question will be as to your point about balance or mix between development and production will be the timing, the advent of additional new development work versus transition production. So there's a little bit of uncertainty as to the exact timeline for the onset of some of these really big additional new development activities and how that will phase with transitions of current development activities into production. But just from a broad strategy perspective, it's going to be important to us to be successful in the capture of those and the key development activities that we're focused on.","And to the extent that that happens sooner than some of the current development activity transitions into production that could put additional pressure if that were the case for some limited period of time as we experienced the transition into production of other activities. So it's hard to call it right now because there is that variable of the timing of these new development activities, but we are intently pursuing them and we will be very focused on supporting the customer in terms of the startup of those efforts as quickly as they desire to get them on contract.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks so much. Good afternoon.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. I wanted to follow up really on Doug's question perhaps. I was trying to get some sort of color of what sort of percentage of sales in the quarter was under the classified umbrella? And whether you're getting any indications from your customer that they may be looking to put more of your work under classified going forward?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Rob, I would just say broadly that we do see a trend in the direction of additional restricted activities. I think it is a reflection of the security environment that we are all operating in these days, that the growing understanding that drive technological superiority means that you actually need to keep a number of important aspects of activities classified. And so a little bit of Back to the Future in some respects in that way. So I do expect that there will be a continuing trend in that direction and how much, what percentages, it's not something that we go into detail on, but we'll make it even a stronger focus of ours trying to ensure that we're providing good and adequate information to the investment community to understand the nature of our business. But I do see that as a longer term trend.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And, Rob, I would just point out that we don't disclose that information quarterly but as Steve referenced there will be a new IR deck posted to our website, the Investor Relations webpage and that will have the latest information on our full year 2018 estimated revenues and customers and sources and things like that. So I would just reference you there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yes. Thanks so much for taking my question. So you have no bids first on the F-35 DAB, you were the incumbent and it's very rare for an incumbent not to no bid an upgrade of a system they already have. So maybe give us a little more color there? And also on your decision to no-bid GPS, was that impacted at all by the issues you're having with James Webb and the issue on the Zuma? Thanks so much.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you, Cai. Just broadly the GPS decision had absolutely nothing to do with anything else going on in the space portfolio other than a relative comparison of the attractiveness of the different opportunities that we're pursuing there. And a look at \u2013 where it makes the most sense for us to invest our resources to pursue those opportunities. And so we see actually a quite a good array relative to the earlier comments that I had when Ron asked the question about the space environment. So again it's how do individual opportunities stack up relative to our other opportunities and what's the best use of our resources to go and pursue those and support the customer community.","It is not unheard of for an incumbency position, if you will, to take a different view of the next step of any activity. To some extent, the experience that we had on X-47B, everyone thought well, we're a shoo-in on MQ-25 why don't we just go do that. And when we looked at that deal, we said I don't think so. So we look at each and every one of these opportunities and test them aggressively to see is this something that merits our investment, merits the application of our broad set of resources and are we really going to be investing them in a wise way to pursue them. And that's how we conduct our business, that's how we're going to continue to conduct our business. I think it's served us very well over the years.","There have been programs where we were the apparent winner and then the terms and conditions changed and we decided not to pursue them. And I think in general, those decisions have been good decisions for our company. So these we put into that category and I really appreciate the discipline within our organization in making those decisions. And the work that Kathy has been doing with our sector teams to really sort through the portfolio and make those important decisions, I think it's going exceptionally well for us.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Just as a follow-up on the F-35, was that contract terms were unattractive or was it that the technology path didn't make sense to you?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I won't get into the details of any individual bid decision that we're making. We look at all of those things and the list of things that we assess would include the items you listed plus quite a few others. And again it has to stack up relative to the other things that we're looking at.","Operator","Your next question that comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Wanted to ask about Orbital as we wait for the deal to close. Any update on some of the key parameters there in terms of how you're thinking about deleveraging post the deal, anything on intangible amortization, any update on synergies as you do more due diligence there? And then as a follow-up, Ken, wanted to ask about cash flow from operations looking beyond 2018, so as we think about 2019 and 2020 given the headwind you have from CAS? Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Let me start with the Orbital part of the question and then I'll try to address the cash aspect as well. And from an Orbital perspective, I would say that no update on PI at this point in time. We are continuing to work through all aspects of the integration of the deal. And from a PI perspective we'll be able to provide information after the deal closes. Clearly, there will be amortization of purchased intangibles once the deal closes. But I would remind you that there will be some amount going the other way in terms of a reset of their pension accounting, where you're no longer amortizing some of the actuarial assumption changes.","From an accretion perspective, I would just say that we continue to be quite comfortable with the previous information we had put out with respect to the accretion and that being on GAAP EPS, economic EPS as well as free cash flow per share and driven by kind of the early cost synergies and then ultimately the operational and then the revenue and capability synergies as well. So, from that perspective, I think we continue to be very positive and excited about getting that closed.","With respect to the question on cash, I would say that, as we look forward, and we don't provide guidance past 2018, obviously. But as we look forward from a cash perspective, this should be a business that is a strong generator of cash. We are growing the business; we are maintaining strong margin rates while we grow, growing margin dollars and turning those dollars into cash. CAS has been a component of our cash flow. But I firmly believe that we ought to be able to, as we look forward, develop our growing business into growing cash. And I don't see CAS reductions as a significant headwind to that profile.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Sam.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So when you give guidance in January we were still under a CR, the 2018 budget deal hadn't been done and now we have an agreement at least for 2018 and some projections for 2019. How should we think about when that starts to materialize for you? Is that something that can help this year or is it something that's really 2019 and beyond? How should we think about that additional spending?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, you know Sam, I appreciate the question and maybe I'll just take your question as an opportunity to reflect a little bit more broadly on kind of what we're seeing from a budgetary perspective and where I see things going over time. Yeah, I really do think we are at an inflection point in many ways in our military history, if you would. And if you look back over the last decade and a half, we've kind of had three big things going on that have put us in a position today where we really would rather not be.","On one hand, we've spent a lot of our treasure and our capacity in dealing with the violent extremist organizations around the globe, very appropriately; we had to do that. But during that period there was something happening around the globe that's really important to understand. There was a very rapid globalization of technology and innovation hubs that created capabilities in other parts of the world that really weren't there if you turn the clock back into the 1990s. And then sort of partway through that timeframe, we threw ourselves a curve ball and we self-imposed these tight constraints in our ability to invest in ourselves when we enacted the Budget Control Act as a nation.","So all of those things together really created a major opening for our competitors to contest the U.S. military primacy and contest it across a lot of different domains. And from my perspective, I think our competitors took full advantage of that opening. Those who might be adversaries in the future looked at that as a real opportunity. So if you add all that up and think about where we are, today we sort of have this major deficit of capability. And as we think about that as an inflection point, I think it's clear that we're just going to have to invest in some very significant military modernization. So I think you have to look at this across these issues of the CRs and just think about it in a more aggregated macro perspective of the things that we've got to do.","Now, you hear a lot of talk about recapitalizing the triad. We clearly have to do that. That's sort of a foundational element of our security posture. But that's not enough, that's not an adequate tool to ensure that we can protect our interests around the globe. So you see and what the DoD is doing, both recapitalization of the triad and a strong focus on recapitalizing the conventional force structure and that in itself sort of spans all of those different domains.","And it's clear, if you look at \u2013 your question was about budget \u2013 if you look at the budget and what the DoD is doing, in the investment accounts, in particular, when we're talking about capability, if you turn the clock back to FY 2015, the investment accounts were about $160 billion altogether. FY 2018 is more like $220 billion. And that's a lot of growth over that period of time. But it's a recognition of the issue that we're having to deal with. And to your point with some clarity around FY 2019, the President's budget has those investment accounts moving up in sort of the $238 billion range.","We know it takes typically sort of on average a couple of years for those types of appropriations to translate all the way through into outlays and to revenues at the company level. So this is a kind of a flow through the process and everybody's trying to move more quickly these days. So we'll see if that doesn't get accelerated little bit. But as we think about the next number of years in front of us, those threat issues are not going away. It's not only in the U.S. but we see our allies also making increases in their budgets, their defense budgets to deal with these concerns and these issues. And I think we all understand that historically defense budgets have largely been driven by the threat environment and I think that's what we're seeing right now.","So we've been working hard over a lot of years to position our portfolio, including the pending acquisition of Orbital ATK to enable our company to be at the center of this investment in modernization that is being driven by the threat environment that we see around the globe. So I kind of look past these CRs even though they are a great source of frustration for everybody in the defense community, but think about where the budgets are going, why they are being driven in that direction and what that means for the application of technology and capability? And I see us well-positioned for that. We are investing significantly to make sure we're going to be able to support our customers and the work that they're doing and that they're going to need to continue to do for some time. And quite frankly others in our industry are making big investments in that way as well. So I appreciate the question because I think it's important to stand back and look at this in that broader context and kind of understand what it means in terms of where we're heading.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, I wanted to go back to the comments on fixed price versus cost because, Ken, if you do look at the Q, I mean, it disclose that in Aerospace the cost type contracts dropped from 63% in the first three months last year to 59% this year with pretty rapid growth in the fixed price contracts. So does that trend continue? Does it reflect growth in the F-35 being the biggest part of the piece or exactly where do we stand on it?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Sorry, George, can you run me through the numbers part of your question, again? I didn't quite catch that.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yeah, the Q discloses that the cost-type contracts were 63% last year down to 59% this year. And obviously the fixed price sales grew quite rapidly over 20% and the cost only grew 4%. So my question is, is this just a unique quarter and we're going to revert back to higher cost type percent or is this the beginning of a trend where cost-type contracts are going to steadily go down in Aerospace?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, George, I guess, you know I would say that one quarter does not make a trend. And that we've seen the F-35 program at both AS and MS seeing strong growth this year's first quarter over last year's first quarter. And with respect to some of the questions about the cost-type side of the business, again that's why we're trying to parse out the cost type into the various phases of that work. And, again, I'd reference my earlier comments on not all cost-type work is the same and some delivers very strong margins. There is relatively mature cost-type work that is almost mature production, but kind of constantly changing.","And I would say that we'll see how the rest of the year plays out, but we expect to see growth in both the development programs as well as the production programs. Those will split and you can think of them as being cost type on the one side and fixed price on the other. But there clearly are other cost type programs that are more mature in their life cycle, and might look to have a risk and margin profile more akin to fixed price production than to some of the early phase development. So it really is a pretty broad array of scope of work and of lifecycle that we deal with here.","Kathy J. Warden - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And I'll just add that it depends on what we win this year as well. Ken spoke to the portfolio as it exists today and how it plays out, but we have some opportunities that could change that if we win them.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And Jamie, I think we'll do one more question and finish it up.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","If I could just ask two quick ones, I think they're quick since I'm at the end here, but one for each of you. So, Wes, you had a lengthy detailed answer to Sam's question, but is there a way to do something akin to what Lockheed did yesterday where they talked about the omnibus and $7 billion worth of plus ups beyond the President's request out of the 2018 omnibus. Is there a way to quantify what you've got on a similar basis or at least talk about what you're competing on, if not all those are awarded yet?","And then Ken, I wanted to ask you the 10-year up to 3%, if you could give us some sense of where that the marks the pension?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, let me just say broadly, we're really pleased of course with how the FY 2018 budget came out. And clearly we have a lot of opportunity associated with some of the things that were added. But my focus always on our business is to make sure that our stuff is in the base. And it's nice if we get things added, but I want to make sure that we're focused on the things that are really at the level of priority they're going to be in the base budget. And as we saw that, that looks really good and we're happy with a number of things that were added as well. So, I think it was just a overall reflection of the importance of the nature of the work that we're doing and the sets of capabilities that we're providing to our customers.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And on the pension side, I would say that if we think about the guidance we gave for 2018, it was based on a discount rate of 3.68%. From that time to your question about the 10 year Treasuries, I think 10-year Treasuries are up roughly let's say 70 basis points, maybe 70 basis points to 75 basis points. So, I'll just remind you that every 25 basis points change on the discount rate would result in about a $70 million change in our FAS expense, and a little shy of $1 billion change in the liability. So that's the sensitivity around that. Obviously, it's sensitive to more than just the 10-year rate, and you've really got to look at the entire curve and how that works. But I think rough order magnitude, that's the sensitivity you're looking for.","And I would just remind you that if you think about FAS and CAS, as I'm talking here, I'm referencing FAS which is more sensitive to changes in those assumptions than CAS is. CAS continues to be based on a 20 \u2013 it's either a 20 or 25-year average discount rate, and therefore, is less sensitive on that. And we also have a little bit more smoothing on asset returns on the CAS side than we do on how we apply FAS accounting. So the FAS side is more sensitive.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Wes, final comments.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","All right, well, I see that we're a minute past our hour. So I'll wrap up quickly by again thanking our team across the company for their outstanding work and delivering a really strong start for 2018. So thanks everybody for joining us on our call today and thanks for your continuing interest in our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Movius, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Frances, and welcome to Northrop Grumman's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. We provided supplemental information in the form of a PowerPoint presentation that you can access at www.northropgrumman.com. Before we start, please understand that matters discussed on today's call constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which are detailed in today's press release and our SEC filings. These risk factors may cause actual company results to differ materially.","On the call today are our Chairman, CEO and President, Wes Bush; and our CFO, Jim Palmer. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.","Wesley G. Bush","All right, thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on our third quarter conference call. We're very pleased with this quarter's results and the performance of our businesses year-to-date. We continue to drive program performance, aggressively pursue high-quality new business with innovative, affordable solutions, reduce our cost structure and align our portfolio with our customer spending priorities in a dynamic environment.","Our intense focus on these actions, combined with effective cash deployment, continues to create value for our shareholders, customers and our employees. These are not new initiatives for us. These are the ongoing efforts and actions that have generated substantial performance improvement over the last few years and that will be increasingly important in today's challenging environment.","Third quarter EPS are comparable to last year despite continued top-line pressure. On a pension-adjusted basis, our third quarter earnings per share increased 6%. We achieved this improvement through a combination of operational performance and share repurchases. All 4 of our businesses performed well in the quarter. Our businesses continue to generate strong operating income, margin rates and cash flow. Year-to-date, we've captured more than $20 billion in new business awards for a book-to-bill ratio of more than 100%. And cash generation has also been strong, even after our $300 million discretionary pension contribution, free cash flow totaled $748 million in the third quarter. And year-to-date, we've generated free cash flow of $1.4 billion or nearly 100% of net income. Our robust margin rates and cash conversion demonstrate the quality of our operational performance for the quarter and year-to-date. We're very proud of our employees' outstanding efforts in generating these results.","Our strong cash generation continues to support share repurchases. During the quarter we repurchased about 4.4 million shares of our stock for $290 million. And year-to-date, we've repurchased 13.6 million shares for approximately $850 million. In the first 9 months of the year, share repurchases and dividends have totaled more than $1.2 billion or nearly 90% of free cash flow. We continually assess our share repurchase program to ensure that it's creating long-term shareholder value. As you know, ours is a long cycle business, and we take that perspective when considering the value of our enterprise. We consider our long-term value relative to the market's current valuation of our cash flows and earnings.","Based on where we are in the cycle, and the prices at which we are purchasing shares, we believe that share repurchases continue to contribute to long-term value creation. The board recently increased our remaining share repurchase authorization to $2 billion, which provides flexibility in a dynamic environment.","Turning to guidance, based on the strength of year-to-date results, we expect to end the year with sales of approximately $25 billion. And we now expect 2012 earnings per share of $7.35 to $7.40. On a pension-adjusted basis, this represents EPS growth of approximately 8% over last year. We're also increasing our guidance for cash from operations and free cash flow. Before discretionary pension contributions, we now expect operations to generate $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion, with free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion.","Looking ahead to next year, there is substantial uncertainty regarding federal budgets, including whether sequestration will occur, and if so, how it would be implemented. We believe that sequestration would not apply to obligated program funds that are currently in our funded backlog, but there's little doubt that the long-term impact of sequestration would be highly detrimental to national security and our industrial base. The short-term impacts, should sequestration take effect in January, are more difficult to assess given the lack of specific implementation detail. As a result, we're preparing for a wide range of budget outcomes. But under any scenario, we expect that as currently provided for under the Budget Control Act, sequestration would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows for our company and our industry over the long-term.","Now in addition to sequestration and the potential impacts of the other fiscal cliff issues, we're now working under a 6-month continuing resolution. This CR is more challenging than in previous years in that there appear to be virtually no exceptions for  new program starts, which includes new tasks on IDIQs and increases in production quantities. There's also limited ability to effectively shift programming -- shift funding between programs as has been done in the past to mitigate execution issues. There's no certainty when we'll have a formal 2013 budget, and it is possible that the CR would need to be extended, which would be an additional source of uncertainty for us and our customer community. So as we think about next year, our outlook is clouded by these challenges. How all these issues are resolved will determine the degree to which our top line is impacted. However, under any reasonable scenario, we would expect lower 2013 sales as a result of the CR restriction on new starts, along with the other constraints our customers are facing. We will be providing our detailed 2013 guidance when we announce our fourth quarter and year-end earnings.","In closing, it was a very good quarter, and we expect a strong finish to the year. Obviously, looking ahead to 2013, there is a high degree of uncertainty, as I said. But we believe we are taking the right steps in the current environment by bringing innovative, affordable solutions to support our customers' needs. And we believe we can continue to create value by remaining focused on our key priorities; performance, cash deployment and portfolio. So now, I'll turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Jim?","James F. Palmer","Thanks, Wes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Highlights for the quarter were outstanding cash generation and strong, consistent segment operating margin rates. This performance, combined with share repurchases, generated this quarter's 6% increase in quarterly pension-adjusted earnings per share. Now, let's spend a few minutes looking at some of the details behind the results. Those results reflect our continued focus on program execution and aggressive cost management and reduction activities. Although operating income declined by the $66 million change in the net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment, on a pension-adjusted basis, our operating margin rate expanded 20 basis points to 11.2%.","In addition to the pension impacts, operating income also reflects lower volume, which was partially offset by an improvement in corporate and allocated expenses. EAC adjustments for the quarter were a net positive $214 million versus $196 million in the prior year third quarter. The primary driver of the change was a $38 million reduction in unfavorable performance adjustments compared to last year's third quarter.","Based on our year-to-date performance, we now expect a 2012 segment operating margin rate of approximately 12%, with a total operating margin rate in the high 11% range. As I mentioned, cash results for the quarter were simply outstanding. During the quarter, we did make a $300 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans which, after tax considerations, reduced third quarter cash from operations and free cash flow by $221 million. Year-to-date, cash from operations is more than $500 million ahead of last year's pace and free cash flow is nearly $700 million higher. Given that performance, we are raising our guidance for 2000 cash from operations and free cash flow. But in doing so, I should caveat that by noting that our guidance does not contemplate any and unusual year end customer behavior due to pending issues such as the debt ceiling, the fiscal cliff, or potential sequestration.","Turning to the sectors, Aerospace third quarter sales increased $131 million, or 5%. We continue to see growth in our Unmanned Systems portfolio, principally due to the ramp-up on programs such as NATO AGS and Fire Scout. Military aircraft sales also increased due to higher F-35 volume, which includes deliveries of the first units under the LRIP 5 program for F-35. You will recall that we adopted the units of delivery revenue recognition for F-35, LRIP 5 and we are now recognizing LRIP 5 revenues with the commencement of the deliveries in this quarter.","Higher volume for Unmanned and Military Aircraft was partially offset by lower sales for Space System programs, including some restricted programs and the impact of the DWSS termination in the fourth quarter of last year. Aerospace operating income declined by 2%, resulted in operating margin rate of 11.1% for the quarter, compared to 12% for last year's quarter. The major change in the margin rate is the transition to the lower margin multi- year 3  contract on the F-18. For the year, we expect Aerospace sales of about $9.9 billion with a margin rate in the mid-to-high 11% range.","Electronic system sales declined by $198 million or 10% due to lower revenue in postal automation, combat avionics, infrared countermeasures and laser systems. Postal automation includes the de-emphasis of our domestic postal automation business, as well as a softening in the international postal sales in Europe.","Combat sales -- Combat Avionics sales declined due to lower unit deliveries for several programs, including the F-22. And Infrared Countermeasures and Laser System programs declined due to force reductions in overseas contingency operations. These declines were partially offset by higher volume for some Space Systems programs. ES operating income declined 5% and operating margin rate increased 90 basis points to 16.3%. You may recall that last year's third quarter included a $25 million provision for the domestic Postal Automation Program, and without that provision, last year's operating margin rate would be comparable to this year. For the year, we expect ES revenues of approximately $7 billion, with a margin rate of low-to-mid 16%, up from our prior guidance of low-to-mid 15%.","Information Systems sales declined $179 million or approximately 9% for the quarter. About $100 million of that is due to the wind down or completion of programs, including JTRS AMF and several restricted programs. Another $30 million is associated with in-theater force reductions and finally, the sale of Park Air Norway impacted third quarter sales by $17 million. The balance reflects just general market softening due to the uncertainty of the budget environment and the shorter cycled nature of our IS business.","Consistent with third quarter sales trends, IS operating margin declined 9%. Our operating margin rate was unchanged at 9.6%. For the year, we now expect IS sales of approximately $7.3 billion, and we continue to expect a 10% operating margin rate for IS for this year.","Turning to Technical Services, third quarter sales fell 6%, largely due to lower volume for the KC-10 program. Our previously announced portfolio of shaping actions in Defense and Government Services also reduced third quarter sales. And on an absolute basis, TS operating income was comparable to the prior year, with operating margin rate expanding 40 basis points to 8.3%, due to improved program performance.","For the year, we now expect TS sales of approximately $3 billion, with margin rates in the high 8% range. On a consolidated basis, we're looking for 2012 sales of approximately $25 billion, and we are increasing our segment operating margin guide rate guidance to approximately 12%, with total operating margin rate guidance to the high 11% range.","Now, let's spend a few minutes talking about everybody's favorite subject, 2013 pension. I should remind you that there are a number of assumptions that are -- that we determine at the end of the year that will principally affect FAS pension cost in 2013. Two of those key assumptions that are critical are the actual return on investment assets in 2012, and then the discount rate used to discount pension liabilities at the end of the year.","Now through September 30, our actual asset return, investment return is approximately 10%, compared to our expected long-term rate of return of 8.25%. And I think you will recall that for every 100 basis points above or below the expected rate of return affects 2013 FAS expense by $40 million. And if we had to set the discount rate at September 30, we would likely be looking at about 100 basis points lower than what we've used to discount liabilities last year.","And again, just a reminder that I think you know that we are required to set all of these assumptions at the end of the year. And so with a little over 2  months to go, we may continue to see volatility, particularly in interest rates, due to matters such as the pending fiscal cliff or global economic factors. But again, for modeling purposes, just a reminder, every 25 basis points change in the discount rate impacts 2013 FAS expense by about, anywhere in the $75 million to $80 million range.","So at the start of the year, and again a reminder, we had estimated our 2013 net FAS\/CAS income to be about $250 million. And obviously, that estimate had assumed no change in the discount rate or asset returns above or below the long-term rate of return assumption of 8.25%. Our estimate for CAS for next year has not changed much but obviously, interest rates and plan asset returns, among other assumptions, will have a significant impact on 2013 FAS expense. Well Stephen, in closing, I would say a very strong operational performance that we've seen for the first 2 quarters, continues into the third quarter. Expect a strong finish to the year. As I said, strong cash flow. So bearing any unusual customer behaviors resulting from the uncertain budget environment, I think we're going to have a strong finish to the year. So with that, I think we're ready for Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius","Thanks, Jim. [Operator Instructions]  Frances, we are ready to begin the Q&A process.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wes, I know you alluded to 2013. You'd have some top-line pressure, regardless of the sequestration situation that evolves. Curious, could you comment on the margin side, Jim or Wes? Regardless of -- or let's assume, no sequestration. What kind, if any, headwind on the margin side we should anticipate? Obviously, you had a strong performance on EACs and the negative EACs continue to come down. Just don't know how much more opportunity there is for the unfavorables to come down. If you can kind of elaborate, maybe just at the high level?","James F. Palmer","Myles, let me give you a range of thoughts here. Clearly, 2012, we've had a benefit from the cost reduction activities we've undertaken over the last year and a half in terms of our existing backlog. Some of that backlog continues to have those benefits on a go-forward basis. Secondly, I would observe that the contracting environment is -- it's a little more difficult that it has to been in the past. It means that we got to be diligent about terms and conditions and contract structure. And most importantly, it means that we have to do what we are charged to do, manage our programs. Thirdly, we do take a look every year at long-term rate of return assumptions for our 4 business areas. I'm very comfortable with where we are, but we'll take another look at that. Based on what we see, as in -- as performance in the industry. And we may revise or we may continue to hold the long-term rate of return assumptions that we have today. But again, I feel very good about where we are in terms of the businesses. Clearly, our job is to do better than those long-term rate of return assumptions and we've been able to do that over the last couple of years, basically through a combination of affordability initiatives and then managing the programs. And then finally, we're not standing still. We continue to take actions to improve affordability within the company, which again, it will give us an advantage on the existing backlog even for new contracts that we negotiate today. So in summary, I would say just outstanding performance from the team for this year, and we feel good about the long-term view of the businesses and what the margin ought to be able to generate. And it's up to us to manage our programs.","Operator","[Audio Gap]","the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm interested on the -- in thinking about the top-line outlook, because if you look at what you all have done over the last few years in terms of reshaping the portfolio, exiting some businesses, ramping down some things like activities in the postal automation area. And then OCL funding coming down. So you've had some things that have taken the top line down. A few contract inflations [ph] . So are we at a point where you can sort of reset the business? And if we set sequestration aside, are we at a point where, as you look forward, are we looking at something that's stable, declining or even maybe some modest growth out over the next few years?","Wesley G. Bush","Doug, let me frame it this way. If we look at 2013 in particular, clearly sequestration is a big, big variable in all of this so, but to the point of your question, if we set it aside, the other reality that we are dealing with now is this continuing resolution, 6 month CR. And it's a pretty tight CR in terms of the way that it's crafted. It puts an enormous number of constraints on our customer community, with respect to what they can do on new starts or transitions into production, or even under IDIQs. So given that, that appears to be at least a 6-month concern, and that will put negative pressure on the top line, sort of across the board. That's going to be a fact of life that we're dealing with. So ultimately, stability in our top line will go sort of hand-in-hand with greater stability and how the government is appropriating and executing the budgets that are allocated for defense, and the other agencies that we serve. The other factor though that I would say, needs to be considered, even if you set aside sequestration, is just how much money is going to be allocated for defense, ultimately in the budget environment? We all know that there is a substantial deficit situation, and that there are some tough decisions that lie ahead to be made regarding the outcomes for each component of that budget. So it's a little unclear today, from where we are, how to predict, how that will go. But to the point that you made, we feel good about how our portfolio is positioned in that regard. We feel that we've done a good job of getting aligned on priorities. So when those budgets get set, it's our expectation that our portfolio will do well in a relative sense against those priorities. The other longer-term opportunity for the company continues to be on the international side. As you know, our international sales, historically have been largely confined to our Electronics business. And while we've been very pleased with those sales and the team at Electronics has done a great job of making those sales very effective for us, we see additional opportunities emerging, particularly in our Aerospace Systems business, but also in IS and TS as we take a broader look and engage with our DoD customers in terms of their strategy on what they would like to see our partners around the globe, be able to do. We see a growing push to take some of the capabilities that historically we've had some challenges exporting. We see a growing push to make those more available to our partners. So that's not the near-term thing. It takes a while to get those through the policy arena and then actually execute it in terms of specific programmatic decisions. But we also see our portfolio as being well-aligned for some of the important thrusts that we see from an emerging policy perspective and supporting our allies around the globe.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm sorry to kind of try and do 2 parts here, but just Wes, just to continue on the continuing resolution question, isn't the absolute level of the CR higher than what the original request is? And so wouldn't that actually, in some ways, be beneficial? And maybe you can talk about some of the starts that you expected this year that get pushed out.","Wesley G. Bush","Well, it is just very slightly higher in a total magnitude sense, but what ultimately counts is what the constraints are that get implemented program by program. So you have to sort of peel that apart. And I -- we're all glad that the total number for the CR was a good number relative to the President's budget. But when it comes to executing programs, particularly programs that are in any form of transition, if it's a transition from development to production, if it's an IDIQ contract where you're finishing off a task, an order on an IDIQ contract and they want to issue a new task. And, if you're just looking at the broader set of constraints that went with -- and this was a very tightly prescribed CR. More tightly than we have seen in the past. So that, that was really the comment that I had on why that is an issue relative to how the top line will work out. Just about every program in our community has a fair amount of variability around where the funding is coming from, what the line items are. And when you start putting those types of constraints on it, it does have implications on what our customers can do. So that's all of our hope that we move through this CR as expeditiously as we can and get a real piece of legislation that really does the appropriations the way they need to be done so that our customer community can go and execute on their mission. That's our, I would say at a, the top-level, our primary concern. I think it tends to impact our shorter cycle businesses more dramatically, but even some of our more substantial programs that are making that transition from design into production could be impacted by those constraints, depending on the timing of the actual appropriations language and how long we actually live under this CR environment.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask, when I'm looking at the balance sheet, it looks like you'll end the year close to or in a small net cash position. Rates are particularly low out there right now. I wonder how you just think about the right level of balance sheet utilization. And there's obviously plenty of uncertainty ahead, particularly in the near-term, but you could add a significant amount to the balance sheet and still keep your leverage metrics fairly low? Or perhaps you just want to wait until the sequestration outcome is resolved? But if you could just speak to how you're thinking about that, probably that'd be very helpful.","James F. Palmer","You're correct, Noah, in your observation. We have a very conservative balance sheet at this point in time. We view flexibility as very important. The cash balances provide us that flexibility in this uncertain environment. Having some certainty around future budget outlooks would be really important. We're mindful of where interest rates are. We've watched that very carefully. I don't know that we're going to see a significant change in interest rates in the near-term. I'd like to believe that we are, but I doubt that we are. So I think that the market flexibility will likely remain for a reasonable period of time, that if we wanted to take advantage of that, we would have the opportunity. But in today's environment, having the flexibility that our capital structure reflects today is really important.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'd like to get back to a strategic question that is not new, but just to get your latest thinking on it for either or both of you. It has to do with share repurchase. You guys are continuing to -- it's your primary use of free cash flow. It's about half of what you're looking for in terms of cash flow before pension contributions this year, is what you're on track to do. And you're indicating that sales are going to face pressure next year. You're indicating that margins are still above their long-term rate. And so, when you evaluate the value in your stock to repurchase it, and I'd just like to maybe get an update on how you think about doing that, and how you plan to modulate your repurchase activity based on where your stock is?","Wesley G. Bush","Joe, it's Wes. I touched on this a little bit in my remarks, and I think it's important to be clear about how we think about this. As I said in my remarks, we are a long-cycle business and when we think about this, we're looking at longer-term value. We're a business that generates good cash flows. And as we assess how that's going, in terms of how the market is valuing our shares, we play that directly into our own model of long-term value creation. And our assessment is that share repurchases have, continue to be, a very, very good use of our cash. In fact, as I pointed out in my remarks and as we announced a few weeks ago, the board increased our remaining share repurchase authorization to $2 billion to make sure that we've got appropriate flexibility as we go forward. So we continue to look at share repurchase as a very good use of our cash. We clearly compare that to all the other alternative uses. And first and foremost, we always make sure that we're investing appropriately in our business to make sure that we are realizing that the opportunities that are represented by the strength of our portfolio. So that is always our primary thinking. We pay a lot of attention to our pension plan to make sure that it is in good funding condition, and we continue to do that, you saw that just here in the quarter we made an additional investment in our pension plan. And I think we've been in a good place on our dividend, we raised our dividend 10% this year. And when we mix all those things together, we like what we've been doing on share repurchase. We do think it is a very good use of our -- of the cash flows that we're generating. And like the opportunity that it presents for value creation in our company. Jim, was there any other perspective you'd like to add to that?","James F. Palmer","I would just reiterate your comments. We continue to have a balanced cash deployment strategy, investing in the business, managing our balance sheet and returning any excess cash to our shareholders. And traditionally, our dividend and share repurchases kind of have been in a 20% ratio for dividends, the balance in share repurchases, if you look back over a quite a bit, a long period of time, absent last year's large share repurchases after the spinoff of Shipbuilding. So -- you and I are in the same place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from RBC Bank.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm not sure if it was Jim or Wes, one of you mentioned about the shorter cycle areas of your business being a bit weak in the quarter. I was wondering if you could quantify maybe how much this might be down, and if you expect this to perhaps catch up at some point in the future? And also, if you're seeing increased competition in some of these short cycle areas?","James F. Palmer","Actually, book-to-bill ratios in the -- both on a quarter and a year-to-date basis are essentially around 1, or above 1, and I think in all of our businesses, except TS, we're at 0.97 on a year-to-date basis. So frankly, compared to last year, at this point in time, our book-to-bill is ahead of where we were.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, I think one of the comments we made earlier was, as we look ahead into the CR environment, we do have a little bit more concern about some of the shorter cycle businesses given the constraints on new starts, if you will. And the CR has been implemented, so that sort of programmatic funding issue that we would have, that I think would manifest in the shorter cycle businesses. But as I pointed out, it can even impact our longer cycle businesses at the point that programs are transitioning in some way that would be impacted by the constraints of the continuing resolution.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You have changed your focus on bidding, it seems, Wes, and maybe for a moment you might want to talk about that? And it looks like it's impacting, maybe your capital spending as well? In a sense, it's much more information technology. It may be less capital-intensive, and more intellectual-intensive?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, our focus in our bidding has really been to make sure that we are pursuing the business base  that will be high-quality business for the longer-term, for the company. And your point within our Information Systems business is right on. We have, over time, transitioned that business from a business that had a much greater fraction of, sort of lower commodity businesses to a much higher end, more intellectual capital, much more engineering-content business. That's a transition that's been underway just these last few years, and I think that's serving us well. It allows us to be very thoughtful about where we are, applying our resources, both our capital as well as our internal R&D and then proposal investments. And it's allowed us to make sure that the businesses that we pursue there really have some form of competitive, sustainable, competitive differentiation that generates value, so that we're not just turning them over, in a very quick mode as we would often see in the lower end commodity businesses. We've been making that transition in Technical Services as well. And over the last couple of years of really fundamentally transformed the portfolio of businesses within something ES, to go after the areas that require more intellectual capital, if you will, around modernization or some of the training solutions. Or even in the services side of that, the areas that require the broader applications or the capabilities we bring forward as a company. So that transition has been underway. It continues, still, a little bit, but I think we've come much of the distance we needed to go to make that transformation. I like where it positions us in the marketplace when it comes to the areas of highest priority for us to pursue, the things that we've talked about extensively. Cyber Security is a good example of that. The modernization work that we're doing in Technical Services is another good example of that. So it's been an important shift for us. Jim, anything you'd like to add?","James F. Palmer","I'd just observe, Howard, that the decline in CapEx that you're seeing, you might remember that we moved from California a year ago, bought a building? That's probably the biggest driver in the decline.","Wesley G. Bush","Year-over-year.","James F. Palmer","Year-to-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So just a question on pension. It looks like, with your good return, your underfunding will be down this year. And so that, I mean, by my numbers, if the discount rate went up by something like 50 to 75 bps we might actually be fully -- very fully funded. And so, taking that into account, I mean, do you think it's a good -- do you plan on making more pension contributions next year if we kind of close where we are today? And if so, how do you view the attractiveness or lack thereof of being more than fully funded?","James F. Palmer","I think, Cai, I think there's an advantage to have a very well-funded plan. There are some practical limits to that as well. And so, if and when we see a move-up in interest rates that reduces the liabilities back to, frankly, a move back to more historical levels, you're right, that will significantly improve the otherwise underfunded situation that we see today. Given where interest rates are, not only is a 25 basis point move in discount rate, which we talked about being potentially 100 basis points lower, and contributing to the pension expense of $75 million to $80 million, a 25 basis points move to $750 million of liability, pension liability. So you're right in observing that a move-up if and when we get that in terms of interest rates, will have a significant impact on funded situation of the plans. And we do, just like with a view of the company, this is a long-term decision that we made for providing employee benefits for our employees. We need to think about it in that way. I don't have significant cash contributions. I don't have any -- it might require contributions next year, at this point, look to be in the range of, let's call it $75 million. So not a significant use of cash. But as we've mentioned before, when you think about our cash deployment across the total opportunity set that we see, we clearly want to invest in the business and continue our, I think, leading portfolio. We want to manage the liability side of our balance sheet by both investing in the pension plans when it makes sense. We have debt that matures in only the next couple of years, and so we need to be thinking about what we want to do there, whether we replace it or pay it off when that matures. And then ultimately, we'll return excess cash to shareholders. Our view really hasn't changed, and we need to think about the pension plan on a long-term basis, and if and when we do see changes in interest rates moving up, it will improve the funded situation of the plans and likely will have a similar impact on our required funding.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to drive down a little bit to get a sense from you on sequester and potential sensitivities around that. It would seem that shorter cycle businesses would be the ones that would get hurt the most, the quickest, given the fact that you've got annual renewals on a lot of contracts. And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about it, whether you have visibility on -- kind of what percent of your firm's overall business would -- you would characterize as short cycle at this point, and would be subject to kind of the winds of sequester and the short-cycle nature of pressure that we might see?","Wesley G. Bush","So Jason, let me -- and I appreciate the question because this is an area where, as I mentioned in my remarks, there's a lot of uncertainty, first and foremost about whether or not sequester would happen. But then, should it happen, how that would all roll out. As I think I mentioned in my opening remarks, we would not expect to see obligated funding hit in sequester. It is, I think, the case that it would take a little bit of time for the -- each of the departments and agencies to sort through what they would need to do contractually as a result of sequestration. Just the pure mechanics of that process would be daunting, if I were putting myself in the shoes of our customer community to really deal with such a thing. So it's hard to predict. And so I wouldn't want to get too far off ahead of trying to predict how that would actually work out. But I do think that the principle that you indicated is probably correct, that the services businesses would, if a sequester were to occur and persisted for some period of time, would probably be impacted sooner, in that they have the higher turn rate of their contracting base. And consequently, they burn through the obligated amounts and they encounter a new contract decision more quickly. And also, the customer, more likely, would be in a position where it would be having to deal with those types of contracts sooner than the longer cycle development and production contracts. Although ultimately, if that sequester persisted, all of those things could be under a lot of pressure. So it's a little bit hard for us to come up with some percentages on that. We've done a lot of modeling for different scenarios. I wouldn't want to go on record pinpointing a particular scenario that I thought was most likely, because as I said, this is going to be a very, very dynamic environment. Should we find ourselves in that position of a sequestration actually getting implemented. And it's going to be -- it would be very, very tough on our industry, but I would also say it will be very, very tough on our customer community and the challenges they would face and the decisions they would have to take, none of us envy anybody being in that kind of a position.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to expand on that a bit, Wes, and you say you've evaluated a number of scenarios. I wondered, just to kind of be specific about something that's hard to be specific about, is there a scenario where the impact to revenues, earnings and cash in 2013 is greater than the cut we'd expect to see to DoD outlays in the event of sequestration if, as you stated previously, obligated funds on contract are unaffected. I would think it would be difficult to see an impact of that sort of magnitude, but I wanted to see if you'd agree with that based on what your evaluations of the scenarios show today.","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, I think ultimately, just if you think about the mechanics, there is the factor around the obligated funding that we mentioned and yes, that's sort of a consistent way of thinking about it. But there's also the factor, the real factor of just the time it would take for a turn on contracts and the rest of it. So it probably would not be an overnight thing. It would take a little bit of time to manifest. But the real problem, I would say, is not just an in year issue, it's the long-term impact that would result from the set of actions that would be taken, that would fundamentally disrupt programs and the industrial base in a profound way. And that's why, from our perspective, we've said it a number of times, this would certainly impact sales and profits and cash flows, but we are all as concerned about what it would mean to the stability of the programs, the stability of the industrial base, the people in the industrial base. All of the other aspects that would ultimately translate into the ability to deliver the National Security Solutions. So just working the mechanics of it, and there's a lot of speculation about how mechanics would work. Long-term, I don't think I'd have to speculate when saying that the impacts would be profound, and very, very negative. And it would take us all a long time to turn back the cycle on that. Jim, I don\u2019t know if you want add anything to just some -- part of, from the financial aspects of your thinking on it?","James F. Palmer","All of which I, again, would agree with, and Carter, if you think about the nature of the accounting method percentage of completion, that we and the industry use, essentially significant changes in your cost structure have a cumulative catch-up impact. And so yes, I could imagine a situation where a change in cost structure or revenues by X amount results in a different percentage change in margins for the company or the industry.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Apologies for this, but I want to continue in this direction, mainly because the irony is that while I think most of us think there might be a negotiated settlement here at some point. What's on record is the most onerous outcome. And maybe another way of approaching this, Wes, is how do we think about the dispersion in the outlay form of the FY '13 funds to Northrop, via the request over a chronological time period? So those funds the Northrop would receive, through the President's '13 request, if it were to go through, when do those outlay, in which fiscal years for Northrop? Is it 25% in '14, some number in '15 and '16? How do we think about that?","Wesley G. Bush","Yes, I won't go through the details of that. Obviously, it's been a part of our modeling. It varies, as you might imagine, by the different components of our businesses. Some of the monies that get appropriated, the actual outlays occur over several years, sometimes 2, sometimes 3, and some of the appropriated monies get burned up in the cycle. And you can imagine which of these businesses go with which. So there is a burn through of all of that. I think perhaps though, a bigger question is should our customer community find themselves in a situation where there's been either by overt decision or by failure of the Congress to actually change direction, basically a national conclusion that we're going to do something as draconian is implement a sequester. What actions will our customers have to stand back and do -- take from a broader strategic perspective? So there's kind of the mechanical part of outlays and obligations and all of that. But the real question at that point in time would be strategic. And what the longer-term implications would be of having to rethink a fundamentally much smaller budget within which to execute the national security mission, while the threats around the globe and the issues that our servicemen and women are called upon to execute continues to grow. To me, that's actually the bigger question here. It's not so much the in-year outlays and the implications of the mechanics in 2013, it's -- is where would that take us. And that's what I think we've -- we need to be mindful of.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","I just wanted to get an update. I don't think you've signed a Block 4 contract. You haven't signed Block 5, because Lockheed hasn't either. So how do you decide what to book for profit when you're making these deliveries under those contracts? And then just one other one I'd throw in. Where do you stand with Block 30? It doesn't look like anything's happening in terms of canceling that either.","James F. Palmer","Yes, actually George, we're negotiated on Block 4 and 5. We're negotiated, so we have a good basis for thinking about marginal rates on the contracts.","Wesley G. Bush","George, let me take on the question around Block 30. We continue to work closely with the Air Force on all the blocks of Global Hawk. The Air Force has continued to fly the Block 30s and we continue to support the activity, and we continue to work with them to make sure that all of the capabilities and operational activities that are needed to continue to make that asset valuable to the Air Force and more broadly, valuable to the co-coms, are being implemented. So the category that we continue to work very closely with the Air Force and the combatant commanders continue to ask for the asset to be utilized.","Operator","And your next question is a follow-up from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jim or Wes, one of the other issues that's going to happen with the sequester, I guess, is the civilian workforce also would be cut very sharply. So that probably has as much of an impact on what would happen as anything else. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Wesley G. Bush","It's a very fair way and it's one of our very big concerns. Clearly, the civilian workforce and the DoD and the intelligence community represent an enormous foundation of knowledge and perspective in implementing the National Security Mission which we're all focused on executing. So the concept of a major reduction in that workforce would have very, very long-term implications. It's also a big concern beyond the DoD and something that I think is sometimes not illuminated adequately in this discussion around sequester, half of sequester goes to the DoD and sort of the national security side of the budget. The other half, fully, the other half goes to the other federal agencies. And so we're talking about impacting individuals who support Air Traffic Control, individuals who support all of the federal enforcement agencies and law enforcement agencies across the board. We're talking about potential impacts to food safety, to the activities that are underway to ensure that the nation is able to deal with diseases and epidemics. All those sorts of issues are on the table every bit as much. When you think about those other agencies, they don't have as large a procurement budget as does the national security side of the equation. In a sense, they don't have as large a procurement budget when they go to take this full 50% of the hit, it will translate into even greater impacts on the civilian employees of those agencies. So this a broader set of national issues and national concerns than just the defense community. And I think that deserves more illumination in the debate around the appropriateness of using this very blunt instrument of sequestration to address the fiscal challenges.","Operator","At this time, gentlemen, there are no other questions.

We repurchased nearly 1 million shares in the first quarter. In total, we distributed approximately $400 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in the business, managing the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","We had a number of program highlights at Aerospace Systems during the quarter. Triton completed formal lab testing and a successful first flight of an improved software suite, which should enable Triton's early operational capability deployment in the Pacific next year. These flight tests further demonstrate the value of Triton's ISR capabilities for both the U.S. Navy and international customers.","We successfully flight tested the MS-177 multi-spectral imaging payload on Global Hawk, further expanding its mission capability. This is the first time this sensor has been flown in a high altitude, long range autonomous aircraft and represents a new benchmark in imaging ISR sensors. This flight test follows last year's successful demonstrations of the SYERS-2 sensor and the optical bar camera and further demonstrates Global Hawk's versatility and effectiveness in fulfilling our nation's high altitude ISR mission.","At Mission Systems, our Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, better known as BACN, completed its 10,000th combat mission for the Air Force. BACN continues to provide critical communications capabilities by translating and distributing inventory, video, voice and data to enhance communications and awareness. This is a great example of Northrop Grumman's focus on driving affordable, technologically-sophisticated solutions to meet our customers' needs.","We continue to support Lockheed Martin in the upgrade of F-16s with our SABR radar. We're supporting upgrades for international customers with delivery of production SABR radars beginning late last year. In addition, we're working with the U.S. Air Force in support to NORTHCOM Joint Urgent Operational Need for F-16 radar upgrades.","At Technology Services, we began work as an integrated subcontractor to Honeywell for the management and operations of Sandia National Laboratories. We have robust domestic and international opportunities across our three sectors. At AS, we're addressing opportunities on the Air Force's Joint STARS Recap, the Navy's MQ-25, new Space programs and a variety of international opportunities for Autonomous Systems. We're also pursuing the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program.","At MS, we continue to pursue SABR radar opportunities for both the U.S. Air Force and international customers. MS is also competing for the radar program on Joint STARS Recap, as well as for a number of significant restricted opportunities and international programs.","At Technology Services, we continue to pursue a range of programs including international opportunities in Australia and the Middle East, as well as sustaining opportunities for our international Global Hawks.","As we look ahead, adequate and reliable defense funding will be critical to executing our country's national security missions and maintaining our military superiority. While we are encouraged that increases in defense spending are broadly supported, it's clear that our customers are challenged in executing their national security missions under a prolonged continuing resolution, and with the potential threat of a government shutdown or a debt ceiling breach. Our ability to maintain our nation's military superiority is also threatened when a lack of reliable funding precludes the ramp up or start of critically important programs.","Looking beyond the relatively near-term issues of the CR and the debt ceiling, I do think it's important to put into perspective the broader trend lines in our national security community. Simply using the top line budget for DoD discretionary spending including OCO as a proxy, we saw DoD appropriations peak and in 2010 at a then year level of $690 billion.","Over the following years we saw a 16% decline in the top line, reaching a level of $580 billion in 2016. It's now clear that our nation needs to address a variety of national security issues, the readiness of our forces, the aging of our strategic deterrent, the dramatically increased vulnerability of our space assets, all compounded by the ever increasing military sophistication, and apparent determination of our potential adversaries.","In his budget outline for 2018, the President has put forward an increased DoD budget, including OCO of $639 billion, reflecting the need to address these and other national security issues.","The supplemental request for 2017 was also an indication of this focus. Recognizing that any new administration has a limited opportunity to refine the next year budget input only a few months into its time in office, the better indication of the vector of national security investment will be the 2019 budget submittal, which will be the first time a more broadly populated team in the new administration has the ability to put its imprint on a comprehensive approach to addressing the national security challenges.","The 2019 budget proposal also will be able to reflect inclusions of critical assessments now underway, such as the Nuclear Posture Review. We all recognize that there are many budget issues to be addressed, but that we need, and that we need, to ensure the broader investments in our country are supported while we tend to these security concerns. But my view is that, absent some dramatic event, we should expect a modest upward trend for the foreseeable future in national security spending. And it's important for industry to play its part in this process by investing in capability and driving on affordability to ensure our customers receive the most value from our nation's investment. We're doing exactly that at our company. And I believe, it will serve our shareholders well for the long-term.","Let me wrap up by reiterating that I am pleased with our strong start to the year. This quarter's results support our ongoing strategy of driving performance to enable us to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth and value creation.","So, now, I'll turn the call over to Ken, for a more detailed discussion of results and guidance. Ken?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll add my thanks to our team for the strong start to the year.","First, first quarter results included higher sales, higher segment operating income and solid margin rates, as well as improvements in net FAS\/CAS pension expense and taxes that altogether drove very strong EPS results for the quarter. First, I'll review the sectors' results and sector guidance and then cover pension, taxes and then allocated corporate expenses and their impact on guidance.","Aerospace Systems sales were up 13% for the quarter with Manned Aircraft again being the primary growth driver as we ramp up on restricted activities. Two additional F-35 deliveries also contributed to higher Manned Aircraft volume in the quarter.","Autonomous Systems volume was up slightly as sales on Triton and several other programs offset declining NATO AGS volume as aircraft production nears completion. Space volume was comparable to the prior year with an underlying trend of growth and our restricted activities largely being offset by declining sales in non-restricted programs like Advanced EHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.","Aerospace Systems' first quarter operating margin rate was 10.8% and reflects the increased amount of development volume for Manned Aircraft. For 2017, we continue to expect AS revenue in the low to mid $11 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 11%, no change to prior guidance.","Moving to Mission Systems, sales rose 2% in the quarter driven by increased sensors and processing volume. The primary volume drivers included all three F-35 sensors as well as JCREW. First quarter operating income was unchanged, operating margin rate was slightly lower at 12.9% and reflects the timing of risk reductions on Advanced Capabilities programs partially offset by improved performance on Cyber and ISR programs. For 2017, we continue to expect MS revenue in the low $11 billion range with a mid to high 12% operating margin rate, no change to prior guidance.","At Technology Services, first quarter sales declined 2% due to the completion of several programs and lower volume on KC-10. TS had higher operating income, which reflects improved performance across several programs in Global Logistics and Modernization and System Modernization and Services.","For 2017, we continue to expect Technology Services sales in the mid $4 billion range with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%, no change to prior guidance. First quarter segment operating income increased 4% and segment operating margin rate was 11.6% consistent with our guidance. We continue to expect a mid 11% segment operating margin rate for the year, no change from prior guidance. Total operating margin rate for the quarter was 13.3%, largely due improvements in net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment.","I would note that we are updating our guidance for the net FAS\/CAS pension adjustment. We now expect FAS of $460 million versus our prior guidance of $485 million. CAS guidance is unchanged at $960 million, which gives us an updated net FAS\/CAS estimate of $500 million for 2017. Also, keep in mind that estimated CAS won't be finalized until we complete our annual demographic study in the third quarter.","In addition, we continue to work on CAS affordability items, particularly to the extent they also reduce required funding over the next few years. We continue to expect unallocated corporate spends of $200 million for the year and a total operating margin rate in the mid-12% range, no change to prior guidance.","Turning to tax, we updated our 2017 guidance, largely to reflect some Q1 discrete items. In addition to a $47 million benefit related to employee share-based compensation, we recognized a $42 million benefit for the resolution of our 2012 and 2013 federal tax returns, as well as $22 million in additional research credits on prior-year returns.","As a result, we are reducing our expected 2017 effective tax rate to approximately 27.5% versus our prior guidance of approximately 29.5%. We continue to expect a weighted average share count of approximately 175 million shares for 2017, which is a reduction of about 3%.","Just a few comments on our cash results and our expectations for the full year. Cash from operations and free cash flow were consistent with our typical quarterly pattern. Cash used in operating activities increased to $439 million from $60 million due to increases in trade working capital. We continue to expect cash flows will be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, with free cash flow ending up in a $1.8 billion to $2 billion range after capital expenditure of approximately $900 million, no change to prior guidance.","So in summary, it was a solid start to the year and we look forward to continued strong performance from our team for the remainder of the year. Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Ken. As we open the line for Q&A, I would like each participant to limit themselves to a single question. If you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue. Bettina?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Thank you so much, and good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I thought \u2013 just checking my notes here. I thought maybe we could start off with the export side of things. You mentioned there were a number of opportunities across the three divisions. What's your expectation for the share of exports could be in the orders in the backlog maybe for this year and going forward?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So broadly we see quite a few opportunities across the international market place. I took your question to be exports, did I hear you correctly?","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","That's right.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Oh! Good, good. Let me just kind of walk through each of the sectors and say a little bit about some of the opportunities that we see that we're out aggressively addressing. I think everyone is familiar with the growth in the high altitude long endurance opportunity space for Aerospace Systems and that's really been an interesting market evolving over the last number of years with both Japan and Korea and of course with NATO AGS adopting variance of the Global Hawk platform.","As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we get Triton underway for the Navy, we are seeing increased attention and interest in that platform around the globe really starting with Australia. I think Australia has been at the forefront of engaging with the Navy and thinking broadly about how that type of capability would really support their security missions from Australia. So, I continue to be quite positive on high altitude long endurance as an important capability for our allies. And as we continue to grow the capabilities of that platform, I think that will only continue to be the case.","Of course, at AS we're also addressing the fighter aircraft opportunity space that's out there through our partnerships with the Lockheed and with Boeing. F-35 is on the ramp-up on the international side and that represents a really good set of opportunities as well as just continuing opportunity space on F-18.","And finally on the Aerospace side, I would also mention the E-2D platform. We have seen so far Japan engage with its \u2013 steps forward in that program and reflecting back on our experience with E-2C a number of years ago. We would expect the E-2D to be an attractive international opportunity over the next decade or so.","At MS, there are just a whole variety of opportunities ranging from the radar activities that I mentioned in my prepared remarks on SABR to a whole variety of things that include C4I systems and air defense systems around the globe. We're careful obviously about which ones of those we take on. We tend to use more of a model where we've demonstrated the capability in the U.S., for the U.S. services. And then ensure that we're deploying a compatible capability with our allies. But the MS marketplace continues to expand, particularly, as we have over the last year or slightly more now, have been focused on this integrated capability that we've created at MS are bringing together the sensors and the software capabilities that go with it.","TS has a variety of capabilities largely associated with sustainment. So, the sustainment of our Global HALE platforms around the globe cause the TS to take on for us. And as we have continued to build up our footprint, our sustainment footprint around the globe, we're taking on some additional platforms through those facilities and capabilities that we both created ourselves in a couple of places, such as in Australia, we've acquired. So the sustainment profile, as we look forward to TS, is an exciting opportunity for us.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","And I'll just add to that, Wes, and say that, Rob, when we think about international sales, it is an important part, and Wes has gone through the details, of our growth opportunities over the long-term. And I would just say that from a 2017 perspective, we expect it to be relatively flat as a percentage of our sales, but I would point out that reflects growth in the international business as the domestic side of the business is growing as well. And I will say that looking at the international sales quarter-over-quarter, first quarter this year to first quarter last year, we did see growth there. So that reflects we are on the path that we expect.","I think you had a question about backlog and international, and how it would impact backlog and I don't have that number in front of me. I would just say that, obviously, international deals take longer to close and I'm not sure we want to commit to a number there is going to \u2013 it's a longer term pursuit, it takes more time, it will be a growing part of our business and I'd be happy to discuss our ultimate backlog numbers when we get to the end of the year.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Just one other thing I would add as well in the international side. The Department of Defense is very focused on ensuring that their \u2013 that the support to our allies is robust when it comes to these capabilities and as we are continuing the strong focus on affordability, I think there is a broad recognition that the opportunity to export from the U.S. off of the existing product lines here, continues to help with affordability on the U.S. based product line.","So, it supports the department's objectives in a number of ways, supporting the allies first and foremost, but also in helping to make the production lines themselves more cost effective and affordable for the U.S. customers. So I am delighted to see that strong focus.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","That's great. Thank you very much.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Matt.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Matt.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, you've called out the mix impact on Aerospace Systems margins for the quarter and I wonder if you could share how that changes over the balance of the year, but then more importantly into 2018 and 2019?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Matt. I would say that our expectations are that the mix that we are seeing in the first quarter is likely to be relatively consistent across the year. AS is a long cycle business and I think that where we see the mix is probably consistent with where it will be for 2017.","For 2018 and beyond, I wouldn't want to comment too much about it because we're only guiding for 2017, but I will say if you think about the long-term business at Aerospace it has a growing complement of both development and production work, the development side, I would say, not only on the Manned Aircraft side but also in Space.","And from a production perspective, Wes mentioned F-35, Triton now into production, so growing opportunities on the production side. And long-term, that the mix will be driven by what rate the particular programs move at. And the further we get out, the harder it is to predict on a program by program basis. But for 2017 I would say, we're largely on the path that we expected to be on at this point in the year. And with that being said, we think it supports the guidance that we gave and that's why we're holding on the AS guidance for the year.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I would just add as we think about the out-years, there is obviously a dependency on the extent to which we're successful in capturing some of the new development work. We are primarily focused our capture activities around new business work that starts off on a cost plus side which often times has some negative pressure on the mix equation.","But there are some very important opportunities on the horizon that I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are competing for and believe represent really good business propositions for our company as we take on that development, and ultimately translate it into production at higher margin rates. So, that will enter into the actual outcomes and the out-years that you had asked about, Matt, the degree to which we are successful in capturing some of these additional business opportunities.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. And maybe just a quick follow-up to that point, what's the latest on the MQ-25? And I think requirements have changed a little bit, but what's your expectation for timing and how you are positioned on that program?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So the Navy, obviously, has to sort its way through its timing in getting to a decision on releasing an RFP and the rest. We, like a few others, are doing the initial study work to support the Navy in that process. So I wouldn't want to get ahead of the Navy's thought process in getting to an RFP on that. But it's one that, as you know, that general class of capability is an area that we've been very proactive in for some time; whether it's been the work we've been doing broadly in Autonomous Systems or with the general class of capability that goes with the intended missions there.","So, it's an important one for our focus and we'll simply have to see how the Navy decides to proceed with an actual procurement on it.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Myles.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Myles.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just wondering if I could ask on the space side within Aerospace Systems. You've got this transition going on right now where the white space is coming down, the classified is going up and the two things are more or less neutralizing. It sounds like Lockheed is seeing more or less the same thing, they \u2013 improves their expectation a little bit on the white world as not being not quite as bad, but they're also thinking about inflection into 2018. And I'm just curious as you think about your space transition between the different growth rates of the white space and the classified space, are you similarly seeing this as a one year phenomena and growth after here?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, Myles, as we look at the unclassified part of our space business, we really see that transition occurring, tipping more in 2019 as we kind of look at the phasing of the programs that the customers have indicated they expect. Whether that might come a little bit earlier is always a possibility depending on what the budgetary profiles turn out to be. But our current thinking is that the unclassified side of our Space business is going to be more like 2019 before we see that inflect.","That said, to your point, the other side, the restricted side of our Space business is continuing to do well and is obviously an important part of our overall Space portfolio. And when we look at that total mix, we're quite pleased with what we have in our Space business.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. (27:27)","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I would just remind you. I would just remind you as well that we do manage it as a single business. We tend to be able to talk more about the non-restricted space than the restricted, which is why it sometimes sounds like it's two businesses. But it is one business. We manage it as one, share resources across the multiple programs, and definitely a business that has long-term growth prospects. And we're excited about what we bring to the opportunities there.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Absolutely.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I'll stick to one. Thanks.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Myles.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon, everybody.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Noah.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, just as one quick follow-up to Myles' question there. If it's possible to quantify what the classified is growing versus what the unclassified is shrinking there, that would be helpful to think about the longer-term trajectory. But then, I also wanted to ask on cash flow, just decent amount of focus there today given the quarter, even though it's seasonally weak and the year being sub 100% conversion from net income. But it looks like that is entirely the CapEx increase. So, I guess the question is, how long does it look like that? What do 2018 and 2019 free cash-to-net income conversion and CapEx, specifically, look like?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, now, I don't know that I can put a number on the split on the Space business given the nature of those \u2013 the nature of those numbers, I guess, I would say. So, not a piece of information I'm able to share on the call.","In terms of the cash flow question, I would just say that it is consistent with our quarterly profile to start-off the year with a relatively slow \u2013 slow start to the year from a cash perspective and we start to make it up in the second quarter and then really strong second half.","And you're right that that in terms of our ability to convert free cash flow \u2013 or net income into free cash flow is largely driven by our CapEx investments as we invest for future growth of the business. And I don't know that I could put a number on it or I would want to put a number on it for you today. But I will say that, we've got a growing cash profile. We will be long-term generators of cash. We're focused on profitable growth in the business. We expect to convert that growth into cash from operations and we've talked about a couple more years of investing in an elevated manner from a CapEx perspective. But as a percentage that should start to decrease as we're on our profitable growth trajectory. That's probably about all I can say on that one. So I hope that answers the question.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Do you have visibility into when elevated CapEx ends and \u2013 and you're just being cautious in sharing it or is it actually just not certain yet depending on exactly how different programs play out and on exactly what else you win?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I would say we have pretty good visibility into what we expect the CapEx numbers to be. And I would just say that about as precise as we want to get is it stays elevated for a couple more years.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And on that Space piece, can you just \u2013 forgetting about the classified business? Can you just quantify the decline \u2013 pace of decline you're seeing in the unclassified business?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","In the unclassified business, I believe that we're looking somewhere between $100 million and $200 million for the year in terms of a decrease. And I think in the first quarter, the unclassified was probably down in the range of $50 million.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good afternoon. Can you tell us where things stand between you and Lockheed on LRIP 11? And they mentioned yesterday, looking to be under a definitized contract by the third quarter. You've got in the past a few LRIPs ahead of them, do you expect that to be the case again or do you expect it to be later on?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Seth, I would just say that we generally don't comment on negotiations that are ongoing with our customers. In terms of any questions on F-35, I'd refer you to Lockheed Martin, but you're right, we continue to work through getting on contract for our pieces of the LRIP 11 of the F-35 program.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolf Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Hunter.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","How are you? Yeah, good thanks. So if you think about Aerospace margins, you mentioned obviously some of the mix impact in the quarter. But as you think about some of the classified work and obviously some other major aircraft programs, is there a scenario where we think we could see these margins kind of staying above the 11% number as you look out maybe over a four, five year planning horizon? Or do you expect a little pressure to drop below that, as just we look out over the next couple of years? Thank you very much.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, I would say that \u2013 I continue to believe that mix is going to be the driver of the margin rates at Aerospace that assumes that we continue our stretch of successful performance and program execution at the sector. And as we look ahead, we do have a growing piece of development work, ultimately that development will transition into production and we have, I think a long run of production work in front of us in terms of F-35, in terms of E-2D, in terms of Triton and other Autonomous Systems.","So, I would expect that the mix would start to move back to a more evenly-weighted or more historical level of production versus development. And therefore, I think in the longer term, there probably is some margin upside from the 11% as we see the move to more production in the out-years. But the question is when as well as the level of development content that we continue to bring in, thinking about MQ-25, thinking about GBSD, thinking about next-gen JSTARS.","So, a lot to play out between now and 2019, 2020, 2021, and a lot of moving parts, a lot of it is exciting. We'd love to bring in that additional development content and work on that in the coming years as well. So, I wouldn't want to commit to a number, but there is certainly the potential for upside with the amount of production and the run that we see in front of us, and just a question of how well that mix plays out.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Okay. And then, Hunter, let me add. Just let me add from a broader perspective. The thing that we're \u2013 we're measuring as we're moving our way along the curve here is how we're really growing segment operating income. And as we demonstrated this quarter, even with a little bit of downward pressure on rate due to mix, we're seeing a nice translation of the top line into the operating income.","So, as we think about value creation for the long-term, we're going to make sure that we are looking at it in an integrated manner, not just on individual unique rate metrics in one year. As we think about the ability to bring on these new programs and manage this mix, our test for ourselves will be are we really growing the income with it. And so far, so good.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right. Thank you both.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you, Hunter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon, gentlemen.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Carter.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I just \u2013 I want to stick to this whole margin topic again and just sort of get right to the point if I can. I think there is at least some sort of a debate around \u2013 as the business, especially in AS, has become more classified, I think it's harder for the market to get a sense of what the underlying risk profile of the programs are. So without kind of asking the margin directionality, maybe Wes, you could tell us about, when you rack and stack the portfolio and the level of maybe risk and opportunity on the flip side, the way we typically think of it in red programs or green programs or whatever. Maybe give us a sense in that kind of qualitative sense of how you think that the portfolio is positioned today maybe versus a year ago if that's a way to get at it.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. Carter, I think that's a really good question and well framed, and it goes really to the heart of the way that we think about the business pursuits that we elect to go after and then of course, the way we think about executing on the opportunities as we are successful in capturing them.","We have a very disciplined process in the company for evaluating each of the business capture opportunities that are out there. And you've seen us over the years and even just recently with the T-X program, make decisions to not go after certain opportunities because of the way we assess that balance of risk and opportunity.","And as we have been doing now, over the years, what it has allowed us to do is to move into a place where we feel that we're able to effectively manage that right balance of mitigating risk and realizing opportunities. Each year, as we think about setting our guidance at the beginning of the year, we go through a very thoughtful approach of weighing those for the current portfolio, that factors in the way that we guide at the beginning of each year. And also looking at what we anticipate to be that mix for the opportunities that we're pursuing.","So, when I stand back and look at it at kind of an integrated manner, which I think was the thrust of your question. And I think about the mix of the programs that we have today, I think our risk and opportunity balance is kind of where we've been and kind of where we want it to be. And as we are proactively pursuing a number of these other activities, we continue that evaluation process on each and every one of them. And if the final RFP doesn't quite add up to the way we had hoped it might, we don't get too stuck on the idea that we were going to bid something. If it really doesn't add-up, we tend to not pursue it. And I think that's going to continue to be our way of looking at things, so that we can effectively manage this risk and opportunity space.","So that we can do, as I mentioned in response to Hunter's question, we can ensure that as we're growing the top line, that we're really achieving what we're after, which is not top line growth, that we're growing the bottom line. That's the focus of the enterprise and you'll only get there if you're effectively managing those risks and realizing the opportunities. So, I feel good about that balance point and it is something that we work hard to manage proactively.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And if you thought about it in terms of the traditional red program framework. Is there any difference in what you see in the portfolio today versus a year ago or two years ago or any color there?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. No, over last few years, I think we've kept that in the place that we want it to be. If you turn the clock back on us a decade ago, we were not in a good balance place. We had more red than any of those like to have and it really led us to do what we've done over the last number of years of rebalance the portfolio and be a bit more thoughtful, particularly on the capture side of things.","So, I think, we've, over the last number of years, been in a very similar position in terms of that risk and performance profile, the red, yellow, green kind of the assessment. And it's our intention to stay that way.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Awesome. Thanks, Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thank you, Carter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein Research.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","One of the things you mentioned earlier about the \u2013 sort of budget processes. There has been a big emphasis this year on readiness and we've heard service chiefs talk about the need to deal with readiness before we really deal with end strength, in a sense. If we would have see some moves that way where additions to the budget tended to be more oriented toward readiness than acquisition, what would that look like for Northrop Grumman? In other words, how would you participate in that if that a scenario that's attractive to you, could you address that?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah. I'll start and then I suspect Ken would have some commentary to add as well. We do participate on the readiness side of things, about a quarter of our revenue is through the O&M accounts and it's probably not the type of work that gets the big headlines like our platforms or our big center systems. But every time there is a concern about readiness that concern typically flows to things like spares and repairs and all other things that keep the force active and operating. So, it is an important part of the way that we support our customers and we see directly the concerns that our customers are expressing with respect to readiness and their messaging, I think, is very, very appropriate given the concerns of the state of much of the equipment and the overall force structure that's out there.","So, I do anticipate that that is the first priority; I think that's very appropriate. And on its heels of course is the continued focus on the recapitalization which we obviously \u2013 I think it's more clear in looking at our portfolio that we play very directly in the modernization of the forces. But the readiness part of it is something that we are very supportive of in terms of the customer's need and also directly support them in achieving that readiness. Ken, is there anything else you'd want to?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","I think you hit it on that one. Thanks, Wes.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Okay. All right.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So if you saw a move in that direction and we saw more readiness spend, is that also something that would hit you in terms of funding and revenues more quickly than you would see somewhat with the longer-term projects?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yes. Yeah. Doug, you're right. It's a shorter cycle impact than the modernization activities which are longer cycle. That's correct.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yes, thank you very much. So could you tell us approximately when you expect decisions on the major domestic opportunities you've mentioned JSTARS, MQ-25, GBSD, and perhaps also [Technical Difficulty] (44:25). And then just from a broader perspective, are you seeing any of these dates slip to the right because of the administration transition? Thank you very much.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, Cai, I do believe that as we \u2013 it's not so much administration transition, it's the budget uncertainty. We've been in a CR now for a while. Hopefully we'll navigate our way through that here in the relative near term. But as we look at 2018, I think there is some concern about how long it will take to actually get a 2018 budget in place. And the reality is those types of uncertainties do impact our customers in terms of their ability to move out with some of their newer acquisition.","So, if it's a transition of a study phase, that's not such a big number and internally can be sorted through and figured out. But if it's a launch of a major new program, that sometimes does have a delay that results from these budgetary uncertainties. We've observed this over the last number of years. CR is nothing new. Unfortunately, we've seen a, typically no more than about a quarter of CR. We're in, at this point, one of the longest running CRs that I can remember, which is unfortunate. But it certainly does impact the timing of the customer's ability to get out there and actually make source selection decisions.","Most of the \u2013 you asked generally about the timing, many of the award dates for the things that we're looking at now are into the 2018 timeframe. It \u2013 in many cases, that is just a reflection of the cycle time that it takes to go from an RFP through a whole source selection evaluation process, and then, of course, to get modulated by the budget realities. But most of the primary decision points with the exception of IRIS, which appears to still be holding in the second quarter at...","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","So, it's about mid-year.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Mid-year, yeah. But the others are primarily 2018.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Cai.","Operator","Your next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. Excuse me.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Howard.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Ken, I know you point out the seasonality of working capital is always tough in the first quarter and some of it is for obvious reasons, comp benefit payments and so on. But, have you looked at trying to solve that, so that is either more level loaded or adjusted it in some other fashion?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks for the question, Howard. Yeah, we do look at that and we certainly look at how we can generate our cash on a more consistent, and probably as importantly, on a predictable basis. And I would say we've generally done pretty well from a predictable perspective, but we'll probably leave a little more meat on the bone into the second half of the year than we would like.","So we've worked \u2013 I'd say we've worked hard to try to pull as much to the left as we can from a cash perspective. You are right that there are some structural challenges in terms of the timing of certain outflows and things like that. But we work hard to make sure that we commit to what we can deliver. We deliver on those commitments, and we try to be as predictable on doing that as we can because we recognize that we're making significant investments in the company, and we've got to generate the cash in order to be able to do that.","So, predictability is important and I would say that's probably focus number one. And then focus number two is trying to pull it to the left as much as possible. And some years we do better than that and others, last year was a particularly, I wouldn't say strong start to the year, but it was not as slow as this year, certainly. But we know how to get to where we need to get to. We're comfortable with our $1.8 billion to $2 billion guidance for the year. And certainly, something as we put the first quarter behind us, we'll look at rack and stack of all the receivables and inventory, and figure out how we maximize our working capital between now and the end of the second quarter, and then from there to the end of the year.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. I wasn't questioning whether you're going to make the $1.8 billion to $2 billion, it's more of a \u2013 is there some process changes or customer factors. But \u2013 and then also you pointed out or Wes pointed out that SABR had a notable order and urgent need. And this has been a big challenge for you to get the Air Force to buy it for the F-16, could you talk about how this opens up the aperture for that opportunity, and where do you go from there with it?","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Yeah, Howard, it's Wes. I'll touch that one. SABR has a great capability; it is an incredibly affordable upgrade opportunity on F-16, and the Air Force has, over the years, struggled with the total budget picture of all the things they've had on their plate. Trying to fit it in, and make sure that they're doing the right things for the F-16, not just with the radar but with the rest of the capability on F-16. And the time has come, and they're moving forward with it from a due-on perspective.","And I think, it is important as you suggested that this really demonstrates the capability in a broader way, it helps drive the affordability in a broader way. And it is our expectation that we'll see quite a bit of additional international interest on this as a result. So, we're delighted to be working with the Air Force and with Lockheed on this, it's a good partnership all around.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Thanks, Howard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking...","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Jason.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","...the question here.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Jason.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, I just wanted to go back to cash flows and the multi-year outlook and maybe ask the question a little bit different way. Ken I knew, and Wes, you both have talked about an elevated CapEx levels going forward. I was wondering though if you could dive into how customer mix might affect working capital going forward. I know that in the international realm advanced payments can be a bit lumpy. And I know you guys are pretty successful in growing international here over the last few years. Just maybe comment on how that's going to impact cash conversion going forward.","And then anything you're seeing here on the domestic front with regard to payment terms and negotiations with the DoD customers at here or other agencies inside the federal government? Just anything that would \u2013 can change the trajectory, so to speak, of free cash flow conversion would be helpful. Thanks.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Sure. Thanks for the question. I would say first of all let me just address the international piece of the question first. Because as we look at the international growth that we have as a company, it's largely going to be through foreign military sale, those contracts are through the U.S. government and generally do not have significant advance payments on the FMS side.","I think that generally when you're dealing with international contracts, if there are concerns and additional risks you try to get more advance payments, from an FMS perspective, the ultimate customer for us is the U.S. government who contracts with the foreign customer and therefore it tends to be a lower cash risk for us, therefore lower advance payment profile. But I think it's a good trade in today's environment. And so I don't see a big slug of international advances as I look out to our international growth opportunities.","In terms of customer mix, I wouldn't necessarily say that customer is particularly a driver of the cash flow, contract, lifecycle certainly can be \u2013 cost plus contracts tend to be where you collect your cost and bill on them and you get a little bit of a lag depending on how often you bill and how quickly those billings are paid. But there have been some changes to DFAR terms and things like that that can impact some longer cycle programs like aircraft programs and things like that.","So, we've got to make sure that we negotiate appropriate terms for those types of programs and that those \u2013 that change in costs cut in 2013 or so. And so, we're figuring out a deal with that and working hard to make sure that we manage our receivables and networking capital. And I wouldn't want to put a number on it for the long-term, but I will say just as an indicator, we are seeing a growth profile for 2017. We are projecting that we will have a top line growth; certainly we're projecting to be able to have profitable growth over the long-term as well. And we don't see any significant increase in our networking capital balances between now and in the end of 2017. So, hopefully that's an indicator for you of where we can deliver as we move forward.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Bettina, I think we're going to do one more question.","Operator","Okay. And your final question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, good afternoon, Wes and Ken. Thanks for sneaking me in.","Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hi, Peter.","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","Hey, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Just kind of a clarification, you called out in Mission Systems on the service side that you had a little bit of lower volume on a couple of different programs within SABR and ISR. Is this just timing related, I know there is no change to the annual guidance for Mission Systems, but anymore color on what was impacting this, whether it was just program sunsetting or just timing?","Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.","As I look at the mix on that, I would say, Peter that we're largely looking at timing issues. I'm not aware of anything structurally or programmatically or any programs that are sunsetting that are driving volume. I would say most of our services volume tends to be in the Technology Services sector. We are seeing some headwinds there in terms of KC-10 volume and things like that. But I don't think there is anything structural from a Mission Systems perspective that would say there is a particular headwind and anything that's there and nothing jumping to my mind in terms of a pressure, but anything that's there I think is just timing.","Peter J.

Today's call is being recorded. My name is Regina, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Ernst, please proceed.","Todd Ernst","Thank you, Regina and good morning everyone. Welcome to Northrop Grumman's fourth quarter and full year 2019 conference call. We will refer to conference slide that are posted on our IR website this morning.","Before we start, matters discussed on today's call including 2019 guidance and beyond reflect the company's judgment based on information available at the time of this call. They constitute forward-looking statements pursuant to Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws.","Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which are noted in today's earnings release and our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties may also because actual company results to differ materially. Matters discussed on today's call include non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled in our earnings release and supplemental PowerPoint presentation.","Our GAAP results reflect the mark-to-market method of accounting for our pension and other post-retirement benefits. For consistency and comparability of our results in 2020 guidance, our references to adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share on today's call will refer to earnings and EPS adjusted for mark-to-market impact.","These are non-GAAP measures. Our earnings release contained a reconciliation of these non-GAAP operating majors to our GAAP results.","On today's call are Kathy Warden, our Chairman, CEO and President, and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?","Kathy Warden","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We had a strong fourth quarter and good finish to the year. I want to thank the Northrop Grumman team for their continued focus on performance, innovation and agility. It's the dedication of our employees to these priorities that enables us to meet the commitments we make to our shareholders and our customers.","Turning to our results, we met our guidance for segment OM and exceeded our adjusted EPS and cash guidance. Our new business capture drove a 21% backlog increase in 2019, providing a strong foundation for future growth. 2019 sales grew 12% to $33.8 billion benefiting from a full year of innovation system, as well as continued growth at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems.","Full year sales reflect double-digit growth on the F-35 program and growth in restricted activities at all four sectors. Restricted work accounted for more than a quarter of 2019 sales, a double-digit increased over 2018.","Our segment margin rate for the year increased to 11.6%. Strong program performance and cost synergies more than offset margin pressure from early phase development work. Adjusted earnings per share also exceeded guidance at $21.21 for the year.","Turning to cash, I want to congratulate the team on a very strong year. Fourth quarter cash from operations totaled $2.5 billion, and free cash flow was approximately $2 billion. For the full year, cash from operations increased to $4.3 billion and free cash flow was more than $3 billion exceeding the top of our guidance range.","Strong cash enabled effective capital deployment. We invested $1.3 billion in our businesses through capital expenditures, strengthened our balance sheet by retiring $500 million of debt and return $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend by 10% last May and reduce their weighted average share count by approximately 3%.","Business capture was a key highlight of 2019 performance. Net awards totaled more than $45 billion- or 1.3-times sales, and we delivered double-digit backlog growth at all four sectors.","At the macro level, defense spending continues to be a national priority. The fiscal year 2020 investment accounts are up 3% to $251 billion. This increase shows the emphasis being placed on modernization, as called for in the national defense strategy.","The development of capabilities to counter peer adversaries continues to be a priority. Our customers are increasingly focused on rapidly evolving multi domain peer threats in areas like space, hypersonics and missile defense. Our growing share of restricted work demonstrates that our customers are turning to Northrop Grumman for these capabilities.","In 2019, restricted awards totalled nearly $11 billion with approximately $7 billion for restricted space. In addition to restricted awards, we receive several multi-billion-dollar awards for large legacy franchise programs like F-35 and E2D.","We also received awards to transition development programs like Triton, GATOR, IBCS and Kirkum [ph] to work full rate production. We're also pursuing and winning the early phase development work that is the seed corn for the next generation of franchise program.","A good example is AARGM-ER, a high-speed long-range missile, which we expect to be our global customers' air to ground weapon of choice to defeat modern air defence system. We also won a large competitive award to supply new targets and countermeasures to test the ballistic missile defence system. And we expect a solid year for award in 2020.","On January 1st of this year, we began operating in a new sector structure to further align our unique capabilities in space, missile, counter hypersonics, cyber and stealth. It's the next logical step after the acquisition of Orbital ATK to enable capture of revenue synergy and drive profitable growth.","In the new structure, we're bringing together and integrating the relevant capabilities to solve many of the nation's toughest problem. We also introduced our new defining profitable brand, to reinforce the value we're providing through performance, agility, and innovation.","Discovery and innovation are at the heart of what we do. We show our customers what is possible, and then deliver through performance framework and culture that balance agility and affordability with quality and safety.","We're investing in innovative concepts and technologies that align with the priorities of our customers. I'm pleased with the progress we are making. And I'll share four examples of demonstrations we completed in the fourth quarter, each of which offers innovation to support our customer's vision for future operation.","First, as we work closely with the Department on the joint all domain command and control effort, we are leveraging our experience with the Army's IBCS. We recently conducted a successful test using air and ground-based sensors against multiple fast-moving airborne targets. We are using agile development methods to integrate sensors and the sectors to rapidly and more precisely address new complex threats.","Second, we participated in the first advanced battle management systems demonstration using feeds for multiple domains to find, track and destroy cruise missiles. Here we integrated the communication suite necessary to connect the F-22 and the F-35 platform enabling this integrated battle management solution.","A third example is our development and integration of a world record 150-kilowatt class high energy laser weapon system on board the USS Portland. The laser system is undergoing final verification testing before deploying later this year, at which time the Navy will gain apps [ph] experience with directed energy systems in support, the future fleet operations.","And lastly, we successfully flight tested a rapid prototype conventionally configured hypersonic ground launched ballistic missile in response to an urgent capability request from DoD. The launch vehicle met a highly aggressive eight months design, integration and launch schedule achieving flawless flight results. These accomplishments are the results of our investments to address our customers emerging requirements with the ability they require.","These investments are solid 2019 financial results and successful business capture provided strong foundation for continued growth and sustained performance.","Our 2020 guidance called for sales to grow to between $35.3 billion and $35.8 billion with a segment operating margin rate of 11.3% to 11.5%. We expect 2020 adjusted EPS will range between $22.75, and $23.15.","After capital spending of approximately $1.35 billion, we expect free cash flow of $3.15 billion to $3.45 billion.","2020 guidance contemplates that we are selected for the next phase of the GBSD program in accordance with the Air Force's current acquisition Timeline, which calls for an award in August. We submitted our proposal in December, and we are in active discussions with the Air Force as they work through this Force selection process.","We are continuing to perform well on the technology maturation and risk reduction phase of the contract. And together with our nationwide team, we are investing in technologies and facilities necessary to be ready for day one of EMD. We anticipate the EMD phase of this multi-billion-dollar decade long recapitalization of the nation's ICBM to sub capability would be accretive to 2020 sales and slightly dilutive to OM rate, as well as free cash flow due to higher capital expenditures.","Ken will review the detailed guidance for the sectors, but I wanted to provide some context around 2020 sector performance. First, sector guidance under the new structure is consistent with the trends we've been talking about in our businesses. We expect space systems will be our fastest growing sector.","Beyond 2020 in addition to GBSD we have large opportunities in Space 3 architecture, hypersonics, intermediate range ballistic missiles and national safe launch. In civil space, we're well aligned for NASA's Artemis program.","For Aeronautics System, we have resident technology and integration expertise and critical domains like stealth and autonomy to support growth over the long-term. On an apples-to-apples basis, the businesses comprising aeronautics grew backlog 24% in 2019, which provides a solid foundation for sustained growth.","For Mission Systems, competitive opportunities in airborne and ground-based radar system create opportunity for enhanced growth. In addition, Mission Systems advanced capabilities and domain expertise, are key competitive differentiators that we leverage across the entire company as we pursued new business. Mission Systems to continue to have attractive top line growth coupled with strong margin rates.","And for Defense System, over the long-term, key growth drivers include high speed weaponry programs like AARGM-ER and our C2 and cross domain C2 program. We expect stable to growing revenue from legacy technology services businesses, as they're focused on the defense and intelligence market continue to generate results.","So, in summary, we have strong performance in 2019 and we expect continued top-line growth and sustained performance in 2020 and beyond. We also expect continued strong cash generation that will support our capital deployment strategy and create value for our shareholders and customers.","I'll turn the call over to Ken now for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, guidance and trends. Ken?","Ken Bedingfield","Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I also want to congratulate the team on strong performance this year. I'll spend a few minutes on 2019 results and discuss our 2020 guidance in more detail.","We will be providing guidance in our news sector structure with some broad year-over-year trend information. Our first quarter earnings release in April will include a schedule that recast prior period results for comparison.","Referring to slides five and six in our PowerPoint deck, I'll turn to sector results. Airspace System sales rose 10% for the quarter and 6% for the year, largely due to higher levels of restricted activity.","In addition, sales were higher in both periods for all three business areas. Restricted activities, F-35 production increases and higher E-2D volume where the growth drivers at manned aircraft.","Next gen OPIR activities where a growth driver at space, autonomous systems reflect higher volume across several programs, including Global Hawk and Triton.","AS operating income increased by 9% in the quarter and 2% for the full year. Fourth quarter operating margin rate was comparable to last year. 2019 operating margin rate of 10.3% reflects lower net favorable EAC adjustments related to several programs nearing completion.","Turning to innovation systems, fourth quarter sales rose 9% and full year sales increased 10% on a pro forma basis. Sales were higher at all three business areas for both periods. In space this was driven by higher volume for national security satellite systems. At flight systems fourth quarter growth reflects higher volume on propulsion systems and full year results reflect increased volume on aerostructures and launch vehicles.","Higher volume on tactical missiles and subsystems including GMLRS and our new AARGM-ER program drove higher defense sales in both periods. Fourth quarter operating income increased 20% due to improve performance at flight systems and space systems. For the full year, operating income totaled $671 million or 11% margin rate, which exceeded our guidance.","Turning to mission systems, fourth quarter and full year sales rose 6% and 5% respectively. Like AS and IS all three business areas within mission systems had higher sales in both periods. At advanced capabilities, higher volume for restricted activities and Marine systems drove growth in both periods. And the fourth quarter also benefited from higher volume on Poland IBCS as that program ramps up.","Growth at cyber and ISR was driven by higher volume for space and restricted programs. And at sensors and processing, fourth quarter growth reflects higher volume for airborne radar programs.","For the full year, sensors and processing sales growth is being driven by higher volume for airborne radars and new restricted programs. Mission system, fourth quarter operating income rose 13% and operating margin rate increased in 90 basis points to 14%.","For the full year, operating income rose 8% and operating margin rate increased 40 basis points to 13.4% exceeding our guidance. Mission systems margin rate reflects improved performance on advanced capabilities and sensors and processing programs as well as a $20 million gain on sale of property.","Technology services fourth quarter and full year 2019 sales were 4% lower as expected. Fourth quarter 2018 sales included an approximately $30 million favorable EAC adjustment for completion of an IT outsourcing contract.","The 2019 year over year revenue comparison was negatively impacted by this adjustment and completion of the GRDC and KC10 programs partially offset by growth in other programs.","Technology services, fourth quarter operating income declined 8% and operating margin rate was 10.4% again, the quarter over quarter comparison reflects with favorable Q4 2018 impacted by items related to the close out of the state IT outsourcing contract. For 2019 operating income increased 3% and operating margin rates increased 80 basis points to 11.1% exceeding our high 10% guidance.","At the total company level 2019 segment operating income increased 13% to $3.9 billion and segment operating margin rate was 11.6% versus our mid-11% guidance. Total operating income was approximately $4 billion with an operating margin rate of 11.7% this was largely due to unallocated corporate expense which came in lower than we expected due to an $89 million benefit for resolution of a cost claim accounting matter, which was not contemplated in our guidance.","A couple of comments on our mark to market adjustment, our discount rate declined 92 basis points to 3.39% which drove a $4 billion increase in our pension liability. We also changed our assumptions to reflect updated society of actuaries\u2019 mortality data, as well as an updated evaluation of our plan population. This increased our pension liability by $800 million.","These increases were partially offset by plan asset returns that exceeded assumptions, increasing assets by approximately 3 billion. So that's how we get to the $1.8 billion pretax expense. Our cash prepayment credit is approximately $1.6 billion as of January 1st of this year.","Turning to cash as is our typical pattern, we had a strong fourth quarter. For the year cash from operations was approximately $4.3 billion and after capital expenditures of about $1.25 billion, our free cash flow grew 18% to more than $3 billion exceeding our guidance.","Now, looking ahead to 2020, I'll mention that our news sector and reporting structure is laid out on Slide 11 of the PowerPoint deck. I'll refer you to a discussion of sector guidance on slide 12.","At Aeronautics Systems, we expect solid mid-single-digit sales growth to the mid to high $11 billion range with a low to mid 10% margin rate, stable versus 2019. About half of the 2020 sales growth is expected from a restricted program in manned aircraft. And we also expect mid-single-digit growth on the F-35 program.","For defense systems, we expect sales to be comparable to 2019 in the mid-$7 billion range, as Lake City transition offsets growth and other areas of the business. We expect an operating margin rate in the mid-10% range up slightly from 2019.","At the new mission system sector, we expect solid mid-single-digit sales growth to the high $9 billion range with a low 14% margin rate. Sales growth is supported by F-35 activities and production ramps and GATOR, Kirkum [ph] SABR as well as restricted development work.","The 2020 margin rate expectation at MS is down slightly due to the $20 million gain on property sale in 2019. And the changing mix that reflects a growing percentage of development work.","At Space Systems, we expect low-double-digit sales growth to the low $8 billion range with a low to mid 10% margin rate. This represents continued strong margin rate performance. I would note that Space System sales and margin rate guidance contemplate more early phase development work, including GBSD, which is expected to be accretive to sales, but slightly diluted to the margin rate of the existing portfolio.","Our sector guidance rolls up to 2020 sales of $35.3 billion to $35.8 billion. And I would note that under the new structure, we expect inner segment eliminations to decline to about $1.8 billion.","I would point out the first quarter 2020 sales are expected to be a bit less than 25% of full year sales. As Mission Systems and Space Systems revenue is weighted towards the second half of the year.","We expect segment operating margin rate of 11.3% to 11.5%. We expect 2020, total operating margin rate will range between 10.8% and 11% reflecting $390 million for the operating portion of the net FAS\/CAS pension benefit, and unallocated corporate expense of approximately $565 million, which includes $315 million non-cash and tangible asset amortization and PP&E step-up depreciation and $250 million of other estimated unallocated items.","Moving to pension, slide 13 provides our 2020 pension assumptions. These assumptions exclude any 2020 mark-to-market impact. Slide 14 summarizes our pension estimates for years '20 through 2022. And slide 15 summarizes sensitivities to changes to our 2020 assumptions. Our guidance systems $500 million of interest expense, de minimis interest income and an effective tax rate of approximately 16.5%.","I'll remind you that our 2019 reported effective tax rate reflected the mark-to-market expense. So, please don't use that as a baseline as you think about our 2020 effective tax rate. Based on all that, we expect adjusted earnings per share will increase to a range of $22.75 to $23.15, or about 8% growth at the midpoint. EPS growth reflects higher sales and higher segment operating income, as well as pension benefit, partially offset by higher corporate unallocated expense and a higher tax rate.","I'd also note EPS guidance is based on $168 million weighted average shares outstanding, a reduction from 2019 of about 1% for 2020 after capital expenditures of approximately $1.35 billion. We expect free cash flow will range between $3.15 billion and $3.45 billion or about 9% growth at the midpoint.","CapEx includes the required early capital investment for GBSD. And we expect the cash flows will continue to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year.","I'll also mention that our cash continues to be driven significantly by operations with net pension defined as CAS less funding, expected to be about 11% at the midpoint of implied 2020 cash from operations.","Our capital deployment strategy continues to call for investing in our businesses, strengthening of the balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a competitive dividend. In addition, we do have $1 billion of debt maturing this fall, which we are currently planning to retire.","In summary, we expect to continue strong value creation through a combination of growth, performance, and robust cash generation as well as thoughtful capital allocation.","I think we're ready for Q&A. Todd?","Todd Ernst","Regina, please open the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of the Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Okay, thanks very much. Good morning. So, I just wanted to ask, maybe one question Ken about working capital. Like very strong performance in the quarter and, whether you expect working capital to grow in 2020. It looks like it was maybe even down a hair in 2019. And whether, you think you can keep it flat or not.","And then, secondly you mentioned the $1.6 billion CAS credit and it looks like over the next three years that pretty much gets eaten up. And so, should we assume in the out years beyond your forecast that CAS contributions are roughly in line?","Ken Bedingfield","Sure. Thanks, Seth. I'll start with the working capital question and then head to pension. I would say from a working capital perspective, we did have better than expected performance in 2019. We've been really focused on working capital and trying to maximize the benefit there. And we did see that that performance exceeded our expectations and 2019. So, we're pleased about that.","As we look at our ability to generate cash in 2020. We're certainly looking at kind of the growth of the company, the strong margin profile, delivering the ability to convert that margin into cash as the primary driver of the cash flow growth. But certainly, managing working capital as efficiently as possible will be a part of that as well.","So, I think that, from a working capital perspective, it's something where it's not going to be a headwind. We don't necessarily expect the continued tailwind that we had in 2019. But as we look at 2020, I think that strong growth and converting our margins in the cash is probably the biggest driver of cash. And again, strong performance by the team in 2018 and we look forward to maximizing again in 2020.","From a pension perspective, you're correct Seth. The current assumptions on pension would result in the prepayment credit getting burned down in 2022. And that would therefore result in CAS and funding being pretty similar as we look beyond 2022. And I would just comment that, as we look at the pension assumptions, we've laid out for 2021 and 2022.","We've got a scenario where generally the cash - net pension cash, CAS less funding is relatively in a box, I would say. There's not a lot of a lot worse it can get. You'll notice that in 2022 CAS is about 150-160 greater than funding that would say that as we look at our performance, it is kind of in a box. And on the opportunity side, if we can outperform or other assumptions change, then we have the ability to drive down that 22 funding that is required under the current assumptions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America.","Todd Ernst","Operator, please clear the line with Ron. It's been static.","Operator","The line has been cleared. Your next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Thank you very much. Kathy, you mentioned restricted - the restricted portfolio is about a quarter of the business and it grew double-digits in 2019 so you're clearly taking share. How long do you think that's sustainable? And what are parts of the business that are may be underperforming your expectations and do they expect to pick up?","Kathy Warden","Thanks, Sheila. I did mention restricted being our key growth area, both in our sales in 2019, as well as the awards that we received with $11 billion awards and $7 billion of that coming in restricted states.","So, we clearly still see space being a growth driver for us into the future. And we also had noted in our third quarter call that we had received $1.3 billion in awards and hypersonic, we continue to see that as a growth area for the business as well.","And I mentioned in my comments today, a demonstration that we conducted in the fourth quarter and hypersonic missiles as well. So, those are a couple of the areas that I would notice key growth drivers going forward in our restricted portfolio.","As I look across the business, we clearly have headwinds as we exit the Lake City contract. This year, we have noted us about 300 million of headwinds in 2020. We basically now have exited the small caliber business. And so that's a headwind that will largely be behind us as we get past 2020.","And so as we look at Aerospace Mission Systems and space, we see strong growth expected in each of those sectors, Aeronautics ambition, in the mid to high-single-digit space to low-double-digits, its defense systems where we have those Lake City headwinds that we see more of a stable growth profile, but really not looking at any part of the portfolio was under performing with those headwind the exception as more caliber.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of a Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter Arment","Yes. Good morning, Kathy and Ken. Kathy, just kind of going back to the legacy innovation systems segment. I know it's now obviously space, but, we've been tracking the kind of the synergy number that you had laid out previously. And then also the revenue synergy, I think was something that originally wasn't a number that got quoted, but maybe just talk about some of the opportunities you're seeing there and how that's progressing? Thanks.","Kathy Warden","We'll do. Thanks Peter. So, in costs energy, I noted in my comments that we exceeded their cost synergy target in 2019. And that helped us to generate higher than expected segment operating margin rate.","So that area of commitment is certainly one, where we feel, we did what we said we were going to do and even had some opportunity to over perform in driving costs out of the business. And that not only generates near-term margin, but it also helps us to position the business more competitively to win in the future, which gets to the part of your question around revenue synergy.","We have been realized the revenue synergy ahead of the estimates we had in by plan for the Orbital ATK business. And we see that continuing as we look into the future. I had noted previously that space and missiles are the two areas where we are seeing the greatest synergy and I gave a few examples in each including AARGM-ER which I talked about again today and the opportunity that we see there not just domestically, but also internationally. We still see those two areas space and missile seeing the ones that will be the key drivers of revenue synergy over the plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from over Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Ken Bedingfield","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Stallard","Ken, quick question for you on capital deployment. You commented that you intend to pay off a billion dollars of debt later this year. I certainly could work walk us through the thinking on that, because obviously, with interest rates being very low, you've already got a strong balance sheet. Would it not make sense to keep the debt, refinance the debt and perhaps return more cash to shareholders?","Ken Bedingfield","Sure. Let me walk through that. And as we look at 2020 and our capital deployment plans. We continue to think about it in the same way we have historically and that is invest in the business, which we're doing in 2020, including what we expect to invest in GBSD, as Kathy talked about. Certainly, paying a competitive dividend.","And then also managing the balance sheet and share repurchase. And we've got an amount of repurchase that we're planning for 2020 and with that, behind us, we've got the cash to pay off the debt. As we look forward, there's more debt that's coming due and we'll certainly evaluate whether or not we continue to delever through paying off debt where we just delever through growing our EBITDA.","And I wouldn't necessarily assume that because we're paying off the 2020 debt that means that we're going to continue to pay off more debt, we've got optionality and obviously we'll continue to evaluate what the best use of the cash is, as we look at all those options, the capital deployment. But we're in a good position of with our strong cash flow being able to deploy all of those avenues of capital deployment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss","Thanks, good morning.","Ken Bedingfield","Good morning, David.","David Strauss","Want to ask about CapEx. It sounds like GBSD is adding a bit to that to this year, maybe 50 basis points as a percent of sales. I think you previously talked about CapEx stepping down in 2021 to like 2.5% of sales. How does GBSD kind of impact that, Ken? Thanks.","Ken Bedingfield","Sure, let me start on that one. From a CapEx perspective, we were at 3.7% of revenue in 2019. We had talked about the profile that we were expecting, as we were looking forward into 2020 and 2021. For 2020, we have updated our outlook to include GBSD that's for CapEx as well as revenue, certainly at the high end of the guide. And, that was not included in the numbers that we talked about last fall.","So, the GBSD now included, we're looking at CapEx of about $1.35 billion for 2020 and probably $1.35 billion for 2021. And then kind of continuing to decrease so the percentage of sales beyond that.","And I maybe would also just note that, as we look at 2020, we do have the CapEx in for GBSD and only maybe $250 million or so of sales given the award, expected to come in August.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn","Hi, good morning.","Kathy Warden","Good morning.","Robert Spingarn","Kathy, this one's I thought I'd ask you about open architecture, which I think you've discussed in the past. What I was wondering if you might walk through how you're positioning Northrop to benefit from do these increased emphases on that design paradigm. And, do you think you can leverage that to drive market share gains at Mission Systems over the long-term?","Kathy Warden","Thanks for the question. I'm glad that you picked up on that Rob, because we have been talking about it for a while, particularly as we discussed, what we have done on IBCS as a program, but I've also talked about that being more of an architecture. And we're now beginning to demonstrate that to the Department of Defense as we participated in demos in the fourth quarter, at least two of them.","The one I noted around IBCS, for joint all domain command and control, as well as the one that we did to connect F-22 and F-35 in communications to enable the battle command system.","So as we think about what the future holds, the ability to have an architecture that rapidly integrate both sensors and the sectors, and allows the department to tie these systems that have been built in more of a stovepipe fashion to communicate and to share information will be critical to their vision for future operations.","And we are able to rapidly do this because we have been working for in these open architectures for a number of years. And we have ready to go solutions that enable this demonstration of capability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi.","Jon Raviv","Good morning, everyone. Just thinking about GBSD being a major change, I think, from the 3Q outlook in the fall, I think you talked on mid-single digit sales and flat margin, your GBSD is less than 1% of sales, but second largest now down in 2020. Can you just sort of put all those pieces together for us and sort of add a little more color as to what's going on with 2020 versus what you said in the fall and then really with the opportunity to accelerate on simply GBSD going forward. Thank you.","Ken Bedingfield","Sure. John, let me, let me start on that one. I would say that as we look at 2020, based on the guide that we've laid out, you call it 4.5% to 6% or so growth given the range and again, that does include a GBSD, proceeding as expected in the August timeframe.","From a margin perspective, I would say that as we think about it, in the new sector structure, again aeronautics would be relatively comparable to 2019. Space Systems would be down a little bit some of that is GBSD and some of that is just other mix changes as it continues to win new business and take on additional development work. And as we've talked about a low double-digit growth rate there at Space Systems.","At MS, we did have the property gain in 2019. So, we see that as having a little bit of an impact on margins at MS, we mentioned that would result in a little bit of a margin, reduction into 2020, on a comparative basis.","And then at the new defense systems, we are projecting that margin will be slightly up and as that business performs well. So, you know, look, we always incentivize the team to perform and to outperform our peers and we look forward to a 2020 where the team will hopefully continue to step up to the challenge as I've seen them do and drive the best margin outcome that we can get to.","Kathy Warden","And Jon, I believe the second part of your question was around the possibility of acceleration of award on GBSD. So, let me just comment briefly on that. As you know, the air force has made it clear that GBSD needs to be in fielding in 2029 and that the time to do so is short. And it's essential that we get started on the critical requirement.","So, we've been investing in the people in facilities that we need to ensure that our team is ready to start upon award and that we could support for an accelerated award schedule if they are able to do so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.","Cai von Rumohr","Terrific. Thank you very much. So, could you update us on your strategy and hypersonic? I think at one point you talked about focusing predominantly on propulsion. Are you also going for a major push in the systems integration role and then maybe update us on the outlook for a counter hypersonics? Thanks.","Kathy Warden","Yes. So, in hypersonics we do have a dual path strategy, the first being to support all of the primes in propulsion. And we've talked openly about the relationship that we have with both Lockheed and Raytheon in that regard. We also are a system integrator. And the demonstration that I mentioned in my comments earlier in the call was an example of where we were the integrator for that demonstrator.","So, we do see ourselves following both paths. We want to be a good provider to the primes in propulsion and that means making investments that support multiple technology paths. But at the same time, we do have the capability ourselves to prime efforts and be an integrator for certain types of systems.","I also will talk briefly about counter hypersonics and there we see really our expertise in space and the capabilities that we have in space being a key enabler to the future counter hypersonic mission sets.","And we have looked at the space business that we are assembling and view ourselves as both a capable prime and payload provider in that space. So again, a similar strategy that we can be both a merchant supplier to other primes with payloads of importance in that space, but also the ability to integrate systems and provide end to end capability ourselves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harnett with Bernstein.","Doug Harnett","Thank you. Good morning. If I go back a few years and look at autonomous systems, my understanding was that a big advantage that Northrop Grumman had was on its common operating systems that they could be applied to multiple programs say in many different classes of UAVs","But today, it appears that the dominant autonomous programs is still really built off of Hale Systems, Global Hawk variants, Triton. So, is there a broader platform for growth in autonomous systems that we're yet to see. Because either they're in early stage development or they're restricted or as - or should we think of this is still likely to grow off of these large Hale Systems in the future.","Kathy Warden","So, Doug, we certainly do see growth opportunity in hale systems. I would also point to examples that were working in the medium altitude space programs like Fire Scout. And then we have also areas of new technology developments that will allow us these scales the system down even further. But I would suggest to that the high altitude that you hear a speak about in the context of surveillance is the best coverage that can be provided.","And so, it's quite economical for these high-altitude systems, at least in the surveillance mission to fly in high range. So, it all depends on the mission requirements. And that's what drives the system design. But we do have system architectures that allow us to scale as the mission requires.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.","Ron Epstein","Good morning. Hopefully this connection is a little better.","Ken Bedingfield","That is better, Ron.","Ron Epstein","Yeah. Great. Cool. Thanks. So, Kathy, just a big picture question for you. You've been in the rollout for a little over a year. And when you think about where the Northrop Grumman is now? Is it where you wanted to be? And, if it's not what are some of the challenges you see for you over the next couple of years?","Kathy Warden","Well, thanks for the question, Ron, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about both my macro assessment and outlook. I am pleased with where we are. One of my priorities when I stepped into the role was to Orion and the team toward several high growth campaigns and align our investments there.","We of course, more recently have aligned the organization to execute that strategy. And as I look to the evidence of success, I point to the backlog growth that we saw in 2019. I would also say that being a head on our revenue synergy projections came from a lot of hard work from the team on a successful Orbital ATK integration, but also very rapidly integrating them into our strategy for these mission campaigns and the growth that we see there.","I also focus the team on performance and agility. And there we continue to perform well in our program even as we take on a number of new development efforts and scale production, which are difficult challenges that they come with the opportunity of long term, sustained growth as well as strong operating margins.","And I'm pleased with what the team is doing there because laying the foundation not only for our near-term future, but our long-term future. We realize the cost synergy from a successful Orbital ATK integration. And again, while that's generating some short-term margin enhancement, really the opportunity there is that we're more competitive over the long term with better rates.","And just overall, I feel that we've over the last year enhanced our competitiveness. The demonstrations that I talked about were very rapidly put together as a result of making smart technology investments, understanding the missions that would be needed by our customers under the national defence strategy, and rapidly aligning our portfolio to bring forward together analogies that meet those needs.","So overall, I feel good about where we are. And I think we're deploying our capital in a way that not only invest in the business but return a lot of the cash we're generating to shareholders and positions us well for future optionality.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.","Myles Walton","Thanks. Good morning, I had two questions that relate to margins. The first one is on R&D; it looks like it was a couple hundred million dollars or 25%. Just curious what that looks like for 2020 in which business absorb that.","And then on EACs, it looks particularly low, but the margins actually were pretty in line, despite that low EAC contribution. So, I'm curious, did you change the booking rates underlying on a systematic basis similar to kind of what you did in 2015 to reduce some of the volatility. Thanks.","Ken Bedingfield","Myles, let me take those questions at least, to start. From an R&D perspective, the biggest impact, the additional R&D was the full year of NGIS. You remember we closed that acquisition in June of 2018. So, we only had a little more than six months of their R&D, and certainly is a strong investor in technology and R&D to drive that future growth.","So that's the biggest impact. I would say that this is a company that's always invested in R&D. And certainly as we look at our growth here, and our ability to grow over the long-term, I think the fact that we continue to invest in R&D through the downturn is one of the strengths that drives us today, and we will continue to do that.","So, not going to put a number on it for 2020. But continued strong investment in a technology that will drive the growth that Kathy's been talking about is certainly where we're thinking about it.","From your question on the EAC perspectives, I would just say that, look, a lot of the EAC adjustments are about timing. And as we think about 2019, and strong margin performance, some of that did come out of some of the more mature programs, where we have a bit of a stronger baseline margin rate rather than seeing it come through adjusted or EAC adjustments. And that's really how we think about the business, is what the programs can deliver and how the programs can perform rather than an EAC adjustment.","So, as we look at 2020, and the programs and the sectors we see continued strong performance and that's how we generate that segment margin rate that we talked about in our guidance.","Kathy Warden","And Myles, as we look at net EAC adjustments in recent years, we had a high watermark in 2018, with over $0.5 billion of net favorable adjustments this year at 480, still very strong. And so, I look at our program performance and just one indicator of that is our net EAC adjustments and feel that we've been doing quite well over the last couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Ken Bedingfield","Good morning.","Hunter Keay","Good morning. Kathy, could you talk about E-2 for a minute. Just give us an update on where you are in terms of total program size and margins. And then can you talk about growth in the program as you portion it out between domestic and international opportunities through both new potential customers and upgrades. Thank you.","Kathy Warden","Absolutely. So, as we look at the program, both domestically and internationally, we see growth. We are delivering more E-2Ds to the Navy, we also have the Japan orders that we booked in 2019, which will be deliveries over the next several years. I'll ask Ken to give you some more of the specifics on the financials, both revenue and margin rate expectations.","Ken Bedingfield","Hunter, I would just say that as we look at our awards and backlog in 2019, E-2D, contributed over $5 billion of awards as we look at both the Navy as well as Japan orders. And it's a solid contributor to revenue as well, around $1.5 billion in sales and strong margins. So really a solid program for us and one that we see as contributing nicely to our growth at Aeronautics in 2020 as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Kathy Warden","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","So, a lot of things below the top line matter, profits and returns on capital matter, obviously. But when we speak to investors, there's still just a lot of focus on the top line, because of there seems to be a differentiation in the programs you've won, and what you've put in the backlog.","And so, we kind of here two camps, one is, yes, they have the programs, but it's very diversified and there's always moving pieces. So, they're just going to grow top line 5% forever. And the second campus, no, you have to be patient and all of the large new wins start to ramp 2021 and beyond, and the growth rates going to accelerate significantly.","And so, can you speak to which of those it is, and does 5% for 2020, does that meet the criteria of outpacing your end market or does that definition that you\u2019ve provided in the past means something much faster.","Kathy Warden","So, let me take a crack at, there are in two ways. First, as we think about outpacing the end market, the investment accounts in the 2020 budgets are up 3%, and we're projecting a 5% growth. So, if you looked in the near-term, you could suggest that that is outgrowing.","But as you and I both know; it takes a while for backlog in these long cycle businesses to manifest in sales. And so that goes to the premise that it does take a while to these awards that we've booked in 2019 will come into sales over a multiyear period and therefore, is derisking growth in those out years and creating the opportunity for acceleration of growth.","To answer your question a little more explicitly in our portfolio, we have opportunities like GBSD, which will if awarded to us, creates a sizable ramp over the next several years. So, it's had the opportunity to create an outsized growth for our portfolio. We also have talked about space and we see space as one of the fastest growing elements of the budget.","But those awards are not yet manifesting themselves in sales. And we have other rewards that we anticipate this year, depending on how successful we are, that also creates opportunity for outpaced growth.","So, I think the scenario that you paint is one where there absolutely is opportunity for us to continue over the long-term to outgrow the budget growth. But that requires us to continue to win business executed successfully, just like any other organization, and you'll make the assumptions as to the confidence that you have that we'll do not operate.","Todd Ernst","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius.","Carter Copeland","Just made it in. Thanks, everybody.","Kathy Warden","Thanks Carter.","Carter Copeland","Hi, Kathy. Question on the bookings. I'm not sure, I heard it correctly, but it sounded like you said $7 billion of the $11 billion were restricted space. And if that's in a legacy restricted space organization, that would be a very large book-to-bill. So, I wondered if that was broad based or if there was anything chunky in there that we should consider as transformational in terms of how you think about the growth rate. I just - any color you can provide there would be appreciated.","Kathy Warden","Yes, I did say that of the $11 billion unrestricted award $7 billion was insane. And that spanned the three sectors in the 2019 structure that operated in space. So Aerospace Systems, Mission Systems and Innovation Systems all contributed to that $7 billion of awards that I mentioned. As we look forward in the new operating structure. All of those businesses will be together in Space System.","Todd Ernst","I like to turn the call over to Kathy for closing remarks.","Kathy Warden","Very good. Well, thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. I want to conclude by just reiterating my thanks to the team for an outstanding 2019. We're positioned well as we start the year-end 2020. With the backlog growth that we've experienced, the strong performance and our commitment to continued thoughtful capital deployment that allows us to grow this business for the long-term for our shareholders. So, thank you all for being with us today. We look forward to talking to you after our first quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation."]}}
