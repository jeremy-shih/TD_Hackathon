Sankovic","Good afternoon, and welcome to TD Bank Group Second Quarter 2013 Investor Presentation. My name is Rudy Sankovic, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations for the bank. We will begin today's presentation with remarks from Ed Clark, our CEO; after which, Colleen Johnson, the bank's CFO, will present second quarter operating results. Mark Chauvin, Chief Risk Officer, will then offer comments on credit quality. We will then entertain questions from those present in the room and prequalified analysts and investors on the phone.","Also here today to answer your questions are Tim Hockey, Group Head, Canadian Banking, Auto Finance and Credit Cards; Mike Pedersen, Group Head, Wealth, Insurance and Corporate Shared Services; Bharat Masrani, Group Head, U.S. P&C Banking; and Bob Dorrance, Group Head, Wholesale Banking. Please turn to Slide 2.","At this time, I'd like to caution our listeners that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. There are risks that actual results could differ materially from what is discussed and that certain material factors or assumptions were applied in making these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation represent the views of management and are presented for the purpose of assisting the bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the bank's financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance. Forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for any other purposes.","I'd also like to remind listeners that the bank uses non-GAAP financial measures to arrive at adjusted results to assess each of our businesses and to measure the bank's overall performance. The bank believes that adjusted results provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the bank's performance. Ed will be referring to adjusted results in his remarks. Additional information on items of note, the bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available on our Q2 2013 report to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Ed.","W. Edmund Clark","Thank you, Rudy, and welcome, everyone, and thank you all for joining us here today. Now Colleen's going to be up shortly to review our second quarter results in detail, but I thought I would start by sharing my thoughts on how we're doing and how the second half of the year is shaping up.","First, I should note, there had been several milestone events since the first quarter, and I'd like to take a moment just to remark on them. We closed the Target and Epoch acquisitions in March, and I would like to welcome members of both teams to TD. We are absolutely delighted that you're with us.","We also will announce our plans for the CEO succession. And as I said at the time, and I still really think it's terrific, I couldn't be more pleased with the choice of my successor and, frankly, the process itself, which has underscored our commitment to continuity with change.","Now to the quarter. Earnings were up 6% on a year-over-year basis. For the first half of the year, earnings were up 7% and earnings per share were up 6%. In my view, a pretty good result.","Our Canadian retail bank had a good quarter. Earnings increased by 5%, driven by healthy volume growth in business banking, improved credit performance and good expense management. The underlying results were even stronger, with growth closer to 9%. Colleen is going to go into that in some more detail.","For the first half of the year, earnings were up 8%, and we would expect similar year-over-year growth in the second half. A very good result given the environment in which we're operating.","Wealth also had a good quarter, as well as a good first half. On a year-to-date basis, earnings were up 8%, including Epoch expenses; and 11%, excluding expenses associated with Epoch. The business is carrying good momentum into the second half of the year, thanks to excellent inflows in our advice and asset management businesses. Epoch will be relatively neutral to earnings in 2013 and will be accretive to the bank in 2014.","It was a tougher picture in insurance as continued good premium growth was not sufficient to compensate for increased claims due to a severe winter. Insurance earnings grew 2% in the first half.","We expect good premium growth in insurance even with slowing creditor insurance, but the business faced increased uncertainty, including the impact of past and future Ontario auto reforms. In view of this, the 7% to 10% growth we previously expected to achieve relative to 2012 normalized earnings of $600 million may be difficult to achieve.","Our U.S. bank performed well into -- in the second quarter. In fact, it was a record quarter. Although margins remain under pressure, loan and deposit growth continued to be strong. For the first half of the year, U.S. Personal & Commercial Banking delivered 11% earnings growth buoyed by strong organic loan and deposit growth, higher fees, the addition of Target and increased security gains as we restructure our balance sheet to better manage our capital and our interest rate duration.","We also, though, continued to invest in the future and are opening new stores in our higher growth markets like Boston, South Florida and New York. In fact, we recently opened our 100th store in New York City.","The operating environment in the United States remains challenging, with low interest rates likely to keep margins under pressure for the rest of the year and beyond. The good news is that our strong volume growth has been able to offset most of this compression, leading us in a very strong position should rates rise.","Overall, we delivered $779 million in earnings in U.S. dollars in the first half of the year, and we are on course to match that level of earnings in the second half of the year, a very positive outcome given the operating environment.","Our Wholesale Bank also posted strong second quarter results, with trading revenues recovering from last quarter's results. Wholesale delivered 18% ROE in the first half of the year, in line with our 15% to 20% target range. We expect to maintain ROEs at this level, but second half growth will likely be less on a year-over-year basis because of non-recurrence of one-time security gains at the end of last year.","So it was a solid quarter overall and, together with our strong performance in the first quarter, led, as I said earlier, to total bank earnings of 7% for the first half of the year and 6% EPS growth. Now these results are exactly where I thought we would be at this point of the year, which is to say working hard to get into the bottom of our 7% to 10% medium-term target for adjusted EPS growth.","Most of our challenges are familiar to you. We've talked about them quite a bit. The fundamentals of our businesses are strong, but we continue to face headwinds from slower loan growth in Canada and low interest rates globally. In Canada, the slowing housing market has raised concerns about the possibility of a more dramatic correction. As you know, several years we were worried about the housing market and the risk that Canada was running. We spoke publicly about those concerns. But the government has responded with a number of reforms, which are having an impact. In my opinion, given the structure of Canadian lending, Canadians do not need to worry that we will see the type of meltdown that has occurred in other countries. We may see some softening in prices, but this will be a good thing, not a prelude to a major correction.","Our views on the global economy have not changed materially from last quarter. On the positive side, economic fundamentals in the United States continue to improve. The main impediment to growth appears to be the speed and nature of the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus. Debate has actually now opened up on how and when to withdraw some of the monetary expansion. All of this is very good news.","At the same time, the rest of the world looks no stronger. Europe is mired in a recession, Asian growth seems more modest and Japanese attempts to restimulate their economy through monetary stimulation have set off further downward pressure on interest rates and currency values.","But Canada is affected by these competing global forces, and our view is likely to underperform the United States in the next few years. For TD, we have to assume, despite the discussion that's going on about where interest rates are going, that for our purposes of running the business, that interest rates do not rise soon and, therefore, that we will continue to face downward pressure on margins for at least one more year. That's why, despite the good performance we recorded in the first half of the year, we are continuing to focus on expense management. The operating environment has changed in the last couple of years, and we had changed with it. Finding current year cost savings is not enough. We continue to focus on more permanent cost reductions. We are carefully reviewing all opportunities on this front. At the same time, we have to manage expense growth carefully. Total bank adjusted expense growth, excluding acquisitions and FX, was 3% in the second quarter, our target, as you know, for the year. We are determined to meet that target.","We expect to grow expenses, measured on the same basis, by less than 3% in the second half of the year. And we are committed to reducing that growth rate still further in 2014 while still investing in future growth initiatives.","Let me talk about capital. As of April 30, our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 8.8%, or 8.5% excluding the impact of the CVA reprieve that OSFI granted in December. Now this ratio was unchanged from the first quarter, a truly remarkable result given that we absorbed the Target and Epoch acquisitions in that quarter. As we indicated to you last quarter, we have been working towards articulating a capital allocation strategy. In a world of growing capital requirements, it is important to review all uses of capital, current or potential, to ensure that it is being used optimally. We've got some clarity on the regulatory framework which we needed in order to develop our strategy. OSFI has now clarified the D-SIB rules. With that framework in place, in view -- and in view of our demonstrated ability to generate capital, we are now allocating roughly $1 billion to repurchase 12 million of our common shares. As we monitor our capital growth going forward, we will continue to review how we can best deploy any future growth and excess capital, including potentially additional share buybacks to maximize shareholder returns while growing our franchise.","To wrap up, our businesses delivered a solid performance in the first half of 2013. We continue to face the headwinds that we've identified previously, but our focus at TD is always on the medium-term build of a great franchise. That is our core business model, and that is the essence of our culture. That's why we will continue to invest in the future, even as we look for permanent cost savings in the present. And that's why I remain confident that we'll continue to deliver on our vision of being the better bank.","With that, let me turn it over to Colleen.","Colleen M. Johnston","Thanks very much, Ed, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4.","Our results in the second quarter were solid with adjusted EPS of $1.90, up 4% year-over-year, and total bank adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, up 6% from last year. Retail-adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion were up 5% from last year, and wholesale net income was $220 million, up 12%. The Corporate segment had a loss of $26 million. It was a solid result in a challenging environment.","Please turn to Slide 5. This slide presents our reported and adjusted earnings this quarter, with a difference due to 3 items of note. None of these are new this quarter.","Please turn to Slide 6. Canadian P&C delivered a good quarter, with adjusted net income of $877 million, up 5% year-over-year. Excluding the MBNA credit mark release and one extra day last year, revenue grew by 4%, and net income grew by 9%. Loan and deposit growth were good this quarter. Real estate secured lending volumes were up 4% versus last year, and we maintained our leadership position in this category.","Business lending growth was strong, up 14%. Retail deposits increased 5%, and business deposit growth was 8%. Credit performance continues to be strong, with PCL and Personal Banking down $52 million from last year, primarily due to better credit performance, enhanced collection strategies and low bankruptcies. Business Banking PCLs were $23 million higher due to a provision for a single client.","Adjusted expense growth was 1% year-over-year as volume growth, merit increases and investment in the business were largely offset by broad-based productivity gains. NIM was stable versus Q1, up 1 basis point sequentially due to seasonal factors. Our expectation remains that NIM will decline by 1 to 2 basis points per quarter. For the first half of 2013, earnings increased by 8%, which was within our expected range. We expect similar year-over-year growth in the second half, a very good result.","Please turn to Slide 7. It was a solid quarter for our Wealth and Insurance businesses, with good underlying growth fundamentals in both businesses. Wealth earnings were up 2% year-over-year due to strong fee income driven by good growth in client assets and market appreciation. We closed the Epoch acquisition in the quarter. Excluding certain upfront costs related to Epoch, earnings grew 8%. We expect that Epoch will be relatively neutral to 2013 earnings but accretive in 2014. Insurance earnings were down 6% versus last year. The most significant factor was higher current-year claims from a more severe winter.","Wealth and Insurance expenses increased by 9% versus last year, primarily due to Epoch integration costs, higher variable compensation and increased project spend, partially offset by decreased expenses from the sale of the U.S. Insurance business and productivity initiatives.","The contribution from TD Ameritrade was $53 million, up $6 million or 13% from last year. This quarter, TD Wealth and TD Ameritrade collectively passed the $1 trillion mark in consolidated assets, reflecting TD's market leadership in wealth management in North America. We expect a very good year for the Wealth business, driven by continued client asset growth and prudent expense management. In insurance, we expect continued good premium growth, although the business faces has increased -- faces increased uncertainty, including the impact of past and future Ontario auto reforms and lower demand for credit-related insurance products. It is possible that our previous guidance of 7% to 10% growth off normalized 2012 earnings of $600 million may be difficult to achieve. Please turn to Slide 8.","The U.S. Personal and Commercial Bank results were good, a new record in fact, with adjusted net income of USD $392 million, up 9% from last year. The increase was primarily due to strong loan and deposit volume growth, improved credit quality and a lower effective tax rate due to higher levels of tax-advantaged investments, partially offset by lower margins.","During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Target credit card portfolio. Revenue and PCL related to Target are reported on a gross basis in the income statement. Non-interest expenses include TD's operating expenses related to the business and amounts due to Target under the credit card program agreement and represent TD's net share. Revenue increased by 7% year-over-year due to the inclusion of credit card revenue from Target, strong organic loan and deposit and fee growth, offset by lower margins. Excluding Target, average loans were up 14% year-over-year, with a 22% increase in personal loans and a 9% increase in business loans. We added $6 billion in Target credit card outstandings this quarter. Average deposits were up 10%.","Our net interest margin was up by 39 basis points from last quarter, primarily due to the mid-quarter Target acquisition. If you exclude Target, our NIM was comparable to last quarter. The drivers of the NIM were very similar to the factors discussed in Q1. We expect our margins, excluding Target and accounting noise, to continue to compress in the 5- to 7-basis-point range per quarter. Low interest rates, shortened duration, security sales and the competitive loan environment will continue to exert downward pressure. Excluding Target, PCL was down versus the same quarter last year, primarily due to improved credit quality of commercial loans and lower provisions related to acquired credit impaired loans.","Adjusted expenses were up 10% versus last year due entirely to increased expenses related to Target. This is a good outcome given our current level of investment. Excluding Target, expenses were down. All in, a good result for our U.S. business. For the second half of 2013, we're on course to deliver earnings at a level consistent with the first half. Please turn to Slide 9.","Wholesale delivered solid results across our franchise businesses. Net income of $220 million was up 12% compared to the same period last year due to higher trading-related revenue and lower non-interest expenses, partially offset by higher taxes. Trading-related revenues were $353 million in the quarter on higher fixed income and credit trading activity. This is ahead of our normalized expectation, which remains at $300 million per quarter.","Non-interest expenses were down 2% compared to last year, mainly due to lower variable compensation. Annualized ROE for the quarter was 20.9%, above our ROE target range of 15% to 20%. Please turn to Slide 10.","The Corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of $26 million in the quarter. Results were in line with last year. Higher net corporate expenses were partially offset by favorable other items. A general allowance release of $19 million after tax was included in the Corporate segment this quarter. Please turn to Slide 11.","We remain focused on the rate of expense growth across the bank and are pursuing initiatives that will permanently improve productivity. We continue to target core expense growth of less than 3% for 2013. This excludes the impact of acquisitions and FX. We are on track to meet this goal. We are making progress on managing expense growth. Q2 core expenses increased 3% from last year after absorbing higher pension costs, increased merit and investments in the business. On this basis, Canadian P&C posted 1% expense growth, while expenses in U.S. P&C and Wholesale declined versus last year. For 2014, we are targeting core expense growth at an even lower rate, and our planning process is well underway. Please turn to Slide 12.","Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 8.8% in the second quarter. Our capital ratio was unchanged from last quarter after closing the Target and Epoch acquisitions. Our capital position also includes the OSFI reprieve on the implementation of the CVA add-on charge described last quarter. In view of our demonstrated ability to generate capital, we've announced a 12 million share buyback program, which translates to roughly $1 billion in capital. Overall, we remain well positioned for the evolving regulatory and capital environment. Please turn to Slide 13.","We've had a number of requests from analysts and investors to provide more color on 2 key areas. First, the impact to NII of security sales in the U.S.; and second, our NII upside to future interest rate increases. As you can well imagine, there are many assumptions, variables and complexities in our NII models which we do not intend to disclose in detail. However, I will, however, provide you with a simplified view to give you a sense of the upside to rising rates and to demonstrate that it doesn't take a big change in rates to have a fairly big impact on our NII. As I outlined last quarter, we've started a program to shorten the duration of our balance sheet and to position TD for an increase in interest rates. This strategy also locks in a portion of the unrealized gains that are part of our capital under Basel III. We are currently triggering securities gains of $60 million to $80 million per quarter by selling longer dated securities from our investment portfolio. Selling these securities triggers the gain but results in the proceeds being reinvested in lower-yielding, short-term securities, which puts pressure on future NII.","On the NII upside, the simplest way to think about it is to segment TDs total non-maturity deposit base of $275 billion into fixed and floating balances. We have approximately $150 billion in float rate deposits, which would be quite sensitive to an increase in short rates. A 25-basis-point increase in short rates would increase NII by roughly $200 million per year, assuming a portion of the rate increase goes back to the customer. The other $125 billion of deposits are in fixed-rate instruments. These deposits would reprice gradually over a period of time. For every 25-basis-point increase in long rates, our NII pick up would be approximately $100 million per year. Taken together, a 25-basis-point increase in interest rates and our $275 billion in deposits could drive an NII increase of approximately $300 million per year, significant upside when rates rise. This is an overly simplistic way of looking at the upside, but it does provide a way to think about rate impacts.","Having said all of this, we are not assuming a rate increase anytime soon. Our financial plans assume 0 rate increases for at least the next 2 years, which we believe is a prudent way to run the bank. In the U.S., NIM may compress a bit more, but strong volume growth will help offset this negative impact. Revenues should continue to grow as fee income, asset sales and balance sheet optimization, including asset acquisitions, will fuel growth. We believe that these actions balance the benefits of reduced capital volatility and interest rate upside with near-term pressure on NII.","With that, I will turn it over to Mark.","Mark R. Chauvin","Thank you, Colleen, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 14.","Once again, this quarter was quite strong from a credit perspective. Excluding the impact of the Target acquisition, bank-wide PCL rates remained stable quarter-over-quarter, representing the lowest rates experienced in more than 5 years. In Canada, while we continue to closely monitor the high level of consumer indebtedness and the residential real estate market, we're not seeing any concerning trends in our credit metrics. To the contrary, during the quarter, gross impaired loans declined in each of the personal credit portfolios. Delinquency improved across the board. Canadian credit cards continued their positive momentum, leading to a further reduction in loss rates. And commercial and wholesale loss rates remained at historically low levels. To sum up, credit quality of the Canadian personal, commercial and wholesale credit portfolios remains very strong.","Turning to the U.S., we are seeing continued improvement in the legacy portfolios as evidenced by a reduction in loss rates when adjusted for the Target acquisition and the normal course build up of reserves for the growing Indirect auto portfolio. Key portfolio highlights include: the quality of residential mortgage originations remains strong while we experienced some lumpiness in commercial impaired formations during the quarter; the improving trend remains on track; and the acquired portfolios continue to perform well within our expectations.","Now, I'll turn the presentation back to Rudy.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Great. Thanks, Mark. We'll now open it up for questions. And to give everyone a chance to participate, please keep to one question and then requeue. For those participating in person here in the room, can I ask you to identify your name and firm before asking your question. And before ending the call today, I will ask Ed to offer some final remarks.","So why don't we get started in the room? So let's start with Peter.","Question-and-Answer Session","Peter D. Routledge - National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division","Peter Routledge from National Bank Financial. A question, Colleen, on [indiscernible] to your disclosure, and then I also have the Supp Pack, a line where you show the impact of the 100-basis-point rising rates [indiscernible] and that number has gone from something near 0 to around 4%, let's say, which is not massive, but it strikes me as somewhat uncharacteristic of TD and TD's asset and liability management principles. So maybe, can you talk about how you're thinking about that sensitivity? I'm not suggesting it's a bad thing, it's just different from where TD was traditionally on that issue. And two, how high could that number get? It's 262 now in your Supp Pack. How much higher could that get before you start to pull back?","Colleen M. Johnston","So Peter, I'm going to start off just to respond to your question about the Supp Pack, and then Ed's going to talk about the broader philosophy. So the numbers in the Supp Pack are really not representative of what would happen in the case of a rate change, and they really assume that every -- that when rates move, everything moves up. In fact, customer rates move at the same rate and, obviously, market rates move. So it's not really a helpful number in terms of simulating what would happen with rate increases. And obviously, it doesn't model in all the other variables around customer behavior, et cetera. So the models that we have internally, and again, the many variants of that, give you, I think, a little bit more of an idea of, again, in this case, what we're modeling 25 basis points. Having said that, that isn't linear, again, because even if you think about what happens if you go to 50 or 100, you don't necessarily take that multiple. Again, you have to factor in all of the changes in behavior, et cetera. And this isn't just a NIM game. Obviously, it affects -- these things affect volume as well. So what we really wanted to do through this process is just -- again, without trying to drill too much into our models, at least give you an indication that there is a fair amount of NII upside. And I think on the philosophy, Ed would like to walk through that.","W. Edmund Clark","There's no question that as we shorten up the duration, we start affecting that number. The way you're required to report that number, what it basically says is that the U.S. would go to a minus 80-basis-point interest rate, and you can come to your own conclusion if that's a realistic number to assume. And so we don't believe it is. And so in turn, in terms of our own models, we look at a world in which, definitely, if the Canadian rates could come down and it's possible that the U.S. goes down to 0, but we think it's -- you're starting to get into quite a different world if you say you're going to run the bank on the assumption that we're going to have large negative interest rates in the United States. So as we shorten up the duration, though, that number does expand. But what we do is the internal measure we use is a measure that says well, let's have a base of 0 for the United States and a number somewhat higher than that for Canada and hold that as our constraint of how short we'll actually go duration. The reality is, it would -- it's a judgment call. There is clearly, as you shorten up duration, you are running higher risk that interest rates will fall here, but you are also getting potentially 3 to 4 times upside if interest rates start to move. And we're saying explicitly, the market, to hold your position and say I want it to be neutral, which means go out long duration here, I think -- we think is the wrong positioning for the bank, and that's why we're trying to be explicit with you that, yes, we've shortened duration and we are willing to give up earnings in the short run to have a better percentage leverage on interest rates rising. Constrained, though, we have an internal measure that's not the one in that supplementary pack.","Rudy J. Sankovic","We'll just go across the row. So, John [ph]?","Unknown Analyst","Ed, in terms of the share repurchase program, keeping in mind TD's historic prudence on capital, but when we take a look at what you've announced today as lower than what your peer group has done, how aggressive can we assume that you're going to be on the share repurchase program? And secondarily, can we characterize this as underscoring your recent statements about large acquisitions in the U.S.?","W. Edmund Clark","Well, I don't think -- well, first off, I would say, when we announce something, we'll probably actually do it. So you can expect that we will actually implement this buyback program rather than announce one. But I think we are in a different position than the other banks, and so we're not going to try to imitate the other banks in this. They're running their strategy, which is -- they believe is good for their bank, and we're running ours. And you start with the fact that we do earn a higher rate of return on risk weighted assets or regulatory capital, however you want to mention them. So, therefore, we have a superior ability to generate capital. So in some sense, we have a bigger issue than everyone else. But corresponding to that, we also have more opportunities. And so I think we're \u2013 as you know, we have a balance sheet in the United States. It's long deposits and short assets. We've been very, very prudent and will continue to be very prudent, but we're obviously in the market all the time to say can we in fact acquire more assets? Because clearly, our return on the U.S. investment would be significantly higher if we could fill in that balance sheet. Right now, those are difficult to find at returns, risk-adjusted returns that are acceptable to us, but we wouldn't want to run our capital down to a point where we couldn't afford to buy one. We'd have to issue shares for this kind of small -- I mean, these tend to be small acquisitions. I'll put Target as a small acquisition as a certain order of magnitude. You don't want to have to issue share. So we will probably carry a somewhat bigger cushion. We probably have a smaller cushion in terms of the volatility of our capital than some of our competitors, but we would want more of a cushion to be able to do small asset acquisitions. In today's market, we don't see large acquisitions of anything that's of interesting to us. I think what I'm trying to say in my statement -- though when we look at that, we certainly wouldn't rule it out, that as we look at all those factors, as we generate this capital faster than other people, that we would decide, well, the best thing to do is to give it back. And I do think there's a change in the world that we're in, is that we're in a world of -- a fairly capital-intensive world. And so lugging excess capital around waiting for a deal doesn't seem like a very good thing to be doing. And so if we have a cushion that will allow us to do small acquisitions, I don't know why we'd keep a whole lot more than that.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Just go -- Andre?","Andre-Philippe Hardy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Andre Hardy, RBC Capital Markets. A question on the credit card business. It used to be a business that you described as underpenetrated, made that statement again in justifying the MBNA acquisition in Canada. Is that still a business you view as being underpenetrated? And if yes, is it the right time to be looking to increase that business given the high consumer leverage?","Timothy D. Hockey","So I'll take that. I'd say, in Canada, we used to talk about it being underpenetrated relative to its market share versus our sort of traditional 21%, 22% share. We now have #1 share in the credit card space. So we would see that as being, yes, still a growth opportunity, but certainly not one that we would have had, say, 5 years ago. The question for us is North American and in that case, we certainly believe that there are great growth opportunities in the U.S. ahead of us, if nothing else other than just penetrating our existing customer base in our U.S. store base.","W. Edmund Clark","I guess the one follow-up comment I'd make is it's probably -- I mean, the MBNA turned out to be a terrific acquisition for us. So it's been a very good acquisition. And I think it -- and it was a factor in our winning the Target deal, combined with Target, which also has turned out to be a very good deal. I mean, it's clearly put us in a position where there are more -- there are opportunities coming our way in North America. And given my earlier comments being we have a deposit-rich bank, and so that's obviously an area that prudently -- and I think there, it's a matter of building your operational capability to take advantage of the opportunities that are coming our way.","Rudy J. Sankovic","We'll start in the front row here.","Michael Goldberg - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division","Michael Goldberg, Desjardins Securities. To get back to capital for a second, do you want to reiterate what you probably said in the past, how does continuing dividend growth fit into your capital plans in addition to the share buyback? And in relation to looking at the asset expansion, if you are going to do something and you've been successful with auto loans, cards and mortgages in the U.S., would it most likely be in those areas? Or would you want to start adding to your capability in U.S. C&I?","W. Edmund Clark","I'll start and then I can put Bharat. So on -- first off, our dividend policy hasn't changed. And as you know, it's a pretty good new story for the shareholders that we've said that we would -- we've  moved our dividend payout ratio range, and so we've got to get ourselves more in the middle of that range. As always, we're going to do it the TD way, which is just every year, methodically, go up to that range. But that implies that our dividends will grow faster than our earnings per share, which is exactly what has been happening. But there's probably a couple of years left where that will continue to happen. So we've always separated out your dividend strategy and your capital strategy. If you have surplus capital that you don't think you're going to use in the near future, then buy back shares. If you have great earnings growth, you can have great dividend growth. In our case, it's supplemented by the fact that we've decided to change the payout ratio. I think we don't rule out entering the new spaces of asset generation. But clearly, you have to be a lot more careful about doing that, in a sense, buying asset-generation capability that you don't have, than you are expanding it where you already have demonstrated capability. So your threshold of returns would be, obviously, much higher where you're going into a new piece of territory than it would be if you're just adding on to a portfolio.","Bharat B. Masrani","Michael, the only thing I'd add is that there are, apart from the 3 asset classes you talked about, there are other areas that are of focus for us. We already have existing capability, but we are adding to those capabilities. And those would be in health care. We have an interest in building that business even more than what we have today. The other one is asset-based lending. We do have a small team that we've been adding on to it. And the third one there has become a new focus area for us, given that we have TD Auto Finance, is dealer floor plan in the U.S. So those are the types of businesses where we are building out capabilities. And if there were suitable portfolios or assets available in those areas, we would certainly look at it seriously.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Jason?","Jason Bilodeau - TD Securities Equity Research","Jason Bilodeau, TD Securities. For Tim, your residential secured lending growth was sort of 4% year-on-year. I don't want to slice this too finely, but if you marry that with sort of Ed's comments that it looks like housing is in a process of decelerating, could we see this number be slipping into low-single digits in the back half of the year? And how does that frame up for your revenue picture? And I know we haven't seen the rest of the group yet, but how do you feel your market share in that category has been performing the last few months?","Timothy D. Hockey","So I will start with the second question. Market share actually -- and overall, real estate secured lending is actually basically flat, slightly up year-over-year. So it might be an industry-type statement. So yes, we have seen a deceleration in real estate secured lending growth, probably slightly faster than we expected if you'd asked us this time last year. And so -- but we are still expecting that number to be in the, call it, high end of the middle -- I don't know how to say that. Call it 3% to 5%, 4% to 6%, somewhere in there. But it's decelerating, absolutely.","Jason Bilodeau - TD Securities Equity Research","Okay. And 1% to 2% seems to you to be sort of a downside case?","Timothy D. Hockey","Yes, that's -- certainly not this year.","Rudy J. Sankovic","John?","John Reucassel - BMO Capital Markets Canada","John Reucassel from BMO Capital Markets. Don't know if it's a question for Colleen or Bharat, just the non-interest income in the U.S. business, it looked like it was up $30 million this quarter versus Q1 and $50 million, call it, versus Q2 last year. Is that all Target-related? And Target was halfway through the quarter, so what else is going on there? Or should we expect this -- is there a bigger jump coming in this number for the rest of the year?","Colleen M. Johnston","So if you look at the quarter-over-quarter increase, that was largely Target. And to your question, Target, we really have half a quarter of Target now. So you'll see the full effect in Q3.","John Reucassel - BMO Capital Markets Canada","So is there -- not to put too -- so instead of $30 million, was there really -- there's really $60 million additional, non-interest income fees on this Target portfolio per quarter? If I looked at it Q1 versus...","Colleen M. Johnston","So the increase was about $40 million, I think, quarter-over-quarter. And yes, you double that for the full impact of Target on a full quarter basis.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Anyone else in the room? Darko.","Darko Mihelic - Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division","It's Darko from Cormark Securities. Just wanted to follow-up with Tim on the residential mortgage question. And really, what I'm after here is -- I just kind of want to understand what's happening on the ground with respect to Ed's comments earlier about the government changes and sort of what we're seeing at the really ground level. I'll give you an example. Table 18 of your shareholders' report provides for us the breakdown of your insured and your uninsured residential mortgage portfolio. If you compare that to last quarter, what you see is your insured actually went down, and your uninsured portfolio went up and not by an immaterial amount. That would sound surprising to me relative to what would have been the behavior, say, 1 year or 2 ago. Is the first-time home buyer being kicked out here in the market? Can you talk to where these originations are coming from? Is the broker origination -- the broker-originated mortgages, is that slowing as a percentage of overall originations? I'm just looking for some sort of a flavor for what the government changes have brought about.","Timothy D. Hockey","So I'm tempted to just say it's moderating as expected, but I think there's an expectation of a more fulsome answer. So if you want color on the ground -- and you've asked a bunch of different questions in there. So what we're seeing is -- so we're now into what I would consider to be a late spring market. But if you step back and say what's been happening over a multiple number of years, as Ed said, we've been quite concerned about the overall growth rate of real estate secured lending for the last number of years. And so the regulatory changes that have actually been taking place over a number of years, quite prudently implemented over a long period of time, are actually having almost precisely the effect that we would have expected, which is a slow landing. So to your point about things like what's happening with the first-time homebuyer and origination shift, so I'll give you -- we don't actually track. There's no good stats on first-time versus not. But clearly, because of the changes around the high-ratio mortgage versus conventional, all the mortgage originations are down year-over-year, but conventional are down less. So in other words, what you would sort of ascribe to be -- subscribe to be first-time homebuyers have actually had more of an impact, which you could say is probably bang on what the regulatory changes would have expected. Overall, we're clearly seeing that even notwithstanding a low interest rate environment, and obviously there's been lots of conversation about that, the rate that consumers are not backing up the truck and actually creating a frothy housing market as low interest rates are usually incenting them to do. And in other asset classes, obviously, the growth rates are even slower. In terms of channel originations, all channels are down year-over-year. In our particular case, our broker channel is down less, but that I would ascribe much more to service improvements and changes we've made in our own channels as opposed to an industry phenomenon. Pricing from that point of view is -- I would say, pricing is aggressive but not unduly so for a spring market. And clearly, it was a cold spring. So that does have an effect on the activity. As recently as just last month and early this month, there's some speculation as is there going to be a resurgence. But if you talk to Craig Alexander at TD Economics, he would say our expectation is still for having a fairly tepid spring mortgage market. So again, it leads us to believe that there is a moderation in effect. And so we continue to believe that there is -- there will continue to be a soft landing and generating the sort of year-over-year growth that we've been talking about going forward. But I think maybe the real question is, what if we're wrong? What if in fact that there is a crisis and in fact, that they're -- it's not a soft landing, but it is an asset bubble that bursts? To that end, we obviously spend a lot of time stressing our portfolio. As we said multiple times, we do stress tests to quite extreme cases, including the worst case scenario going back to the depression in Canada. Every time we do that, and we've become quite expert at doing stress tests, it continues to show that in Canada, given the nature of this business, given the government guarantees and the insurance portfolio that we continue to make money in Canadian banking overall, we don't go into the negative. So on the one hand, we've said, we were worried because we think what's good for Canada is good for TD. On the other hand, 4 or 4 years into the changes, it's moderating exactly as expected. But if we're wrong at whatever percentage of likelihood that is, then we still feel good about the stress test. So Mark has anything to add, but...","Mark R. Chauvin","Yes. The only thing I would add on the stress test, it's really not the mortgage portfolio that you're worried about. And that if you paint that type of scenario where you have such a reduction in house prices across the country, it's really your other credit portfolios that would be more of a concern, the unsecured credit portfolios and your commercial portfolio. So we stress that as well. And really, through the deepest scenario that we can paint, the Canadian operations remain profitable. I mean, it's not a good picture, but it's a profitable picture.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Operator, why don't we go to the phones now, please?","Operator","Absolutely. Your first question is from Robert Sedran from CIBC.","Robert Sedran - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","Tim, there's been a -- I wanted to come back to the credit card issue. There's been a fair bit of chatter in the market about the travel cards and loyalty programs and such. I wonder if you can just give us a sense of whether you're satisfied with your positioning in that segment, how the card has been performing? And then I wonder if I can paraphrase your earlier answer to the credit card question as we definitely are looking to gain share in that business, but perhaps not necessarily in Canada.","Timothy D. Hockey","So we're quite comfortable with our travel card portfolio, it's growth rate. But as opportunities come up and for market share expansion, whether it be in the U.S. or in Canada, we continue to be interested. We think this is a great space even at this point in the credit cycle.","Robert Sedran - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","What segment of the credit card market is growing more rapidly, Tim?","Timothy D. Hockey","I would say the high-end spend cards. I mean, Canadians love their point programs, and they continue to use them probably more so than almost any other nation on the planet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Theriault from Merrill Lynch Canada.","Steve Theriault - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A capital markets question for Bob Dorrance, please. So, Bob, a nice trading number this quarter, exceptional really on the fixed income side and from what I can see, without any big jump in vol, without any big jumps in originations. So I was hoping you could tell us, is there something specific to TD here you can highlight for us on the fixed side? Or was the environment just better than what I think we've been expecting here for Q2?","Robert E. Dorrance","Okay. I'm not sure I can say whether there's anything specific to TD because I haven\u2019t seen other results. As you've mentioned, the strength in the trading results was driven by the interest in credit category. The real tailwind in the market thus far during the year and globally has really been in the credit space, broadly speaking. So corporate credit, financial institution credit have all experienced spread compression or price increases. So good volumes in secondary markets, as well as very good volumes in origination markets. So when you combine strong origination of credit with positive trends, it's really the secret sauce to having good trading results in that marketplace.","Steve Theriault - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So nothing unusual as far as you can tell, just a nice, supportive environment?","Robert E. Dorrance","No. I think a very just strong supportive environment in credit across the spectrum, high-yield investment grade leveraged loan. So all those markets I think is -- I think many of you have been pointing out in reports, are very strong. So the participation in that is really what's driven our results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Malhotra from Macquarie Capital.","Sumit Malhotra - Macquarie Research","2 hopefully quick ones for Colleen. A lot of talk about expense management and how the bank has put an increased emphasis on that over the -- or coming into what we expected to be a slower growth revenue year. If I look ahead to Q3, in the last 2 Q3 conference calls you've told us about a large expense uptick that we should expect in Q4. If I look ahead to that, in planning -- certainly planning through expense management much more coming into this year, has it developed to the point where we're not going to see that kind of increase? Do you expect it to be more of a steady state as far as your expense growth is concerned?","Colleen M. Johnston","So, Sumit, we're working very hard to sort of even out our expenses over the course of the year, in particular as it relates to initiative and project spend. And I know the last couple of years, we've had a bit of that snowplow effect in the fourth quarter, and we'd like to try to remedy that. I think the consequence this year is obviously, as I think we've had some success in doing that, then our expense growth rates earlier in the year look a bit higher. I'd like to show you better proof points at this stage in the year around what we're going to achieve on a full year basis. So my sense is that, probably, in Q3, just given that phenomenon, you'll probably still see a bit of an elevated rate of expense growth. So I doubt on a Q3 year-to-date basis I'll be showing you a rate of growth at 3%, but certainly on a full year basis. So in other words, what I'm saying is we are really actively managing our expenses so that we don't have that kind of a blip in the fourth quarter. So again, in fact, I would expect -- I would definitely expect that expenses will be down in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. So that's what we're looking at, at the moment. And I think some very good efforts to I think -- I believe that spreading that expense just means that we can spend that money more wisely and more prudently, and we've made a lot of progress on that.","Sumit Malhotra - Macquarie Research","No, I agree. That makes sense. And the second very quick numbers one for you is within the U.S. segment. So it's somewhat down the same path John Reucassel was on. When I look at the Canadian dollar adjusted expense growth sequentially, it's about $175 million. I know you had warned us that the Target accounting would be somewhat different. So of that $175 million linked quarter, how much of that would you attribute to Target? And whatever that number is, is it fair to say that it just doubles next quarter with the full quarter impact?","Colleen M. Johnston","So, Sumit, why don't I just do a quick line-by-line review of Target? I think it'd just be helpful to have it on the record, and we haven't gone into more detailed disclosure on this, just for some competitive pricing reasons. But if you look at -- I prefer to use U.S. dollars because it's more directly comparable. So if you look at quarter-over-quarter in the U.S. P&C, I'd say if you look at the revenue increase quarter-over-quarter, you could sort of chalk that up pretty much entirely to Target. If you look at the PCL line, our PCLs were up. If you exclude Target -- or actually, our PCLs would be down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And if you look at our expense growth, which was about USD $150 million, about 2\/3 of that would be Target-related, and the other increase was really more timing-related to expenses. So if you strip out the Target-related expenses, in fact, our expenses were down about 1% on a year-over-year basis in the U.S., which I think was a fantastic result when you consider all of the investments that we're making in that franchise. If you look at the Target contribution overall, I know when we announced the deal, we had talked about a 1% ROA on the deal. And I'm happy to say that we're actually achieving a result that's in excess of that number. So we're actually quite pleased with where we've started off with Target in the first couple of months.","Sumit Malhotra - Macquarie Research","That's very helpful. Any impact on the tax line because of Target? Or is that 15%-ish level in the U.S. a reasonable run rate for your business right now?","Colleen M. Johnston","So, no, it didn't have any impact on the tax line. But I would just remind everyone that in the U.S., first of all, our tax rate is sustainable roughly at that level, I'd say probably in the sort of 15% to 18% effective tax rate. And that effective tax rate has come down certainly versus last year and a little bit quarter-over-quarter, and that's because we're doing more of these tax-advantaged loans and investments, partly which is a requirement under The Community Reinvestment Act. And the way that works from a reporting standpoint is that actually, it creates losses at the revenue level, and all of the benefit goes into the tax lines. So even just the way the mechanics work would suggest a -- as you ramp up that business, would suggest a lower effective tax rate. But I would assure you, it's sustainable at roughly that level. And so what that does, when you look at the -- all bank tax rate, and I would say the best way to look at that is on the adjusted TEB basis, which may look a little low, but I would say is partly, it's a decline in the U.S. rate. Partly, wholesale was down a bit, and then mix of business is really driving that rate. I've had a number of questions today, so I thought I would just expand my answer on that.","Rudy J. Sankovic","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gabriel Dechaine from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Gabriel Dechaine - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Commercial real estate in Canada, you've got $21 billion of loans. It's growing pretty fast. Can you just tell me what's been driving that growth? And it's in 2 buckets, residential and non-residential. And then a quick one for Al Jette if he's in the house. 17 -- Page 17 on the supplement, Mortgages Securitized and Retained. It's up $7 billion quarter-over-quarter. What's driven that? I guess, relatedly, are you securitizing loans with the anticipation of using more capacity in the CMB program because industry growth has gone down, something like that, that might help your NIM down the road?","Mark R. Chauvin","So, Gabriel, it's Mark. I'll address the real estate question. So on the -- as you pointed out, the -- in Canadian residential real estate, we have about $13 billion. That consists about 3\/4, or roughly about that amount, is operators of multi-unit residential buildings. They're apartment buildings. And they would all be secured with mortgages. The maximum loan-to-value would be 75%, but it would average below that. And it would all generally be recourse. The balance of it, of about -- the remaining 25% to 30% would be the residential homebuilder or developer, and our condo exposure would be in that area, would be in that segment as well. Again, this is an area that's remained relatively constant over the years for us. We have a pretty constant customer base. We continue to do transactions that we think are strong, and there are strong transactions out there. And the loan quality across that portfolio was quite strong and remained strong. In terms of the non-residential, about $8.4 billion. I'd say 60%, 70% of that is commercial mortgages. So they would be against income-producing properties secured by mortgages. Maximum mortgage would be loan-to-value at origination, but the average would be closer to about 65%, and they would be recourse. The balance of that is generally where we deal with a real estate company that wants an operating line of credit that we secure by taking a charge on real estate within our normal real estate lending guidelines. Again, the quality in both of these portfolios is -- well, as across the entire Canadian Commercial, as I indicated earlier, is very strong, but we've had a very good track record in these 2 segments as well.","Gabriel Dechaine - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So 3 quarters of that '13 apartment buildings, basically?","Mark R. Chauvin","Correct on the first number, yes.","Colleen M. Johnston","Just speaking on behalf of Al Jette here. The increase in the MBS holdings that you called out, Gabriel, was mainly in Canada and reflects liquidity management actions in part related to various wholesale funding maturities later in the year. So the increase doesn't really reflect any change in strategy in terms of the way we're running the bank. And just in the interest of time, I'm happy to follow-up with you later if you want to probe that a bit more. It's pretty straightforward, though.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Mario Mendonca from Canaccord Genuity.","Mario Mendonca - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","If you could help me think through some of your disclosures, first on Page -- Slide 6 of the presentation, you referred -- and this is very likely for Tim again, you refer to a 4% revenue growth if you exclude the M&A credit mark release and 1% adjusted expense growth. I don't think the message you're sending is that you think 3% operating leverage in domestic retail is reasonable. Would that be a fair statement?","Timothy D. Hockey","No, that's right. But if you look at the headline numbers, you're essentially saying it looks like it's flat. But in actual fact, it's more like 1.5 points. And I guess if you're asking how do I feel about the operating leverage going forward in the second half, I believe that, that's achievable at that level, even at lower revenue growth rates.","Mario Mendonca - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Sort of the 1.5?","Timothy D. Hockey","Yes, about there.","Mario Mendonca - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And then -- and sorry, If I could just squeeze in one other quick one, that sort of threw me off, in the presentation, Page 25, you also refer to operating -- or not operating leverage, I'm sorry. You refer to loan-to-values in domestic mortgages or real estate secured as about 40 -- sorry, just bear with me, 47% average current loan to values. But in the report to shareholders, also Page 25, the loan to values look obviously very different. What difference are we looking at here? The newly originated, newly acquired? Is that the difference? And if so, what does newly mean? What time period are you talking about?","Mark R. Chauvin","Yes. The difference is the latter is originations, and that would be during the last quarter.","Mario Mendonca - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Oh, so everything disclosed on Page 25 is a last quarter disclosure?","Mark R. Chauvin","On 25 of the...","Mario Mendonca - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Report to shareholders.","Mark R. Chauvin","Yes.","Colleen M. Johnston","Yes.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Great. Thank you very much. And Ed, over to you for final remarks.","W. Edmund Clark","Great. Thank you, and thank you for staying on. It's a little bit past 4 o'clock here. So I guess our main message is that we foreshadowed most of the issues that are in the industry here and that we ended up so far in the first half about where we expected. If we look forward, we believe that if interest rates stay flat, which we keep underscoring, it has to be a planning assumption if it isn't a forecast, we probably have one more year of NIM compression. And by that point, by the end of 2014, we will have actually worked through the NIM compression for the Bank. And so we won't have this downward pressure. I think there is a possibility that the U.S. recovery, if it keeps on coming on as strong as it has, that, that assumption that flat rates are here for that period of time will turn out to be erroneous. But it's the right basis to run the bank. And we are adjusting to that environment, and you have -- we have to adjust in terms of how we manage expenses and how we manage the expense structure of the bank. And we have to adjust in how we manage capital. And we want to do that in the TD way, which is a way that says -- but at the same time, we're not going to give up future growth. And so we're willing to take short-term earnings hits as we are, and are managing our duration to position ourselves when rates finally move there in a good position. But we are also going to keep on investing on the business because we're about building great franchise. And getting this balance is a hard thing to do in the environment. But as I said before, that's what we get paid to do for a living. Thank you very much.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thank you, Ed. And with that, we will end the meeting.

The Bank believes that adjusted results provide readers with a better understanding of how management views the Bank's performance. Bharat will be referring to adjusted results in his remarks. Additional information on items of note, the Bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q2 2019 report to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Gillian, and thank you everyone for joining us today.","Q2 was a great quarter for TD. Earnings increased 7% to $3.3 billion and EPS rose 8% to $1.75, driven by record results in our retail businesses, and a rebound in wholesale. We had good revenue growth in the quarter. Credit quality remained sound and we continued to invest in building the bank of the future. Our CET1 ratio held steady at 12%, including 5.5 million common shares bought back during the quarter.","Given our robust capital base and consistent ability to generate organic capital, we announced our intention today to initiate a new NCIB for the repurchase of up to 20 million common shares for cancellation, subject to regulatory approval.","Overall, I'm pleased with our results this quarter. They reflect the benefits of our diversified business mix and North American scale, as well as our risk discipline. Our proven business model is a powerful enabler, allowing us to deliver on our purpose today as we reinvest in our competitive advantages to transform the Bank for the digital age.","This quarter, we took a decisive step forward with our enterprise cloud strategy as part of a broader effort to modernize our operations and put in place a state-of-the-art technology architecture, one that increases our agility and creates productivity savings we can reinvest in delivering better customer experiences.","We participated in the launch of Verified.Me, a blockchain-enabled digital ID service, designed to allow customers to verify their identity quickly and securely, using personal information they can send to share from their bank with service providers of their choice. Verified.Me is an exciting new application of an emerging technology developed through a collaborative market-led approach that is putting Canada at the forefront of the global move to a digital ID.","We also continue to support the development of Canada's AI ecosystem. On the heels of our acquisition of Layer 6 last year, we seeding the next round of innovation with our foundational investment in Radical Ventures, an AI-focused venture capital fund. Canada has become a magnet with top AI talent globally. And we are seeing the same phenomenon at TD where the Layer 6 team has doubled in size over the past year, accelerating our ability to drive better business decisions and enhance the customer experience.","These investments are at the heart of our forward focus strategy, and there are just a few examples of how we are continuously adapting and reinventing ourselves to deliver innovative experiences for our customers. We were delighted to be recognized for our efforts on that front this quarter with not one, not two, but three J.D. Power awards for customer service excellence.","In Canada TDCT won the award for highest customer satisfaction levels among the big five banks, ranking highest in overall satisfaction, convenience and channel activities. And TD Auto Finance Canada ranked highest in dealer satisfaction among non-captive retail lenders for the second year in a row. And in the U.S., TD Bank, America\u2019s Most Convenient Bank, received highest customer satisfaction with retail banking in the Southeast.","As I\u2019ve often said, we don't design our strategy to win awards, we win awards because of how we execute on that strategy. It's a testament to the value of our omni-channel approach and the power of the one TD model. And none of it would be possible without our people and their relentless focus on doing more for our customers every day, across the enterprise and in each of our businesses.","Let me turn to our business segments now. Canadian Retail delivered again in Q2 with $1.9 billion, up 2% as strong revenue growth was matched by continued high level of investment. In the personal and commercial bank, our J.D. Power wins are just one outcome of putting the customer at the center of everything we do. Another is the volume growth we continue to generate as customers respond to the investments we've made in our products, platforms and advice capabilities by entrusting us with more of their business.","We also saw strong net asset growth in our wealth business as we leverage our scale to create new sources of value for our customers from digital resources, like TD Direct Investing, new goal assist tool, which enables WebBroker clients to build personalized investment plans to the new mortgage and private debt funds we launch for our private wealth clients, offering access to TD Greystone expertise in alternative assets. We\u2019re delighted with the progress of the Greystone integration, which is bringing together two first class investment teams with complementary capabilities and highly compatible cultures.","Turning to the U.S., our U.S. Retail Bank delivered impressive results this quarter as well, with earnings up 12% to $753 million. The strong performance was driven by good revenue growth, reflecting higher deposit margins and volume growth and positive operating leverage. And with the contribution from TD Ameritrade up 27%, segment earnings rose to US$948 million, up 15% or 20% in Canadian dollars.","We've laid a strong foundation for future growth in our U.S. business. Over the past 10 years, we've been rebuilding our core infrastructure and platforms, this quarter successfully converting our small business customers to our new digital, next generation platform. Our J.D. Power win is a strong endorsement of these continued investments, and of our commitment to create experiences that respond to our customers\u2019 evolving needs.","Rounding out our businesses. Wholesale Banking bounced back from a tough first quarter. Earnings were $221 million, reflecting higher levels of M&A and underwriting activity, alongside continued investment in the global expansion of our U.S. dollar strategy.","TD Securities also won several signature mandates. We advised Goldcorp on their US$12.5 billion merger with Newmont to create the world's leading gold company. We advised Brookfield Business Partners and CDPQ on their acquisition of Power Solutions from Johnson Controls and co-led Brookfield\u2019s dual-currency term loan B and high yield bond financings.","In our global markets business, we were awarded our first euro benchmark mandate by KFW, the biggest SSA issuer in the euro market. The \u20ac5 billion deal is TD Securities\u2019 largest SSA bond underwriting to date and marks a major milestone in the growth of our euro franchise. And we led TD Bank\u2019s highly successful \u20ac1.5 billion 5-year senior debt issue, the first benchmark senior offering in the euro market from a Canadian bank bail-inable securities.","As I reflect on the first half of the year, I\u2019m pleased with our performance. It reflects continued momentum in our franchise businesses, good credit quality and better conditions this quarter for market based revenues.","Looking ahead, the macro environment remains fluid. Trade and geopolitical tensions are heating up, and economic conditions remain mixed with several output indicators still soft, while employment growth remains strong. As we move through the second half of the year, we will remain focused on our long-term strategy, which has delivered consistent earnings growth over time and provided us with the capacity to invest in our purpose to enrich the lives of our customers, colleagues and communities.","This month, we issued two reports, demonstrating our commitment to this purpose. Our environmental, social and governance report, which presents TD's ESG scorecard for 2018 and our report on the Ready Commitment, which outlines the impact about corporate citizenship strategy in our four priority areas of environmental stewardship, financial security, connected communities and better health. I encourage you to read these reports which provide a wealth of information on the purposeful investments our strategy is enabling.","I also want to take a moment to focus on the spring flooding in Eastern Canada. These events have impacted thousands of people in multiple communities. We've taken steps to provide support including financial contributions to the Red Cross and through our branch network, as well as through direct customer outreach to help those we serve, cope with the challenges. We're also closely monitoring the fires in Western Canada and are in touch with the Red Cross to determine how best to support those affected. In these moments, we want to be there for our customers, colleagues and communities.","To wrap up, we are delivering strong results today while laying a strong foundation for the future. That includes the new workspace we are creating at 160 Front Street West, a brand new office tower in the heart of downtown Torrent. Our vision for the future of our workplaces is built around the goal of bringing our people and teams together in ways that promote collaboration and improve workflow supported by investments in the right tools and resources. 160 Front Street is a key part of this initiative. It will be a powerful complement to our flagship TD Center and a best-in-class workplace for our people, our most important asset. I will close by thanking them, our more than 85,000 colleagues around the world who are living our shared commitments each day and devoting themselves to being ready for our customers.","With that I will turn things over to Riaz.","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you, Bharat. Good afternoon, everyone, and please turn to slide seven.","This quarter, the Bank reported earnings of $3.2 billion and EPS of $1.70. Adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion and adjusted EPS was at $1.75. Revenue increased 8%, reflecting volume growth and higher margins in our businesses, as well as higher fee based revenues. Provisions for credit losses decreased 26% quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card and auto portfolios. Expenses increased 8%, reflecting continued investments in employees supporting business growth and strategic initiatives.","Please turn to slide eight.","Canadian Retail net income was $1.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by charges related to the Greystone acquisition, as well as higher expenses, insurance claims and credit losses. Adjusted net income increased 2%. Revenue increased 8%, reflecting volume growth, margin expansion, higher insurance and fee revenue, and the acquisition of Greystone. Average loans increased 6% year-over-year and average deposits increased 3%, reflecting growth in both personal and business volumes.","Margin was 2.99%, up 5 basis points sequentially, reflecting a refinement in revenue recognition assumptions in the auto finance portfolio and an increase in the Prime BA spread. Total PCL decreased 10% quarter-over-quarter with reductions in both impaired and performing PCLs. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 27 basis points, down 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Expenses increased 11%, reflecting higher spend supporting business growth, including additional FTE and volume-related costs, charges related to Greystone and increased investment in strategic initiatives, including marketing and capability builds in data and digital technology.","Please turn to slide nine.","U.S. Retail segment net income was US$948 million, up 23% year-over-year on a reported basis and 15% on an adjusted basis. U.S. Retail Bank reported earnings rose 14% on strong revenue growth of 6%. Average loan volumes increased 5% year-over-year, reflecting growth in the personal and business customer segments. Deposit volumes, excluding the TD Ameritrade\u2019s sweep deposits, were up 4%, including 5% growth in core consumer checking accounts.","Net interest margin was 3.38%, down 4 basis points sequentially, primarily due to seasonal increases in deposits. Net interest margin was up 15 basis points year-over-year, largely reflecting higher deposit margins.","Total PCL including only the Bank's contractual portion of credit losses in the strategic cards portfolio was $170 million, down 26% sequentially, reflecting lower provisions for the commercial portfolio and seasonal trends in the credit card and auto portfolios. The U.S. Retail net PCL ratio was 45 basis points, down 14 basis points from last quarter.","Expenses decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting the elimination of the FDIC surcharge, recovery of a legal provision this quarter and charges associated with the Scottrade acquisition in the same quarter last year. The contribution from TD's investment in TD Ameritrade increased to US$195 million, and segment ROE increased to 13.2%.","Please turn to slide 10.","Net income for wholesale rebounded sequentially to $221 million, reflecting higher trading related revenue and advisory and underwriting fees as market conditions improved. Net income was down $46 million from the same quarter last year. Revenue is comparable with Q2 of last year, but reflecting higher advisory and underwriting fees, offset by lower trading related revenue. Noninterest expenses increased 16%, reflecting continued investments in the global expansion of our U.S. dollar strategy and the impact of FX translation.","Please turn to slide 11.","The Corporate segment reported a net loss of $161 million in the quarter compared to a net loss of $163 million in the same quarter last year. Net corporate expenses were lower year-over-year, largely reflecting lower net pension expenses in the current quarter.","Please turn to slide 12.","Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 12% at the end of the second quarter, consistent with the first quarter. We had strong organic capital generation this quarter which added 40 basis points to our capital position. And this was mostly offset by growth in RWA, reflecting volume growth as well as the transition of a Canadian credit card portfolio to AIRB, as well as the repurchase of common shares in the quarter. ","Our leverage ratio was 4.2% and our liquidity coverage ratio was 135%. We announced our intention to initiate a new NCIB for upto 20 million common shares, subject to regulatory approval.","I will now turn the call over to Ajai.","Ajai Bambawale","Thank you, Riaz, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 13.","Credit quality remained strong in the second quarter across all business segments as evidenced by reductions in gross impaired loan formations, gross impaired loans and credit losses. Gross impaired loan formations were $1.34 billion or 20 basis points, down 6 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 2 basis points year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross impaired loans formation reflects higher prior quarter formations in the U.S. commercial portfolio, primarily attributable to the power and utility sector, and seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card and auto portfolios. Consistent with recent quarters, there were no new formations in the wholesale segment.","Please turn to slide 14.","Gross impaired loans ended the quarter at $3.3 billion or 48 basis points, down 5 basis points quarter-over-quarter and stable year-over-year. The U.S. Retail segment was the primary contributor to the Bank's $238 million quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross impaired loans, reflecting a reclassification to performing for certain U.S. HELOC clients, current with their payments, and seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The wholesale segment maintained a zero impaired loan balance quarter-over-quarter.","Please turn to slide 15.","Recall that our presentation reports PCL ratios with gross and net of the partners' share of the U.S. strategic card credit losses. We remind you that credit losses recorded in the corporate segment are fully absorbed by our partners and do not impact the Bank's net income. The Bank's PCLs for the quarter were $636 million or 39 basis points, down 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and up 3 basis points year-over-year. The $219 million quarter-over-quarter PCL decrease was driven by typical seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card and auto portfolios and the Canadian consumer lending portfolios.","Please turn to slide 16.","Both in impaired and performing PCL decreased quarter-over-quarter, reflecting U.S. seasonal trends, as already mentioned, generally lower performing PCL across Canadian Retail, and higher prior quarter impaired PCL in the U.S. commercial portfolio, primarily attributable to the power and utility sector. In summary, credit quality was strong across the Bank's portfolios, and we remain well-positioned for continued growth.","With that, operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now take questions from the telephone lines. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Sumit Malhotra from Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.","Sumit Malhotra","First question is for Riaz on capital. Riaz, one of your counterparts this morning talked to us about IFRS 16 and the impact that would have in -- to start 2020. Just thinking about that for TD and especially with your larger branch footprint. Are you able to give us an idea what you're expecting from a capital impact for that implementation?","Riaz Ahmed","We're working our way through the standard, Sumit. And as you can appreciate, there are some interpretational items that we need to work our way through and some choices that need to be made. So, we're not prepared to quantify what the impact would be. However, as you well know, when the right of used asset gets capitalized at the beginning of the next fiscal year, it will be risk weighted and impact -- I assume -- I'm expecting that impact to be very manageable.","Sumit Malhotra","All right. So, that\u2019s something, as you said, there are some choices you made, we can revisit that later in the year?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes.","Sumit Malhotra","And then, I'll wrap up with a question on the wholesale side. So, I think, you communicated to us last quarter revenue would stabilize. We've seen that here. I just want to focus on the expense side of the equation, and specifically the build-out that has been referenced to a few times. When we look at the headcount in this segment, it's about - it's up about 10% year-over-year, and you've had a pretty steady climb over that period of time. Just maybe two questions here, if you can give us an idea of how this expansion is going to trend. Is there a number you have in mind as to the amount of full time complement that has to be added to get to the scale in wholesale outside of Canada that you're looking for?","And then, secondly, I hope I'm not putting you on the spot, but I didn't see this in the annual report. Approximately, how much of your revenue in the segment is being generated outside of Canada, if we use full-year numbers for 2018?","Bob Dorrance","Okay, thanks. Yes. We have, as we\u2019ve mentioned on the way through, invested in building out both the global markets businesses as well as the corporate investment banking business, project really to grow U.S. dollar revenue, both in the U.S. region, as well as in other parts of the world in which we operate. We\u2019ve had a fairly aggressive build in people on the front office side in the last two and half years. We have added approximately 200 front office people, roughly half and half split between global markets and corporate investment banking. And then of course you need to also invest in infrastructure and people and support and control et cetera. So, it\u2019s a been a relatively large investment for TD Securities.","We feel we\u2019re at a point now though where that will slow down fairly meaningfully. We\u2019re still looking to add a person here and there in some of the areas. But now, we're more focused on achieving the revenue that we're making the investment for. And there is J curve in that. Some businesses are further along in the cycle, we\u2019ve been working at them. Our SSA U.S. dollar business has been up and running now for a number of years. And we had a market share there where we're in the top five banks in U.S. dollars SSA space. In that business now, we're starting to add euro and sterling. But, it's a fully invested business. Contrast to that, primary services or prime services I should say in U.S., it\u2019s couple of years old. First part of that was investing in systems and policies and metrics and people. But that is now running and the focus there is adding the clients that we now need to make it more profitable business. And we have probably more of the latter type than we do the SSA business. So, bottom-line, Sumit, is we\u2019ve -- the growth in FTE will be relatively small in the front office side.","Riaz Ahmed","On the matter\u2026","Sumit Malhotra","\u2026was on the revenue mix or geographic mix?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. I think -- Sumit, it\u2019s Riaz. On the matter of geographic mix of the revenue, as you know, we make very careful choices about how we define segment. And I think you should look at TD Securities as an integrated global segment. Yes, we do make disclosures in the annual report about where the sources of revenue are. And that is more a legal entity reflection of the accumulation and aggregation of earnings. But, when you have the global centers, for example from a trading perspective that are in London, Singapore, New York, Toronto, you have funding sources that come from variety -- the trading book really should be thought of more as an integrated business unit. So, I don\u2019t think it makes sense to break it out -- the wholesale results in that way.","Sumit Malhotra","Yes. I\u2019ll leave it here. I mean, obviously, some of the Canadian peers anyway who have expanded more into U.S. in the wholesale business have provided that information. And I think really, what I\u2019m getting at here as Bob has detailed, you\u2019ve certainly added full-time complement in the U.S., and it would be interesting to see how the revenue progression for that expense that you've made is trending. And I think that would be helpful to gauge that. So, I hear you, but hopefully that\u2019s other one we can revisit going forward.","Riaz Ahmed","Okay. Thank you.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Meny Grauman from Cormark Securities. Please go ahead.","Meny Grauman","Good afternoon. If I look year-to-date adjusted EPS growth about 4%, so I'm wondering how confident you are that you can still get to the bottom end of your 7% to 10% range for 2019.","Bharat Masrani","Meny, this is Bharat. Last quarter when we talked about this, we said, there is a lot of headwinds, there is some tailwinds that has not changed. In my remarks upfront, I talked about some of the risks that we see out there. But overall, the way we set up -- our medium-term target of hitting 7% to 10% earnings growth continues to be applicable from TD. And we'll try very hard, as I said last quarter to try and get towards the bottom end of that range going forward.","Meny Grauman","Okay. So, still realistic. And then, just in terms of expenses, what's the outlook? In the past, you've talked about sort of a slowdown in the second half of the year in terms of expense growth and a ramping up in operating leverage. Can you update us on how you're thinking about expenses in the second half of the year and operating leverage?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes, absolutely, Meny. It\u2019s Riaz. As we said coming out of 2016 that we were making room to make investments. And then, if you look at our expense growth coming into \u201817 and \u201818, you can see that steady ramp-up of expenses and particularly in 2018, over the four quarters, we had an increasing expense profile, which is now beginning to plateau out and we're seeing a more level set of expenses from a quarter-to-quarter basis. So, what that means is that we have brought our expenses to a level where we feel that we're making the investments that we need to make and still driving out the right productivity. But, it just turned out that the result of that is in the first half, you see a larger expense growth number which will moderate quite a lot in Q3 and Q4, but at comparable expense, absolute expense spending levels.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Good afternoon. I just wanted to clarify something to your previous statement on expenses. From what I recall, like we saw pretty meaningful ramp-up in the back half of last year. So, was the point there that we should see pretty healthy operating leverage in the back half of the year when we look at third and fourth quarter?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. I think that's exactly right, Ebrahim, that as our expense spending growth rate and investment growth rate will normalize or moderate in the second half, it should create better operating leverage. And as you know, we always strive to create operating leverage year after year after year. And so, I do expect that you will see much better metrics on that front.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Got it. And I just wanted to focus on the U.S. Retail margin. One, in terms of, Riaz, if you can just talk about what you're seeing in terms of deposit pricing pressure with the Fed on hold, and your outlook for the margin? And secondly, if you can talk about any actions you're taking to protect the margin, if the Fed ends up cutting interest rates at some point over the next 12 months, given sensitivity to your margin as well as sensitivity at Ameritrade to declining interest rates?","Greg Braca","Ebrahim, thank you for the questions. It\u2019s Greg Braca. I will just first start on the margin question. If we think about the quarter-over-quarter, you saw we were down 4 basis points. But, I would like to point out that year-over-year, we're still up a healthy 15 basis points. And generally, the way we would look at the sequential quarter-over-quarter, little bit of a dip is Riaz upfront mentioned, some seasonal deposits. So, we could talk about it in terms of mix of loan and deposit volumes in quarter-over-quarter and that contributed to the decline.","But the way I would think about it, and I\u2019ve talked about this for a couple of quarters now is the quality of the deposit growth and what we're seeing in the U.S. is a very competitive and dynamic environment with both large and small organizations really looking to put on deposits and show some ability to grow. Some are going about it with core franchise growth, and some are paying up for it. We clearly are not in that latter half camp. And we -- our betas remain very well in check. And we've done a very good job growing core DDA and core checking account growth. And we've talked about that in the past as well. Core consumer checking account growth up year-over-year, up 5% is really -- is healthy household acquisition and goes to our whole model around primacy and convenience and all the things that we talked extensively about.","To your second question, when you think about protecting that margin, if interest rates go the other way, or whatever the case may be, I do think it goes back to the way I answered this first question is that our goal here regardless of the environment is to drive core household growth, not pay off for hot deposits, drive, core checking account growth, and we're seeing that across all of our lines of business, including small business and consumer. So, that's how I\u2019d answer that.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Just a quick follow-up on that. So, the margin went down seasonally impacted because of deposit mix shift, is the outlook that it should hold relative to 2Q levels or do you expect incrementally more compression as the year progresses?","Greg Braca","So the way we look at quarter-over-quarter or the next few quarters out, these things are going to tend to bump around a bit. And very difficult, because in addition to just volume, there's a whole host of things. So that we always talk about that goes into it, long term rates, investments, loan yields. So, there's a whole suite of things that would go into that margin story. But, what I would generally say is with a stable outlook from the Fed, and barring anything further dramatic on the long end, you generally tend to see -- general statement over several quarters fairly stable margins.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Sedran from CIBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Sedran","Riaz, I just wanted a quick clarification, actually on the comment you made about the Canadian margin, which was the impact of, I guess a change in revenue recognition around the auto finance book. Can you -- a little more color and whether that is a one-time item on the revenue line that will fall away or if that was a recurring thing that will keep the margin at the level it got too?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes No, Rob, what that's about is that we're seeing faster prepayments in the auto book, which would therefore result in faster revenue recognitions. It wasn\u2019t a methodology, it\u2019s actually the underlying assumptions. And so, I think that as we continue to see those prepayments, we will see more faster revenue recognition along -- in that portfolio.","Robert Sedran","So, as long as consumer behavior remains where consumer behavior has been, the margin is going to evolve from here as opposed to giving back 2 or 3 basis points that was up this quarter?","Riaz Ahmed","I don\u2019t think that it should have big impact on margins going forward, it may just come off as things level off a little bit in our new assumptions. So, similar to what Greg said about the U.S., I think Canadian margins probably bump around a bit from here, but that would be an adjustment to assumptions that doesn\u2019t occur all the time.","Robert Sedran","And so, the rest of the margin trajectory from here is consistent with the prior guidance, there is a leak upwards, I guess?","Riaz Ahmed","I think, slight bias upwards. But I would say, as Greg indicated, it\u2019s true in Canada as well that lots changes in terms of product competition and consumer behavior. So, I think it's better to stay that it will bump up and down little bit here and there.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steve Theriault from Eight Capital. Please go ahead.","Steve Theriault","If you could go back to the capital markets for a moment and focusing on expenses. So, the last couple of quarters, the expense line\u2019s been about $600 million plus or minus a few million. Wondering how -- is that -- should we think about it as a run rate? And I look at year-on-year, the revenue line was identical, expenses were about $80 million higher. How much of that $80 million or so year-on-year increase is from the higher U.S. expenses as you build that out?","Bob Dorrance","I think there is some -- I think, we\u2019re of the view that the 600 a quarter is something that we should probably be modeling in ourselves. And the reason I was hesitating thee is there is also regulatory build and technology build and Brexit build and some of that may be recurring, and some may not be recurring. So, I think, we certainly have been pending money on, if you want to call, the EU-27 regulatory, we\u2019ve been spending a lot of money on that type of activity. So, that may slow down. I think, what the real key though is that we need to grow revenue to make the return on the investment. And if that is not occurring at the pace we need, then we need to reduce expenses as well. So, we are focused on both.","Steve Theriault","Do you have a base case on when you like to see that return on equity get back to sort of the high-teen level in terms of sort of trying to gauge your level of patients with all that? ","Bob Dorrance","This quarter would be good. No. I mean, we still have an objective of making an ROE more in the 15% range. I think, we\u2019ve referred to in the last number of years, I think the high-teens are little bit of air in the past, given what's going on in the business. So, that\u2019s the focus and we\u2019d would like to try to achieve that as quickly as we can.","Steve Theriault","Okay. Maybe one more for you then. After the volatility from last quarter, I'm curious if there was any actions taken this quarter, sort of in reaction last quarter that may have mitigated any revenue upside for Q2, in what's proving to be a pretty strong capital markets quarter across the whole group here?","Bob Dorrance","I don't think there was anything that we were doing last quarter that was changed, and we're doing this quarter that caused anything in the results. But, what we\u2019ll continue to do though is -- the U.S. markets were strong, especially in the latter two months of this quarter. And our investments there really are what's going to cause the change in the mix and for us more stability in our revenues overall. So, it's that investment that was that certainly helped the quarter and markets helped that. Whereas in the previous quarter, the lack of market activity in both Canada and U.S. combined was the expense run rate, as you spoke of certainly was a negative factor. ","Steve Theriault","Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Doug Young form Desjardins Capital. Please go ahead.","Doug Young","Hi. Good afternoon. Just two quick ones. Riaz, just in U.S. Retail, I think, there was a recovery of a legal provision. I just wanted to see if you can quantify that. And just that so I have this correct, but that was netted out of net noninterest expense. Is that correct?","Greg Braca","It's Greg, Doug. So, the way we would talk about that is we're not going to put a number on that. And the way we think about expenses in general is if that item had not occurred, our expenses would have been up year-over-year. And expenses in general would have been reflecting our continued investment in the business. But, we wouldn't put an absolute number on that release.","Doug Young","Would that mean -- I don\u2019t know if you can just give us some ballpark, like the with mix been up like low-single-digits, is that\u2026","Greg Braca","Well, as we\u2019ve said all along, we still would have had positive operating leverage. And if I were to think about this for the first half of the year, we had expenses of 6%. And for the first half -- you're going to have these numbers from time to time in any given quarter. So for the first half of the year, our expense rate even with this item is running roughly 3%. And certainly, we've had positive offering leverage for the first half of the year.","Doug Young","Okay.","Bharat Masrani","If you, Doug, just look at the trend of noninterest expensive over the last six quarters, I think you can assume that's a good trend.","Doug Young","Okay. That's fair. And then, just lastly, set one capital generation, I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of is -- I think historically, if we went back, I think 15 to 20 basis points per quarter is typically what people have talked about and I think maybe we've talked about in relation to TD. We're going into a different environment, there's been regulatory changes, is that still a reasonable level to expect for TD or is there something that's changed that would cause that to be lower going forward? Thank you.","Riaz Ahmed","I think, Doug, if you look at slide 12, you can see that the net income less dividends contributed 40 basis points. And then of the RWA increases of 27 basis points, just a little bit less than half of that was devoted to the migration of the card portfolio from standardized to AIRB. So, I think you can see in that the capital accretion continues to still be very strong, even in a very fluid environment.","Doug Young","And that I guess that move of that credit portfolio to AIRB, I mean, that in and of itself is done, so that's one-time. Is there anything else that's on the horizon that would be similar in such that if you move to AIRB would have a negative impact?","Riaz Ahmed","Well, in our business mix, cards are one portfolio, which when they migrate to AIRB, the risk weights on them are higher than standardized. Typically, it's the other way around. And of course, you're well aware that our U.S. non-retail portfolio still needs -- is in the process of migration to AIRB, but that should be a benefit.","Operator","The next question is from Gabriel Dechaine from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.","Gabriel Dechaine","I want to talk first about the commercial book in Canada. And it looks like you guys didn't have any credit noise there, no real losses out of the ordinary, like we've seen from a few other banks this quarter and last, mind you. I guess, I'm kind of -- outside of Europe, in quarter performance, we have seen some issues then in the Bank. The Canada is raising their own concerns about corporate indebtedness. And then, we've also got this massive growth in commercial and wholesale loans in Canada. I was just wondering, what do you think about that growth? And what do you think differently than what the Bank of Canada is may be concerned about? And why are you not concerned about credit quality and commercial lending in Canada in general? Sorry, that's a bit of a [indiscernible] question. But\u2026","Ajai Bambawale","It\u2019s Ajai. I'll start with PCL, and then Teri will talk about growth. We're definitely seeing very low PCL and loss rates across the commercial book. And I would describe the quality as good. But that doesn't mean there's no migration. There is some migration occurring. And I would put it in the category of gradual normalization. So, it's not like it's not occurring at all. I can\u2019t speak to the peers and what their book is, like, but certainly in our book, like I feel it\u2019s strong, it\u2019s performing well, but there is some normalization occurring. And it's to actually go to some of the ECL tables. And you look at stage 2 ECLs, you see a bit of an uptick, and especially you look at business in governments, you\u2019ll see some migration there.","Gabriel Dechaine","So, what's driving that?","Ajai Bambawale","I think, we're late in the cycle. So, it's not abnormal to see some migration, so late in the cycle. I can't pinpoint a single thing that's pointing that. And it's not a single sector. But I would say, it's broad, but it's still low dollars.","Teri Currie","And then, it's Teri, from a commercial growth perspective, I'd say we're very comfortable with the business that we're putting on the books. We're continuing to put bankers on the streets, in markets, where they're building great relationships. Business succession continues to be an opportunity for us. And I feel comfortable that I think Riaz was quoted earlier this morning. We're prudent lenders through the cycle. And so, we're very comfortable with the business growth that we're seeing and open for business going forward.","Gabriel Dechaine","Teri, while I have you as the mic, I thought I\u2019d ask something with a bit more of a positive spin, we've seen the housing market go from source of intense concern last year and in the wake of B20 and starts data was dipping lower and lower. And in the last few weeks or months, we started to see some good starts data, some positive sales data coming out of the GTA and Montreal as well. And the industry seems to be I guess bottoming out in terms of mortgage growth, RESL, I would say. I'm just wondering if you are generally as optimistic as you were about this business a little while ago or maybe if there's some additional optimism today in your growth outlook for RESL growth and the ancillary businesses.","Teri Currie","So, I continue to feel very comfortable with we\u2019ve been talking for quite a while now about a mid-single-digit medium-term outlook for proprietary total real estate secured lending growth. And I feel very comfortable with that for this year and going forward. We\u2019ve been investing, as you know in this business, more on mobile mortgage specialists, more training for our branch advisors, a leading capability that is fully digital to apply for a mortgage online. We\u2019ve got a position as we talked about in the past where we're forced in hybrid HELOC loan market share and we're continuing to be able to advance there with customers primarily who are already customers of TD. And retention is very strong as well. So, continue to feel good about that guidance going forward.","Gabriel Dechaine","Outside of what you are doing, is there anything in the macro that\u2019s maybe more...","Teri Currie","Certainly we're seeing -- as you mentioned, certainly, we're seeing particular in the GTA the kind of start of that spring lending season and some good trend. It really is a tail of the two sort of halves of the country, if you will, little bit tougher in the west. Although I would say under $1 million in Vancouver and condos is still a hotly contested market for purchasers. And then, GTA in particular little bit stronger. So, it\u2019s early days in the spring season but we're seeing some green shoots. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Nigel D'Souza from Veritas Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Nigel D'Souza","So, I had one on just the loan volume side, and I wanted to focus on your auto book. So, if I look at the Canadian retail segment, all loans are relatively flat and in the U.S. they\u2019re down slightly quarter-over-quarter. You mentioned prepayment rates, the higher prepayment this quarter. And, I was wondering what we're seeing in Q2 here, is that just a one-off non-recurring trend, or what is the outlook, given that autos tend -- we\u2019re late cycle and autos tend to be kind of a leading -- lead the cycle, what do you see auto finance volumes playing out for rest of the year?","Riaz Ahmed","I think on the matter of the prepayment, Nigel, it\u2019s Riaz, I will just say that the way we look at these from an accounting perspective is we sort of look at the trend over a period of time. So, I don\u2019t think you should interpret this as a one quarter trend. When we look at our revenue recognition policies, and this applies across a wide number of products, whether it would be mortgages, auto or even corporate, like you always look at kind of prepayment trends over longer periods of time to see if you\u2019ve got an appropriate assumption that is going into it. So, I don\u2019t think you should look at it as one quarter. As far as longer terms trends go, I\u2019ll let maybe Greg comment on the U.S. auto piece.","Greg Braca","Sure. So, you are right. And it would have been similar to last quarter. Nigel, if we looked at Q1 over Q1, we were really coming down to relatively flat year-over-year numbers for the last couple of quarters. We have a view too that we are later in the cycle. We also want to an appropriate return. We also want to manage relationships and volume, versus just a couple of years ago, where you would have seen us growing 8%, 9%, 10% year-over-year in auto. We think we have the right mix of the business that we've been positioning this as you -- in the U.S. And, I wouldn't be surprised if over the next few quarters, you saw a bump around that this level maybe up a couple of points. But, this is generally where we see ourselves for the foreseeable future.","Nigel D'Souza","That's really good color. And I just had one last question on -- if I could turn to just credit losses and PCLs in general. There's a step down in provisions for your Canadian Retail segment. And although seasonality has benefited that quarter-over-quarter, there was a larger step down in prior years. So it's still fairly elevated up, as you noted nearly 30% year-over-year. So, I was wondering if you could provide more color there, is there anything at play here, in terms of you expect to turn lower over the coming quarters and have another step down or what are you seeing just on EBITDA performing or impaired side on Canadian Retail?","Ajai Bambawale","So, I'll talk about the year-over-year. It's Ajai. So, kind of moving off very low numbers. And if you look to Q2 \u201818, our number was 23 bps, and the lowest we\u2019ve had is 22 bps. So, we're really moving off those very low numbers into what I would consider a little more normalized numbers. And I think 27 bps still remains in a very acceptable range of 25 bps to 30 bps. But, what I am seeing is -- and I mentioned this earlier, a gradual normalization of credit losses across the various books in Canada. So, my expectation is that normalization will continue to occur at a gradual pace, unless the economy turns, I should clarify, unless the economy turns.","Nigel D'Souza","Got it. That's very helpful. I appreciate the answers.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Darko Mihelic from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Darko Mihelic","Hi. Thank you. I have two questions, one for Bob Dorrance and then an obscure question that anybody can answer, I hope. So, first for Bob. You mentioned that you didn't really change anything in the quarter, and that's cool. But, I guess the question that I have is one of the things that has been changing for you is the way you account for your trading deposits. And we've seen a bit more shift in the fair value to profit or loss. And of course, this quarter, we see trading rebounds to $411 million from $251 million last quarter. So, the question is sort of twofold. First, were there any marks from that that suppressed or helped the trading revenue? But more importantly, from my perspective is as we continue down this path of shifting the accounting regimen, will there be any sort of headwinds or tailwinds to trading revenue for the next couple of quarters?","Bob Dorrance","There was nothing meaningful quarter-to-quarter, Darko in that particular part of the business. I think, as you look at the Q3 last year was where we had called out for the first time that there was a meaningful reduction in revenue that occurred, the function of marketing the trading deposits in the way that we were marketing them. We have probably migrated roughly 50% of the book to fair value through OCI. So, I don't think -- it'll be a positive year-over-year, but it won't be on a full amount.","Darko Mihelic","Okay. So, in other words, just modest headwind -- or tailwind I supposed to trading revenue.","Bob Dorrance","I would say that. Yes.","Darko Mihelic","And then, my obscure question. So, I appreciate the commentary that quarter-over-quarter -- and it looks as though when I look at the presentation, and the way you sort of designed it around credit quality, is that quarter-over-quarter, we saw a bit of an improvement and there's less stage one, stage two, less on performing, I suppose. But when I open up the supplementary capital, it's a different story in Q1, asset quality, healthier RWA and this quarter, asset quality was the other way. And you actually had to increase risk weighted assets, because of asset quality movements. And reason why I asked this is typically what we're concerned about in some pieces, is that as provisions rise, and as things get worse, not only were your provisions for credit losses rise, but so will your RWAs. And yet in two quarters, we had the opposite sort of phenomenon happening at TD. So, I'm wondering, if you can maybe connect the dots for me if at all?","Riaz Ahmed","Are you, Darko, looking at the flow statement for risk weighted assets?","Darko Mihelic","Yes.","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. So, I think, as Ajai indicated earlier that you can see a little bit of migration in the books, and so that you end up having -- you can end up having an instance where both the PCLs and risk-weighted assets are experiencing the similar migration in that way. Because with the way Basel III and IFRS 9 works, you can get a little bit of doubling up of your pro-cyclicality. But as we indicated earlier, that number you can see in the flow statements is not that significant. And so gradual and normalization is how we like to describe it.","Darko Mihelic","So, when I look at it, though, I mean, for a year to date, you have a 3.5% increase in your risk weighted asset. And most of that would be just from portfolio from adding to the loan book. But, a portion of it is also, because of credit quality. And I'm not singling out TD, there's much bigger one of your peers. But again, it's just quarter-to-quarter, I suppose the -- I guess what I'm getting from you is the answer is they can go opposite ways. But over a period of time, when -- I'm just trying to confirm that the general view would be that provisions for credit losses and RWA inflation, for lack of a better word should be -- should go hand-in-hand?","Riaz Ahmed","It could. But, there are sometimes differences in how that are looked at. For example, the calculation of expected shortfall in capital is different from how it's done for IFRS 9 purposes. So, there can be methodology differences. And if you look at that asset quality line over the last five quarters, you can see it was up in Q2 of 2018, but it was down in Q3, down again in Q4, down again in Q1. So, I think, the thesis that there's a general trend indicator here would not be evident in the numbers.","Bharat Masrani","And let me just build on that. I mean, there's definitely some credit migration occurring and that credit migration is going to be reflected in the RWA numbers. But, if you maybe look ACL and if you look at ACL year-over-year, and go and look at it by stage, okay, so, total ACL is up 333 million and these are all in the disclosures, year-over-year big part of that is FX. But excluding that, the increase in stage 3 is actually very little, it\u2019s $50 million. And then most of the increase is actually stage 1, which I would describe as largely volume, but there's some mix in seasoning there. But, there is a number for stage 2 as well. And some of that is commercial migration, which will naturally show up in the RWA numbers and there is mix and seasoning also occurring across some of the portfolios.","Darko Mihelic","Okay. Thanks very much.","Bob Dorrance","Good obscure answer to your obscure question.","Operator","Thank you. The last question is from Scott Chan from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. ","Scott Chan","I wanted to -- lots of question on the Canadian housing but I wanted to switch to U.S. housing and perhaps get your take on kind of what's unfolding there. And when I kind of look at your book share, your residential mortgage is very solid and your HELOC book is trending downwards, maybe some thoughts regarding those portfolios for the balance of the year. ","Greg Braca","Sure, Scott. So, first, I would say, I\u2019m glad you pointed out. The mortgage book has been up for several quarters now, year-over-year, and we were up 8% this quarter. As you might know, if I just contrast this to just a few quarters ago or back before last year and the cycle of rate hikes really intensified, it would have been more of a balance mix between refinance and purchase. And we\u2019re seeing this certainly swing to a purchased market with far less on the refi as rates have been moving up for the last year and a half. So, the volume that we\u2019re seeing is decidedly being driven by jumbo mortgages, and certainly not only into the consumer book but also into the private bank and in the wealth business in the U.S.","You correctly point out that the home equity business is down and we're down 6% year-over-year. But, I would also contrast that to many of our peers and they are seeing double digits for quite some time now. And that\u2019s just evident of when rates starting up, there\u2019s been a large refinance out of home equity into more permanent or fixed-rate mortgages. And even we\u2019re seeing a little bit of an uptick with that, with rates beginning to stabilize over the last three or four months and actually come in, the long end, folks have had another bite of that apple on the refi side for home equity balances. So, relative to peers, while we\u2019re down in home equities and certainly less than half of a sizable book than we are in the mortgage side, it is -- we're still seeing outperformance relative to peers, even though we\u2019re down year-over-year.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Sohrab Movahedi from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sohrab Movahedi","Just two quickies. Teri, do you -- does your business do any lending to the private mortgage markets?","Teri Currie","My businesses does not.","Sohrab Movahedi","And so, Ajai, is there a policy around any lending to mortgage investment corporations or otherwise at the Bank?","Ajai Bambawale","I\u2019m pretty confident there are policies and we limit any of that kind of lending.","Sohrab Movahedi","Could you quantify it?","Ajai Bambawale","No. I don\u2019t have that information available.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay. And then just to go back to Darko's question, if you have negative migration and you are reflecting that negative migration through higher provisions, whether it's stage 1, 2 or 3, will that then relieve some of the pressure that we would have otherwise expected to see from RWA appreciation?","Riaz Ahmed","Well, as I said, Sohrab, it might, to some extent. But, the two systems don't really work hand in hand. The risk weighting system is different from the IFRS 9 accounting system. So, as I said earlier, you can get overlaps. And that just increases the pro-cyclicality of the regime. But, given the quality of the credit book in our underwriting, we wouldn't anticipate that it would give us big swings.","Sohrab Movahedi","But, so just to play that back to Riaz, maybe take another kick at it, if capital ultimately is intended to defend against unexpected losses and you therefore have expected deterioration in the credit quality and reflected through higher RWAs, then presumably -- or through higher provisions, then presumably you don't need to also account for it through higher capital retention. Is that fair?","Riaz Ahmed","I think in principal, that is the correct framework, Sohrab. And if you go back and look at all the comments that were made to the various authorities around the accounting provisions and the introduction of the various Basel rules, those provisions were pointed out. And I think those papers give you a pretty good understanding of what that -- how those two interact.","Sohrab Movahedi","Thank you very much. ","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you, Sohrab.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. I would now like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. Masrani.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, operator. And nothing obscure about our results and I might add. TD delivered a great quarter.

With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you for joining us today. As Rudy mentioned, Colleen will be up shortly to discuss our results in detail, but let me start by sharing my thoughts. This was a strong quarter for TD. All our businesses performed well. The bank generated EPS of $1.20, an increase of 4% versus an already elevated quarter in 2014. These results were driven by solid revenue growth, good credit performance, positive operating leverage and favorable foreign exchange.","Our Canadian retail segment delivered very good adjusted earnings growth of 8%. We continued to take market share across a number of key categories, and posted a strong quarter for new originations in our real estate secured lending business.","Wealth management achieved double digit earnings growth driven by strong fee based revenues and asset growth. These results reflect the benefits of ongoing investments in this business including the addition of new advisors.","Insurance also had a very strong quarter, as favorable claims performance contributed to good earnings growth. Before I leave Canadian retail, I\u2019m thrilled to highlight a significant accomplishment this quarter. We pride ourselves in providing legendary service across Canada and the U.S. For the 10th year in a row, J.D. Power has recognized TD as the leader in customer satisfaction among Canadian Banks.","For as long as this award has existed TD has won it, and I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of our branch, phone, digital and AT&T including various groups that support this businesses. I also want to thank our customers for their tremendous loyalty and for awarding the industry leader in this important category.","Turning back to the quarter, U.S. retail results were up slightly from Q3 of last year and have increased 5% year-to-date. The business has good momentum, loan growth is strong, we are acquiring customers significantly faster than our competitors and we are making progress on deepening relationships. Our focus on growing the U.S. Wealth business is also going well as assets under management have doubled since we acquired Epic in 2013.","Margins have declined this quarter, but we are increasing our net interest income and making good strides on improving our efficiency ratio. Wholesale banking delivered a strong quarter with earnings of $239 million. These results reflect higher trading revenues and investment banking fees and growth in the corporate lending portfolio. We made good progress building out our U.S. franchise adding high quality corporate institutional and government clients and leveraging the deep relationships we have with customers at TD Bank, America\u2019s most convenient bank. This focus has seen strong growth in our U.S. dollar franchise in the last three to four years.","A TD Securities loan book south of the border has been growing at 15% annually since 2013 mainly in high quality investment grade loans. Our government business ranks third globally in terms of raising U.S. dollar funding for its clients and we continue to add franchise building producers across all of our business lines.","On the capital front, our common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.1% remains strong and both our liquidity and leverage ratios are comfortably above our targets. As we look ahead to Q4, we expect that credit losses will remain relatively stable with Q3, and FX will be a positive driver given the stronger U.S. dollar. On the other hand, we expect to see higher expenses and normalization of insurance earnings. Overall, 2015 is shaping up to be good year for TD ahead of our expectations.","Now let me talk a little about the current operating environment and what it means for us. In recent months, we have seen further weakening in economic conditions in emerging markets and downward pressure on commodity prices including oil. The Canadian economy likely contracted in the first half of the year and the Bank of Canada reduced interest rates twice. We are living in uncertain times with increased volatility and financial market turmoil having broader and longer implications.","TD is not immune to these macroeconomic forces, but we\u2019ve had lower risk profile and our resilient business model I\u2019m confident we are well positioned to weather the storm. We get paid to take the right risk and manage those risks and this is exactly what we are doing. Our exposure to oil is relatively small, our underwriting standards remain strong and to date the oil and gas portfolio is performing within expectations and we don\u2019t expect material losses.","We continue to see originations of high quality personnel and commercial loans across our network including Western Canada. We are standing by our customers and clients as they adapt to a new reality. While the U.S. economy also faces uncertainty, the economic outlook is more promising. The U.S. has begun to show signs of recovery and we will benefit from any future rate increases. The housing market, it keeps improving, consumer spending is on the rise in part due to falling energy prices and labor markets are performing well. With this positive outlook, I like the way we are positioned in the U.S. with a young high quality franchise that\u2019s growing and taking share.","I am proud of our performance. TD continues to grow our volumes at a healthier rate and are focus on service and convenience is driving market share increases across our key markets. Our business model has proven to be resilient and we are weathering these conditions well, however, we understand that we can\u2019t rely on revenue growth alone in this environment and we continue to look for ways to make TD the better bank.","Last quarter, we announced the restructuring charge that reflected the first phase of a bank wide focus that will help make us more effective and reduce our rate of expense growth. We are well into the second and final phase and expect to complete most of the work by the end of the year.","As I look forward, our focus on permanently improving our processes will play an important role in enhancing our agility and positioning us for success, but the TD story remains one of growth. I am equally focused on investing in opportunities that will position us for continued out performance in our core businesses. Our leadership team remains resolved to increase efficiency and effectiveness. I am confident that when we are done TD will be an easier place to work and a better bank for our customers to do business with. I\u2019m excited about our prospects and I\u2019m proud of how we are becoming fitter and faster the TD way.","To wrap up, it was a strong quarter for TD. I am pleased with what we have achieved and I have full confidence that we are taking the right steps to preserve our track record of delivering good results and to invest and adapt for our customers, employees and shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Colleen.","Colleen Johnston","Well thanks, Bharat and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. This quarter we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.20, up 4% year-over-year. The quarter reflected strong growth from retail and wholesale versus last year, up 10% and 11%, respectively. The corporate segment posted a loss of CAD161 million. We continued to benefit from the favorable currency impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.","Adjusted total revenue increased 10% year-over-year net of claims or 5.3% excluding FX, led by strong loan deposit and wealth asset growth in addition to higher insurance, fee-based and trading revenue. Growth this quarter was partially offset by margin compression.","Adjusted expense growth was 9% year-over-year or 3.6% excluding FX. Expense growth was driven by increased investment in technology, modernization and new capabilities and regulatory infrastructure partly offset by productivity gains. We were pleased to post strong operating leverage reflecting good revenue growth, positive claims experience and prudent expense management. We remain focused on delivering sustained productivity improvement. Overall, a strong result for the bank this quarter. Please turn to Slide 5.","This slide presents our reported and adjusted earnings this quarter with the difference due to three items of note, which you have seen before. The litigation item reflects the recovery related to certain litigation matters recognized as an item of note in prior quarters. Please turn to Slide 6.","Canadian retail delivered a strong quarter with adjusted net income of CAD1.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year. The increase was driven by continued good loan and deposit growth very strong insurance earnings, and wealth asset growth partly offset by higher expenses.","Loan and deposit growth was good this quarter. Total loan growth was 5% year-over-year with real estate secured lending volume up 4%, business lending growth up 9% and auto lending up 17%. Deposits increased by 6% due to strong growth in core checking and savings accounts which were up 9%. Business deposits grew 7%.","Margin declined 1 basis point sequentially primarily due to the impact of a credit mark release in the acquired credit card portfolio last quarter and the lower rate environment partially offset by seasonal factors. For Q4, we expect margins to remain under pressure due to mix, seasonal factors and competitive pricing. ","PCLs increased 4% year-over-year, personal PCLs decreased CAD11 million due mainly to lower credit card personal lending and auto provisions. Business banking PCLs increased CAD20 million year-over-year.","Adjusted expenses were up 4% year-over-year primarily due to higher employee-related costs including higher revenue-based, variable compensation in the wealth business and business growth, partially offset by productivity savings. Canadian retail produced positive operating leverage when insurance claims are netted from revenue. Overall, a strong result from Canadian retail. Please turn to Slide 7.","U.S. retail, excluding TD Ameritrade, posted adjusted earnings of U.S.450 million, up slightly from Q3 of 2014. Results for the quarter reflected strong volume growth and disciplined expense management, largely offset by margin compression and normalizing credit losses. Revenue increased 1% year-over-year as industry leading volume growth and broad based fee growth were partially offset by lower loan margins. Loan and deposit growth remained very strong in the third quarter.","Total loan growth was a strong 11% year-over-year with a 4% increase in personal loans and a 17% increase in business loans. Average deposits increased by 6%. Margin declined 12 basis points quarter-over-quarter, roughly half of the decline was attributable to our U.S. Partner card programs and hedging related items which were offset in other income. The balance of roughly 6 basis points was due to lower loan margins in commercial and auto loans and the impact of the low rate environment on deposit margins. We expect margins to remain under pressure due to continued competitive pricing and the low rate environment.","PCL increased 36% year-over-year mainly due to higher provisions for commercial loans as a result of an allowance built partially offset by a decrease in personal banking PCL. Expenses declined 1% year-over-year due to ongoing productivity savings partially offset by higher expenses to support growth and higher regulatory costs. Our adjusted efficiency ratio has improved by 110 basis points year-over-year.","Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade in U.S. dollars increased 7% year-over-year due primarily to increased asset growth and transaction revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses. Overall, good fundamentals from the U.S. bank which has driven 5% earnings growth in U.S. dollars on a year-to-date basis.","Please turn to slide eight. Net income for wholesale was CAD239 million, up 11% year-over-year, a very strong result. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year, due mainly to higher fixed income and equity trading, M&A fees and corporate lending partially offset by lower equity underwriting fees compared to a strong Q3 of 2014.","Non-interest expenses were up 10% driven primarily by higher initiative spend, the impact of foreign exchange translation and higher variable compensation. ROE this quarter was 17%.","Please turn to slide nine. The corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of CAD161 million in the quarter compared to a loss of CAD53 million in the same period last year. The higher loss was the result of lower favorable tax items in the current quarter and ongoing investment in enterprise and regulatory projects and initiatives.","Please turn to slide 10. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.1% in the third quarter versus 9.9% in Q2. The increase reflects solid organic capital generation partly offset by increased RWA mainly due to volume growth. Both our leverage and liquidity ratios are consistent with last quarter. Overall, we continue to remain well positioned for the evolving regulatory and capital environment.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you, Colleen. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 11. While we've seen an in the provision for credit loss of CAD47 million or 12% quarter-over-quarter and CAD114 million or 35% year-over-year, the increase is attributed to the normalization of loss rates in the U.S. portfolio through a combination of increases in commercial and retail allowances to support volume growth, seasonal trends in consumer credit volumes and lower recovery levels as workout activity continues to reduce.","The Bank's loss rate was flat at 33 basis points for the quarter with gross impaired loans stable at 57 basis points, up 1 basis point over the previous quarter and 2 basis points year-over-year.","The oil and gas portfolio continues to perform within expectations and we have yet to see a meaningful deterioration in consumer credit quality in the impacted regions. Oil and gas outstanding exposure remains stable representing less than 1% of total loans and acceptances.","While we continue to maintain a cautious approach across retail and non-retail exposures impacted by low oil prices, I do not current believe that low oil prices will result in a material increase in credit losses. In summary, credit quality remains strong across the bank as we head into the fourth quarter.","With that, operator we are ready to begin the question and answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from John Aiken from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","John Aiken","Good afternoon. Bharat in his opening comments talked about TD being a growth bank and I immediately then flipped to the indirect auto growth that you had on both sides of the border. I found that very interesting based on commentary one of your competitors had that they were actually tapping the brake in terms of that loan growth. So Tim, can you let us know what your philosophy is in terms of this portfolio and importantly what you're seeing in terms of some of the longer term lending practices that are going on in the marketplace?","Timothy Hockey","Sure, John, we are actually quite comfortable with this portfolio. We had great growth through the years. The dynamic of course is that the auto sales continue to be strong. Just so we have made some investments in that particular business and we introduced a new system this past spring and so we're seeing some other results of that.","The overall trends, if you worried about at this point of the cycle, we continue to see the call it average credit score in that business essentially flat through the years. We're actually a little bit below industry average when it comes to loan to value on the prime book. We're basically on market in the non-prime book, but we're still very comfortable with this particular business, we think it's an important growth area for us.","Mike Pedersen","John, this is Mike. Maybe I'll comment from a U.S. perspective. This is obviously a category where we continue to see good growth and our new dealer strategy is paying off. We're focused mostly on super prime and prime, little bit of near prime and we've reduced our expense space and both our credit and profitability metrics are improving. And as was the case with Tim's comments on Canada, all of the key risk metrics, the stuff we're writing is better than our portfolio, so it were improving our risk posture in this business as things stand and comfortable with it.","John Aiken","That's great. From a competitive standpoint, though you guys being forced to chase the terms that are being pushed out?","Mike Pedersen","Nor that the case in U.S. in fact, as I alluded to including on term the originating terms are lower than the portfolio terms and they are well within normal risk parameters. We're not chasing the stretchy stuff.","John Aiken","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Meny Grauman from Cormark. Please go ahead.","Meny Grauman","Hi, good afternoon. First question, wanted to follow-up on commentary you made. You talked about \u2013 you haven't seen any meaningful deterioration in consumer credit quality in affected regions, in oil producing regions. And I'm wondering why you think that is? There are some reasons that you think that this is that that's causing this?","Mark Chauvin","It's Mark. I'll answer that. I think we still feel it's probably early and its probably still to come. You can certainly see in those markets that unemployment is going up. We're just not seeing it translated to our delinquencies yet, but I still think in the next quarter or two that we will see it come in to the levels that we kind of expected when we kind of went down this road.","To put it maybe in the context, we feel that at s $35 oil price, it gradually recovers into the $40s and into maybe $50 over four-year period that you might look for an increase on the direct and indirect which will cover the consumer area of about 5% to 10% per year. So, we think that that's probably likely to come. We just haven't seen yet but we're watching closely.","Meny Grauman","Thanks for that. Then I wanted to switch gears and I think this one for Tim. I just want to ask about the Canadian mortgage market and there are definitely headlines over the past few months about fraud. And I'm wondering from your perspective, how big a problem do you think fraud is in Canada and do you think that there's more fraud going on now in the system than say five years ago?","Mark Chauvin","Yes. It's Mark again. I'll take that from a maybe a risk perspective. We follow in our underwriting standard, verification of income and the down payment is very important and central to the process. So, we will do that through several means and we will do it until we satisfied that we have it right. So it could be tax returns, that could be -- if they're a customer of the bank it would through automatic deposits to their accounts, but would be verification from employers that we would even reach out and call to them, call the employer if necessary. But in addition to that we do have fraud analytics that looks to assess the reasonableness of a declared income to make sure it makes sense.","And my comfort that is working effectively is that we do have a Quality Assurance program that follows up behind. And we even do that for mortgages that we buy from other institute like from other second tier areas. When we buy them we do go and look at it and it's effective in detecting those fraud situations and picking them. And so I'm quite comfortable that we're effectively managing it. We have the proper risk navigation in place. I don't think necessary that it's gone up over time though to tell you the truth.","Timothy Hockey","Meny, if I can just add. I think if you look back to your point five years ago the heighten level of scrutiny on this market both by all of us as lenders as well as regulators, as well as tightened the Ministry of Finance basically in terms of tightening. My sense is if anything it would have gone down little bit and there's certainly higher degree of scrutiny on that type of activity.","Meny Grauman","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steve Theriault from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Steve Theriault","Thanks very much. If I could start with a couple maybe quick questions for Mark, Mark. So I'm referring to slides 21, 22 in the deck, and maybe it's obvious, but I'll ask anyway. When I look at TD versus Canadian Peers versus U.S. Peers, you have those three tables there. On gross impaired, TD screens quite favorably, on credit provision quite favorably as well. But I look at the formations and may topical given all the questions around credit these day, I notice TD's formation in terms of basis points is higher than Canadian Peers, which maybe isn't too surprising, but higher than U.S. Peers as well. I'm wondering maybe hopefully my questions has been long winded enough to give you a chance to take a look at those and if you can provides some insight as to why that is maybe helpful?","Mark Chauvin","Yes. I mean, the increase in gross impaired loan formations really focused in the U.S. primarily, relatively constant in Canada period over period. And in U.S. what we're working through is in the HELOC portfolio we have two legacy effectively interest only products. One is an evergreen so individual in the HELOC portfolio can stay on interest only payments for an extended period of time when the product was originally sold. And then what we refer to is a 5510 product when means it's got a five-year interest only period followed by another five-year then amortization over ten. And these are legacy products that over the years with the tightening of the underwriting standards these are products that we don't offer any longer.","So, as we go through the portfolio we're renewing these customers and so it's an interest only or we're looking to qualify them under the current standards. And the standards are higher and they're more rigid appropriately so. And so if a customer does not qualify then we're required to designate them impaired. It is a regulatory requirement that called TDRs and they go into the impaired although they are still making their payments. So if you look at the formations for the quarter 90% of those were customers that were making payment as just as they couldn't qualify under the current standards.","And if you look at the overall impaired for HELOC it's about 60% that are currently making their payment themselves. So we've been experience [ph]. We're about a year or so into this process. We feel that we reserve appropriately for those based upon our experience going forward. As U.S economy continue to strengthen we think that these will get better and probably the risk of loss is not \u2013 we don't really see it as the high expected loss portfolio, but it will have an impact on impaired formations and gross impaired loan for period of time I'd say for the next three or four years.","Steve Theriault","Okay. That makes sense. It's probably just a much bigger part of your mix than it would be for some of those U.S. comps on the table?","Mark Chauvin","Yes. True. I guess I don't study the others as well.","Steve Theriault","And then a quick for Colleen in Q2 when you announced the restructuring charge, you hinted at a Q4 charge but the work was still being done and may still very well be ongoing, but wondering if you can give us a sense for whether in terms of order of magnitude it will be in similar range or not when we roll around to Q4 in December?","Colleen Johnston","Ho, Steve, the work is still ongoing and I don't have a solid number at this point in the process, but I think we're probably looking at an order of magnitude that's somewhat similar to Q2 charge. Although I would expect at the moment it will be smaller than what you saw in Q2, but more to come in the fourth quarter.","Steve Theriault","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert Sedran from CIBC. Please go ahead.","Robert Sedran","Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to come back Colleen to your comments around the U.S. margin, and I make sure I understood them. I guess half that was related to loan and deposit spreads, was any of that mix or is all that just competition?","Colleen Johnston","So, I'll start out and then maybe hand it over Mike to embellish a little bit, so if you look about half the margin decline and we have in the past we've called out the U.S. card partner programs and that can have an effect on the margin and in particular there were some accretion last quarter which didn't recur. And then also we had and I'm sorry to cite accounting movements but I must do so.","We did have shift between NII and other income related to our fair value hedges. So that -- you can see that sequentially that are other income in the in-source currency increased quite a bit. So I'd say, I call about half of the margin decline was related to those two items. And then I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about the relative growth rates in our various portfolios and how that's affected the margin.","Mike Pedersen","Yes. So I think the answer to the question is that it was partly mix. So, the margin did decline a bit more than we expected this quarter, but mostly because we grew faster than we expected and that was especially in larger commercial loans and in super prime auto lending. So, in this environment with origination margins lower than portfolio margins if you're outgrowing the market in lending you are subject to more margin pressure, but it\u2019s still good NII business. And so because we had larger than expected growth in larger commercial loans and in super prime we saw a little bit, so you called that mix, but I would just say that these represent good NII business with good credit quality but lower margins, but you'd want us to do this business and you can see it in our NII, we grew our lending in our revenues increased by CAD60 million quarter-over-quarter.","So our focus is on growing our revenues and profits more than just managing to the NIM target and in the last couple of years we've grown our net interest income faster than our both our big bank and regional bank competitors.","Robert Sedran","And so if I can tie that back to Colleen comments about the pressure to be ongoing, presumably are less than what was shown this quarter?","Mike Pedersen","I think we're hesitant to put precision around this, but on balance I would expect that it's most likely that we'll see some continued downward pressure and that's especially if we continue to see good loan growth or better than market loan growth. I would just add that rate increases would obviously mitigate this.","Robert Sedran","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mario Mendonca from TD Securities. Please go ahead.","Mario Mendonca","Good afternoon. Mark, first could you just explain what you meant by the 5% to 10% increase when you're describing the expected increase in credit losses, do you mean 5% to 10%?","Mark Chauvin","Okay. We run many stress test and looking at the impact of low prices, but if you look at the one that I think that's probably most appropriate that's a $35 gradually increasing as I indicated earlier, and when you look at that the incremental increase due to low oil prices in the direct, so that would be the oil and gas sector, the services sector and the indirect would be largely consumer credit in those regions that are most impacted by low oil prices. We would expect versus current PCL levels an increase in the 5% to 10% per year range.","Mario Mendonca","Annually, so call for the next three years, if that's the way [Indiscernible]","Mark Chauvin","I'm sure, I would go three years, but say per year my thinking is two.","Mario Mendonca","Okay. That's fair. Colleen, the next question I'm going to ask, I've had some varying degrees of success on the calls, but given what Mark's just offered about what seems kind of like a modest increase in PCL. The question I have is in that environment do you think the bank will be capable of growing earnings, even just modestly year-over-year? ","Colleen Johnston","We'll start with Mark, Mark is responsible for all of the stress testing and all of the moving parts and comments specifically on oil and then I'll wrap it up, Mario.","Mario Mendonca","Okay.","Mark Chauvin","So, looking at the view, what is the impact of oil prices to the bank effectively, I mentioned the credit, there's pluses and negative, so the most obvious negative is the credit element which I mentioned, but also in that scenario, we would look forward, reductions in interest rates and we've seen two from the Bank of Canada already that are kind of factored into the analysis itself. And then we'd also look for just revenue reductions due to the lower GDP growth.","But on the other side looking at the positives, the reality is with low energy prices we would expect higher consumer spending in our largest markets being Central Canada and Northeastern U.S. and we would expect those to have stronger growth. And also in that scenario it's really \u2013 you would certainly see a low Canadian dollar which we're seeing today and that would have a positive impact on FX translation on our U.S. earnings.","So the net impact of the positives and negatives of our stress testing is kind of a neutral position. So, we feel we're pretty well position to weather this situation given our relatively lower exposure to oil and gas itself plus kind of where our large markets are and couple with U.S operations to arrive at its kind of a neutral impact over that two-year period. So I'll past it over to Colleen.","Colleen Johnston","Yes. Just to conclude, talking about 2016, its still \u2013 our planning process is still underway, it\u2019s probably a little early to comment on specifics. But I think if you take Mark's comments and then what I would say is that absent any other shocks we don't necessarily see oil prices impacting our growth trajectory and obviously we are working on productivity improvement which should help us in 2016, so, net-net as they say we would still see some growth.","Mario Mendonca","That's what I was looking for. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Gabriel Dechaine from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Gabriel Dechaine","Hi. Good afternoon. Just two prong on the expense question here. The seasonal increase we, I think you guided to it last quarter that we would still see in Q4 this year, I'm just wondering if we're going to see a similar magnitude of quarter-over-quarter spike as we did last year which was on the high side. And then also on the restructuring charge how many understand the benefit for investors, if it\u2019s not a tangible EPS figure that's going to come out of the cost cutting in this program, like will TD be able to deliver sub 3% growth in perpetuity, something along those lines, I think that could be helpful?","Colleen Johnston","Okay, Gabriel let me start with your first question regarding our Q4 expense increase. So I'm going to give you some numbers here and I'm going to express them on an adjusted basis and I'm going to exclude foreign exchange. So over the past couple of years we've had an average quarter-over-quarter growth in the fourth quarter just over 6%. So this year I do still expect an increase, but I'd be surprise if the rate of increase isn't substantially lower, again in percentage terms in the last two years, but I will caution off the top that based on where foreign exchange rates are going, I think the headline number quarter over quarter will look higher because of FX.","So, on a Q3 year to-date basis are expense again excluding foreign exchange and M&A increased by 3.6% and if I'm right about Q4, this means that our full year expense growth rate will definitely come down from the Q3 year to-date level. So, we're definitely on the case I can assure.","Gabriel Dechaine","That's very helpful.","Colleen Johnston","So to move on to your second question, really the message isn't different from what we told you last quarter. So, if you look at our expenses this year and I just mentioned the 3.6% growth and I'm talking on a year to-date basis now, so I'll just give you some moving parts. So higher project and initiative spend drove about 2% growth in our total expenses and there are base expenses are up on a year-over-year basis as well, and that always have to come in to the picture.","So, we are giving increases to our frontline staff, our business volumes are growing. So that also means that expenses will increase, and then what we're doing, we've been doing for several years and we'll continue to do at a greater rate is then we productivity gains to bring our rate of expense growth down. So this year they say 3.6% and part of that growth by the way is variable cost that's linked to revenues. So that sort of gives you the picture of where we are.","So when you think about as we head into next year, we expect that project and initiative spend really increase, but again we're spending at important areas already this year, but you look things like digital and mobile capabilities, although we're keeping our retail distribution cost in total at a very reasonable growth rate.","Technology, modernization and transformation is really important and that's to improve our agility and to reduce costs. Regulatory infrastructure is an area of spend in particularly on aspects of Dodd-Frank. So, and also as you look to next year we do \u2013 the fact that we are increasing our project spend, means, that we will have higher depreciation cost going forward, because some of our project cost are capitalized. We will continue to have base increases going forward and again this for the same that I mentioned just a minute or so ago.","So, then the key is that what do we do in terms of productivity and we got it frankly increase the rate of productivity gains from what I've cited on a year to-date basis and that's where restructuring is going to help us. So the name of the game here is that what we want to do is make sure that we can \u2013 that we can slow down our rate of expense growth. You're not going to see a year-over-year decline that just isn't reasonable in this environment, but what we do what to do is reduce our rate of expenses growth, and people ask me what are you doing, that will fall to the bottom, that will fall to the bottom and assuming we obviously what to make sure that we can grow our revenues at a decent rate given the environment. So that how we're thinking about expenses generally.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. That's helpful, very helpful. Just a really quick on there. Bharat, you mentioned normalization of insurance earnings, there was big spike this quarter in growth. Was the contribution from which may call the claim -- positive claims development. What was that?","Riaz Ahmed","It's Riaz, Gabriel. I don't think normally disclose that in a quarter-over-quarter basis, but I can say that if you look at the claims number on a year-over-year basis its down quite a bit. So half of that order of magnitude is because of as I had mentioned in Q2, 2015 that we're shedding some low value international activity, and so that's brought our claims cost down fair bit without having any meaningful impact on NIAD and then the other half is in Q2 and Q3 we've had terrific weather, so our claims are down, we're seeing the emergence of some favorable development and then we didn't have any material catastrophes to speak off, so I think that's what causing us to have two very strong quarters.","Gabriel Dechaine","Thank you, Riaz.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sumit Malhotra from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just to share with Bharat since we're there on insurance. Two years ago at this time we had some conversations after the events in Calgary about whether the P&C Insurance business was a good first for TD Canadian retail operations just given some of the consistent volatility we had seen. It's been a much better year from a claims experience perspective; we have just talked about some of the improvements you've made in the business. And it's also been a period where there has been M&A activity in P&C Insurance domestically. Now that the business is fixed up or running better, have you given some additional thought as to whether it is a fit with what you want the brand to be in Canadian retail?","Bharat Masrani","Sumit, yes, the business continues to be core for us, yes, we did have some issues and as you rightly pointed out we fixed those issues. We have adjusted our model to make sure that we take into consideration events like what happened Calgary, so that is part of how we run the business. And frankly we see some synergy and having that TD brand in that business and we can leverage that. And it is a good returning business as we saw this quarter. So overall we feel pretty comfortable with where we are and we will continue to find ways to make sure that we are growing this business appropriately and in a manner that provides us with good returns. But overall very happy with it and it continues to core.","Sumit Malhotra","All right. That's straightforward enough. And then one quick one hopefully for Mark, since your were giving us some color on how you're thinking about the stress test process. If I look at on a year-over-year basis we've obviously seen a significant decline in oil prices yet unemployment on a Canada as a whole basis, the unemployment rate is actually lower. So when you run your stress scenario how are you envisioning the trend in domestic unemployment? And I ask specifically due to the fact that the bank is a bigger domestic credit card player than it was when we have the last credit cycle in Canada?","Mark Chauvin","Well, when we did our low oil price scenario, I mean, we did look at it on a regional basis and our scenario played out that there would be increased on unemployment in those impacted regions in the range of from then existing levels of 40% to 50%. And if you look at the increase in credit losses that I mentioned 5% to 10% that is like two-thirds or largely driven in the unsecured sector which would be cards, I would include indirect auto in that as well. So that's really the major driver of the increase in credit losses versus the direct exposure to the actual oil and gas producers. Our experience in the oil and gas producers has played out very similar to how we projected last January in terms of we have seen negative migration in the portfolio, but we\u2019ve seen \u2013 we\u2019ve had no surprises in terms of accounts. The accounts that went down and once we thought would go down. We\u2019ve had four go into impaired status but two of those were paid out relatively quickly and we\u2019ve only got two left in the account at above CAD30 million and actually we\u2019ve seen about CAD400 million or 10% of portfolio payout and it was the higher risk accounts that were refinanced or taken out by acquirers. So yes, the unemployment certainly factored into it and this credit card is a driver but we think it\u2019s well within the range of being \u2013 its within what we would have expect or call it our risk appetite.","Sumit Malhotra","And so I just sort of have it right, I may have missed it earlier. When you say 5% to 10% are you talking on a dollar basis on the domestic provisions, 5% to 10% left?","Bharat Masrani","Correct.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sohrab Movahedi from BMO Capital Markets.","Please go ahead.","Sohrab Movahedi","Just a quickie for Mike. Are you happy with the performance of the U.S. retail segment in source currency?","Mike Pedersen","Sorry, I didn\u2019t catch the last bit of your question.","Sohrab Movahedi","Just in source currency so avoid negating the effects in fact are you happy with the performance of the segment?","Mike Pedersen","I am happy with our performance in the circumstances that were operating and it\u2019s as difficult in terms of the lower rates and the fitful economic expansion and traction as well as the competition. As I look at the major elements of our performance, we are doing very well versus our end market competitors. We are doing well on earnings. We are doing well on revenues; we are doing well on expenses to have 200 basis points positive operating leverage this quarter is a nice thing to have in this kind of environment.","Our expenses are down for the full year, year-to-date by 1% compared to last year. So I\u2019m happy in the sense that we are outperforming our end market competitors in a very difficult environment. I\u2019m obviously hopeful that we get some assist in terms of the economy and rates but in the absence of that I think we have enough levers at our disposal in terms of deepening relationships with customers and improving our distribution strategy and the productivity agenda that we can continue to generate earnings going forward no matter what the \u2013 within reason no matter what the circumstances are and year-to-date our earnings are up 5% I would have taken that at the beginning of the year if you said it was possible.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay, so just \u2013 but just to push on that earlier a bit. I mean it looks like the credit environment has turned way for your portfolio in the U.S. You\u2019ve got some incremental loan losses absent recoveries that\u2019s just going to be there and you were able to offset that with the lower expenses this quarter like year-over-year. If credit continues to you know not deteriorate but at these types of levels trend higher and revenue environment stays such that the best you can do is grow lower margin but higher volume business, how much leverage do you think you have on your expense line to continue to get the bottom line in an around these types of level?","Mike Pedersen","Well I guess I\u2019d say that we understand that in this environment for the reasons that you\u2019ve articulated that we need to be very focused on productivity and expense management agenda and as I alluded to before we are and we have been and we continue to be in terms of its difficult, it\u2019s a little early to look at next year, but I think we will continue to see that expense management will help us moderate that rate of expense growth and our focus is to try to continue to deliver positive operating leverage even as we\u2019re investing for future growth and things like our card business and our wealth business and our technology and digital platforms and so on.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Stefan [Indiscernible] from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes hi guys, good afternoon and also good evening from London. Two questions, the first one on the U.S. assets, you obviously have been quite interested in buying portfolios, small books etcetera. Could you just give us a little bit about the criteria that you have and the minimum hurdle returns, size etcetera and also maybe a little bit about the type of credits asset that is card etcetera and is there anything on the horizon right now that could be of interest to you.","And the second question is now that your assets are higher than RBC or I guess some of your other competitors I really should say, have you had any discussions with obviously or with any other regulators in terms of the potential inclusion on the GCC list. You are a significant bank in the U.S. and you are a significant bank in Canada which are obviously two quite important banking systems on a global scale, does that potentially make you a GCC down the road?","Mike Pedersen","So it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll take the first part and then I\u2019ll let Riaz take a stab at the second. So I would say that our focus on the U.S. business is on organic growth at this time. As I said before we feel we\u2019ve got lot of levers to pull and that\u2019s our primary focus. We do of course look at things as they come up from time to time and in that respect I\u2019d say we are more focused on potential asset plays in the line of the Nordstrom kind of thing or similar things then we are on for example larger branch based acquisitions, but our focus is on organic growth.","Riaz Ahmed","Stefan, its Riaz. I\u2019d say on the question of becoming a GSIB as you know both under the BCBS as well as the U.S. rules the test is a multi factor weighted test of which the balance sheet is only one factor to be considered. So we\u2019ve been in our calculations we\u2019re nowhere near being designated GSIB or either international here in the U.S.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Doug Young from Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Doug Young","Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess the one that I was kind of just hoping you could enlighten me on is the collective IBNR did increase I think in U.S. 48 million and I think that\u2019s different than I think the impact or what caused that was different than what caused the gross impaired loans increased but and I think you refer to it as allowance build. Can you flush that out for me in terms of what that relates to?","Mark Chauvin","Yes it\u2019s Mark. Two factors were driving that, one is as you grow volumes and the U.S. is experiencing good volume growth. You are adding to your reserves and its showing up in the IBNR. And the second area is there is a seasonal mixture to two of the asset categories such as credit cards and indirect auto, which typically in the second quarter or the quarter ending April tend to have an improvement in quality which results in a reduction in your allowances as well as a reduction in volume to payouts. But that naturally comes back in the third quarter and so we\u2019ve seen a \u2013 that swing in the third quarter and cards and indirect auto which was really totally within our forecast but it resulted in the increase in the allowance as well as with the commercial side. But it was driven by effectively volume I guess is the simple answer.","Doug Young","Volume, and so this you would expect it to reverse in the next quarter, is that a sense\u2026","Mark Chauvin","Well I think the volume \u2013 I would expect it to stay constant to increase with volume, but not to the same extent because the seasonal factor won\u2019t play as much a factor in the next quarter and everything else being equal just it would be in pace with volume.","Doug Young","So this has nothing to do with migration, it\u2019s more of a volume.","Mark Chauvin","Yes, not credit qualities. It would be migration. And so we look at it and we decompose it and it was driven by volume not credit quality.","Doug Young","And then just a second, I guess calling on the set one ratio, do you hedge out your FX risk within the set one ratio or no?","Colleen Johnston","I can turn this to Riaz, but the answer is yes we do.","Doug Young","Yes, okay.","Colleen Johnston","So I just answered this.","Riaz Ahmed","I won\u2019t - get angry.","Colleen Johnston","Riaz, [Indiscernible] luckily.","Doug Young","Thanks.","Colleen Johnston","Yes, we do.","Doug Young","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Peter Routledge from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.","Peter Routledge","Thanks, I just want to come back to Meny's question a little earlier about the mortgage approval process. I\u2019m kind of having a hard time reconciling the diligence you talked about and your peers talked about as well with sort of the service aspiration of turning around approval less than 24 hours. So, what would you say to a skeptic who thought well there\u2019s no way they can hit their service goal and due diligence and there has to be corner cutting in their due diligence.","Tim Hockey","Well those are the standards that we actually have negotiated. It\u2019s Tim answering here. What we\u2019ve changed in the last little while as we entered into an outsourcing relationship with First National and they have a very dedicated senior lending team. So what we do is we basically have outsourced our adjudication and our funding of the mortgages. They are writing to our specifications. There is no auto adjudication which to your question might impact your turnaround times but we\u2019ve negotiated as part of our pricing the ability to actually get those approval rates back and quickly and we\u2019ve seen a substantial improvement in the turnaround times to the brokers which is one of the reasons why we are up strongly in real estate secured lending. So we\u2019re quite comfortable and given this is a relatively new relationship the oversight that we put in place with the TD folks on the ground is measuring to a brand newly established standard care.","Mark Chauvin","I would only add Peter is that the verification of income or the down payment can occur after the approval. It\u2019s in the fulfillment process.","Peter Routledge","Okay, so you have \u2013 you can still improve the conditional approval and then\u2026.","Mark Chauvin","The fulfillment is after that and maybe you have to have all that documentation in order to fund and you may identify the problems then and not fund.","Peter Routledge","Okay. And one other question, if despite all this at some point it sounds that a small but productive cohort of third parties have put or submitted mortgages with faulty or misrepresented underwriting data. And if those insured mortgages are sitting on TDs balance sheet, could your mortgage insurers deny the claims on those mortgages even if no TDs employee was directly or indirectly involved in that misrepresentation?","Mark Chauvin","The insurers position, they refer it to as fraud for shelter and that\u2019s where someone may overstate their income in order to get to into a house as long as there has been no employee of the organization involved in that, their position that does not invalidate insurance.","Peter Routledge","Thank you, that\u2019s very clear. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back to Bharat Masrani for closing remarks.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you operator. As you\u2019ve heard with all the answers and again the most importantly the results, very proud of how the teams have delivered yet another strong and growing number from TD. So thank you to everybody for a terrific job well done and look forward to seeing you in the next 90 days. Bye, bye.","Operator","Ladies and Gentlemen this concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a great day."],"23301":["Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) F4Q12 Earnings Conference Call December  6, 2012  3:00 PM ET","Executives","","Rudy Sankovic - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","W.

My name is Rudy Sankovic. I\u2019m the Head of Investor Relations for the bank. We will begin today's presentation with remarks from W. Edmund Clark, the bank's CEO, after which Colleen Johnston, the bank's CFO, will present our fourth quarter operating results. Mark Chauvin, our Chief Risk Officer, will then offer comments on credit quality, after which we will entertain questions from those present in the room and from prequalified analysts and investors on the phone. Mike Pedersen, Group Head, Wealth, Insurance, and Corporate Shared Services will also discuss the acquisition of Epoch Investment Partners that we announced earlier today.  After that we will entertain questions from those present in the room and from prequalified analysts and investors on the phone.","Also present today to answer your questions are Tim Hockey, Group Head, Canadian Banking, Auto Finance and Credit Cards, Bharat Masrani, Group Head, US P&C Banking, and Bob Dorrance, Group Head, Wholesale Banking.","Please turn to slide two. At this time, I would like to caution our listeners that this presentation contains forward-looking statements and there are risks that actual results could differ materially from what is discussed and that certain material factors or assumptions were applied in making these forward looking statements. Any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation represent the views of management and are presented for the purpose of assisting the bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the bank's financial position, objectives, and priorities and anticipated financial performance. Forward looking statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. ","I would also like to remind listeners that the bank utilizes non-GAAP financial measures to arrive at adjusted results to assess each of its businesses and to measure overall bank performance. The bank believes that adjusted results provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the bank\u2019s performance. Additional information on items of note, the bank\u2019s reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward looking information are all available in our 2012 MD&A available on TD.com.  ","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Ed.","W. Edmund Clark","Thanks, Rudy, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. Colleen is going to be up shortly to discuss our fourth quarter results, but let me start by sharing my thoughts on the year as a whole.","Fiscal 2012 was a very strong year for TD with all of our businesses delivering positive earnings growth despite a number of headwinds. Total earnings for the bank were up by 10% and EPS grew 8%, in line with our 7% to 10% medium term objective. We also passed the $7 billion mark in earnings for the first time. ","We achieved these results by staying on strategy and doing what we said we were going to do. Our Canadian and U.S personal and commercial banking businesses recorded strong loan growth and deposit growth throughout the year, though personal loan volumes in Canada have moderated in recent quarters.","We also continued to focus on growth opportunities we\u2019ve identified in auto lending and credit cards. In particular we announced our agreement to acquire Target\u2019s US credit card portfolio which we expect to close in the first half of next year upon receipt of regulatory approvals. This acquisition will help us meet two key objectives. It supports our strategy of optimizing our North American balance sheet and in fact will accelerate our progress on closing our loan deposit gap in the United States by a full year. It also significantly expands our North American credit card capabilities, building on last year\u2019s MBNA acquisition.","Our wealth business performed well in 2012, despite difficult markets. We maintained our leadership position in direct vesting. We grew our advice base business and gathered new assets at an impressive pace. Insurance had a disappointing finish to the year, given the additional reserves we took in relation to unfavorable developments in prior year Ontario Auto claims. However, the business\u2019s core fundamentals remain quite strong.","Wholesale finished the year on a very strong note with all of our businesses reporting well in choppy markets. We maintained our top three data stats in Canada which included achievements in a number of areas. To highlight just a few, we were number one in equity block trading, number one in syndications, number two in corporate debt under-running and number three in announced M&A. ","We also continued to grow our franchise fixed income and foreign exchange businesses. In addition to these good results in our business segments, we made our object for limiting our core expense growth across the bank to 3% this year by getting more efficient at what we do and reinvesting the savings in additional productivity enhancing measures. We also raised our dividend twice, delivering an 11% increase to our shareholders and increasing our target payout ratio while continuing to build our Basel III capital position.","Let me now look ahead to 2013. We said that last year that we would have to work hard to reach the bottom end of the 7% to 10% range for adjusted EPS growth and we did. We also said though that we thought it was even tougher next year and that is still my view. The headwinds we\u2019re facing have not abated. In the last few months consumer loan growth in Canada has slowed and the housing market has cooled. We are already seeing the impact on our Canadian retail bank. Persistent worry about weakness in the global economy and continued concern about the fiscal situation in Europe and the United States are keeping interest rates low, putting more pressure on margins and the regulatory bar keeps getting raised.","On the other hand, it\u2019s important to keep a balanced view of the outlook, even in our base case in the countries that matter to us, Canada and the United States, GDP growth is in the 2%, 2.5% range. There\u2019s significant upside in the United States both in the short and the medium term. The right fiscal deal with an appropriate balance of adjustment between short term withdrawal stimulus and longer term actions to address structural issues could reduce the fiscal drag implied in current forecast and more importantly, it could unlock the burden of uncertainty weighing on business decisions. Better growth in the United States would obviously benefit Canada. ","Let me tell you what I think this means for our business. In Canada we\u2019ll continue to focus on building our domestic banking business, credit card and auto finance businesses, but even with strong growth in these areas, I would expect to see some earnings rotation away from Canadian personal and commercial banking as a whole next year. ","Our wealth business should be a source of above average growth. With the strong asset growth we\u2019ve recorded, we are well positioned to benefit from an improvement in market conditions and to today\u2019s announcement of our agreement with Epoch Investment Partners, we have taken an important step forward with our growth strategy for wealth. Mike will provide more color on the transaction shortly, but let me take a moment to say how excited we are about bringing Epoch into the TD board. ","We have previously indicated that we\u2019d be interested in adding asset management capability in the United States and global equities and that\u2019s precisely what this acquisition does. Epoch is a successful investment manager and we are confident that we are getting good value for money. Epoch has a strong growth track record and a culture very similar to ours. This deal will strengthen TD\u2019s wealth management business in Canada and be a pillar of our developing US wealth strategy.","On the insurance side, excluding the impact of additional reserves, our insurance business earned roughly $600 million this year. But with reinsurance costs rising and the possibility of higher claims costs, we are currently looking at earnings growth in the 7% to 10% range next year, relevant to the $600 million run rate. ","TD Bank, America\u2019s most convenient bank will be an important part of our story next year. We remain committed to our $1.6 billion earnings target for fiscal 2013 and we are confident that we can get there by leveraging our service and convenience model to keep growing market share.","In wholesale, we\u2019ll continue to focus on delivering 15% to 20% returns despite higher capital requirements. We\u2019re further investing in building our franchise model. In addition to these ambitious plans for each of our business segments, we will maintain an unrelenting focus on lowering our costs while improving our operations. That\u2019s a must in today\u2019s economic environment. We are targeting core expense growth at or below our 2012 level which will allow us to pursue positive operating leverage while continuing to invest strategically in our businesses. That means managing our expenses aggressively, but we are going to do this in the TD way, by rethinking and reengineering our businesses in ways that both enhance the customer and employee experience and strengthen our resilience as an organization. ","Before I hand things over to Colleen, let me comment on the fact that there's been a lot of media speculation lately about acquisitions in the banking sector. Now normally, I would not respond to media speculation, but this is a good opportunity for me to provide an update on TD's appetite for large acquisitions in the United States because while there's been a lot of media speculation, we're not actually aware of anything big for sale in the United States.","When we look at our U.S. Personal and Commercial bank, we feel very comfortable with where we are today. With the scale we have in our footprint and our proven organic growth strategy, we are not compelled to make acquisitions and we have made that point quite consistently. In 2012, we were also very clear that we did not want to do a large transaction. Our focus was tuck-in deals and asset portfolios, and we are still interested in those.","As we look ahead to 2013, we are seeing signs of improvement in the U.S. economy that make larger deals more feasible. However, given the position strength that we are operating from today, any prospective transaction would have to satisfy certain criteria, the most important of which is that the deal meet our financial hurdles and is supported by the market, particularly if significant equity financing is required. It would be a mistake to believe that we have a bias in favor of doing a large deal. We do not. Indeed large deals contemplate a whole set of issues and the thresholds to do one are obviously higher.","The good news is that we have choices. Organic growth by itself, organic growth process series of smaller deals or the option of opportunistically taking advantage of a larger deal that might arise that fits our core strategy. Our primary focus remains organic growth. We remain cautious on acquisitions and we'll only do a deal large or small if it fit our timing and our price. We don\u2019t intend to comment further on this subject. ","To close, 2012 was a very good year for TD, reflecting consistent performance in our Canadian and U.S. retail businesses and a good result from our wholesale bank. Next year brings continued challenges, but I am confident that we have all the tools and resources we need to overcome them and continue delivering sustainable earnings growth given our proven business models, experienced management team and tremendous people.","Let me finish with a word to them. I am very proud of the 85,000 people who make TD a better bank, and whose dedication in meeting the needs of our customers and clients, was recognized by J.D Power and Ipsos again this year. You are the driving force behind our success. On behalf of the Board and the senior executive team, thank you for all your tremendous effort. I would also like to make special mention of our employees in the United States who worked tirelessly in recent weeks to support our customers and each other through the recovery of super storm Sandy. You have inspired all of us with your heroic actions.","With that let me turn the call over to Colleen.","Colleen Johnston","Thanks Ed, and good afternoon everyone. Let me take you through our results. Please turn to Slide 4 and I'll start with a brief review of the full year. 2012 total bank adjusted net income was $7.1 billion, an increase of 10% from last year and adjusted EPS was $7.42, up 8% year-over-year. Both results are new records for TD. Earnings growth was solidly within the Bank's 7% to 10% medium EPS growth objective, a good accomplishment given the many headwinds we faced this year.","In total, our retail businesses delivered adjusted earnings of $6.2 billion, up 10% from 2011 and represented 88% of total Bank earnings. TD Canada Trust had a good year, delivering $3.4 billion in adjusted earnings, up 12% over 2011, driven by good volume growth, the acquisition of MBNA and higher fee income.","Wealth and Insurance delivered good results, with earnings of $1.4 billion, up 4%. Higher fee based revenue in wealth and solid premium growth in insurance were partially offset by higher claims in insurance. ","U.S. P&C delivered a record year with over $1.4 billion in adjusted earnings U.S. dollars, up 10% as a result of strong loan and deposit volume growth and higher fee-based revenue, partially offset by higher expenses to support growth and the impacts of the Durbin amendment. This 10% earnings growth was achieved despite the fact that the Durbin amendment took 10% off the bottom line.","Wholesale Banking had a good year with earnings up 8%, as stronger results in core businesses were partially offset by lower security gains. Adjusted operating leverage for 2012 was 2% and we finished the year with a strong Basel III pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio of 8.2%. Overall, this was a strong year for TD.","Please turn to Slide 5. Looking to the quarter, our results were solid with adjusted EPS of $1.83, up 5% year-over-year and total Bank adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, up 6% from last year. Retail adjusted earnings of $1.5 billion were up 8% from last year \u2013 sorry, 6% and Wholesale net income of $309 million was up 10%. The Corporate segment loss was $29 million. Overall, a solid quarter and a strong finish to 2012.","Please turn to Slide 6. This next slide presents our reported and adjusted earnings this quarter with the difference due to five items of note. This quarter includes a reserve related to super storm Sandy, which had a $37 million negative impact on earnings. The charge mainly reflects increased PCL on loans in the severely affected areas, plus a charge related to damages to our premises.","Please turn to Slide 7. Canadian P&C had a solid quarter, with adjusted net income of $831 million, up 10% from last year.","Adjusted operating leverage was 2% this quarter with revenues up 12% compared to last year and expenses up 10%. The acquisition of MBNA added 10% to adjusted revenues, 8% to expenses, 23 basis points to NIM, and $91 million to PCL. Loan and deposit growth were good this quarter with the retail business generating good, but slowing lending volume growth. Real estate secured lending volumes were up 6% versus last year, auto lending was up 3%, and all other retail volumes, excluding MBNA, were down 2%. Retail deposits showed strong growth, up 10%. Business lending growth remains very strong, up 15%, and business deposit growth was up 10%.","Expense growth was elevated in the fourth quarter due to the timing of business investments, marketing initiatives, and employee-related costs. Credit performance remains strong with PCL and personal banking, excluding MBNA, up 1%, primarily due to adjustments related certain past due accounts. Excluding this item, personal credit quality was strong. Excluding the impact of MBNA, margin was down 11 basis points compared to last year due to the low rate environment, competitive pricing, and portfolio mix. Margin was down three basis points sequentially.","As noted previously, we expect margins to decline by a couple of basis points per quarter in 2013. In Q1 2013 margins may be down by approximately 7 basis points as the credit mark release from the MBNA portfolio, which was embedded in NII, will not recur in 2013.","Let me briefly comment on MBNA, which was a strong contributor to earnings growth this year. The deal significantly strengthened our market share, moving us from number five to number two and earnings were ahead of our original expectations, helped primarily by much better than expected credit quality. Integration costs have been higher than expected with $150 million to $200 million of additional expenses expected in 2013. These costs will be shown as an item of note. Integration is scheduled to be fully complete by mid-2014.","Please turn to Slide 8. The Wealth business had a good quarter, while the Insurance business posted a disappointing performance. Wealth earnings were up 6% year-over-year. Higher fee-based revenue from asset growth and higher net interest income from improved net interest margins were partially offset by lower transaction revenues due to decreased trading volumes. Asset growth was strong, mainly due to net new client assets.","Insurance earnings were downs 37% year-over-year. Revenue declined due to unfavorable prior year claims development in the Ontario auto market and weather-related events, partially offset by premium growth and the inclusion of MBNA. The core fundamentals of the business remain strong. Expenses across the segment were up 1%. The contribution from TD Ameritrade was lower this quarter, down 6% on lower TD Ameritrade earnings, partially offset by increased economic ownership and a weaker Canadian dollar.","Please turn to Slide 9. U.S. P&C delivered strong adjusted net income of U.S. $358 million for the quarter, up 23% from last year. The increase was primarily due to strong organic growth, lower effective tax rate and gain on sales of securities, partially offset by the impact of the Durbin amendment. Average loans were up 16% year-over-year, including a 37% increase in residential mortgages and a 10% increase in business loans, and average deposits excluding government deposits and TD Ameritrade IDAs were up 7%.","NIM was 348 basis points, down 12 basis points versus last year, primarily due to the low rate environment and strong growth in lower margin products, especially mortgages. We continue to remain comfortable with our previous NIM guidance of 350 to 375 basis points. Accounting noise will continue to create some bumpiness and occasionally cause us to fall outside of our range.","We will continue to see deposit compression due to the low interest rate environment, but our expectation is that loan growth will exceed deposit growth thereby helping our NIMs. The target acquisition which we expect to close in the first half of calendar 2013, upon receipt of regulatory approvals will increase our NIMs. Total adjusted PCL was up 55% from last year, primarily due to new regulatory guidance on loans discharged and bankruptcies and timing in the acquired credit impaired portfolio. The underlying credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to improve. Adjusted expenses were down 4% from elevated levels last year. During 2012, we opened 41 new stores, bringing us to 1,315 stores in the U.S.","Looking to next quarter, we are seeing some early softness in volumes and fee income associated with lower transaction levels in the aftermath of super storm Sandy.","Please turn to Slide 10. Wholesale delivered a strong quarter in difficult markets, with net income of $309 million, up 10% from a good quarter last year. The increase was due to higher trading related revenue and improved underwriting and advisory fees and reduced expenses in core businesses, partially offset by lower security gains in the investment portfolio. Total trading related revenue in the quarter was strong at $316 million, which was in line with our normalized expectation of $300 million per quarter. Non-interest expenses were down 5% compared to last year, due to lower infrastructure costs and legal provisions. Annualized ROE for the quarter was strong at 30.3%. We continue to target medium term ROEs in the 15% to 20% range despite higher capital requirements.","Please turn to Slide 11. On an adjusted basis, the corporate segment posted a loss of $29 million in the quarter. Results were down from last year, due to higher net corporate expenses largely offset by the favorable impact of other items including tax. The loss in Corporate was below our guidance due to positive treasury and hedging-related results. I won't be providing a range for corporate segment going into 2013. As you've observed the corporate segment is inherently difficult to predict and the number can be somewhat volatile. Having said this, going forward, I expect the quarterly loss on average will exceed the average of 2012, but will likely come in below my prior guidance.","Please turn to Slide 12. We continue to focus on slowing the rate of expense growth to position us for the revenue headwinds of the slow growth economy and the sustained low interest rate environment. Our focus is on initiatives that will permanently improve efficiency, making productivity a competitive advantage for TD. At the all-bank level, Q4 adjusted expenses were up 8% versus Q3. This is consistent with the pattern of higher Q4 expenses seen in past years, which has been followed by a drop off in expenses in the first quarter of the next year. As mentioned in Q3, elevated expense levels in the fourth quarter were primarily due to business volume and seasonality, higher project and initiative spend and marketing campaigns. ","Excluding expenses added by recent acquisitions and foreign exchange adjusted expenses grew by 3% in 2012 in line with our target growth rate. Next year we're targeting a rate of expense growth at or below the rate of growth in 2012. In order to achieve this goal, all parts of TD are participating in our productivity agenda and we're integrating expense best practices into their business.","Key levers for 2013 will be lowering our cost from external vendors through sourcing and procurement, optimizing branch and store resources relative to volumes across our network; and process improvements that will make it easier to deliver a leading customer and employee experience.","Within the tighter expense framework, we continue to invest in a branch network, adding 65 new branches and stores this year, 24 in Canada and 41 in the United States and we plan for higher project and initiative spend in 2013.","Please turn to Slide 13. Looking at capital our fourth quarter Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.6% and our pro forma Basel III ratio was 8.2%. We are well-positioned for the evolving regulatory environment.","With that I'll turn the presentation over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you Colleen and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide 14.","As a reminder the debt securities classified as loans and the acquired credit impaired loan portfolios have been excluded from the credit slides. Setting aside one-time items which I will discuss in a minute, our Canadian credit quality remained strong while the U.S. portfolio continues to improve. There were three one-time items that have led to some noise this quarter. First, our Canadian personal results reflect an adjustment related to HELOC accounts. The impact of the adjustment is a $162 million increase in gross impaired loans and $22 million increase to PCL. With an average current loan to value of 53%, we expect ultimate losses on the newly impaired HELOC accounts to be minimal.","Secondly, in line with recent guidance from U.S. regulators, a small portion of our performing U.S. personal loans have been reclassified to non-performing status. The change was made to reflect cases where a loan has been discharged through bankruptcy proceedings, but where our borrower continues to make payments.","The regulatory guidance requires that we classify the loan as impaired and write it down to the value of its collateral, which is also consistent with accounting standards. The impact of the change was a $49 million increase to gross impaired loans and a $30 million increase to PCL. As these largely consist of longstanding loans that have always made their payments, we expect to recover a substantial portion of this account as the loans continue to pay down.","Thirdly, in response to the devastation caused by super storm Sandy, we have taken a one-time provision of $54 million. This amount is not reflected in our credit slides, but is listed as an item of note in the supplemental information package. Early indications are that our customers are well insured and we think it's unlikely that this number will be exceeded. In conclusion, we do not consider these events to be an early indicator of future challenges in our credit portfolios.","Now I'd like to turn the presentation over to Mike.","Mike Pedersen","Thanks, Mark. We're on Slide 15. So let me begin by reiterating that TD's wealth strategy is focused on organic growth, primarily by targeting existing TD customers in both our Canadian and U.S. Retail and Commercial Banking businesses, but as Ed said, we have said since last year that we would be interested in acquiring an asset management firm with strong U.S. and global equities capabilities and Epoch provides us with deep global and U.S. equities expertise, which we think will be very important to our clients going forward.","It's also highly complementary to TD's existing strengths in fixed income and Canadian securities. Epoch has grown their AUMs every year since their inception, including right through the financial crisis. They have an extremely experienced management team, a highly disciplined investment process and a proven track record of delivering strong risk-adjusted returns for their clients. So the strategic rationale for this culmination is simple. For TD, we immediately and significantly strengthen our U.S. Wealth business and we also broaden our offer for both retail and institutional clients in Canada. For Epoch, it strengthens an already strong business model, but maybe most importantly, we believe our cultures are strongly aligned.","From a financial perspective, the deal will enable both businesses to grow faster. We expect the transaction to have minimal earnings impact in 2013 and to be accretive in 2014. We plan to fund the purchase with cash and we expect that they have minimal negative impact on our Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as well. So to sum up, we're extremely pleased with today's announcement. We believe it's great news for Epoch clients, for TD's clients and for our shareholders. Rudy?","Rudy Sankovic","Great. Thank you very much, Mike. We will now open it up for questions. To give everyone a chance to participate, please keep one question and then re-queue if we have time. For those participating in person, can I ask you to identify your name and firm before asking your question? And before ending the call today I will ask Ed to offer some final remarks. So why don\u2019t we get started with questions from the room please? Go on.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Rudy Sankovic","John Reucassel, BMO Capital Markets","John Reucassel \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Sure. I\u2019ll start it off. Yes, sorry. John Reucassel, BMO Capital Markets. Excuse me. I know you don\u2019t want to answer questions on large acquisition, so I\u2019m going to try and ask one anyway. When you say it has to meet strategic priorities, is that in end market presumably and how does that roll in, how do you view investment in TD Ameritrade as part of helping to fund a large transaction? And then maybe tie in, how you feel \u2013 you talk about the U.S. getting better, but the regulatory environment seems to be uneven, Trulo [ph] those comments last week about solo capital, those type of things. Could you put that in context please?","W. Edmund Clark","So you listen to me about as much as my kids I think. So I guess just to repeat this, I\u2019ll start with and then I\u2019ll try to pick up your points. I think the point that we\u2019re making \u2013 always that we\u2019ve made all along is we do not need to acquire banks in order to grow in the United States because we have such a powerful organic growth model and we\u2019ve been growing branches, more than 40 new stores this year and we\u2019ve had 88% deposit growth this year, 16% loan growth. You don\u2019t take a machine like that and say, \u2018boy you need to do something to get it kick-started.\u2019 We\u2019ve got a fantastic machine. So we don't need to do bank acquisitions. Second point is, we are not aware of any large bank that's for sale today. So, we are talking about a hypothetical situation, but if there has been so much media comment about it, that you have to sit there and say okay. ","I guess the question maybe we're hoisted on our own petard, we said clearly to the market what our focus was for 2012. I guess the question is perpetually that. So, for the next 10 years, we say, we'll never do a large deal and I think we say, we're going to get ourselves of that petard and say, clearly, if a large deal came up, it would be irresponsible to say no matter what price, no matter what our situation, we would absolutely never look at it. But what we are clearly saying is, large deals have a much higher threshold than any other deal because they involve a degree of complexity and you have to be practical. A large deal requires some financing, depending on the size of the deal and if the market doesn't like that, then you can't go do the deal. So there is a practical limit that's put on by the market. ","But I think, we're trying to tell people, chill out a little here, there is nothing for sale and we are not chasing large deals and then we'll see when the world comes whether we look at it. I think we would look at TD Ameritrade in a completely different \u2013 we don't put the two together and say, we've always liked the TD Ameritrade space. I think it's obviously been a tough space over the last few years. The remarkable thing is how well TD Ameritrade is. It's growing its assets about twice as fast as its competitors. And so it's been able to hold its earnings together because it's been able to grow its volumes and offset any margins. And so, we think when we look at that, this is a pretty attractive option and we don\u2019t know why I wouldn't put the two together. As to Trulo [ph], we wouldn't anticipate, we were running the U.S. \u2013 our U.S. entities, whether they're TD Securities or TD Ameritrade or TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank, we capitalize them as you know on a fully implemented Basel III standard and at this stage certainly we have no indication that when they put these holding companies together the rules for those will be significantly different than what a Basel III would lead you to do and we're already capitalized to that.","Rudy Sankovic","Next question please. Thank you, John. Mike?","Michael Goldberg \u2013 Desjardins Securities","Michael Goldberg, Desjardins Securities. Just want to follow-up on that question. I'm going to misbehave also and then I have my own question. You said Ed, that you have several criteria for anything big, including support from financial markets. How would you know in advance that you would have that support from financial markets if we didn't know what it was that you were planning to do or is there some other thing that you're getting at that would give you that indication that you'd have that support?","W. Edmund Clark","It's pretty sneaky to ride in on a question that I wasn't going to answer and then say, I'd like to ask one too, but I think the simple answer, no. There's nothing sneaky or complicated in this. I think, I believe that we have the best leader of a security dealer, certainly in Canada and one of the best in the world and I think Bob can tell me exactly what kind of deal and price the market would support or not that you don't have to go out and test the market to find that answer. I think the answer is fairly \u2013 will be fairly evident to us.","Michael Goldberg \u2013 Desjardins Securities","Let me get to my original question, and it's about insurance and the weakness that you had this quarter. How much did higher claims, adverse development and these factors are in dollar terms actually impact the pre-tax contribution from insurance this quarter, and of that, how much of that was from claims; of that, how much of that was from adverse development; and what gives you confidence that there won't be further adverse development?","Mike Pedersen","So, the way we think about the year is that insurance is a business with a fair bit of cyclicality. So, normalized earnings, as you heard, might have been around $600 million, so $150 million a quarter. This obviously hit us in the fourth quarter. You can see from the numbers that the full year impact of the adverse development compared to 2011 was about $131 million, and in terms of the quarter it was probably roughly two-thirds adverse development and one-third the weather-related events. There were four big storms in August. That\u2019s more than we would normally expect. That included three big storms in August, sorry, and super storm Sandy in the last bit of the year.","Michael Goldberg \u2013 Desjardins Securities","You're confusing me in talking about two-thirds from this and one-third from that. Can you just give it to me in dollar terms?","Mike Pedersen","Well, we don't disclose the amount of the CATS and the severe weather events, so I'd rather not do that, but if you think about the fourth quarter and think about it in normalized earnings terms of say 150, think about the difference, two-thirds, the impact of adverse development, one-third the impact the severe weather events.","Rudy Sankovic","Anyone else in the room? So why don't we turn to the phones. Operator, could you start us off please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Theriault from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Steve Theriault \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much. Question for Mike Pedersen or maybe for Ed on Epoch. Can you talk a little bit about how autonomous you expect Epoch to remain from TDAM? Also how long do you have to keep parties at Epoch locked up for, so to speak? And can you tell me what the mix of AUM is at Epoch U.S. versus non-U.S.","Mark Chauvin","On the question of autonomy, this is an extremely well-run business. It has been successful in growing, as I said, every year including through the crisis, extremely experienced management team. In these types of acquisitions what you're buying is the management team. So we expect them to continue to run the business as they have with the obvious caveat that they will do so within the framework of TD\u2019s governance and risk paradigms. They will work very closely with TD Asset Management there are some synergies that we will be able to realize. For example, we have some third-party advisory mandates that we are going to be able to bring in-house. There are certain things that are being done inside TD Asset Management in Canada now that we will likely ultimately have Empire doing. So I think the answer is that we are going to try to interfere as little as possible with the obviously successful formula that Epoch has.","W. Edmund Clark","Just to underscore what Mike said, I think when you buy an asset like this you want to leave it alone. I think the one thing we will do is actually helping to grow more because there is business that we can send its way. But the key is that Epoch will stand as an entity and grow itself and I think it will just grow faster with the business that we can roll to it naturally.","Rudy Sankovic","Okay, thanks Steven. Why don\u2019t we \u2013 next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Sedran from CIBC. Please go ahead.","Robert Sedran \u2013 CIBC","Hi there. Good afternoon. A question on the margin I guess in the U.S. I gather Target is going to materially change the guided range there, but without that you are at the low-end or even slightly below the low-end of your 350 to 375 range. So, given the structural challenges that they are on the margin, how can you be comfortable that this range is or this quarter is about as low as it get. Is there anything unusual in the quarter that may reverse going into next year?","Bharat Masrani","Robert, as we have thought previously this number will be volatile. Once in a while we will breach the range that I had put out, but just to understand the dynamic of the business, on the deposit side for sure there is compression, zero rates in the U.S., but the offsetting side for us is that, as Ed talked about it earlier and Colleen mentioned as well, we\u2019ve got a very good organic growth numbers for our loan business. We grew our loan 16% and that helps us on the margin side obviously, but I guess Robert you are asking to look forward. I think the key point here \u2013 and I know this is what probably people are thinking is what does this do, given the volatility in this number regarding the $1.6 billion target that we have set out there. I can tell you I\u2019m continued to be committed to that target. I am comfortable with that target. When you look at Target acquisition, the portfolio will help us as well as our de novo strategies. You've seen the numbers we've delivered. We opened 41 stores. We plan to open 35 more next year. Colleen talked about the productivity agenda that applies to the U.S. as well. So overall, when I look at it, yes, there will be volatility in this number, but am I comfortable, am I committed to the target we've set out? Absolutely. So I think that's probably a wider perspective as to how you should look at this?","Rudy Sankovic","Mike?","Mike Pedersen","Rudy, if I can just jump in. I failed to answer the second part of the previous question around retention of the team at Epoch. There are very strong retention mechanisms in place. We have five-year contracts in place for the most senior people in the organization and retention mechanisms for every single employee in the Company.","Rudy Sankovic","Thank you. Thanks Robert. Why don't we get to the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Brad Smith from Stonecap Securities. Please go ahead.","Brad Smith \u2013 Stonecap Securities","Thank you. I just had a quick question, I think in the MD&A around the U.S. Banking unit, there was some mention of securities gains in the quarter and of course when I look at the noninterest income, there's quite a significant increase in securities gains. Can you quantify that in the U.S. P&C Bank?","Bharat Masrani","I don't think we have come out exactly what those numbers are on a regular basis. I don't think it would be appropriate for me to get and try and reconcile every dollar there, but I think the bigger perspective for you to understand, Brad on this is that, we do manage our balance sheet. You are well aware as to how we do that. Given the rate environment, our duration strategy requires us sometimes to trigger security gains, because that's how we manage our balance sheet, including how we tractor within our U.S. business. In addition, as you're probably aware, under Basel III there will be capital volatility because of the unrealized gains as to how they are treated under Basel III. So it also makes sense for us to make sure that these capital benefits we have do indeed become firm under Basel III. So there is an overall strategy here that we're following, and I think that's the best way to give you that perspective and we will continue to do so until this rate environment forces us there because that is part of our overall strategy to manage our U.S. balance sheet.","Brad Smith \u2013 Stonecap Securities","Thanks Bharat. Just in the September 30 filing for the operating company, there was a $42 million securities gain. Would the amount in the segment be larger than that?","Bharat Masrani","I can't comment on that. Maybe Colleen can help there.","Colleen Johnston","Yeah. That's about the right number for the quarter, Brad.","Brad Smith \u2013 Stonecap Securities","Thank you very much.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks, Brad. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Routledge from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.","Peter Routledge \u2013 National Bank Financial","A question for Ed. It's not about acquisitions, you\u2019d be glad to know. But it's sort of the flipside of it. There was certainly some concern about acquisitions. It's reflected I think in that share price the last month or two. Why not go the other way? Why not announce 2% normal course issuer bid like some of your peers have done? Failing that, why not just stop the 1% discount? Outside a large transaction at some point in the future, why not actively try to keep share count level?","W. Edmund Clark","Yes, I think the simple answer, what I have said and I may well be that we are approaching the point where we'll have to solidify our capital strategy. I think we haven't yet heard what the DCIB charge is going to be, what the timeframe for implementing that is. So what we\u2019ve basically said and as mentioned earlier, we haven't heard what the U.S. holding company rules are going to be otherwise I say we don't anticipate that it would have an impact on us. So I think at this point we've been in that capital accumulation mode and said we would address the issue after that once we did. I think the other thing is that, so far, we have been blessed where we can redeploy excess capital at well above our cost of equity. Many banks are not in that position and so buying back their shares is the only alternative that they have, but if you look at the MBNA deal, you look at the Target deal, if you look at those deals, those are spectacular deals for the shareholders. So you always have to sit there and say, if you happen to be strategically positioned where you can create economic profit for your shareholders, you'll always pause and say, well do I want to give it away and destroy value by buying at a lower return to the shareholders and taking advantage of these small opportunities that seem to be coming our way.","Peter Routledge \u2013 National Bank Financial","Okay. Thanks.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks Peter. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gabriel Dechaine, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Gabriel Dechaine \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just a question on the Canadian margin. You\u2019ve got the margin excluding MBNA down 3 basis points. Does that 3 basis points include any positive credit mark that was on the MBNA transaction? I mean I think it was about 4 or 5 basis points impact from that this quarter?","Mark Chauvin","Yeah. This quarter it's about net neutral. The breakdown of the 3 basis points was call it, a little over third being the deposit margins, about a third of that being a reduction in the amount of real estate breakage costs and then the rest is sort of mix.","Gabriel Dechaine \u2013 Credit Suisse","So when it says excluding MBNA, it also excludes any positive impact from the credit mark. Is that right?","Mark Chauvin","True.","Colleen Johnston","Yes.","Gabriel Dechaine \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, I got you. Now like people ask you this every quarter basically, but what's your plan to stabilize the margin in 2013 or this quarter basically what we should expect?","Mike Pedersen","Given I can't actually stabilize or increase the level of absolute interest rates. It's going to be a little difficult to stabilize margins, but that's I think our story in the past and going forward that we are impacted by the absolute low level and protracted low level of interest rate.","Gabriel Dechaine \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then last one for Ed, just the big picture, loan growth in Canada is still pretty strong. If it does continue and then all housing prices have started to show some weakness, but if mortgage growth and consumer leverage keeps growing at a pretty healthy clip, what would the likelihood of Wall Street implementing the countercyclical buffer be? Do you have any thoughts on that?","W. Edmund Clark","Obviously this is dangerous territory, but I would be surprised at that. I think it's becoming quite clear that Canada is well in the lead of implementing Basel III versus all the other major jurisdictions in the world. I think if the housing market reheated up, then I think the government would say, is there other non-monetary policy rules that they could do to continue to tighten down on it. But I think right now, that's a question for a year from now, not for now. I think for now people are trying to step back and say what has been the impact of the rule changes and how much of that is flowing through and how much is still to flow through and I think there's going to no action for a while here, would be my view.","Gabriel Dechaine \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks Gabriel. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sumit Malhotra from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Sumit Malhotra \u2013 Macquarie Capital Markets","Good afternoon. First for Colleen, just on your comment in your prepared remarks about the Canadian banking margin. Did you say the adjustment from Q4 to Q1 \u2013 sorry, not the adjustment, the decline would be 7 basis points, strictly on the reversal of the MBNA credit card?","Colleen Johnston","So partially \u2013 I assume it on the fact that we will not have another credit mark in Q1 and partially then just ongoing margin compression, because obviously, starting next year, we'll be just publishing the margin on a basis including MBNA. So we just wanted to caution, so it wasn't a surprise when you came along to Q1 to see that you'll have both effects.","Sumit Malhotra \u2013 Macquarie Capital Markets","That\u2019s helpful. The aggregate decline would be seven and then from that level all else equal it would be in the range that Tim has talked about in previous quarters, which is something like 2 basis points a quarter, all else equal?","Colleen Johnston","Yeah, that's right. I'll ask Tim to confirm, but yeah, that's exactly right.","Tim Hockey","Yeah. You got the math right.","Sumit Malhotra \u2013 Macquarie Capital Markets","Okay, thank you. And then just over to U.S, the Bank has made references over the last couple of years since you did the FDIC and South Financial Group transactions about the accounting back and forth between \u2013 if I can call it that, between net interest income and PCL. This quarter, the 11 basis point decline, are you in a position to help us think through how much of that is what you would consider to be a core decline versus how much is accounting, because it certainly seems like in order for margin to get back into your range before the Target deal, you're counting on some of the accounting noise to go back in your favor, if that's the right way to put it.","Colleen Johnston","Yeah, Sumit, it\u2019s Colleen again. I'd say it's about half and half. About half of the decline was accounting related and half was core margin related and that  they are largely due and this is a broader issue just around accretion generally which is not necessarily smooth on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So you will see a little bit of bumpiness because of that effect.","Sumit Malhotra \u2013 Macquarie Capital Markets","And is it right to say that for margin to actually go up in this business, again prior to Target that you would need some of that to go the other way?","Colleen Johnston","Again I think that will \u2013 it will over time that stabilizes. Needless to say I think that becomes more of a quarter-to-quarter issue and then I think we'd already reference the mix issue and Bharat had commented on that, with the expectation of continuing strong loan growth that the margins on the lending side are thicker than on the deposit side. So that should actually help us as well. And then Target, I'll provide some guidance as we get closer to close, because Target will actually have quite a significant impact on the margin, but I will help you walk through what that will do on a line-by-line basis so you can adjust your models.","Sumit Malhotra \u2013 Macquarie Capital Markets","Thanks for your time.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks Sumit. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mario Mendonca from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Mario Mendonca \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Just one quick question on expenses for Bharat in the U.S. On an adjusted basis, expenses were down fairly significantly year-over-year. Now what I'm having a little difficulty understanding is whether that's just a reflection of how high the expenses were last year, or if there was something more specific to what happened this quarter?","Bharat Masrani ","No, Mario. It's ongoing expense management. We have been on the productivity agenda for a while and we are within the numbers that Colleen talked about for the Group as to what you should expect from a year-over-year perspective. And to keep this in perspective, some of those numbers may seem higher in some quarters for the U.S. business, because we do have new stores and investments that we make. So that's why sometimes you do see those numbers jump around a lot and finally there was an adjustment year-over-year once we migrated to IFRS. That had some impact as well, but overall, I think the message I would leave on expenses is that we are part of the productivity agenda. Our numbers will be higher than what Colleen has pointed out because of the investments we are making in our plant, in new stores and other initiatives.","Mario Mendonca \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Thanks very much.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks Mario. Next question please.","Operator","There are no further questions on the phone. Please continue.","Rudy Sankovic","Great. Thank you very much then and I will turn it over to Ed for some final remarks.","W. Edmund Clark","I just want just reiterate what I said at the start. I actually think it was a great year and I really do want to take the opportunity to thank our employees. I think what they managed to do is plow through a whole set of issues that came our way, a lot of headwinds that we had to deal, and produce great results, and I think it really underscores what a powerful underlying operating model that we have that we can overcome those headwinds. I want to thank all the shareholders for supporting us. I wish everybody the best of the season, and we look forward as a management team to continuing to perform in the interest of the shareholders in 2013.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks Ed.

Good afternoon and welcome to TD Bank Group's first quarter 2017 investor presentation. My name is Gillian Manning and I'm the head of Investor Relations at the Bank. We will begin today's presentation with remarks from Bharat Masrani, the Bank's CEO, after which Riaz Ahmed, the Bank's CFO, will present our first quarter operating results.

","Additional information on items of note, the Bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q1 2017 report to shareholders. With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat. ","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Gillian and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Q1 was a great quarter for TD. Earnings rose 14% from a year ago, to CAD2.6 billion and EPS increased 13%, to $1.33. Our retail and wholesale businesses performed well, reflecting strong volume growth, good client activity and an improving macro environment. Our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.9%, up 44 basis points from the prior quarter; and our leverage and liquidity coverage ratios remain strong. ","Reflecting these strong fundamentals, we declared a $0.05 dividend increase, bringing our dividend to $0.60 per share, a 9% increase. And we announced our intention to repurchase up to 15 million shares for cancellation, subject to regulatory approval, primarily to offset dilution from our dividend reinvestment program and issuance related to stock options. ","Overall, I'm very pleased with our results this quarter. We delivered double-digit earnings growth and strengthened our capital base, while continuing to invest in our businesses and in meeting our customers' needs. ","Turning to our segments. Canadian Retail earned CAD1.6 billion in Q1, up 4% from a year ago. Revenue rose 3%, driven by good volume, asset and free growth. We also benefited from higher margins, reflecting business mix, repricing and Treasury actions we took last fall, though we continue to expect moderate downward pressure on margins in the months ahead. ","In Personal Banking, we continue to grow our core deposit base which is critical to our retail strategy. On the Lending side, we had good origination activity in our proprietary real estate secured lending channels and loan growth was strongest in higher margin products, such as HELOC and unsecured loans. In Commercial Banking, we had robust growth in loans and deposits. ","Our Wealth business performed very well this quarter, with strong asset growth and trading activity driving a 15% increase in earnings. Insurance earnings were down slightly, as improved claims results were offset by investments in improving the customer experience and upgrading our platform. ","As we indicated in our Q4 call, expense growth in Canadian Retail was elevated this quarter, reflecting strategic investments we're making to digitize the customer experience, enhance our products and extend our service and convenience model across our distribution channels. Those investments are already yielding impressive results. ","Let me share a few examples. Last quarter, I mentioned the redesign of our WebBroker platform in Direct Investing. The results have been outstanding. We're delivering solutions 20% to 30% more cost effectively, while releasing improvements faster and more often. We're leveraging scalable and reusable technology solutions, like the cloud and APIs. ","We further personalized our card offering, making it possible for customers to keep their TD Visa card number when they change card types at TD, the first Canadian bank to offer this service for Visa customers. And we released enhancements to TD MySpend, our money management app that empowers users, who now number 850,000, with more tools to manage their financial well-being. ","We're excited about these innovations which are driving strong engagement and enabling us to provide customers with better, more meaningful advice. With the majority of our Canadian customers interacting with us digitally, we will continue to prioritize these initiatives. ","Turning to the U.S. Our U.S. Retail bank generated earnings of $518 million this quarter, up 10% from a year ago. Revenue growth accelerated to 9%, driven by strong loan and deposit volumes, higher fee income and continued strength in household acquisition. ","As is typical in the first quarter, we had a seasonal uptick in credit provisions, but underlying credit performance remained strong. We also delivered very good operating leverage again this quarter, even after continued investments in technology, enhanced digital offerings and revenue growth initiatives. ","Those enhancements continue to power strong growth in U.S. digital sales. For example, 15% of checking account sales are now done digitally, up from 9% a year ago and digital credit card sales are now over 20%. We expect to build on those gains with the innovations we continue to make. ","We've extended our new digital platform to a tablet experience, creating a single universal app that allows customers to review products and complete the account opening process digitally. And we introduced TD ASAP which allows customers to authenticate directly to an advisor in a contact center from their digital device. These tools are making banking faster, simpler and more secure for our customers; and we're seeing the benefits in improved customer experience scores, reduced call center wait times and increased productivity. ","Q1 was a strong quarter for our Wholesale Bank. Net income was CAD267 million, up 66% from the prior year. Robust capital markets and good activity across our businesses drove stronger trading revenue and higher debt and equity underwriting fees, more than offsetting revenue-driven increases in variable compensation and costs associated with our acquisition of U.S.-based securities dealer Albert Fried & Company. ","We also continued to advance our strategic priorities. TD Securities ranked number one in Canadian equity underwriting in 2016, raising nearly CAD10 billion on behalf of our clients and leading some of the year's largest transactions. And our sovereign, supranational and agency business is off to its best start ever in 2017, leading 14 U.S. dollar benchmark deals this quarter and raising nearly $30 billion in total. ","One quarter into FY17, we have much to be pleased about. Our Wealth and Wholesale businesses are profiting from strong client flows and favorable financial market conditions. Our U.S. Bank's robust fundamentals are being amplified by accelerating U.S. economic growth and the prospect of higher rates. And our Canadian Retail franchise continues to deliver solid results and is well positioned to benefit from a firming outlook for the Canadian economy. ","This quarter, you saw us deploy strong earnings growth and savings generated from our productivity program into additional investments and you can expect that to continue. It's an exciting time to be in banking. Rapidly changing technologies are opening up new frontiers and we're well situated to seize the resulting opportunities. ","We will continue to make investments to advance our digital transformation, deliver a more connected customer experience and simplify the way we work. Our spending is purposeful, pragmatic and aligned with our strategy to build a better bank, a bank of the future. ","To wrap up, I'm extremely pleased with our first quarter results. They speak to the strength of our diversified business mix, the adaptability of our service and convenience model in a digital world and the enduring power of our customer-centric approach. I would like to thank our 80,000-plus employees for their hard work and dedication for enriching the lives of our customers and communities while delivering for our shareholders. ","We have accomplished a great deal together and I'm confident that we can build on this momentum in the year ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Riaz. ","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you, Bharat. Good afternoon. Please turn to slide 4. This quarter, the Bank reported earnings of CAD2.5 billion and EPS of CAD1.32. Adjusted earnings are CAD2.6 billion, up 14% and adjusted EPS was CAD1.33, up 13% year over year. Adjusted revenue, excluding acquisitions and FX, increased 7%; and adjusted expenses on a similar basis also increased 7%. Higher expenses this quarter reflected seasonality and investments in our business and infrastructure. As I said last quarter, these investments will continue and we expect the rate of expense growth to be higher on a year-over-year basis in the first half of the fiscal year, particularly in our Retail businesses, with expense growth abating in the second half of the year. ","Credit losses increased 16% quarter over quarter, but declined year over year. Segment reported earnings were CAD1.6 billion for Canadian Retail, CAD800 million for U.S. Retail and CAD267 million for Wholesale. The Corporate segment reported a loss of CAD100 million or CAD75 million on an adjusted basis. ","Please turn to slide 5. Canadian Retail segment net income was CAD1.6 billion, up 4% year over year, reflecting revenue growth in Personal and Commercial Banking and Wealth and lower insurance claims, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses and PCL. Total loan growth was 4% year over year, with increases in personal lending and business lending volumes. ","Deposits increased by 12%, reflecting growth in core checking and savings accounts and business deposits. And wealth assets grew 11%. Insurance claims decreased 12% year over year, reflecting a reduction in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities and lower current-year claims. ","Margin was 2.82%, up 4 basis points quarter over quarter, reflecting favorable business mix, Treasury actions and product repricing. We nevertheless continue to expect moderate pressure on margins, reflecting the low interest rate environment and competitive pricing. PCLs were relatively stable, increasing 2% quarter over quarter. Year-over-year PCL increased 18%, reflecting the benefit in the prior year of the sale of charged off accounts and higher provisions in the auto lending portfolio in the current quarter. ","Expenses increased 7% year over year, reflecting higher investments in strategic initiatives, including digitizing the customer experience and enhancing our product suite, increased investments in front-line employees and business growth, partially offset by productivity savings. Please turn to slide 6. U.S. retail net income was $601 million, up 9% year over year or CAD800 million, up 7% year over year. The U.S. Retail Bank earned $518 million, up 10% year over year. Strong revenue growth reflecting higher loan and deposit volumes and fee income growth was partially offset by higher expenses and PCL. Total loan growth of 7% year over year, reflecting growth in both personal loans and business loans and deposits increased by 11%. ","Margin was 3.03%, down 10 basis points quarter over quarter. The decrease was largely due to the accounting impact on NII from our hedging activities which, as you know, is largely offset in other income. Fundamentally, margin was up 1 basis point this quarter, reflecting good deposit margin expansion, partially offset by lower accretion on legacy loans. While many factors affect margins, we expect continued improvement in 2017, with potential further upside if U.S. rates continue to increase. ","PCL increased 32% quarter over quarter, primarily reflecting seasonal increases in the auto lending and credit card portfolios and prior quarter benefits related to the release of special reserves held for the South Carolina flood. PCL increased 21% year over year, primarily due to higher provisions relating to mix in auto lending and growth in seasoning and credit cards. ","Expenses increased 5% year over year, reflecting higher spend for technology modernization, volume growth and additional front-line employees, partially offset by productivity savings. Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade increased 1% year over year. ","Please turn to slide 7. Net income for Wholesale was CAD267 million, up 66% year over year, reflecting higher revenue and a net recovery of credit losses, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses. Revenue increased 29%, reflecting higher origination activity in debt and equity capital markets and higher trading-related revenue. ","PCL decreased, reflecting the recovery of specific provisions in the oil and gas sector. Non-interest expenses increased year over year, reflecting higher variable compensation in line with revenue and higher operating expenses and costs associated with the acquisition of Albert Fried & Company. ","Please turn to slide 8. The Corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of CAD75 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of CAD178 million in the same period last year. Net corporate expenses increased year over year, due to the timing of ongoing investments in enterprise and regulatory projects. The contribution from other items increased CAD133 million year over year, reflecting higher revenue from Treasury and balance sheet management activities, as well as provisions for incurred but not identified credit losses and negative tax and other items recognized in the prior year. ","Please turn to slide 9. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.9% at the end of first quarter, reflecting strong organic capital generation. The increase in RWA this quarter reflects business volume growth offset by certain capital management activities to reduce capital-intensive investments. ","Our leverage and liquidity ratios are consistent with last quarter's levels. We announced our intention to launch a normal course issuer bid for up to 15 million common shares, subject to regulatory approval. This is primarily to offset the share issuance for the dividend reinvestment plan and stock option exercises. I will now turn the call over to Mark. ","Mark Chauvin","Thank you, Riaz and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 10. Credit quality remains strong, as we begin the year with stable trends across the Bank's credit portfolios. Gross impaired loan formations were stable at CAD1.3 billion or 21 basis points quarter over quarter and reduced CAD436 million or 9 basis points, from the previous year. U.S. Retail formations are up CAD71 million, due to seasonal trends in the credit card and indirect auto portfolios and the negative impact of foreign exchange. There were no new formations in the Wholesale portfolio. ","Please turn to slide 11. Gross impaired loans ended the quarter at CAD3.4 billion, down CAD110 million or 1 basis point quarter over quarter, as resolutions outpaced formations in the Wholesale and U.S. Commercial portfolios. Gross impaired loans decreased CAD400 million or 8 basis points, year over year, driven primarily by resolutions in the U.S. HELOC portfolio and the impact of foreign exchange. ","Moving on to slide 12. As indicated in previous quarters, U.S. strategic card PCLs are reported on a net basis for segment reporting, including only the Bank's contractual portion of credit losses. For the purpose of the credit slides, we continue to report gross losses to better reflect portfolio credit quality. ","Provisions for credit losses during the quarter are within expectations at CAD635 million, up CAD81 million or 5 basis points, quarter over quarter to 42 basis points, 3 basis points lower than the previous year's quarterly loss rate. The primary factors impacting PCL in the quarter are seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card and indirect auto portfolios, driven by holiday spending and the negative impact of foreign exchange, offset by CAD25 million in recoveries in the wholesale oil and gas sector. ","To conclude, the key takeaways this quarter are credit quality remains strong and we continue to be well positioned for growth across all credit portfolios. With that, Operator, we're now ready to begin the question-and-answer session. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. ","Ebrahim Poonawala","First question, Riaz, if you could help us with a better understanding of the NIM dynamics in the U.S. going forward around you mentioned that you expect the NIM to continue to improve even without any interest rate increases and then do even better. Is there any way, if you could help quantify around what we should expect on the NIM coming off the December rate hike and if we get another hike in March, what that could mean for the 2Q, this NIM strategy going forward. ","Riaz Ahmed","Ebrahim, as I'd mentioned to you on the Q4 call, I'm not really giving specific guidance around interest rates and its impact on our NIM, as you can see that there tend to be a fair number of moving parts. But what I can tell you is this, we experienced very good deposit margin expansion in this quarter which, as I mentioned earlier, was offset a little bit by the lower accretion on legacy loans.","So the fundamental margin was net up 1 basis point. We experienced this accounting noise from hedging that I've talked about before which a decrease in NII is offset in other income which brought the headline number down. But this quarter, we've also made a decision to move those Treasury and balance sheet management activities to Corporate segment which actually hurt the U.S. Retail's earnings this quarter. But nevertheless, what we've done is taken a fair bit of that volatility out into the Corporate. So you should see a more stable and rising NIM, U.S. segment NIM number moving forward. ","And given that the Fed rate increase occurred really in the middle of the first quarter, that, from a deposit margin perspective, should continue to bode well into the second quarter, where we would have the effect of the full year. And you should also see continued improvement, due to what I mentioned before, the yield curve enhancements. ","Ebrahim Poonawala","And if I may, just another question for Bharat, I guess. There's been a fair bit of discussion around U.S. M&A through this earnings season. Just wanted to get an updated view both in terms of on the Bank's front, I know you've talked some interest in your Northeast, within your Northeast retail footprint and on the non-Bank side, cards or what would interest you? ","Bharat Masrani","Ebrahim, our view on that is unchanged. It has not changed. We continue to be interested in high quality card portfolios in the U.S., as we have said before. It's a business that we like. Our experience has shown that this business performs very well. It gives us decent returns and frankly, helps us to build up our scale in the U.S. So if we were to see more opportunities in that area that make sense from a risk appetite perspective and obviously financial perspective, we would look at those seriously, particularly given the structure of our balance sheet in the U.S., with deposits outpacing loans by quite a margin. ","With respect to the Bank acquisitions, we had said and we continue to believe that if there are particular opportunities that would help us accelerate our organic growth plans within the U.S., particularly in the Southeast, where we think that we may not have as much of scale as we would like, given the demographics, the dynamics of that market, we would look at those very seriously. But all of these would have to make sense, both from a risk perspective and financially, as well. ","Ebrahim Poonawala","And Bharat, would you care to quantify what size of deal should we think about when we think about M&A, both cards or bank fund? ","Bharat Masrani","A lot would depend on, A, what is available and B, our ability to integrate it, make sure we do it well. If you're going to do a large-ish transaction, then we have to make sure that the culture is going to be aligned what our values are to make sense, because we do have a fantastic business proposition in the U.S., as we do in Canada. Our value proposition is compelling and we would not want to do anything that would disturb that. ","With respect to size, tough to say, Ebrahim. Obviously, if there's a very large transaction that appears to be very compelling, then we would have to think hard about timing, what would suit us, both from a financial risk and integration and conversion perspective, but as well as market timing and whether such a deal would make sense for the Bank. So hard to predict precisely, because none has come around. But should one present itself, we would look at it seriously. But those would be the factors that would come into play. ","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Therall [ph] with Eight Capital. ","Steve Therall","I wanted to ask a question on indirect auto. You mentioned this quarter a change in mix in the indirect auto. Am I right, is that flagging a move a little bit down market, more into near prime? You've been reluctant to do so in the past. So if that's right, wondering what the thinking is there. ","Mike Pedersen","So it's Mike, Steve. So to be clear, we're have not been originating any sub prime and we continue not to originate any sub prime. ","Bharat Masrani","We're talking U.S. here, just to clarify. ","Mike Pedersen","We're talking the U.S. here, yes. We're obviously continuing evaluating what our origination mix should be. And as you suggest, in recent quarters we have tweaked that a bit. We're doing a bit less super prime and more prime and near prime. But we're not talking about dramatic switches in the mix. It's a few percentage points. I'd say it's all planned and it's evolving exactly as we expected. We knew we were going to see higher PCLs as we adjusted the mix and we're seeing them in the quantums that we expect to see. It's obviously more accretive business for us overall. So I'd say very comfortable with what we're originating and no concerns on the credit quality part in the auto finance portfolio in the U.S. ","Steve Therall","When you say a change of a few points, what would the near prime be at in terms of mix? Would it be 10% or less than that, more than that? ","Mike Pedersen","So the origination which is what we're doing, so a year ago, it would have been about 10.5%. Now it's just over 15%. But it changes quarter by quarter. ","Steve Therall","And maybe if I can dove tail that into a question for Mark. I think a bit surprised by the rise in PCLs in the U.S. So when we consider everything together, so the seasonality in cards, but then what looks like a pretty consistent ramping in auto loans, maybe in part on the back of more near prime, how representative of a run rate out the remainder of the year would you say that $190 million, I think it was, PCL number for the U.S., Mark? ","Mark Chauvin","So maybe in looking at the quarter-over quarter change in the U.S. PCL, first, I'd clarify that it was really right on our projections. So there was no surprise to that at all. And really what was driving that quarter-over quarter change, we refer to it as seasonality. But to explain that a little bit more, it's really driven by the fact you experience during our first quarter, given our large participation in strategic cards with the retailers, you see an increase in spending through the holiday season that increases balances. Also during this period and it's consistent year in and year out that you see a slight increase in delinquency in the card portfolio, as well as the indirect auto portfolio.","And that is what really, those two things create an increase in PCL through reserving which we forecast, but every year comes back in the second and third quarter. So that was probably about 60% of it, the change. Another 30% would have been change in FX. So it pretty much accounted for all of it in the year. And I would expect the loss rates in those two categories to revert to what we experienced in the third and fourth quarter, as we go forward in the year. The issue of the mix in cards was a bit of a factor year-over-year, because it takes longer, but not as much quarter-over quarter. ","Mike Pedersen","Steve, it's Mike again. If I could just add to your point. Last year, we saw Q1 PCLs were the high water mark for the year. We'd expect the same this year, based on what we're seeing right now. ","Steve Therall","And then just a follow-up. The PCL on the auto, will that grow, would you say that's going to grow in line with the loan book or will it grow a little faster with the change in mix? ","Mike Pedersen","I think primarily with volume, but a little bit with mix. ","Operator","We'll go next to Meny Grauman with Cormark Securities. ","Meny Grauman","I just wanted to understand a little bit more the dynamics in terms of your outlook for further margin pressure in Canada going forward, especially in the context of what helped the margin this quarter. You mentioned favorable business mix, Treasury actions and product repricing. So just in that context, why you expect margin pressure to continue going forward. ","Teri Currie","Meny, it's Teri. I'll take the question. So as you identified, the positive factors for Q1 were business mix. So really, deposit growth was very high, so that really helped us. Product mix, we had record checking volumes, so that made a difference. We had some Treasury actions, as you indicated and repricing activity. So those things helped us in the first quarter, year-over-year, in particular. ","When we look ahead, we have all the same dynamics that we had talked about last year. And so we expect modest downward pressure, because we'll still be facing the fact that on the deposit book, the tractors will roll over at lower pricing and on the lending book, the new business we're putting on is at lower margin than the average portfolio margin. Having said that, you will have seen we're starting to originate more of our home equity line of credit, our FlexLine product and higher margin product in the lending book., so that will help over time. But again, the same factors of lower interest rates, competitive pricing are going to play a role in cost of funds as we go through the year. ","Operator","We'll go next to Sohrab Movahedi with BMO Capital Markets. ","Sohrab Movahedi","We'd like to stay with Teri, if I can. Teri, within Canadian Banking, I think this was the first quarter in a while that your year-over-year revenue growth was over 5% and you've had pretty good accelerating revenue growth there. Can you just talk a little bit more on the revenue dynamics across, not just on margins? ","Teri Currie","For sure. So thanks for noticing that. I would say, obviously for Canadian Retail, Wealth performed particularly well, with strong growth there. Business lending and personal lending performed well and unsecured personal lending has been a strategic growth focus for us. Great core deposit growth, business lending at double digits, personal deposit growth, again record checking volumes in Q1. So a lot of things working in our favor. And then again, we've got the embedded growth in the franchise that's helping us. So I'd say we had good organic growth across many of our businesses, including cards. ","Sohrab Movahedi","And so within that Canadian personal and commercial banking piece, your non-interest income was up pretty smartly. Is that repeatable, do you think? ","Teri Currie","Certainly the biggest factor was our broad-based organic growth. And so I would say the caveat I would probably put on it is we had such good deposit growth, I would expect that to moderate somewhat. Otherwise, I'd say yes. ","Operator","We'll go next to Nick Stogdill with Credit Suisse. ","Nick Stogdill","Just sticking with Teri on Canadian P&C. Last quarter, you did telegraph that expenses would be elevated in the first half of 2017. Can you break apart how much was for the front line growth versus technology spend and other buckets in terms of the 7% growth year-over-year? And is that a good pace to assume for the second quarter, as well? And then lastly, just on the back half of the year, should we expect expenses to decline on an absolute basis versus H1 or flat or how should we think about that? Thank you. ","Teri Currie","For sure. So a bunch of things in that question. So yes, we had guided to the expense growth that you saw in this quarter. And as Riaz mentioned, there were some one-time favorable items in Q1 of last year. If we look at the expenses in this quarter, first off, the year-over-year expense growth will abate through the year. I think either Riaz or Bharat mentioned that earlier. And we're still expecting positive operating leverage for the full year. So there will be some bumpiness in quarters. ","When we look at the investments, as we mentioned, call it 33% of that is around digitizing our branch customer experience. So this is really ensuring that we've got the right network, ensuring that we've got Wi-Fi and iPads in our locations such that our front line colleagues can help our customers take up our industry leading digital properties and continue to help our customers save time and money and have their self-service transactions which almost 80% of them happen today, happening via direct channels, if you will. We have invested in front line advisors, as you mentioned, call that another good portion of the investment. And that would be both Wealth Management and in cad P&C mobile mortgage sales force. ","And then the other impact is rationalizing and enhancing our product lineups. That's another portion of the expenses. And in that case, an example would be for unsecured lending, we've gone from 50 products down to 8 in the last quarter. So we're making it easier for our colleagues and more efficient for them to get the right products in our customers' hands. So I'd say overall, we're making investments to grow the business where we've done that in the past. You've seen the examples of that. FlexLine business card would be other examples of where we've made those investments and they've paid off in future growth. So I think that covers us. ","Operator","We'll go next to Gabriel Dechaine with National Bank Financial. ","Gabriel Dechaine","Just a quick numbers question on the U.S. margin and then still on this expense topic here. The margin, you mentioned it's accretable yield that would have benefited Q4. Can you quantify that, just so I can get a better sense of what the actual margin did in the U.S.? ","Mike Pedersen","Yes. It's Mike, Gabriel. Around 4 basis points. ","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. So net of that -- ","Riaz Ahmed","Negative, not a benefit. ","Mike Pedersen","That was a negative. ","Gabriel Dechaine","Right. It was negative in the sense that you had it last quarter, you didn't have it this quarter. So excluding that, you would have been up 5-ish kind of thing. And the accounting thing. ","Riaz Ahmed","The math works. Yes, Gabriel. The math works the way you said it. ","Gabriel Dechaine","One plus four, I got it. Okay. Then on the IT -- sorry, the elevated expenses in Canadian P&C, the digitization. Now just from a conceptual standpoint here, if I go through your non-interest expenses in the supplement and I go through the major categories, it looks like it's, where expenses went up across the Bank were in salaries and benefits and all the other major line items were either flat, up a little or down. But it looks mostly salary related. So as you talk about expenses, growth abating or expenses coming down, as some of that initiative spending gets pulled back, how should I see these lines evolving over the course of the year? ","Teri Currie","So it's Teri. And then Riaz can kick in, as well. So for our Canadian Retail businesses, again, a big part of the number was front line advisors and customer support to ensure that as we grew our business, we could continue to grow our capabilities to meet our customers' needs. And the other thing that you would have seen would be increased costs along with investing in our businesses. That obviously requires more people to deliver those investments in those projects. ","Riaz Ahmed","And I'd also just add to that, Gabriel, that when you're undertaking these projects to digitize and along those lines, they require a lot of people and developers, et cetera. So you would expect to, you're correct to basically connect the dots between the examples that we're giving you about that investments that we're making to salaries and benefits, because it is people-driven research, development and projects work. ","Gabriel Dechaine","But those aren't necessarily permanent, are they? ","Teri Currie","No. ","Gabriel Dechaine","Right. And is there -- and it was alluded to earlier that you had good revenue growth in Canadian Banking this quarter. There's been some acceleration there. Has it been -- maybe we underestimate that from where we sit or where I sit anyway, but as you're pushing through these transformations and cultural changes, really when you're digitizing, I guess that's going to have an effect on the culture, there's a lag between or maybe a negative impact on your revenues short term, like we saw last year, maybe 2015, as well and you're starting to turn the corner on that as the new, as the plan advances, I guess. Is there some validity to that? ","Teri Currie","For sure I would reinforce the midterm guidance that we've given on Canadian Retail around mid-single digits. That's still what we would be projecting. But I would I say, I think when we think about how we're delivering our strategy, it's definitely a multi channel strategy. And while our customers are taking up our new capabilities, it's equally true that most of our customers deal with us across multiple channels. And when they do that, they actually have more business with us and they're more satisfied.","And so we're continuing to really work through how do we optimize the branch network to be there for our customers in high growth markets, consolidate and create new formats where it makes sense and concurrently invest in the digital properties. And I think we're keeping that balance fairly intact, fairly right. And as we look you ahead, we think we can do that with moderate expense growth and good business growth. ","Operator","We'll go next to Sumit Malhotra with Scotia Capital. ","Sumit Malhotra","First, just a couple of clarification questions for Riaz. On the U.S. NIM, the commentary about, I think it's balance sheet management activities, are you referring to just the way the accounting impacts your credit card partnerships and how that flows through or is this relating more to the securities portfolio and some action you may have taken in that regard in the U.S.? ","Riaz Ahmed","You're right that it is the accounting effects, but I wouldn't isolate it to one or other part of the balance sheet. Because as you know, we take our asset\/liability approach on an integrated basis. But it relates to the fact that we use derivatives to adjust the duration profile of our interest rate risk and those derivatives are marked to market for accounting purposes and then you use hedge accounting to tag those hedges against assets that would move in a similar way and sometimes you can get basis differences. So that over the term of the hedge, the effect is zero, but in the meantime you get this little volatility in NII that gets offset in other income. ","So it's a very kind of a technical accounting requirement. But what I'd say to you is that the takeway is that the hedging program works. It is largely revenue neutral over its duration. And that's why we essentially took it out back to the Corporate segment, to give you a more fundamental view of what's going to happen to the underlying margin, so that we're not struggling with this quarter after quarter after quarter and putting you through mitts over it. ","Sumit Malhotra","It sounds like between this and the credit card accounting, you're going to make more references to a so-called core movement in U.S. NIM, like you did this time around, going forward. ","Riaz Ahmed","I think essentially, you'll see that coming together in any event, given that we're moving the effects of these Treasury and balance sheet items to Corporate segment starting this quarter. ","Sumit Malhotra","Okay. And another clarification. But you know what? In the interest of time, I'll ask my actual question and I'll requeue, if there's time. Back to Teri. And when we look at the 7% expense growth, I'm looking just at the P&C Bank, not Wealth or Insurance, the one you show in your appendix. So 2016, your expense growth in this big segment was limited to 1% year-over-year. And this year, with some of that project spending you had talked about, it's up at 7% to start the year.","Now, I may be looking at this too simplistically, but the 2016 flat expense number comes on the back of the larger restructuring charges the Bank enacted in 2015. My question would be, why wasn't some of that project spend anticipated over the course of the year and maybe spread out a little bit more? And maybe put a different way, did last year's number benefit, was it more front loaded in that $600 million run rate savings estimate you've guided to as a result of the restructuring charges? ","Teri Currie","I'll give you three pieces to that. I'd say for sure, as we came into 2016, expenses were lower as a result of the productivity exercise that we had done in 2015. In particular, we would have been holding some vacancies and so working our way through that in 2016. For sure, we had lower expenses at the beginning of 2016 and you're seeing the impact of that now year-over-year in our first quarter expenses, the number that you talked about. So those are two factors. ","Having said that, we did accelerate our expenses through 2016 and then guided to this higher level at the beginning of this year because of those timing differences. So again, I believe moderate expenses for this year and improving year-over-year gross and positive operating leverage are the right sound bites. ","Bharat Masrani","And Sumit, this is Bharat. When you have a favorable environment and you have an investment list, then obviously you're going to take advantage of the environment and get those investments done. And we will continue to do that, because it makes sense for the Bank. And I know there's a lot of noise around this, but my point is that and I've said this many times before, we're not going to worry about operating leverage on a quarter by quarter basis. We will make sure and we will try to aspire to a positive operating leverage over the year. And that's what we said we will do and that's what we're doing. ","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Sedran with CIBC. ","Robert Sedran","Teri, I guess you're the most popular kid on the playground today, so I'm going to stick with that. I'm just curious, when you think about -- I'm probably paraphrasing Bharat from earlier when he talked about making progress on extending the service and convenience model into the digital side. I'm wondering, on the hours open on the branch side, if there's ever been any thought or if you've been doing anything in terms of paring back some of that as the channels become a little bit less emphasized or if you think maybe that's too central to the brand that you can't really affect the hours opened at all or if it wouldn't be a good idea to even try? ","Teri Currie","Since I'm popular, maybe I'll give you a little bit of a story around this. So our strategy obviously has been and we've been winning, because we have a deep understanding of our customers and we're delivering the best personal connected experiences. And that's a branch strategy. That's an ATM strategy. It's an online and digital strategy, an online and mobile strategy and it's a phone strategy. And again, we're continuing to pull the levers that we think make sense to have a connected experience for our customers to meet their expectations. ","Branches continue to be important for our customers. They're important for problem resolution. They're important for complex advice. And they're important for us as billboards, for attracting new customers and you know we continue to be very good at acquiring new customers. And so while we're continuing to innovate our formats in branches, we've reduced our square footage since 2013 by 160,000 square feet, we do think our hours advantage continues to serve us well. Now in markets, we continue to tweak to ensure that we maintain that advantage, but that we're available for customers at times that make sense. And so there have been cases and will continue to be where we pull those back. But I can definitely tell you that we think our hours advantage is a big part of our service and convenience offering and it's not the most expensive part of creating the availability for our customers and so we would be loathe to do too much about that. ","Obviously, concurrently, as you mentioned, we're building out our digital capabilities. And Bharat mentioned industry leading capabilities, like TD MySpend, TD For Me and WebBroker. And so we're going to continue to, I think, deliver a premium retail franchise across all channels for our customers going forward. ","Operator","We'll go next to Darko Mihelic with RBC Capital Markets. ","Darko Mihelic","Teri, I'll stick with you. One question, I'll try and keep it brief. What's difficult for us on the outside is when we understand or we hear about the elevated expense level, the question is, why does the expense level decline, but more importantly, at the end of this all, why is it that all the banks have been able to take restructuring charges, they're also spending on initiatives, why seemingly that you're spending or it's affecting you more on a relative basis?","And I guess where I'm coming from is when I hear that you're rationalizing products and digitizing the customer experience, it's difficult for us from the outside to understand whether or not what you're doing is actually ahead of your competitors or you're catching up to your competitors. So can you speak to maybe some benchmarking and something that would help us understand better what TD, apart from TD MySpend and WebBroker, but what it is that you've done with the product on the advisor side that is actually industry leading? ","Teri Currie","Sure. So I think the biggest issue around expenses, as we've talked about, is the year-over-year comparison and the fact that in Q1 of 2016, we had some favorable items and in the ramped up expenses, if you will, through the year and delivered a good expense result for the full year and now we come into 2017 with a plan to deliver a good expense result over the full year, but some front end year-over-year expense growth that is creating, I think, some of this question. So I do continue to want to emphasize that for the full year, we will have positive operating leverage and moderate expense growth. ","Having said that, if you're looking at then how do I understand why you're in this place, I would say in terms of digitizing and automating our offerings to our customers, we're continuing, like all of our competitors, to do more in that regard. And I think that that will continue to provide better customer experiences over time and also better efficiency over time. But there is investment to make that happen and that's what we're working through. ","In terms of areas where we lead, certainly WebBroker is a big example of that. That's been cited by the Global and Mail as the best amongst the big five banks. And I'd say the investment in the self-service capabilities for our investors has been second to none. And then again, according to Com Score, we have the best mobile engagement in Canada across our customer base and 50% of our total customer base are active mobile users and almost 80% of service transactions happen self-service. So those are just come examples. I'd be happy to answer more questions, if you have a follow-on. ","Darko Mihelic","I do have a lot of follow-ons, but I'm not going to monopolize the call. I'll leave it there. Thank you. ","Operator","We'll go next to Sohrab Movahedi with BMO Capital Markets. ","Sohrab Movahedi","Mike, just for you on the U.S., a bit of a big picture question. Lots of talk that maybe the U.S. administration's going to be able to get the U.S. GDP growth going to 3.5%, maybe even 4%. In that type of an environment, what sort of leverage do you have in benefiting and growing your earnings, if U.S. GDP growth was in the, let's say, 3.5% to 4%? ","Mike Pedersen","I've made the point before that I think given our size, compared to -- which is relatively small in the U.S. in the overall scheme of things -- compared to some of the larger players, I believe that our growth and success is less correlated to GDP growth than some of our competitors. We win through a unique model and the proof is in our household acquisition and our deposit growth and our loan growth and so on. So I think that's very important. We actually believe that we can succeed in a low growth, moderate growth, faster growth environment. ","Needless to say, I think the sentiment in the U.S. right now is fairly positive. Whether I'm speaking with consumer customers or commercial customers, they are more positive in terms of their outlook and commercial and corporate customers are talking about investments and capital outlays more than they were. So I think that augers well. But, as this may be the basis of your question, we're not really seeing it in the actual GDP numbers reported yet, but I think they're sometimes a lagging indicator and I think we will see it. ","If we get into a faster growth environment, I would expect us to perform better than we're performing now. There's a point at which TD will not do the racier things in a fast growth environment, but we're nowhere close though that environment. I feel very confident about our business looking forward, with the assumptions that the economy's going to operate as it is or slightly better. We just have so many things that, being a relatively young business, that are going well for us. We're outgrowing our peers in all the respects I spoke about. We're deepening relationships with our customers. We're making very good progress on that. We're changing our distribution strategy. Bharat mentioned the digital sales in one year on checking going from 9% to 15%. We've had excellent productivity progress, good expense management. I'm very pleased with the efficiency ratio this quarter, 56.7%. ","And then we've got opportunities, as Bharat alluded to, like the Nordstrom's and Scottrade kinds of deals, as well as others that he alluded to and on top of that, potential rate increases. So feel good about the prospects for the business over the next year or two. ","Sohrab Movahedi","It almost sounds like you'd rather not have the GDP growth in the U.S. ","Mike Pedersen","No, given the choice, I'd take it. ","Sohrab Movahedi","Thank you. ","Bharat Masrani","Sohrab, on that, if you have 3% and I think you said 4%, that would be quite something if that happens, we're going to have companies borrowing more, loan growth is going to be pretty robust then, there's going to be a lot of transaction activity. So you would think, we're a large checking bank, so you would think the transactions would go up, debit interchange would go up. We have partnership deals with our credit card retailers.","You would see some robust activity there. And if you have that kind of GDP growth, I'm not clairvoyant, but you would expect interest rates to be firmer than where they are today. And with our balance sheet mix, with the heavy emphasis on the deposit gathering, you would think you would benefit. ","So that's yes, Mike's point is bang on that our model allows us to perform very well, regardless of from a relative perspective, regardless of where the economy might be, but an overall GDP growth of that level, if it were to happen on the basis that people would normally expect, would be positive, very positive. ","Sohrab Movahedi","And presumably, you would hold Mike's feet to or whoever's heading up the U.S. region then, you hold their feet to fire. In other words, you have much higher expectations out of that earnings, expectations of earnings out of that segment under those circumstances, as well. ","Bharat Masrani","More than just feet.","Operator","We'll go next to Mario Mendonca with TD Securities. ","Mario Mendonca","A couple moments ago, you said something that really caught my attention. You said that the Bank will invest when we have favorable revenue environment, we're not going to worry about quarterly operating leverage. So the question I want to ask is, in any given quarter, what expense flexibility does the Bank have? And what I'm getting at here is, is it CAD100 million, as in in any given quarter, you can either expense or not expense CA100 million or spend or not spend CAD100 million. And if the answer to the question is that's a ridiculous question, that's fine. But that's the direction I want to go. ","Bharat Masrani","Well, I'm not going to say it's a ridiculous question, Mario. But I will say that when the environment, when you see some positives in the environment, like we've seen in certain markets, when we know what our own pipelines are and that's not just by quarter and we do get a sense for where the next little while might be and sometime we get it right, sometimes we get it wrong. But hopefully, most times we do get it right. And that would encourage us to make the investments perhaps faster than what we might have done had that not been the case. ","So that's what I mean. I don't want you to take the impression that we can throttle up or down within two minutes because Mike thinks something's going to happen in the U.S., so let's get the expenses up. But generally, we do try and take advantage of an environment. Because in today's day and age, the investment opportunities are huge and some of them make a lot of sense for TD and we want to make sure that we take advantage of our franchise and industry leading positions. We just want to make sure not only do we maintain it, but we take share because of that advantage. ","Mario Mendonca","So expenses will always be based on their merits, but the timing of those expenses could be somewhat variable. ","Bharat Masrani","It's not inaccurate. Not going to suggest that your whole expense base is of that characteristic, but certainly some categories do fall into that description. ","Operator","And at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Bharat Masrani for closing remarks. ","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Operator. I'm very, very happy with what we have delivered today. You look at the numbers out of U.S. Retail, very strong results, as well as from Wholesale. And we've started to see momentum out of our Canadian Retail business, where we have some of the largest market shares in the industry. So very happy with how the quarter's turned out and the momentum we're building. ","So thank you for your support. I know our shareholders are listening to this call. We appreciate your support and I look forward to meeting many of you in the quarter. And if we do not get a chance to get together, I look forward to talking to you in 90 days from now or so.

Please go ahead Ma'am.","Gillian Manning","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to TD Bank Group\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2016 Investor Presentation. My name is Gillian Manning and I'm the Head of Investor Relations at the Bank.","We\u2019ll begin today's presentation with remarks from Bharat Masrani, the Bank\u2019s CEO after which, Riaz Ahmed, the Bank\u2019s CFO, will present our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 operating results.

Additional information on items of note, the bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q4 2016 report to shareholders. ","With that let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Gillian and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our Q4 and fiscal 2016 results, which reflect the power of our low-risk franchise, a geographically diversified business model and a good execution in each of our businesses. Let me speak to the results.","During Q4, we earned $2.3 billion up 8% from a year ago and EPS was $1.22, up 7% reflecting strong performances in our U.S. retail and wholesale segments and stable earnings in Canadian retail. For the full year, earnings were $9.3 billion and EPS was $4.81, both up 6% from 2015.","Revenue increased across all our businesses. Expense growth excluding FX and acquisitions was 2% and we maintained positive operating leverage while continuing to invest in our businesses for future growth. Provisions for credit losses stabilized in the second half of the year and credit quality overall remains strong.","Our capital and liquidity positions ended the year on an equally strong footing. Our CET1 ratio was 10.4% and our leverage and liquidity coverage ratios remain above target. We increased our dividends paid per share by 8% in 2016 and we delivered an 18% total shareholder return at the top of the Canadian peer group.","Let me turn to the segments. Canadian retail earnings increased 1% this fiscal year and personal and commercial bank net income rose 2%. We continue to grow revenue and manage expenses in a slow growth economy, while making investments to optimize our branch network and improve the customer and employee experience.","Our wealth business performed very well. Earnings growth was 9% and we achieved record asset levels and enhanced our advisory and client trading capabilities.","Our insurance business also did well, increasing pretax earnings by 6%. Overall the fundamentals of our Canadian retail business remained strong. We\u2019re putting good risk-adjusted business on the books and we continue to leverage the power of one TD to strengthen and deepen customer relationships.","This year, we received further recognition for a differentiated service and convenience offering and our ability to deliver that experience seamlessly in a digital environment.","In addition to retaining top spot in the Ipso survey for overall customer service excellence among the big five banks for a 12th consecutive year, we were repeat winners of the Ipso's Online and Mobile Banking Awards and we had the highest number of mobile unique visitors according to comScore.","Turning to the U.S., earnings in our U.S. retail bank rose 9% to US$1.9 billion in fiscal 2016. We grew revenues on strong volumes, better margins as well as the addition of the notes from assets was strategic to our portfolio. Expenses were well-managed resulting in strong operating leverage and credit performance was stable.","It was a strong year across the Board for our U.S. business as we outperformed our peers in loan and deposit growth and household acquisition by continuing to put the customer first.","In October, in conjunction with TD Ameritrade's agreement requires Scottrade, we agreed to acquire Scottrade Bank. These transactions are strategically important for us. Scottrade's three million plus client accounts nearly 500 branches and US$117 billion in assets under management will add significant size and scale to TD Ameritrade\u2019s online brokerage business and expand our suite deposit program.","We are very pleased with these transactions, which strengthen our relationship with TD Ameritrade and reinforce its contribution to our U.S. retail growth strategy.","Our wholesale bank generated high-quality earnings growth reflecting the strength of our franchise. Net income increased from 2015 and ROE was 16% reflecting good revenue growth. TD Securities maintained its top three dealer status in Canada and let some of the years marquee transactions most recently acting as joint book runner on average sales $460 million IPO, the largest Canadian IPO of the year.","We also made significant progress in our U.S. dollar businesses nearly doubling for the second successive year, the number of U.S. -- of lead U.S. dollar debt deals and with our agreement to acquire Albert Fried, we will further expand our U.S. capabilities and client offerings, the transaction will leverage our leadership position in the prime brokerage space in Canada and mark an important step forward in our efforts to build an integrated dealer in the U.S. aligned with our U.S. businesses.","As I reflect on the year just ended, the benefits of our strategy to diversify our earnings -- diversify our earnings base are clear. As growth in some of our Canadian retail businesses has moderated, the performance of our U.S. retail segments coupled with our expanding wholesale franchise has provided support to overall earnings growth.","We expect these trends to continue next year. In Canada, GDP growth is expected to remain modest in 2017 and 2018 with the economy continues its adjustment to a lower growth environment and has policy efforts to address the rising housing prices and household debt start to take effect.","With the yield curve largely flat out to five years, we think it is prudent to moderate our medium term growth expectations for the Canadian retail segment from the 7% plus target identified at our Investor Day to mid-single digits.","By contrast, the economic picture is brighter in the U.S. The Fed appears likely to raise rates in the coming months and the market has responded with bond yields rising and the U.S. dollar on the upswing. While there are global risks, these conditions in the U.S. if sustained, will enable us to deliver total bank adjusted EPS growth for 2017 inside our 7% to 10% medium term target range.","We have a resilient diversified business model that generates strong risk adjusted returns and this enables us to continue to make strategic investments to improve our operational efficiency and lay the foundation for future growth including enhancements to our digital capabilities.","I've been sharing examples this year of how we're investing and innovating in the digital space. By putting the customer front-end center, we've been able to drive engagement to new levels, particularly in mobile. Let me highlight a few of our latest accomplishments.","This fall we launched TD for Me; a new capability integrated with our TD Banking App. TD for Me is a digital concierge that allows customers to opt into a service that sends real time notifications about special offers and nearby events.","Let me give you an example. If you visit our real estate development site served by a TD Mobile Mortgage Specialist in a TD for Me zone, you'll get a push notification on your home screen connecting you with an advisor who can answer your questions and guide you through the process of getting a mortgage.","Early feedback on TD for Me has been very positive with over 900,000 customers registering for the service on their mobile devices.","Our companion app in Canada, TD MySpend is also growing in popularity. Since launch in May, we have over 700,000 customers who love the way it helps them manage their financial wellbeing.","In our Wealth business, we completed a transformational journey that began nearly three years ago. All of our direct investing clients have now been successfully migrated to our award winning new web broker platform.","We've implemented a new active trading platform and a new order entry system and we introduced a mobile trading applications that is fully integrated into the TD Banking app. As a result of these investments, we have now fully deployed a strong platform that positions us well for further innovation and continued success.","It's a similar story in the U.S. with our next generation digital platform; 2.2 million customers are using our app across Android and Apple devices. The new capabilities that powered strong adoption and engagement on our mobile platform with digital sales of retail products now representing more than 10% of all sales.","In our wholesale bank, we introduced the new electronic foreign exchange trading platform that provides faster and more automated pricing for clients, which has led to a significant increase in trading volumes and we are delivering the same kind of innovation internally to help our colleagues do their jobs more easily.","This year we implemented a paperless claims process in our insurance business. We began to digitize our back office processing and we launched TD Apps, an internal app store that allows colleagues to download capabilities on to their mobile devices simplifying a range of tasks. I look forward to providing more updates on our front and back office innovations in future quarters.","To wrap up, I'm proud of what we achieved in 2016 and excited about our opportunities next year. I would like to thank our 80,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication in making TD the better bank as well as our clients and customers for the opportunity to serve them.","I would also like to thank our investors and shareholders who have supported us on several landmark debt and preferred share deals this year and who have reflected a strong performance in an all-time high for our stock price. We appreciate your confidence and we are committed to continue executing on our long-term strategy and delivering strong shareholder returns.","With that, I will turn things over to Riaz.","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you, Bharat. Good afternoon, everybody. Please turn to Slide 4. In 2016 the bank reported earnings of $8.9 billion and EPS of $4.67. Adjusted earnings were $9.3 billion and adjusted EPS was $4.87 both up 6% year-over-year.","Revenue increased 9% in across all of our segments led by volume growth. Expenses increased 4% or 2% on an adjusted basis, excluding currency and acquisitions, resulting in 200 basis points of operating leverage. PCL increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting volume growth, provisions related to oil and gas exposures and the impact of foreign exchange. Most of the increase occurred in the first half of the year as loss rates have since stabilized.","Canadian Retail and U.S. Retail delivered net income of $6 billion and $3 billion for the year respectively, while wholesale reported over $900 million in earnings.","Please turn to Slide 5. This quarter the bank reported earnings of $2.3 billion and EPS of $1.20. Adjusted earnings are $2.3 billion up 8% and adjusted EPS was $1.22 up 7% year-over-year. Adjusted revenue increased 6% excluding FX and acquisitions led by volume growth and adjusted expenses increased 5% excluding FX and acquisitions resulting 100 basis points of operating leverage.","Expenses ticked up this quarter raising seasonality as well as investments in our business and infrastructure. These investments will continue into fiscal 2017 and as a result, expense growth is expected to be higher on a year-over-year basis in the first half of the year, particularly in our retail businesses.","PCL decreased 1% quarter-over-quarter, segment reported earnings were $1.5 billion for Canadian retail, approximately Canadian $700 million for U.S. Retail and $238 million for wholesale. The corporate segment reported a loss of $138 million or $94 million on an adjusted basis.","Please turn to Slide 6. Canadian Retail segment net income was $1.5 million, an increase of $6 million as we earn through margin compression in Canadian personal banking, higher expenses a higher effective tax rate in insurance and increased provisions for credit losses.","Total loan growth was 5% year-over-year with increases in personal lending and business lending volumes. Deposit increased by 10% reflecting growth in core checking, savings and business deposits and wealth assets grew 10%.","Insurance claims decreased reflecting more favorable prior claims development and less severe weather conditions in the quarter. Margin was stable down only one basis point quarter-over-quarter and PCLs were also relatively stable increasing 2% quarter-over-quarter.","Expenses increased 5% year-over-year as a result of business growth, including investment in claims facing advisors, volume related expenses, branch optimization and initiative to modernize our platforms and digitize the client experience all partially offset by productivity savings.","Please turn to Slide 7, U.S. retail earnings were US$536 million, up 9% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. The U.S. Retail bank earned US$465 million up 14% on an adjusted basis from the fourth quarter last year. Results for the quarter reflected revenue growth on higher loan and deposit volume, good credit quality and strong operating leverage.","Total loan growth is 11% year-over-year reflecting growth in both personal loans and business loans and deposits increased by 9%. Margin was down one basis point quarter-over-quarter, reflecting good deposit growth, while manufactures affect margins, we expect continued improvements in 2017 with potential upside if U.S. rates increase. PCL increased 12% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting seasonal increases in the auto lending and credit card portfolios. ","Adjusted expenses increased 5% year-over-year, reflecting business initiatives including store optimization, the impact of additional FDIC surcharges, seasonality, volume growth and investments in front-line employees, partially offset by productivity saving. Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade decreased 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher operating expenses, partially offset by favorable tax items in the quarter.","Please turn to Slide 8. Net income for wholesale was $238 million up 21% year-over-year on higher revenue, lower PCL and some favorable tax items this quarter, partially offset by higher compensation expenses. Revenue increased 11% reflecting higher origination activity in debt and equity capital markets and higher fixed income trading, partially offset by lower equity trading and advisory fees. PCL was $1 million and down year-over-year reflecting specific oil and gas provisions in the prior year.","Please turn to Slide 9. The corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of $94 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of $161 million in the same period last year. Net corporate expenses increase year-over-year, largely due to ongoing investments in enterprise and regulatory projects.","The contribution from other items increased $90 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting higher revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activity, some favorable tax items in the current quarter and higher provisions for incurred but not identified credit losses in the prior year.","Please turn to Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.4% at the end of the fourth quarter. Organic capital growth was offset by increased risk-weighted assets and pension valuations. The higher RWA's reflect growth in business volumes, the effects of Basal 1 floor and the temporary capital impact of rating downgrades to certain student loan asset back securities in our investment portfolio, which may continue. We remain very comfortable with the credit quality of the portfolio.","Our leverage and liquidity ratios are consistent with last quarter's level. Overall I'm happy with our financial performance this year. Our results reflected strength of our franchise model and diversified business mix and we are well-positioned to continue growing our businesses and meeting the needs of the evolving regulatory and capital environment.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you, Riaz and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11. Credit was strong throughout the year continuing into the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross impaired long formations are down three basis points or $111 million driven by reductions in U.S. Legacy interest only HELOC formations.","For the quarter, gross impaired loan formations are flat at $1.2 billion or 21 basis points. U.S. retail formations are up $65 million due to seasonal trends in the credit card portfolio and the negative impact of foreign exchange. There were no new formations in the wholesale portfolio.","Turning to Slide 12; gross impaired loans ended the year at $3.5 billion stable at 58 basis points on both the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. The U.S. retail gross impaired loans are up $101 million in the quarter, primarily driven by seasonal trends in the credit card portfolio and the negative impact of foreign exchange. The increase was partially offset by a $48 million decrease in wholesale gross impaired loans due to resolutions in the oil and gas sector.","Moving on to Slide 13, as indicated in previous quarters, U.S. strategic card PCL are reported on a net basis for segment reporting, including only the bank's contractual portion of credit losses. For the purpose of the credit slides, we continue to report gross losses to better reflect portfolio credit quality.","The full-year loss rate is 41 basis points, up seven basis points from 2015, driven by credit losses for exposures impacted by low oil and gas prices, reserve build for incurred, but not identified credit losses in the retail and nonretail portfolios and the negative impact of foreign exchange.","Provisions for credit losses were $554 million for the quarter, down two basis points quarter-over-quarter to 37 basis points. The primary factors impacting PCL in the quarter were reductions in reserve build, offset by a $35 million increase in U.S. retail PCL driven by seasonal trends in the credit card and auto portfolios.","Moving to Slide 14, we\u2019re continuing to see improvement in the performance of our oil and gas producer and services portfolios as evidenced by resolutions in some of our impaired loans attributable in part to the recent stabilization and prices and more positive market tone.","Consumer losses in oil impacted regions are stable and continue to be offset by favorable performance in the rest of Canada. To conclude, the key takeaways for the quarter are credit quality remained strong, the credit impact associate with low oil and gas prices continues to moderate and we are well-positioned for continuing growth going into 2017.","With that operator, we are now ready to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could start with your comments around growth outlook for the U.S. as you look into 2017. And I was wondering if you can provide some color around what areas do you expect U.S growth to really maybe pick up in 2017 or probably stay the same as we've seen in 2016?","Mike Pedersen","Yes, so it's Mike. So we\u2019ve obviously seen very good revenue growth in the U.S. this year and based on what I see right now, I expect that to continue, but I expect our volumes to continue to be strong. I also expect our margins to increase based on what we\u2019re seeing.","It\u2019s possible we'll see a bit of moderation in categories like commercial and auto finance lending, but not seeing that yet. There are some signs that there's a bit of pricing pressure in some of those sectors. So that may adjust our flows a bit but broadly speaking, I expect good growth across the categories that have produced good growth this year with improving margins.","The fee growth will be I think also robust with the caveat that we made a move this year to time order posting for overdraft charges and that\u2019s had an effect this year and we\u2019ll see the full year effect of that in 2017 and then I would say that all of which I had -- all of what I\u2019ve just said is assuming no rate increases. If there is a rate increase that\u2019s upside to what I\u2019ve said.","Ebrahim Poonawala","And do care to quantify what that upside could be if we get maybe multiple rate hikes at the short end in the U.S. next year?","Mike Pedersen","No. The comments that Bharat and Riaz have made with respect to the upside, includes our assumptions of what that'll be, but we\u2019re not disclosing anything more than that.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Understood and if I can quickly ask question just in terms of capital I guess to Riaz, if you can remind us in terms of what the targeted capital ratio is? If I recall correctly, Scottrade is going to consume about 30 basis points of CET1. So where do you want that ratio to be as we think about ending 2017?","Riaz Ahmed","Ebrahim, the way I look at capital is you were well above the minimums that are required and when we look at the risk factors in our bank I feel very comfortable with capital ratio where it is. I don't generally tend to run any particular target in my mind about capital.","We look at our surplus capital position and determine its best use from time-to-time, which can be prioritized by way of funding growth and then with which could include potential acquisitions and then returning capital to the shareholders.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Understood. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","We will go next to Gabriel Dechaine with Canaccord.","Gabriel Dechaine","Good afternoon. Also a question on the capital, we saw this disclosure for the first time, that the impact of the regulatory floor $5 billion increase in RWAs, that kind of popped up and I believe that's in relation to the impact of Basal 1 floors on your AIRB, RWAs that were recently transitioned in the U.S. Is that correct first of all?","Bharat Masrani","Yes that would be correct, Gabriel. As you know what every Basel III compliant bank has to do is calculate its risk weighted assets using internal risk-based model and compare that against the risk weighted assets that it would calculate under the old Basel I framework and the benefits that one can draw from moving to internal risk based models is capped by reference to this floor.","And when you have a low-risk bank like ours, you would expect that we would get that at some point and you'll remember that in the last quarter, we transitioned our U.S. retail portfolio from standardized to internal risk based methodologies as well. So no surprise that at some point we would get to this floor.","Gabriel Dechaine","I'm a little bit dumb on this. I guess why would this happen so soon and I've never seen anything like this from Canada like for example real estate secured loans are risk weighted anywhere between 10% to 15% depending on the bank and standardize is 35%.","I'm just cherry picking an example, but I've never seen an impact from these floors having an effect on the banks and then what's the difference and then why is it happening, why did this happen so soon after your AIRB transition in the U.S.?","Bharat Masrani","Well I think the calculation Gabriel is in relation to the entire balance sheet and so you know that Canadian portfolio is transitioned some years ago. So we have a certain amount of the balance sheet that is risk weighted using internal risk based models and some that is risk weighted using standardized models.","And the process of movement from standardized to risk based models includes development of internal data and capabilities and models, which then get approved by the regulators and then once the regulators are satisfied with them, you implement them.","So the fact that we introduced U.S. retail model in Q3 was just one aspect of our balance sheet that transitioned in Q3. So I don\u2019t think you should take away from that that the effect was so soon. But it is an effect that low risk banks would feel faster than high risk banks.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. My next question is rate related and I've seen you raise prices on mortgages this quarter as of other banks and I'm wondering what that does to and we've seen the five year rate increase as well. I am wondered what that does to your margin outlook for the Canadian business in particular.","And then pursuant to that, if it's not going to cause your margins to go up, what kind of rate increases do we need to see for this margin issue to kind of dissipate materially and how long does that take to go through your tractors I guess?","Teri Currie","So it's Teri. Just on margins in general and then talk about rest as we go through, so obviously we have the highest absolute margins in Q4. We were flat in CAD P&C and as you mentioned we had the benefit of our factoring strategy and acquisitions over the last several years, but we can't outline interest rates and to your point, that takes a few years to work its way through.","Because we have a majoritively fixed rate, mortgage portfolio and very large and growing, fixed rate mortgage portfolio, reserve portfolio overall, we are more differentially impacted.","We expect as we look ahead to 2017 that that margin compression that we've experienced this year will moderate over the full year. There will be bumpiness in quarters, but we should expect it to moderate in the next year and obviously when you look at the re-pricing, when the re-pricing is only for new originations or renewals, that takes a bit of time to work its way through the mortgage book.","Gabriel Dechaine","All right. But there is no ballpark, rates have to go up by X before we start to see margins increasing in Canada again.","Teri Currie","We don\u2019t have something like that to talk about.","Riaz Ahmed","I think in relation to one part of that which is factoring strategy that you talked about Gabriel, what you have to do is look at what five to seven year swap rates might be doing today compared to what they might have been five to seven years ago. So I think you have to look at what rate are you coming off and at what rate are you going on.","And so you'll see that the swap rates today are still lower than what they might have been historically and that will give you an indication of where rates need to be.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. Thank you. And Mark didn't say limit yourself to one question. So I asked a couple.","Mark Chauvin","Okay. No issues.","Operator","We will go next to Meny Grauman at Cormark Securities.","Meny Grauman","Hi good afternoon. Just wanted to better understand your revision to your growth targets for the Canadian Retail business and I think Bharat you mentioned the yield curve, but I'm wondering is this change just driven by the outlook for margins or is there something else as well that is causing this via reappraisal?","Teri Currie","So it's Teri. I will take it. If you recall when we had our Investor Day there were a couple of rate increase embedded in that target that we set and obviously the context has changed both around that and around real estate secured lending, since the time that we had Investor Day. So those are the two main factors that have caused us to change the outlook.","Having said that, next year's outlook I would say you should expect similar growth in loan and deposit books for CAD P&C. You should expect again as I said compression in margins moderating. Expenses will be elevated as has been said in the first half of the year and you take that together with PCL's growing largely in line with the volume growth of our businesses and you should expect better performance from CAD P&C next year.","Meny Grauman","On the expense front, if I look at sort of the run rate savings that you're looking for from your restructuring announcements it definitely looks at the lower end of the peer group and you've talked about it before, but I'm wondering given the upward pressure you're seeing on expenses, why not be more aggressive in terms of restructuring into next year? I guess the question is are you contemplating in light of this outlook maybe taking more restructuring charges?","Riaz Ahmed","I don\u2019t think so Meny there. What I would say to you is you have to look at, what we said in 2015 when we took the restructuring charges that we would get productivity benefits that we would reinvest and so if you look at 2016 for the whole year ex the impact of currency and acquisitions, our expense growth rate was in the mid-2s.","And within that envelope, we made some very significant investments in the items that I talked about earlier. So I don\u2019t think that you should see that as pressure on expenses. I think you should see it as good expense management and delivering operating leverage this year and making the investment that we feel are necessary to make.","So I think you can continue to expect that we will do that and that it may result in occasional quarter bumpiness in expenses, but that doesn\u2019t bother me too much.","Meny Grauman","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Sumit Malhotra with Scotia Capital.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks, good afternoon. A couple of sensitivity questions and I want to go back to something you gave us, it's been a few years now and I'll direct this to Riaz and he can send it to long appropriately.","The rate sensitivity, the bank had given us the net interest income sensitivity, the changes in rate increments both at the short and long end of the curve and you had gone as far as to break that up geographically. Just because it has been a few years and obviously the composition and size of the balance sheet has changed, are you in a position to update those numbers?","Riaz Ahmed","So Sumit, what we gave in Q2 2013 was an illustration to give you a perspective on how our bank thought about asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity. I don\u2019t intend to update that as a guidance matter on an ongoing basis because a fair bit of it you could reasonably expect would be proprietary to us.","But to your point lot has changed. The deposit look growth, your currency has an impact at geographical mix of our deposits plays a role. How much of your rates are -- deposits are floating versus fixed. So there is a number of assumptions that go into that.","But I think what you can take away is that we are a deposit heavy bank and therefore as interest rates go up as you would expect our deposit margins would widen and the impact of which I would refer you to Bharat's outlook remarks for you to get a perspective on how we think about it.","Sumit Malhotra","And it's still the short end of the curve. I think it's fair to say that's more beneficial to the bank from a net interest income perspective. Is that correct, am talking sense?","Riaz Ahmed","The yield curve steepens, if the yield curve steepens very substantially, then the longer side of the curve could overwhelm the shorter end of the curve. So that's why -- that's what I mean that it's subject has so many assumptions that you really have to build your model to kind of get to that perspective on how you would view different bank's profiles.","Sumit Malhotra","Okay. I may follow up with you offline on that. The second one -- last one for me is on your tax rate in the U.S. it's obviously with the aftermath of the Presidential Election, there has been a lot of focus on corporate tax rates. TD's tax rate in the U.S. banking segment has averaged about 17% for few years now.","And I recall the bank telling us that, that lower rate had to do with some of the -- some certain programs that you participated in. If there was to be a meaningful corporate tax rate reduction in the U.S., given where you're being taxed into this segment, would you benefit in a material way or is your tax rate where it stands right now already as good as it gets for the bank in the U.S.?","Riaz Ahmed","I think Sumit the way you should think about that is the tax rate is established by reference to statutory rates that are in place at the time and then there is deducts from that. So for example as an example we participate in various community reinvestment activities that are subject to tax credits etcetera and so those tend to be deductions that get you to your effective tax rate. So if the overall tax rate would reduce, then yes we would have benefits come up.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks for your time.","Operator","We will go next to Peter Routledge with National Bank Financial.","Peter Routledge","Hi thanks. Just a question on the impact, potential impact of the proposed changes to housing finance, specifically on your funding strategy in Canada if these are set itself out as having pretty advanced and innovative funding approach that certainly capitalized on the housing planned system as it existed and it's changing. Big picture question, how does it change your funding strategy, particularly lending risk sharing?","Riaz Ahmed","I think that you are correct that we took our mortgage portfolios and securitized them and fund and use them. So what we are doing now is just continuing to diversify our funding strategies using more global markets and more products such as covered bonds in order to create new funding strategies and of course Longbow has had a very strong balance sheet management programs, so that we can experience the benefits of having some of the best rating and keeping our name in demand.","So that's an aspect of our treasury funding strategy that we spend a lot of time and spend a lot of time with our fixed income investors to make sure that we're creating continuous attract and being an attractive name out there and as you know that allowed us to crack the U.S. dollar subordinated debt market this year in a very attractive way. So we're just resorting to more traditional methodologies and maintaining our innovation and focus on this area.","Peter Routledge","Absent yield curve changes to the shift in strategy either increase your funding cost or make them more volatile?","Riaz Ahmed","Probably a little bit of both because you are going to more traditional market methodologies and global markets. So the covered bond market is a helpful source of stability. So you would see that our -- that you would see some increase in cost of funds which is partly also the margin compression story we\u2019ve been talking about.","And you always want to be more careful with the volatility that the global markets would pose. So we do have fair bit of -- we\u2019re very active in funding and making sure that we're funding our balance sheet well in advance of needs.","Peter Routledge","And just final related question on NHA MBS balances. So, these would be your balances on balance sheet, which I believe qualifies high-quality liquid assets under the LCR. Those balances may shrink. They just may not be as much NHA MBS, is this -- does this pose an additional headwind for your margin again absent any other change or do you think it's just nominal?","Riaz Ahmed","No, I think that this is more an issue for the global industry about availability of HQ and the eligible assets. So you\u2019ve seen banks pick up more of their balance sheet in sovereign and treasury bonds. So I think it's more a matter of managing your liquidity than anything else.","Peter Routledge","But if you had set $35 billion in NHA MBS you had $25 billion, that wouldn't materially impact your all bank margin?","Riaz Ahmed","I just have to substitute other low investments to maintain the liquidity yes.","Peter Routledge","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Sohrab Movahedi with BMO Capital Markets","Sohrab Movahedi","Hey, thank you. A couple of numbers question maybe for Mark and then a broader one for Bharat. Mark, what\u2019s the percentage of your nonconforming mortgages -- of the portfolio, what percentage of the portfolio with nonconforming mortgages, call it defined as non-residents newcomers and self employees, what percentage would that be?","Mark Chauvin","It would be roughly 1% on the existing portfolio.","Sohrab Movahedi","Perfect and then just a quick follow-up on that one as well, if I look at your, if I asked you to tell me what you would review to be the higher risk end of your mortgage portfolio by LTV and Beacon scores some sort of a credit score, what would be the thresholds that you would use?","Bharat Masrani","Well, I think the idea of a Beacon score below 650 with a loan-to-value above 75% if you want to identify the high risk sector, that would be an appropriate way of looking at it, which I\u2019ve seen our peers have done, but I think that\u2019s a fairly traditional way of looking at it.","Sohrab Movahedi","And so what percentage of your portfolio would be in that bucket?","Bharat Masrani","Well, with no coincidence, around 1%. ","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay. Thank you. And I guess Bharat the broader question I would have is as you\u2019ve given us the outlook we have a feel for what Canadian Retail is going to do. I have a feel for what U.S. is going to do, if you were going to handicap the direction arrow on your ROE as a bank next year or next couple of years two, three years doesn\u2019t matter, is it pointing higher or is it flat or do you think it\u2019s still going lower.","Bharat Masrani","Sohrab, firstly on the -- as you said different segments, you have a sense for what our thinking is and for the overall bank, some of the indications out of the U.S. might talk about the growth in volumes and our business there. You see what's happening with the yield curve there. What's happening with the currencies. So that enhance my comment on we do have a chance to get into our 7% to 10% target that we had set out over the medium term.","Now on ROE, obviously with the percentage of the bank's earnings that come from the U.S. does impact our ROE so there could be some pressure from that perspective, but on the other hand, we are putting on very good risk adjusted businesses. We are happy with how we\u2019re tracking with our ROE given the type of business model that we run, the percentage of our business that is retail oriented versus not, the volatility that you experience out of TD is more predictable that\u2019s our view.","And if you put all those things together, we\u2019re happy with how we are tracking on the ROE, but you will see some bumpiness year-over-year depending on where our earnings growth is coming and where it may reverse so itself.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay. Maybe I've misunderstood it, but Mark, Mike Pedersen was talking a little bit about improvement in -- potential improvement in margins, not even factoring in any rate increases and the like, why wouldn't that be accretive to the U.S. segment's ROEs all else equal?","Riaz Ahmed","Sohrab, can I give you a technical answer.","Sohrab Movahedi","Yes, sure.","Riaz Ahmed","That you have a situation under current IFRS accounting rules where the goodwill gets translated as well. So what you're seeing in the ROE is essentially your earnings get translated and your capital gets translated and that translation adjustment as you know goes to shareholder's equity and therefore also raises your capital base.","So historical price that you paid for that goodwill from a currency perspective is irrelevant under the IFRS rules. So, if you see a stronger dollar, like if you had our rising U.S. earnings and your dollar was flat through your acquisition price, yes, your ROE would go up.","But as the U.S. dollar strengthens, you would have different impacts. So, that\u2019s what Bharat is telling you is that you have to look at the performance of the U.S. retail segment and U.S. dollars and then also look at the Canadian dollar translation of the goodwill in relation to the price that was originally paid and that's what causes that lumpiness.","Sohrab Movahedi","That's perfect. So absent Canadian dollar further depreciating against the U.S. dollar, in your scenario you would see an ROE improvement.","Mark Chauvin","Yes.","Bharat Masrani","Yes you would and just having said that for in Mike\u2019s business in U.S dollar terms when you measure it of course with improving margins and growth in our business and we are generating, very good what we call operating ROEs out of the U.S. so we're trying to -- we would see better ROEs within our U.S segment.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay and then outside of the U.S segment but at a total bank level, Terry has also talked about the stuff. Just generally speaking, how do you feel about the direction are on the ROE over the next two to three years.","Bharat Masrani","It\u2019s hard to put a particular number Sohrab, but our view is that ROE, as we put on more business over time, we should see improvements especially with some of the sentiment you see in the market with respect to what's happening in the U.S.","Over time we feel in Canada it will readjust to a more normal environment then what we\u2019ve seen recently and that should help our business. Apart from the margin you have also this issue in Canada where GDP growth is more muted and when is expected to continue for the next couple of years.","So all these factors would play a role in how the bank does, but having said all that, as I started answering the question that given our balance sheet, given the type of risk profile that we run in the bank, the type of volatility you experience out of TD we think our ROE is reflective of that and we're pretty happy with how we are performing.","Sohrab Movahedi","Thank you very much.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Bharat Masrani for closing remarks. ","Bharat Masrani","Thank you very much operator and again very happy with how TD has been able to deliver. Very good numbers for the years and this fiscal year end as well and I would like to take this opportunity once again to thank our nearly 80,000 colleagues around the world who continue to deliver for our customers as well as our shareholders.","And for folks on the phone, in case if you do not get together in the near term I wish you happy holidays and good health and we will see you in the new year. Thanks very much operator.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. We do thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the TD Bank Group's Q3 2019 Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Gillian Manning, Head of Investor Relations at TD Bank. Please go ahead, Ms. Manning.","Gillian Manning","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to TD Bank Group's third quarter 2019 investor presentation. We will begin today's presentation with remarks from Bharat Masrani, the Bank's CEO; after which, Riaz Ahmed, the Bank's CFO will present our third quarter operating results; Ajai Bambawale, Chief Risk Officer, will then offer comments on credit quality, after which we will invite questions from prequalified analysts and investors on the phone.","Also present today to answer your questions are Teri Currie, Group Head Canadian Personal Banking; Greg Braca, President and CEO, TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank; and Bob Dorrance, Group Head Wholesale Banking.","Please turn to slide 2. At this time, I would like to caution our listeners that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that there are risks that actual results could differ materially from what is discussed and that certain material factors or assumptions were applied in making these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation represent the views of management and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank's financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance.

Bharat will be referring to adjusted results in his remarks.","Additional information on items of note, the Bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q3 2019 report to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Gillian, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Q3 was another strong quarter for TD. Earnings rose 7% to $3.3 billion and EPS increased 8% to $1.79. All of our segments performed well in the quarter. We generated good revenue growth as customers entrusted us with more of their business. Expense growth moderated, resulting in positive operating leverage, and we continued to invest in our capabilities to serve our customers better, today and tomorrow.","These forward-focused investments are made possible by the strength of our business model. It has proven itself over time, delivering consistent earnings growth, anchored by a strong risk culture and robust balance sheet metrics. That includes a CET1 ratio that held steady at 12% this quarter after the repurchase of over 11 million common shares. This is a powerful testament to our ability to generate organic capital and an important source of strength and flexibility.","This impressive enterprise performance was built on positive results in each of our segments. Let me turn to them now. Canadian Retail had another good quarter in Q3, with earnings up 3% to $1.9 billion. Revenue growth was strong and the rate of expense growth slowed, contributing to positive operating leverage. We continued to elevate the customer experience, introducing a number of innovative solutions. In the Personal Bank, we launched an international remittance tool that allows TD customers to send money via Easy Web for cash payout at more than 500,000 Western Union locations around the world.","It's a simple and intuitive experience, leveraging our digital and money movement capabilities, a great example of working together as one TD to help our customers more particularly in the important New to Canada segment. TD Canada Trust also surpassed the 5 million mark for active mobile users this quarter, solidifying our leadership position as Canada's largest digital bank. In our wealth business, building on last quarter's Greystone Fund launches, we introduced a new real estate pooled asset trust for high net worth clients and seeded a global real estate fund. With these product innovations, we are staking out a leadership position in proprietary alternative offerings.","In the direct investing side, we refreshed our Learning Center with extensive online resources, including curated video-learning journeys and live online workshops. And in our insurance business, the TD Insurance app is now powered by the same technology behind TD for Me, our banking app's digital concierge. It offers enhanced content and location management capabilities, including the ability to direct customers to the nearest TD Insurance auto center.","Across our Canadian Retail franchise, we continue to win more business by making it easier for our customers to engage with us, whether it's giving people the ability to send money to family and friends around the world, equipping investors with investment choices and educational resources to build their wealth or providing support to drivers on the road, it's about being there for our customers when and where they need us and providing them with the advice and capabilities they need to feel more confident about their financial lives.","Turning to the U.S., earnings in our U.S. Retail bank rose 6% to USD 747 million this quarter. Revenue increased 4%, reflecting strong loan and deposit growth and higher fee income. We generated over 100 basis points of positive operating leverage and with the contribution from TD Ameritrade, up 17%, segment earnings increased 9% to USD 967 million, a new high. We also continued to invest in our core infrastructure and digital platforms to power the next generation of personalized, connected human experiences for all of our customers, including an active mobile user base that exceeds 3 million.","We launched a new digital mortgage offering to make the application process simpler, faster and easier. It combines self-serve tools for easier access with face-to-face guidance when customers want it, and it has reduced processing times, resulting in higher overall experience scores. We also delivered more convenience for customers who have accounts with both TD Bank and TD Ameritrade. They can now get an integrated view of their banking and investment accounts on TD's digital site and access their Ameritrade accounts from the TD website or mobile app, a better experience for our customers and another step forward in our strategic relationship with TD Ameritrade.","Our wholesale bank earned $244 million this quarter, up 9% from a year ago as higher trading-related revenue offset lower advisory and equity underwriting fees. Our U.S. dollar strategy continues to show steady progress. Since the beginning of the fiscal year and against the backdrop of softer industry-wide new issuance volumes, we gained market share. We're lead book runner on more than 100 U.S. investment-grade deals and more than doubled the number of U.S. ADS lead book runner mandates. We were active in the Green Bond space again this quarter, participating in 12 green or sustainable bond issuances, including joint leads on the World Bank's inaugural Euro mandate, KSW's first trailing green SSA offering of the year and LBBW's inaugural U.S. dollar green covered bond out of Europe.","TD Securities was named 2019 Canada Derivatives House of the Year by GlobalCapital for the second year in a row as well as Coming Force in SSA Bonds, reflecting the strides we made in building out our capital markets business. And for a second year in a row, we tied for first place in overall Canadian fixed income as a Greenwich Share Leader and Greenwich Quality Leader. These results demonstrate the success of our strategy to build long-term client relationships as well as our commitment to quality service and excellence in execution to deliver for our clients.","All-in-all, a good performance by our wholesale business as we continue to execute on our strategy to add scale and diversification to our client focused franchise dealer. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance at this stage of the year. Three quarters into fiscal 2019, EPS is up 6%, a good result given the uncertain macro environment and difficult start to the year in wholesale.","As you know macroeconomic uncertainties persist. Trade and geopolitical tensions continue to escalate. Central banks are cutting rates and yield curves have declined and remained inverted for long periods. However, our diversified retail focused model has demonstrated its resilience in a variety of operating environments. And with the investments we've been making to modernize our operations and increase our efficiency, we are well-positioned to continue meeting our customers' changing needs and delivering value for our shareholders.","As ever, we move forward united by our purpose to enrich the lives of our customer's, colleagues, and communities. They are at the heart of everything we do. We expressed our commitment to them in a variety of ways this quarter.","In July, we celebrated TD Thanks You, our annual Customer Appreciation Day. In particular we recognized small business banking clients who've shown exceptional dedication and service to their local communities. The work they are doing, promoting female entrepreneurship, children's health, sustainable food practices and employment opportunities for people with disabilities to cite just a few examples is an inspiration to us all.","We've always believed that we win the most customers at TD because we have the best people. So we were proud to be named one of the top three employers in this year's Indeed top-rated workplaces in Canada and to make a big move up in DiversityInc's Top 50 companies in the U.S. These rankings reflect many things, but above all a unique and inclusive employee culture.","That culture was on full display this summer as we celebrated Pride 2019 in Canada and World Pride in New York. Thousands of employees joined together for events in over 100 cities across North America in support of the LGBTQ2+ community, and we launched the second annual TD Ready Challenge, focused on better health one of four drivers of change we are supporting through the Ready Commitment, our corporate citizenship strategy.","This year's 10 grants of $1 million each will go to organizations that are helping improve access to early detection and intervention for disease with a goal of driving more equitable health outcomes for everyone.","To wrap up, I would like to thank our more than 85,000 people for their hard work and dedication. They live our purpose and shared commitments each day and truly bring the TD brand to life. I'm proud of what we've accomplished together and I look forward to a successful finish to the year.","With that, I'll turn things over to Riaz.","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you Bharat. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 7. This quarter, the Bank reported earnings of $3.2 billion and EPS of $1.74. Adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion and adjusted EPS was $1.79, up 8%. Revenue rose 6% with increases across all our business segments. Provisions for credit losses increased 3% quarter-over-quarter and expenses increased 5%, reflecting business growth and investments in strategic initiatives.","Please turn to slide 8. Canadian Retail net income was $1.9 billion, up 2% year-over-year, reflecting higher revenue and positive operating leverage. Adjusted net income increased 3%. Revenue increased by 6%, primarily reflecting volume growth and higher insurance and wealth fee-based revenue. Average loans increased 5% year-over-year and average deposits increased 3%, reflecting growth in both personal and business volumes.","Margin was 2.96%, down three basis points sequentially, reflecting a prior period refinement in revenue recognition assumptions in the Auto Finance portfolio and competitive pricing in term deposits.","Total PCL increased 13% quarter-over-quarter with increases in impaired and performing PCLs. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 29 basis points, up two basis points quarter-over-quarter. Expenses increased 6% reflecting higher costs supporting business growth and charges related to Greystone.","Please turn to slide 9. U.S. Retail net income was US$967 million, up 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and 9% on an adjusted basis. U.S. Retail Bank reported earnings rose 6% year-over-year on revenue growth of 4% and positive operating leverage.","Average loan volumes increased 6% year-over-year, reflecting growth in the personal and business customer segments. Deposit volumes excluding the TD Ameritrade sweep deposits were up 5% including 4% growth in core consumer checking accounts.","Net interest margin was 3.27%, down 11 basis points sequentially primarily due to lower deposit margins and balance sheet mix. Total PCL including only the Bank's contractual portion of credit losses in the strategic cards portfolio was US$191 million, up 12% sequentially as a decrease in impaired PCL was more than offset by an increase in performing PCL.","The U.S. retail net PCL ratio was 48 basis points up three basis points from last quarter. Expenses increased 3% year-over-year, reflecting business and volume growth and higher investments in business initiatives partially offset by productivity and elimination of the FDIC surcharge. The contribution from TD's investment in TD Ameritrade increased to US$220 million. Segment ROE was 12.9%.","Please turn to slide 10. Net income for wholesale was $244 million, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting higher revenue and partially offset by higher non-interest expenses and higher PCL. Revenue increased 13%, reflecting higher trading-related revenue, partially offset by lower advisory and equity underwriting fee. Expenses increased 12% reflecting continued investments in the global expansion of our U.S. dollar strategy and the impact of FX translation.","Please turn to Slide 11. The corporate segment reported a net loss of $173 million in the quarter compared to a net loss of $113 million in the same quarter last year. Net corporate expenses were lower year-over-year largely reflecting lower net pension expenses and lower enterprise projects in the current quarter.","Please turn to Slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 12% level with the prior quarter. We had strong organic capital generation this quarter which added 41 basis points to our capital position. This was mostly offset by the repurchase of over 11 million common shares in the quarter and growth in RWA.","Looking ahead to Q1 2020, we expect the implementation of IFRS 16 and the revised securitization framework to have a 20 to 30 basis point impact on CET1 capital which we expect will be mitigated by internal capital generation. Our leverage ratio was 4.1% and our liquidity coverage ratio was 132%.","I will now turn the call over to Ajai.","Ajai Bambawale","Thank you, Riaz and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide 13. The Bank's credit quality remained strong in the third quarter. Gross impaired loan formations were $1.46 billion or 21 basis points, stable quarter-over-quarter and up three basis points year-over-year.","Please turn to Slide 14. Gross impaired loans ended the quarter at $2.9 billion or 42 basis points, down six basis points quarter-over-quarter and down three basis points year-over-year. The Bank's $351 million quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross impaired loans, primarily reflects the sale of impaired loans in the U.S. commercial portfolio attributable to the power and utility sector and resolutions outpacing formations in the U.S. RESL portfolios, partially offset by higher impaired loans in the Canadian commercial and wholesale portfolios.","Please turn to Slide 15. Recall that our presentation reports PCL ratios both gross and net of the partner's share of the U.S. strategic card credit losses. We remind you that credit losses recorded in the corporate segment are fully absorbed by our partners and do not impact the Bank's net income. The Bank's PCLs in the quarter were $664 million or 38 basis points, stable quarter-over-quarter and up three basis points year-over-year.","Please turn to Slide 16. The Bank's impaired PCL was stable quarter-over-quarter reflecting credit migrations in the Canadian Retail and Wholesale segments, offset by a decrease in the U.S. Retail and Corporate segments. Performing PCL increased quarter-over-quarter, largely reflecting normal cost parameter updates in the Canadian and U.S. consumer lending portfolios.","In summary, as expected, we've seen some credit normalization this year in the Canadian consumer lending portfolios and the Bank's commercial lending portfolios. Overall, credit quality remained strong across the Bank's portfolios and we remain well-positioned for continued growth.","With that operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, your line is now open.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Good afternoon. I guess first question Riaz if you can talk about just the margin outlook in Canada and the U.S. given that the forward curve in both markets are pricing in rate cuts. I just would love to get your thoughts in terms of the magnitude of compression we should expect as we look out over the next year.","Riaz Ahmed","Ebrahim thank you. As you know in Canada, we've said before that margins will bump around for a variety of reasons. And while there are some very strong underlying economic fundamentals with employment and business investment clearly the -- Canada is going to be affected by what really happens in the U.S.","So -- and if we turn to the U.S. geography, the U.S. segment, again, on the ground as Greg will tell you, the activity is very good. We have a situation where employment is at record levels, consumer activity remains quite strong, and business investment is remaining quite positive and quite constructive. And you can see that in the -- in our performance in loan and deposit growth in the U.S.","But clearly there are main macroeconomic certainties that are kind of driving rate considerations and expectations that at some point perhaps, we may see the economy slow.","So, it's difficult really to give you any particular outlook on the rates because if it turns out that we might see trade uncertainties dissipate, we may see a return to greater macro confidence which would also help the underlying business conditions.","So, I think as a matter of general outlook I'd -- it'd be difficult to give you a forward outlook. But clearly if the forward curves do play out, we would expect to see some margin compression as a result of that. But then there are also mitigating factors that as interest rates come down you might obviously continue to see loan volumes grow faster and credit performance should be better. So, I think that's -- you can see some very mixed conditions depending on which scenario you wish to outline.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Understood. And the 11 basis points margin compression that we saw in the U.S. this quarter, was there anything one-off in there that might reverse itself next quarter? Or is the $327 million the right base to think about how the margin may trend from here?","Riaz Ahmed","It is the right base. There are no unusual items to point out in that Ebrahim. About half of that is driven by just the rate compression that I talked about earlier, and then the other half is due to balance sheet mix that materializes from continued volume growth.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Got it. Thank you. I'll requeue again.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steve Theriault from Eight Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Steve Theriault","I had a question on Canadian P&C, but first if I could just follow-up, Riaz, on the NIM. Appreciating there's -- you can think about a lot of different scenarios. Do you think it makes sense at all to look back at either what your margin was or the delta in the margin following the last couple or few rate hikes of 2017 and 2018, to help us gauge future movements? Or has mix changed or anything else changed to the point where that -- you don't think that's a useful way to think about it?","Riaz Ahmed","No. I think that, Steve, doing a little bit of trending is always useful in taking a look at how things would change under various scenarios and you can see the mix change in the balance sheet as well as we can, because the loans and deposits categories are indeed disclosed. So, I think, it would be useful to look at that trending, but you also have to keep in mind, as I mentioned earlier that forward -- if you take a forward-looking view, you also have to take into account what changes that might bring along with volumes.","Steve Theriault","Yes. That's fair. Thanks for that. And then -- so on Canadian P&C, Teri, for the most part FTE has been for the last, at least a couple of years, pretty range-bound between 27,000 and 28,000 and stripping -- and that's stripping away the wealth component, so just looking at the Appendix on the supplemental. But this quarter jumped to I think just under 29,000. Is there anything temporary in nature in terms of that spike or maybe if you could just give us a bit of color on what's going on in terms of FTE in your -- in that division?","Teri Currie","For sure. Thank you. So if you look at the kind of our strategy around continuing to be a leader in acquiring new customers and then the embedded growth opportunity in the franchise, we've been working through in branch banking, as I had mentioned before, our future-ready strategy, where that's really around ensuring that we're elevating the capabilities of our people in the branch network and adding client-facing advisors, both in my business and in Paul\u2019s business to meet the customer opportunity.","So as we're doing that, we're seeing that sort of steady climb of client-facing advisors that we're adding. We've also been investing in more mobile mortgage specialists, so you're seeing the growth of them. And then, as we're implementing new initiatives to help the client experience, some of which Bharat talked about earlier, is the number one digital bank in Canada, some of the investments we're making in that IT space or in those capabilities are contributing to the growth.","And then, finally, we've been adding in the operations and adjudication space as we've had strong growth in lending in the franchise, to ensure that we can get answers to our customers quickly when they make requests of us around loans, that's the most important thing to them, is helping them to understand what they can afford quickly, so that they can make their personal decisions. So in combination, those are the strategic investments we've been making in the business that have caused that increase in FTE.","Steve Theriault","Would you say there's upside from there as you can -- I think, your intention is to continue to hire more mobile bank specialists and so on. Would you -- and I mean and some of those things have been ongoing for a while, right? So -- ","Teri Currie","For sure. In this year, with the future-ready strategy, we've in particular been adding financial advisors in the branch network at an accelerated pace. We had last year a slower -- we had a slower pace coming into this year of -- we had more vacancies and then we were accelerating growth.","So you've seen some accelerated growth this year for financial advisors in the branch in particular. We will continue to add advisors and invest at a pace that makes sense to deliver both short-term and long-term growth. The pace would likely come down a little bit as we go into next year.","Steve Theriault","Thanks for that.","Teri Currie","Operator, do we have another call?","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Meny Grauman from Cormark Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Meny Grauman","I wanted to understand a little bit better what was driving the parameter updates that were pushing up the performing loan provisions. If you could highlight some of the key movers here?","Ajai Bambawale","Thanks. It's, Ajai. So I would say, we regularly and on an ongoing basis look at our models and look at our parameters across our books. And so, for this quarter basically, we updated our parameters for the consumer portfolio in Canada and the U.S. and there was a bit of an uptick because of that.","The uptick was in Canadian auto. There was an uptick certainly in Canadian cards. And then in U.S. cards, as well, particularly in the performing category. On the impaired side in the U.S., we actually saw a benefit. So really what these parameter updates are doing is, they are adjusting for underprediction or overprediction of PCLs. And they are sort of a onetime true-up. So it's pretty much normal course activity.","Meny Grauman","Okay. I guess, what I'm getting at is, we saw a big move in the yield curve over the last little while and higher probability of recession. I'm wondering if those factors or factors like that changed or get captured in the modeling for performing loan provisions.","Ajai Bambawale","Yes. We -- so we certainly consider macro changes, but the macro change impact, I would say, was slightly beneficial. So it's not -- macro is not driving this parameter-related increase.","Meny Grauman","And in terms of that net positive for macro factors, what's the key positives? I can think a lot of the negatives, but what would be the key positives?","Ajai Bambawale","So, good follow-up. So I would say that in Canada, we certainly updated our 2019 GDP numbers. There were slightly better employment numbers in Canada. And as you're aware, home prices are firming up as well. And in the United States for 2019 in particular, slightly -- growth for 2019 was updated. Those were really the drivers.","Meny Grauman","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert Sedran from CIBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Robert Sedran","Hello. Good afternoon. A question for Teri, please. I just -- I noticed the mortgage growth is starting to pick up a little bit after a period where HELOCs were definitely dominating the business mix. I know, you've kind of talked about this a little bit in the past, but is this reflecting more of a maturation of the new HELOC product or is there something -- a conscious decision to shift more business towards the mortgage product?","Teri Currie","Thank you. It's not -- I mean customer by customer, we will help them make the right decision about the mortgage product that makes sense for them or the RESL product that makes sense for them. And it is often the case that the hybrid HELOC product with its flexibility makes sense. We're seeing a little bit right now and just in terms of rates of people going to fix rate versus float and so that would explain a little bit of the mortgage growth. But, in general, really pleased with the continuing sort of 5% growth in total RESL and the investments we've made in that business.","Robert Sedran","Is that a kind of growth rate especially as Ajai noted the prices are affirming a little bit? Is that a rate of growth that you think is reasonable as we look out? I know it's difficult to look too far out but is 5% RESL growth something you're comfortable with continuing?","Teri Currie","We're certainly comfortable with the business that we have done and we've been at that sort of rate of growth over the last number of quarters as you know. There's lots of factors to consider but with the investments we've made in this business we've talked about kind of mid-single-digit growth in this business and that's certainly what we expect for this year.","Robert Sedran","Okay and thank you. And just to clarify, Riaz, when you were talking about that Canadian margin, it sounded like the decline in this quarter was more about the prior period than it was about this quarter, is that right?","Riaz Ahmed","Well, I think in both quarters, there were some adjustments that contributed to that. And so you're right most of the decline would be due to those items. Fundamentally would have been down one bp.","Robert Sedran","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Scott Chan from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott Chan","Good afternoon. I just wanted to go to Wholesale Banking and on the expense side. I guess for three straight quarters, it's been low double digits. And you called out Canadian investments in the global U.S. dollar strategy. Does that dissipate at some point? And should we expect expenses to normalize to a lower level?","Bharat Masrani","Yes, I think the run rate, as I've commented on the last couple of quarters that we're seeing this year overall which has been sort of in that $600 million level is what the steady state would appear to be. So as that plays out -- we've made a lot of investment in 2017 and 2018 and that's rolling through into 2019. That will reduce and I think the run rate where we are now we'll be at that level. So the year-over-year should come down then.","Scott Chan","Okay. Thanks. And just on the U.S. side. I just noticed some commercial, it was a bit light on the quarter. And I know it's just one quarter if we kind of compared to peers on the U.S. side. Was there something on the commercial side that you guys maybe pulled back on or should we expect this portfolio to still outpace personal going forward?","Greg Braca","Yes. I just want to make sure I confirm the question. You said you saw it as a bit light?","Scott Chan","The commercial on the U.S. side it was up 1% quarter-over-quarter. But still on a year-over-year basis it still outpaced personal, but if I kind of look across the peers\u2026","Greg Braca","Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure I was -- on a quarter-over-quarter between pay downs and movement and seasonality that's going to move around a bit. But I would say fundamentally, we've actually been seeing strong and very supportive C&I in overall commercial loan growth. Commercial loan growth for the quarter was roughly 7% all-in with commercial real estate. And if we went back just a couple of quarters ago, we would have been talking about more moderate rates of growth so it's good to see that we've actually been accelerating the growth in the C&I business over the last couple of quarters.","The market's been constructive we've been spending a lot of time on various strategies for middle market and the commercial bank and we think it's performing quite well right now.","Scott Chan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Doug Young from Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Doug Young","Thank you, and good afternoon. Just on the credit side. Wanted just two things I guess. There is an uptick in PCLs and growth impaired loan formations in Canadian Retail and hoping you can elaborate a bit on the drivers and I think in the MD&A there was a mention of insolvencies or whatnot. So I was hoping you can unpack that. And then the second thing on credit there was a reversal in performing loan PCLs in capital markets. I originally thought it was to do with PG&E but, I guess, that's actually in the U.S. Retail. So just wanted to understand what that reversal in performance loan PCLs and capital markets was related to. Thank you.","Ajai Bambawale","Thanks for the questions. So first on Canadian impaired. Yes, there's an uptick. I'd say a fair bit of that is commercial. And really what's occurring in commercial, we are moving off some very low numbers. And it's across 4-5 industries 4-5 borrowers, so, again, off low numbers but that's part of the numbers. And then I would say in the rest of the book the personal book there is an uptick particularly in unsecured credit, some in other personal, some in cards. In other personal, it's driven by some seasoning that's occurring because there's some select risk expansion we did a couple of years ago and there is an uptick in insolvencies that's also reflected there.","And then the other category I'd call out is cards, again, a bit of an uptick because of insolvencies. And then the second part of your question on capital markets, again, the reversal there is largely model-driven. So we updated our ECL models in capital markets and so that's a model-related release.","Doug Young","And what was updated in the model that would have driven that\u2026","Ajai Bambawale","It's all the parameters that would drive the release.","Doug Young","Is there any one in particular, or is it just across the board?","Ajai Bambawale","It's across the board.","Doug Young","But doesn't it sound like in the Canadian Retail side, although, you note in your call out certain items it doesn't sound like they're concerning to you. Is that a fair statement?","Ajai Bambawale","Yes, because, again, we are moving off very low numbers. If you actually go back and look at Q3 of 2018 we were at 24 bps. We're at 29 bps now. So, overall, we're still operating within a very acceptable range. But, again, I will remind you we're late in the cycle and I do expect some gradual normalization in credit losses. I actually in our Q1 call did message that and it's actually turning out as expected.","Doug Young","I mean, would you say 29 basis points is normal or would you -- where would normalization land on the PCL rate for Canadian?","Ajai Bambawale","So good question. I don't think that's a number we disclose. But what I will tell you is that 25 to 30 still is a low number and normal would be higher than that.","Doug Young","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sumit Malhotra from Scotia Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks. Good afternoon. Start with a numbers related question for Teri in Canadian personal and commercial. Looking at your fee income line for the quarter, up 1% year-over-year and we didn't see the normal seasonal increase from Q2 to Q3, which at the very least the day count usually helps. Was there anything that depressed the fee number this quarter that was out of the ordinary that may be resulted in overall revenue a being a bit later?","Teri Currie","Thank you. So there were a couple of items this quarter and a couple of items last year that would represent a couple of points in the other income. So that would definitely be part of the story there. So think of it more like 3% to 4% growth.","And then I'd say just to comment on the business itself, really strong core checking and savings growth at over 4% and retail card sales up 2%, so maybe a little bit lower but certainly good momentum there. And we're still looking forward to the Air Canada partnership in the future.","Couple of small items. Mortgage discharge fees were a little bit lower I think that's probably timing. And our wealth referral fees were a little bit lower. And as we've gone through this change in the branch banking network I think that's just really a function of the change we're going through and it's not something that worries me. I'd say there's been a good trend on other income and expect good business growth going forward.","Sumit Malhotra","The 3% to 4% in your view is a more reasonable run rate expectation?","Teri Currie","Certainly. We've seen good growth momentum and would continue to expect to see that.","Sumit Malhotra","Thank you. And then across the border to U.S. personal and commercial for Greg. I think both in this quarter and also nine months -- over nine months, your expense growth in the business is 3%. Off the top Bharat mentioned the many initiatives that are underway in terms of technological spend and the offering to customers.","When we take into account some of the comments on the rate backdrop and what that might mean for revenue, how are you thinking about your level of investment spend and expense growth of the business? Is 3% a reasonable level that you can keep or is it perhaps a little bit low in light of some of those investments that were discussed?","Greg Braca","Well, maybe just backward looking I'll start with that. I think we've tried to strike the right balance and you've seen that bump around quarter-over-quarter just in 2019 from first quarter to second quarter to third. And just given the nature of the business, you'll probably continue to see that bump around from quarter-to-quarter.","I do think it's part of the art as much as anything is how do we strike the right balance with making sure that we are building the digital bank for the next decade that we are making the right investments that we're investing in frontline facing capabilities and employees in digital. And quite frankly I think you're seeing that in the growth numbers play out real-time both in terms of the consumer bank, small business, the commercial bank and things we're doing around our wealth business. That is certainly -- we spent a lot of time and energy building the capabilities around that in the U.S. And a lot of these capabilities didn't exist, five, seven, eight and certainly 10 years ago.","So do I think we're getting the right balance right? I think we are. I would also say that we're also trying to make sure we're as efficient as possible. So we've talked before about BAU business as usual expenses versus build the bank and making sure we're making those right investments. So how we\u2019re getting cost out, how are we digitizing the bank and using new tools and capabilities just as important. I think that narrative has to continue to play out. And we're going to be mindful of getting that balance right going forward.","Sumit Malhotra","How does that balance off your -- how does that balance take into account that fact that for a period of time your net interest income, which is obviously the bulk of your revenue is growing at double digits and now it's half of that in this new world order for interest rates. Does that balance -- getting that balance right allow you to slow the level of investment spend or is some of that expenditure already in the pipeline and set in stone so to speak?","Greg Braca","Well, the good news is that you've heard us talk about a number of investments that we've made over the last few years in platforms in terms of capability in building the infrastructure. We think that is awfully important and I think that's true. But we will continue to make want to make investments going forward and we're going to have to balance the environment we're in.","And I think the leading organizations that get this right will be the ones that just don't fold up the tent because the environment they're in that they are still able to find the headroom by freeing up capacity or being efficient in other areas to make sure there are investing in their priorities. So we shouldn't kid ourselves that the environment gets more difficult or the slope of the curve continues the way it is, we're going to have to be smarter around that going forward.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Nigel D'Souza from Veritas Investment. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Nigel D\u2019Souza","Thank you. Good afternoon. I had two quick questions. The first is to circle back on a point you made earlier. I believe I got it correctly, the impairments that you were seeing on the Canadian commercial book that was driven by multiple accounts. And if I look in your -- or multiple sectors and if I look in your supplement, I see automotive, construction, metals and mining, and oil and gas. Am I identifying the right sectors here that drove that? And is it correct that it wasn't driven by a single account, it was driven by a few sectors?","Ajai Bambawale","Yes. You're absolutely right. Its a few borrowers across auto, industrial, other services. You'd see a few dollars in metals. I think there's a bit in retail. So, there's no single borrower and there's no real theme. I'd say these are more idiosyncratic issues.","Nigel D'Souza","Okay. So, that was my second follow-up. So, you still view it as idiosyncratic at this point in the cycle.","And the second question I had and this is a more specific one and it's last one. For the commentary, you had on your updates to your modeling expect you've probably lost models under IFRS 9 for performing loans. I just wanted to check in with you whether those model updates and the true-up did it include a change or update in your scenario weightings? In other words are you weighting the adverse scenario more? Have you changed that? And is that expected to change given the current conditions?","Ajai Bambawale","Yes. So, we look at our scenario weighting every quarter as part of our governance. We did not change our scenario weightings for this quarter. Having said that, we believe we have an adequate weighting on the downside and our probability weighted allowance continues to be higher than our baseline.","Nigel D'Souza","Okay, that's really useful insight. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Gabriel Dechaine from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead, your line is now open.","Gabriel Dechaine","Good afternoon. Couple of questions around the U.S. business. I'm sorry if I missed it, but the margin guidance for the U.S. did you provide any for the near term? And if not could you tell me what the impact of the Fed rate cut will be on Q4 margins given that it took place at the end of the quarter? And I've got a follow-up broader more interesting I hope.","Greg Braca","Gabriel, it's Greg. Thanks for the questions. No, we did not provide guidance. If you missed the earlier part of the call and what our view is around net interest margin going out. But we did cover off that obviously the Fed rate cuts and the general slope of the curve is generally not favorable. And our quarter-over-quarter number that you saw us down 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter is a combination of lower short-end rates in front-running the actual Fed rate cuts we saw in the market as well as balance sheet mix. So, that's how I'd answer that from a quarter-over-quarter perspective.","Gabriel Dechaine","In another way would you expect the linear relationship in your margin vis-\u00e0-vis Fed rate cuts plural or does it moderate over time because that's what another bank is saying?","Greg Braca","Yes. So, I think what we've talked about in the past is what it means on the way up. On the way down all things being equal on the short end of it from a spot number, just with U.S. retail bank I'm talking about now in U.S. dollars for every 25 basis points of cut is worth roughly $90 million pretax.","Riaz Ahmed","And Gabe it should be -- as Greg qualified that all things being equal, you should do the same book and if you're dealing with the same float mix of the book it should be linear.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. And my broader question. This issue combined with Ameritrade let's say because their revisions have been pretty substantially negative reflecting there a more challenging growth outlook as well.","The combination of your U.S. business and Ameritrade has been at least 20% if not more of your growth over the past few years. How does the possible slowdown in these businesses affect your confidence in the 7% to 10% growth maybe roll that out over the next year as well perspective-wise?","Riaz Ahmed","Gabe what I'd tell you is that first of all when you look at the U.S. Retail businesses over the course of the last three or four years you're quite right in pointing out that they have been fabulous for us and for delivering the franchise growth.","Now, what we look at in terms -- the winning strategy for us over the years have been that we've built a franchise that is focused on delivering its customers' need and we underwrite consistently through various cycles and therefore pick up market share. And sometimes when we've gone through down markets, you've actually seen TD do better.","So, I think if we focus on the right strategy, the macros will be what they will be. But as I've indicated earlier, when you see rates coming down there can be a number of offsetting factors in volumes or the economy does a little bit better. You can see better credit performance. And you might see for example in brokered spaces that cash on IDA balances, et cetera might actually increase. So, there can be some very good mitigating effects of rate declines.","Gabriel Dechaine","I'll leave it there. Thank you. Have a good long weekend. ","Riaz Ahmed","You too.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Darko Mihelic from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is now open.","Darko Mihelic","Actually just as a follow-up to that. Maybe just -- I mean I get idea A, balances may go up, but I guess the -- does the yield pickup that you have when the five-year U.S. dollars swap rate is over 150? I guess it's below that now. How does that factor into the numbers going forward? Is that just something that falls off slowly and gradually over the next few quarters? And am I right in thinking it's about $100 million or so of revenue?","Riaz Ahmed","You are correct, Darko, in saying that when those revenue sharing arrangements that go with interest rates come into play, they do play out over the course of the tractoring strategies that are undertaken. So it is a gradual slope up and therefore a gradual slope down. As to the quantification of it, we have not disclosed that before and I think you will be quite able to calculate it all off the public disclosures.","Darko Mihelic","Yes. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just a question for Ajai. On slide 16, I appreciate that the parameter updates on the U.S. portfolio was in the cards. The corporate, though, shows performing as negative. I mean, can you just help me understand? That's the partner share right? So just maybe -- ","Ajai Bambawale","That\u2019s right. So, again, parameter updates can impact portfolios differently. So what was happening on the strategic cards is -- so keep in mind, parameter updates are adjusting for either underprediction or overprediction. So if we were overpredicting impaired, for instance, in strategic cards is correcting for that. If we were -- if we're underpredicting performing then we'd correct for performing. So we actually saw benefit in strategic cards, because there were some overprediction.","Darko Mihelic","Okay. And we're going into the seasonal pick up in PCLs, I suppose, because of the indirect auto and credit cards in the U.S. Is there reason to think that this year it'll be different? And in terms of magnitude, like, should we be sort of expecting a similar normal sort of pickup in PCLs in Q4 for the cards and auto portfolio in the U.S.?","Ajai Bambawale","Yes. So, I did give you some guidance for the full year, which was 40 to 45 basis points. And I do expect for the full year, we'll be nearer the higher end of the range. And I'd say, the main reason for that, I mean, three quarters have played out is because U.S. tends to be high from a -- because of seasonality. So, I think, you should look at basically history to see where that number will be, but Q4 tends to be a high number for us.","Darko Mihelic","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sohrab Movahedi from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sohrab Movahedi","Thanks. Ajai, you're a good guide to go to again. Just a quick question. Are you -- I know, there's been lots of investments on the technology side, but from risk management and collections in particular, are you adequately staffed or are you adding to your staff?","Ajai Bambawale","Yes. So what I would tell you is that, we've done a very comprehensive downturn readiness assessment across the bank and we're continuing to invest in areas including collections, both from a technology perspective and certainly, I'd say, from an FTE perspective we would ramp-up again depending on the situation. I don't think we'd ramp-up too much in advance, but we'll certainly have a plan on how to deal with it.","Sohrab Movahedi","So in other words, you haven't ramped up right now in that from a collections perspective?","Ajai Bambawale","I think, we're adequately staffed right now.","Sohrab Movahedi","You're adequately staffed, okay. And Teri, do you think you can generate operating -- positive operating leverage next year?","Teri Currie","So, we've talked about this year. Our goal over the medium term is to deliver positive operating leverage and we expect to do that for this year.","Sohrab Movahedi","Too early to talk about next year, is that right?","Teri Currie","I think, my friends around the table would say yes.","Bharat Masrani","Apart from that, Sohrab, this is Bharat Masrani. We've always said that we would like to continue to invest for the future. That's the hallmark of TD, that's how we create the franchise that we have, that's why you see the growth that you do.","There will be instances where we may not have positive operating leverage for a particular period, because we are not going to compromise on great opportunities to invest. But our general aspiration and I think you've heard us say this before, is to generate positive operating leverage. But we shouldn't focus too much on a particular period or quarter or a year even, if the right opportunities present themselves.","Sohrab Movahedi","Bharat, since I just got you, any updated thoughts around inorganic capital deployment?","Bharat Masrani","Inorganic. Generally, Sohrab, at TD there's no doubt that we are good at acquisitions. I think, we've showed that in our history. In fact a lot of the franchises we've built outside of Canada have come through that. So, obviously, if there is any compelling opportunity that presents itself, we will always look at it very seriously.","And in this current environment, with all these macro uncertainties, there's probably more opportunity that will present itself, depending on how long these uncertainties continue. So we will make sure that we look at all of those opportunities seriously.","Sohrab Movahedi","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. I would like to turn back the meeting over to Mr. Bharat Masrani.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, operator, and thank you to all of you for joining us this afternoon. Once again, as I do every quarter, because it is important, I would like to take the opportunity to thank our 85,000 colleagues around the world, who continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders every quarter. Really appreciate all the effort they put into delivering for our shareholders as well. Thank you and see you in 90 days.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now ended.

My name is Rudy Sankovic. I'm the Head of Investor Relations for the Bank. We will begin today's presentation with remarks from Bharat Masrani, our CEO; after which Colleen Johnston, the Bank's CFO will present our fourth quarter operating results. Mark Chauvin, Chief Risk Officer, will then offer comments on credit quality; after which we will entertain questions from those in the room and from pre-qualified analysts and investors on the phone.","Also present today to answer your questions are Tim Hockey, Group Head - Canadian Banking, Auto Finance and Wealth Management; Mike Pedersen, Group Head - U.S. Banking; Bob Dorrance, Group Head - Wholesale Banking; Riaz Ahmed, Group Head - Insurance, Credit Cards and Enterprise Strategy. Riaz is also responsible for the capital and treasury activities at the Bank.","Please turn to Slide 2. At this time, I would like to caution our listeners that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. There are risks that actual results could differ materially from what is discussed, and that certain material factors or assumptions were applied in making these forward-looking statements.","Any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation represent the views of management and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank's financial position, objectives and priorities, and anticipated financial performance. Forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for other purposes.","I'd also like to remind listeners that the Bank uses non-GAAP financial measures to arrive at adjusted results to assess each of its businesses and to measure the overall Bank performance. The Bank believes that adjusted results provide readers with a better understanding of how management views the Bank's performance. Bharat will be referring to adjusted results in his remarks.","Additional information on items of note, the Bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q4 2014 report to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Rudy, and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Colleen will be up shortly to discuss our fourth quarter results in detail, but let me start by sharing my thoughts on the quarter and the year as a whole.","Our fourth quarter was a solid quarter for TD. Earnings and EPS were up 3% year-over-year to $1.9 billion and $0.98 respectively. While the headline numbers appear to be a bit soft, the shortfall was due to several factors which Colleen will discuss.","Looking beyond these items, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, with healthy loan and deposit volumes, good growth in fee income, and lower credit losses offset by higher enterprise expenses and the margin pressure we signaled last quarter.","Turning to the full-year 2014, I'm very pleased with our performance. Total bank earnings exceeded $8 billion, up 8% from a year-ago, after adding back the insurance charge we took in 2013. And EPS rose 8% on the same basis to $4.27. Our Basel III capital position ended the year at a healthy 9.4%, and we delivered a 14% increase in dividends paid per share as well as a 20% total shareholder return for the fiscal year. These strong results were driven by great execution in all of our businesses.","Canadian retail performed very well in 2014, with earnings up 8% after adding back last year's insurance charge. In our personal and commercial banking business, loan and deposit volumes were strong and credit quality was excellent. Our wealth businesses had a banner year with direct investing maintaining its industry leadership position and our advice and asset management businesses achieving record levels of long-term fund sales in assets under management.","Insurance continued it's recovery from a tough year in 2013, and we achieved the number one ranking in credit card market share with the acquisition of exclusive Aeroplan Visa mass marketing rights and half of the Aeroplan Visa portfolio. I'm equally proud of the recognition we received for continuing to deliver legendary customer experiences from industry providers like J.D. Power and IPSOS, as well as customers in the broader public through their overwhelming response to our TD Thanks to You and more recent Make Today Matter campaigns.","Our U.S. retail bank also delivered good results in a challenging environment. U.S. personal and commercial banking net income reached nearly US$1.7 billion in fiscal 2014, up 5% from the previous year, an impressive performance given continued pressure on loan margins and US$234 million less in security gains relative to last year. These results were driven by strong loan and deposit growth, a continued contribution from Epoch and Target, significant declines in credit losses, and disciplined expense management.","Together with a strong year at TD Ameritrade, where earnings from our ownership stake rose by 17%, this drove a 7% increase in net income in our U.S. retail segment and a 14% increase in Canadian dollar terms reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar.","Our wholesale bank turned in a great performance in 2014, with earnings up 25% and ROE at 18% for the year. Revenue growth was strong in our trading and origination businesses and TD Securities led some of the year's largest equity and debt transactions, including PrairieSky Royalty's $1.7 billion IPO and the Nalcor Energy- Muskrat Falls project, a bond placement that demonstrated our ability to leverage capabilities and partnerships across the entire bank.","On the expense front, total bank expenses, excluding variable compensation, acquisitions and FX rose 3.7% in fiscal 2014. This growth included investments to position ourselves for future success, including strengthening our digital capabilities, opening new stores and ensuring that we are equipped to meet significant new regulatory requirements. As we've often said, it's important that we make the investments necessary to keep TD strong today and in the future.","Let me now turn to the year ahead. We will continue to focus on organic growth, leveraging the investments we've made to expand our businesses and capabilities over the last decade, and we will keep looking for ways to deliver legendary customer experiences across all of our businesses, including digital channels. We have great opportunities to drive stronger growth by being true to these core attributes of our brand. At the same time we face several headwinds. The operating environment remains difficult. With interest rates still low, a global recovery that is only gradually taking hold and increased competition from traditional and nontraditional players.","In addition, credit, and a stronger U.S. dollar were tailwinds this year. We do not expect either to make the same contribution to earnings growth in 2015.","Our reflected tax rate is likely to rise, and expense pressures will persist as we continue to invest in our technology platform, our distribution network, our regulatory infrastructure, and productivity initiatives. That's why I'm determined we will re-double our efforts to increase efficiency and streamline our cost base. This will be an important area of focus in 2015.","What does this mean for earnings growth? We continue to aspire to deliver 7% to 10% EPS growth or the medium term. In the current environment, it is difficult to see how we will get into that range next year, given the headwinds I've just outlined, but this should not obscure the strong fundamentals of our franchise businesses.","In Canadian retail, personal loan and deposit volumes are accelerating. Business lending is strong, and TD Canada Trust has enhanced its product offerings to support this growth. Our cards business is performing well. The fundamentals of our insurance business continues to strengthen, and our wealth franchise goes from strength-to-strength with direct investing platform that is on par with global players like TD Ameritrade and an advice business that is partnering evermore closely with TD CT to drive new client relationships.","Our U.S. retail franchise is well positioned to benefit from a stronger U.S. economy, one of the few OECD economies currently experiencing a genuine recovery. While low rates and intense competition persist, we continue to take share and outperform our peers. We're also evolving our distribution strategy, deepening customer relationships, and improving our productivity.","We will keep investing in all of these areas next year, including opening 23 new stores. We expect continued good performance in our wholesale business, though the recent drop in oil prices may affect our momentum in the energy space. We will build on the signature deals we led in Canada this year to strengthen our profile with clients and extend our franchise model in the United States.","In closing, as I reflect on the year just ended, and look ahead to my first full quarter as CEO of this great institution I'm optimistic about the opportunities we have and confident about our strong track record of executing on our goals.","I want to thank you, members of my senior management team, and our incredible colleagues here at TD, who now number over 85,000, for your hard work, dedication, and ability to rise to any challenge. I know that together we will achieve great things as we build an even better bank.","Thank you very much, and now, I will pass it on to Colleen.","Colleen Johnston","Thanks very much, Bharat, and good afternoon everyone. Let me take you through our results. Before we review the fourth quarter in detail, let's start with a brief overview of 2014.","For the full-year, total adjusted net income was 8.1 billion, a new record, up 14% from 2013 and adjusted EPS of 427 was up 15%. Our 2013 results included additional losses in our insurance business related to claims resulting from severe weather-related events and increased general insurance claims. After adding back this impact, adjusted earnings and EPS grew 8% compared with last year.","Our retail businesses had a great year, contributing 90% of total earnings. Canadian retail grew 17% or 8% after adding back the insurance charges I just mentioned. This record performance was driven by good growth in loans deposits and wealth assets, strong credit performance, positive operating leverage, and the addition of the widely recognized Aeroplan program.","U.S. retail grew 14%, another new record, supported by good operating performance and currency translation. In a tough operating and regulatory environment, the fundamentals remained very good for our U.S. business. Strong loan and deposit growth and excellent credit performance helped the business earn through a significant decline in security gains, and we benefited from the acquisitions of the Target credit card portfolio and Epoch Investment Partners.","Wholesale banking delivered an impressive year with earnings growth of 25%. Very strong top line growth, lower PCL, and good expense management all contributed to a great year. We finish the year with a CET 1 ratio of 9.4%. Overall, we were very pleased with our 2014 performance.","Please turn to Slide 5. Turning to Q4, we delivered adjusted net income of 1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.98, both up 3% year-over-year. The quarter reflected good earnings contributions from our operating segments partly offset by higher corporate segment loss. Retail adjusted earnings of 1.9 billion were up 7% over last year, driven by good loan and deposit growth on both sides of the border as well as lower overall PCL and currency translation.","Wholesale net income of a 160 million was up 31% from a week quarter last year. The corporate segment posted a loss of a 165 million. Overall, a solid result for the bank this quarter.","Please turn to Slide 6. This slide presents our reported and adjusted earnings this quarter with a difference due to two items of note both of which you've seen before. I'd like to highlight that the MBNA conversion is now successfully completed and we do not expect any further items of note related to the MBNA integration.","Please turn to Slide 7. Canadian retail delivered a good quarter with adjusted net income of 1.4 billion, up 7% year-over-year. The increase was driven by good loan and deposit and wealth asset growth and the addition of Aeroplan partly offset by higher expenses. Loan and deposit growth was good this quarter. Total loan growth was 6% year-over-year with real-estate secured lending volume up by 4% and business lending up a strong 10%.","Card growth was strong at 21% due mainly to the addition of Aeroplan, while auto lending volumes increased by 11%. Personal and business deposits increased by 4% due to strong growth in core savings and checking accounts, up a 11%, partially offset by lower term deposit volume. Margin was down six basis points sequentially in line with our guidance from last quarter, primarily due to the low rate environment, competitive pricing and seasonality.","We expect margins to bump around, but remain relatively stable for the next few quarters depending on product mix, seasonality of the competitive environment, and rate moves. Credit performance continues to be favorable with PCL and personal banking up by 8 million from last year due to the addition of Aeroplan balances.","Business banking PCL was up by 18 million, driven mainly by higher prior year recoveries. Adjusted expenses were up 8% year-over-year due to higher employee-related cost, including variable compensation mainly in wealth, volume growth, initiatives to grow the business, and the addition of Aeroplan. These increases were partially offset by productivity gains.","We continue to disclose the Canadian wealth and insurance businesses, which are included in the Canadian retail segment. The wealth business made a strong contribution with 10% earnings growth. Assets under management grew 23 billion or 11%. The insurance business had solid results, roughly in line with Q4 of last year; overall, good performance for Canadian retail.","Please turn to Slide 8. U.S. retail, excluding TD Ameritrade had earnings of U.S. 385 million flat to Q4 of last year. Results for the quarter reflected strong organic growth, favorable credit, and good expense management offset by margin compression and lower security gains. Revenue decreased by 2% year-over-year, as volume growth was offset by lower gains on sales of securities and lower margins driven mainly by lower accretion and also heightened competition.","Average loans were up 8% year-over-year with a 3% increase in personal loans and a 14% in business loans. Average deposits increased by 5%. Margin was down 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter, in line with our guidance from Q3, reflecting lower accretion as well as some core compression due to heightened competition and mix. We are starting to see signs of margin stabilization from the Q4 level as competitive pressures are abating.","PCL decreased 29% due primarily to improvements in credit quality, particularly in auto loans and lower net charge-offs in business lending. Expenses were down versus last year. Permanent expense reductions were offset by higher employee costs to support business growth.","Expenses related to Target revenue share declined versus last year. Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade in U.S. dollars were up 5% year-over-year due to increased TD Ameritrade earnings which rose 6% versus last year; all-in, a solid performance in the U.S.","Please turn to Slide 9. Net income for wholesale of a $160 million was up by 31% compared to a weak fourth quarter last year. The increase was due to lower expenses. Revenue was flat versus Q4 last year as higher equity and debt underwriting and M&A fees were offset by lower trading-related revenues. During Q4 we implemented a funding valuation adjustment related to non-collateralized derivatives which amounted to $65 million pretax. The introduction of this reserve reflects evolving industry practice. This item reduced trading-related revenue.","Non-interest expenses were down 10% compared to an elevated Q4 of 2013, which included expenses related to a commercial dispute. ROE this quarter was 13% below what has been our range due to the FVA charge.","Please turn to Slide 10. The corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of $165 million in the quarter. As expected, the elevated loss was primarily driven by continued investments in enterprise projects and initiatives and a lower contribution from favorable tax items. We expect corporate segment losses to increase next year, reflecting the non-recurrence of gains from the sale of TD Ameritrade shares recognized in 2014, higher expenses and a reduced level of favorable tax items in 2015.","Please turn to Slide 11. Core expenses for the quarter, which exclude the impact of FX and acquisitions were up 5.5% year-over-year. Excluding higher variable compensation, core expenses grew by 5%. On a full-year basis, core expenses grew by 4.9% or 3.7% when the variable compensation is excluded. As anticipated, operating leverage for the fourth quarter and 2014 was negative. Growth in core expenses for both the quarter and the full-year was driven by a combination of higher investment in regulatory and growth initiatives and employee costs.","On a full-year basis close to 2% of our expense growth reflected higher project and initiative spend, investments in the future including digital regulatory and infrastructure build. Base growth was partially offset by productivity savings.","Please turn to Slide 12. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.4% in the fourth quarter, up approximately 10 basis points versus Q4, due mainly to solid organic capital generation. Overall, we continue to remain well positioned for the evolving regulatory and capital environment.","With that, I'll turn things over to Mark, and turn to slide 13.","Mark Chauvin","","Thank you, Colleen, and good afternoon everyone. This has been a strong year from a credit quality perspective. Performance across the loan portfolios remained very solid with full-year PCL of 34 basis points, a four basis better than what we experienced in 2013.","The positive trend continues with loss rates remaining at cyclically lower levels during the fourth quarter. The increase noted in U.S. personal impaired loans during the quarter is attributed to full implementation of continuing regulatory guidance on troubled debt restructuring, related primarily to our home equity line of credit portfolio, the continued mortgage foreclosure backlog in the courts of Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, and a weakening Canadian dollar. Notwithstanding their impaired status, roughly one-third of the mortgage and HELOC impaired balances are current with their payments. We remain satisfied with the credit quality of the U.S. real estate secured portfolio.","Looking forward, current economic forecasts suggest that credit quality will remain strong in 2015, although volume growth is expected to result in a moderate increase in total credit losses.","Lastly, given the focus on current oil prices, I would like to briefly comment on our exposure in near to mid-term outlook. The information provided in appendix slides number 31 and 33 has been expanded to provide additional information on our oil and gas credit exposure.","Our oil and gas loan portfolio consists of a well-diversified mix of global and North American oil and gas companies. The majority of non-investment grade loans are subject to a secured borrowing base using discounted oil and gas prices, risk-based independent engineer reports and semi-annual re-determinations. We also stress each borrower to a conservative level which is well below current prices.","At present we would not expect to see any material loan impairment or losses in an environment, where oil dropped to $60 for an extended period. Historically our experience with this sector has been very good. For context, we incurred no credit losses in the 2008-'09 financial crisis during a period in which oil prices touched $35.","Now, I'll turn the presentation back to Rudy.","Rudy Sankovic","","Thank you, Mark. We'll now open it up for questions. To give everyone a chance to participate, please keep to one question and re-queue if there is time. For those participating in the room, can I ask you to identify your name and firm before asking your question? Before ending the call today I'll ask Bharat to offer some final remarks. So why don't we get started in the room, Jason?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Q - Jason Bilodeau","","Yes. Maybe I'll pick up on \u2026 ","Rudy Sankovic","Jason Bilodeau from Macquarie Capital.","Jason Bilodeau","","Jason Bilodeau from Macquarie Capital. Just picking up on that issue about energy. Mark, you addressed this from a credit perspective. I don't know who on the Board wants to talk to what does it mean from a growth perspective so what does the corporate and commercial loan book look like in a $60 oil environment and what does the investment banking activity look like in a $60 oil environment?","Mark Chauvin","","You start, Bob.","Bob Dorrance","Sure, I can do it from the investment corporate banking perspective. The energy business, upstream\/midstream pipeline utilities et cetera has been approximately 5% to 10% of our revenue over the last number of years. With the current activity going on in oil pricing certainly is impacting activity levels in the business. And so, things have slow down, and we would expect that until oil starts to establish a range wherein businesses can plan around what their activities would be, it will probably remain slow until that time.","As Mark alluded to, it's not something that hasn't happened before. There is a cyclicality in the business and hence the 5% to 10% range of what it represents to our overall capital markets revenues. So I think what we'll have to do is look to other areas to augment revenue growth and not be reliant on the energy or especially the oil part of the patch, companies like Midstream and utility part can remain relatively active, but it's the equity raising on the oil and gas part that will be I think slow for a while, for the industry.","Jason Bilodeau","And then, in sort of smaller books like in small business or commercial type lending, is there any weight you'd expect in that part of the \u2026 ","Tim Hockey","No, as you can imagine we've both stressed that book often and obviously frequently recently. Not too much to add to what Mark and Bob would offer other than if you look at piece of Canadian economic picture overall as a result of this, given it's -- our economics team would say it sort of a net negative for the Canadian economy overall, but it would probably be at these low rates are one or two quarter period of time until the supply side starts to equilibrate.","So for example, if you look at the housing market in Calgary, which has been one of our three hottest markets across the company, then the expectation is it is that would start to moderate over time, but the overall economic impact on Canada is relative needed, probably 25-50 basis points even over a sustained multi-quarter low oil shock and as far as our commercial and commercial management accounts book that we are actually quite comfortable with our clients and their exposure even at low levels.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks, J. Next question, John?","John Aiken","John Aiken with Barclays. Bharat, you framed your outlook for 2015 in your opening comments; couple of things that I'm stuck at for me is obviously that to paraphrase your challenge to hit your medium term guidance in terms of 7% to 10%. You also have a stressed organic growth being part of the process. Would be very interested to see if you could frame this around the outlook for dividends and what conversations the Board has been having around that? The increase that you took in the first quarter was obviously to break out of that pattern of every second quarter. But are we now looking at TD falling into a pattern of an annual dividend increase and what that may mean for the outlook?","Bharat Masrani","Yes, John; on the dividends we did signal at the time as you rightly point out that we don't want to make this an autopilot way of doing it. Our current plan is to look at our dividends like we did last year. At the same time and we will do so. And what pattern we follow, we will let you know, but it should not surprise you that we will do declare dividends when we think it is appropriate for the bank to do so, based on where we are in our thinking on where earnings are going, and secondly where we are in the range as well, and both those issues are important to us, but for now you should assume that we will stick to the timeline we did that we outline, last time we talked about this.","Rudy Sankovic","Good, thank you. Anything else in the room? Okay, operator, why don't we go to the phones, please?","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Steve Theriault at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steve Theriault","Thanks very much. Question for Tim Hockey. So balances have been flat at the last several quarters in US in direct auto but showed some nice growth in Q4. I know you've been optimizing dealer relationships dealing with some issues and a little bit of restructuring. So does this signal that you're back in growth mode? The rightsizing and restructuring is past? Maybe a bit of an update there, please?","Tim Hockey","Sure. Actually, we're quite pleased with the level of growth. As you know we have been restructuring the mark [ph], the industry overall was pressured by margins. So we took significant cost out of the business and we have been skewing more to the prime and the actually super prime end of the spectrum. So as a result, we're quite confident, as Mark pointed out, our credit losses have dropped in that particular business. So we're -- because of the very high fixed to variable cost base of putting on additional prime and super prime, it's a business that we actually like. So yes, we're quite pleased with both our risk profile as well as the increased growth on that book.","Steve Theriault","So you'd expect to be able to report some relatively consistent growth through next year?","Tim Hockey","Yes, we can.","Steve Theriault","Thank you.","Rudy Sankovic","Thank you, Steve. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gabriel Dechaine at Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Gabriel Dechaine","Hi, I just want to ask about the earnings outlook for the US business. Considering your revenue outlook, margin trajectory and maybe some uptick in PCLs because we had a bit of a low point in PCLs in Q2 and Q3 this year?","Mike Pedersen","","Yes. So we did say in Q3 that the earnings would be down a bit in Q4 as you saw. We had strong fundamentals in Q4 and growth continued to outpace the industry. In fact, I'd say we accelerated in Q4, which was nice to see. Our NIAT was flat the last year because of lower securities gains and margin compression which Colleen alluded to. We also had a few tax and expense items related to the year end, but I'd point out that our expenses were nevertheless lower than they were in Q4 last year.","So I think about growth for next year in terms of modest growth over the full 2014 year. So in '14, we're up 5.3%, bit better than we expected. We outperformed our U.S. peers across most metrics as we built the franchise. I'd share that the full-year loans were up 10.2%, deposits up 7% year-over-year, much better than our peer and we also outperformed in checking accounts and household acquisitions. Expenses for the full-year grew 1.4%, that's ex-acquisitions and that's even as we continued to invest in the business, including 34 new stores for the year.","In terms of the modest NIAT growth outlook for 2014, I do expect that we'll continue to grow the business very strongly still. There are really three issues that make it a bit tough next year. One is margins, this is as you know always hard to predict, but based on everything I see now, in terms of rates and mix and competition and accretion trends and so on, I'd expect that our 2015 margin will be relatively stable from the fourth quarter, although it may jump around a bit during the year. But nevertheless, even though we expect it to be relatively stable from the fourth quarter, the full-year margin will be down from 2014, because the margin declined during 2014.","The second, so the headwind is that we haven't planned for much in the way of securities gains in 2015 and we have 61 million in 2015, and then the last one is PCL's and you asked about that, we had a very good better than expected year on PCLs in 2015; low charge offs, some strong recoveries. We do think we're near the end of that, although we may be wrong again, but we're expecting as we talk about modest growth that PCL growth will normalize along with loan growth. So just to be clear, all of what I've just said assumes no rate increases and given this outlook we're obviously also very, very focused on expenses for 2015.","Gabriel Dechaine","I call that a thorough response would be an understatement. Thanks for that, Mike.","Mike Pedersen","It was a wide ranging thorough question.","Gabriel Dechaine","Actually I lost my question list, but anyway, thanks.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks, Gabriel. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sumit Malhotra at Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks, good afternoon. Let's stay with you, Mike and to go back specifically on the revenue outlook. I know security gains have played a role but you've obviously had on a constant currency basis a tougher comparison for revenue in the last couple quarters in the second half of this year. When I hear you talk about net interest margin when you've got -- you're talking about no interest rate increase assumption in your outlook. Bond yields have obviously moved a lot lower and looking at some of your regional bank counterparts in the US, they seem to be talking about continued NIM compression in a pretty significant way, at least for the first half of 2015. So is it something to do with accounting or the accretion that TD has had that leads you to make that statement? Or maybe you can give me some visibility as to why you think you can buck the trend on margins?","Mike Pedersen","Yes, I think a few things. So first of all, on loan margins; we are starting to see the pressure moderate a little bit, and I think you've heard that from other banks as well, in particular on commercial corporate banking, but also in auto finance. So it feels a little better than it did. We expect our deposit margins to be stable to up during 2015. We've been able to do some things on the treasury side as rates have evolved that make that the likelihood. And the acquired loan portfolio was obviously smaller and smaller, but we expect the impact on the margin to be lower this year than it's been in the last year. It was pretty significant in 2014, you saw form Q4, 25 basis point decline year-over-year and over 2\/3rds of that was accretion. So those would be the kinds of things we thought through as we tell you that.","Sumit Malhotra","Is it your view that positive operating leverage is a realistic goal, again on a constant currency basis for this segment in 2015?","Mike Pedersen","Yes. So we obviously have a much smaller securities gains issue that we did and that's what made it difficult in 2014. We're very focused on expenses. As I said, 1.4% ex-acquisitions was a good result for this year. We are hoping to repeat that sort of performance roughly. And so, I think a positive operating leverage, I would say that we are targeting it, but not necessarily predicting it. It's a difficult environment that's hard to predict anything in.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks for your time.","Rudy Sankovic","Yes. Thanks, Sumit. The next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Sedran at CIBC. Please go ahead.","Robert Sedran","Hi, good afternoon. So Mike you're on a bit of a roll so I guess I'll stick with you. I want to ask you about the personal loan growth. The outlook both for the industry in general and then also for TD, and maybe you can touch on Target and some of the other initiatives in so doing. And I know you're not banking on any interest rate increases but what you think any interest rate increases might do to that loan demand on through your footprint?","Mike Pedersen","Okay, I'll try. It's tough in the personal loan space right now. It improved a little bit in Q4 across most of the categories, but especially auto. Let me try to comment on each of them. I mean, mortgages, we're still way down from where we've been, our year-over-year growth was 2%, last quarter was 1%. So you could say it's on an annualized basis increasing a little bit, but frankly there is just very little trend or hard indicators to hang your head on.","In the fourth quarter we saw a re-fi spike for about 10 days until rates went back up. So I'd say cautious expectation that 2015 will be a bit better on mortgages. Home sales are rising, stated intentions to buy are up, house values are improving, but really I think we need wages and incomes to rise. I think the key thing for me is that household incomes are still nowhere near recovered from pre-crisis, and if you think about how that feels from a personal point of view, it doesn't really matter what other statistics are that makes it a little tough. So that's why I'm cautious about predicting much growth in the mortgage space.","When and if it starts to happen, I think we're well positioned where we got very low penetration, we're growing our mortgage sales force, we got our store network, which is very strong and have also invested now in digital mortgage origination. So I think we're well positioned.","On home equity lending, I'm a little puzzled as to why that isn't growing better, given what's happened with employment in housing, but I think the industry was down like 4% or 5% in the last numbers I saw. We've been flat, so we can feel good about that, but it doesn't feel very good. Again, I think this all come, but again I think it's related more to wages and income than to anything else. Tim talked about autos, so I won't repeat that, I agree with what he said.","On cards, Target is the large part of our existing portfolio and it's still down from a year ago, but continuing to recover. So sales and new account growth is now back to where it was before the pre-breach levels. The non-Target TD card portfolio is showing strong growth, but it's a small base in the context of Target being included.","So you don't really see that show up, but to give you a data point, a year ago, 9.6% of our households had a TD credit card. Today, it's 12.8%. So it's a big focus for us. Deepening customer relationships in general's a big focus for us, and we'll be even more so going forward. Another data point and then I'll quit. A year ago, we had 3.8 products and services for customer, today it's 4.2; that's a really good progress, I'm really happy with that. There's more opportunity because we got upside there compared to other banks.","Robert Sedran","And just a quick follow-up because that was another detailed answer, just a quick follow-up on that credit card answer; is it a question of is the goal credit card volume, is the goal credit card balances, what are you looking to grow in terms of the credit card business?","Mike Pedersen","Well, the goal is credit card profitability, and customer profitability, and customer attention, but cards are a very attractive product set in today's capital environment. And Riaz runs that business very effectively and we're delighted with what we're seeing from a U.S. perspective. And we got lots of plans to grow that business. Riaz, I will invite you to jump in to the extent you want.","Riaz Ahmed","No, that's great. We're hoping to grow both.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks, Robert. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Routledge at National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.","Peter Routledge","Hi, thanks. I just want to go back to an issue Tim referenced in his answer and it just relates to the price of oil and what that might mean for his household book. I think Mark you said you've stress tested your commercial portfolio for oil at $60 for an extended period of time and you didn't view credit as a major issue. What would that do to household PCLs if you had $60 oil for an extended period of time?","Mark Chauvin","Shorter and serious, I have no idea. I don't think we've actually tried to take a look at that particular item.","Tim Hockey","I mean we have look at the economic forecast. And it's very early in the process, so I wouldn't have an answer to the question. But it would look to increase unemployment by 5% or 10% from what the base would have been. So that would have some impact on PCL but you not in the scope of a material large one in our view. But we're going to spend more time looking at that over the next couple of months.","Peter Routledge","","Okay. And then for Tim or Bharat, you think about your personal commercial bank in Canada. Its been on let's call it a great 15 to 20 year growth run and I'm sure there are, I'm sure the platform is still somewhat geared towards growth mode. If you decided to get very aggressive, could you still grow earnings at 5% a year even if you did have flat revenues because of slowing loan growth and higher PCLs and what have you?","Tim Hockey","Yes. ","Bharat Masrani","","I was going to say that. Since Tim said that I will reiterate that the answer is yes. In fact we would be disappointed with that.","Tim Hockey","I wasn't going to say that but I guess my boss just chimed in, but okay. ","Peter Routledge","","I mean how quickly could you act if all of a sudden the Canadian environment shifted and you really were worried about falling earnings? How ready are you for that?","Tim Hockey","It's depends on what you say in terms of shifting. On the one hand we are a large organization; on the other hand if I look at some of the investments we've made in 2014 and the momentum that we're already seeing in the business and actually feeling pretty good about the 2015 outlook relative to our growth. We've had an uptick in our linked quarter growth in lending. We've got products coming on-stream; we have new services that we've offered. There is a -- I think a sense of momentum here that we've got going forward in to 2015 notwithstanding low interest rate et cetera. ","So if you're asking if things went so quickly you'll have to illustrate the scenario but I'm quite confident about our growth aspect going forward and as many have said we've made investments in 2014 and we will continue to make some investments in 2015 going forward but we will be also focused on positive operating leverage. ","Peter Routledge","Let me reframe it then. A year from today oil is $60. What sort of efficiency initiatives would you be ready to go with?","Tim Hockey","Well, we've explained this, the way we approach it in Canada and many of the other parts of the business. We have an ongoing productivity focus in all of our businesses; and that is we expect our businesses to operate under a pretty simple paradigm, which is they get to grow their expenses inside their growth revenue. And to do that, to be ready for a shift in revenue outlook then they have to be constantly be investing in productivity gains and then if the revenue warrants it then the expenses can grow in new initiatives. So we've been on this program for three or four years. Our operating leverage for example in Canadian retail in 2014 was exactly the same as it was in 2013 at about 150 basis points.","So if you're saying that all of a sudden revenue growth falls off a cliff then we would have to severely curtail our investments in future in order to bank, if you will, the productivity gains, that would be a tough choice to make given that we don't like expense fire drills but it's one we would make.","Peter Routledge","Okay, thank you very much.","Bharat Masrani","The only thing I would add Peter is that we -- our franchise is national as you know, so if there is a problem with oil, I'm sure it will be a more of a regional story then perhaps as big a national story. And given the size of our business, the diversity of our business you would think there would be offsets elsewhere in our business. We do this stress testing as you would expect and would make sure that we adapt to the environment we find ourselves in.","Peter Routledge","Okay, thanks.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks Peter. Next question, please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Meny Grauman at Cormark Securities. Please go ahead. ","Meny Grauman","Hi, good afternoon. Bharat, in your opening remarks you referenced non-traditional players as being a source of competition and increased competition. I'm wondering whether you could just flush that out a little more and just talk about what you're talking about and specifically in the non-traditional side.","Bharat Masrani","","Great question. I'd say one example would be, obviously you've heard as I have there is intense interest in the payment system for example. You have potential entrants that are not banks in that space and that's an important business for TD, for the Canadian banks and we got to figure out ways to how we compete with those players, how can we be as agile, as flexible as them. So what it takes is and banks have generally been pretty good. I can talk about TD. We take those issues very seriously and so we will make the right investments to make sure that if and when that were to happen that we are prepared for it and are able to effectively complete. ","So that's just one example. I mean you hear of a lot of other non-traditional type of threats, the shadow banks, as regulation is changing in various jurisdictions where we operator and those are all the issues that we think about as to how we can effectively compete especially in our core businesses that are very important to us. So that will be one example of many.","Meny Grauman","Thank you.","Rudy Sankovic","Thanks, Meny. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mario Mendonca at TD Securities. Please go ahead.","Mario Mendonca","","Good afternoon. Colleen and Bharat, if we could go to the capital question. So the Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio 9.4% on a relative to global peers I'm sure it's fine but among the big five Canadian banks, not so much. What I'm struggling with is, is this actually a meaningful disadvantage or should we expect TD to be able to manage RWAs and to get that ratio through 10% relatively quickly?","Bharat Masrani","Riaz, do you want to take it first as to what's going on with the ratio and then perhaps I can follow-up on the first part of his question, on whether this is a disadvantage or not?","Riaz Ahmed","","Sure, hi, Mario. If you look at the quarterly capital development for us, you saw that in the first quarter we were down a bit, second quarter, we grew quite a bit and then Q3 and 4 we grew by about 10 basis points each quarter. So our overall organic capital generation, net of dividends and net of risk weighted asset growth is about 20 basis points is how you should think about it. And in the first quarter we took a CVA charge, second quarter you saw that capital growth and then in Q3 and Q4 some small things were undertaken. We completed our buyback program in Q3 and then in Q4 we had the pension valuation go against us. ","So I am not overall worried about the rate of capital generation and I think we are quite optimally placed in terms of where we would like to be and in the organic growth strategy that we are looking at in '15. I don't see it as being something that I worry about.","Mario Mendonca","","But Riaz, do you think 20 is still a good number to use for organic capital generation quarterly?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes.","Mario Mendonca","Okay.","Bharat Masrani","The only thing I would add, I think Riaz covered it up. No, Mario we would not consider our self to be strategically challenged from a capital perspective. That's not how I think about it. In fact we would consider our self to be well capitalized and have whatever flexibility we need to make sure we remain within our strategy.","Mario Mendonca","Are buybacks still part of the outlook?","Bharat Masrani","Well you know, we have talked about this more generally. I look at buybacks overall, within our overall capital deployment framework where we look at you know what's the amount we are going to require to meet our organic growth aspirations. Those are important, those are our core businesses. We also look at, is there any strategic or capability gap within our franchises and you have seen, we have taken advantage of opportunities when they have emerged, Epic comes to mind where we thought, it provides capability that would enhance where we were already. So we'd use our capital for that. ","We have also said that if an appropriate smallish tuck-in acquisition appeared in Mike's business, especially in certain part of the geography we would seriously look at that. And so this is kind of the hierarchy we go through and at the end, if all of them turn out then, yes, we still have too much capital; we don't have any need based on what I just said, of course we will look at buybacks at that point. But that's how we think about it, Mario rather than targeting a particular date.","Mario Mendonca","Then really quickly, Colleen and I think Bharat, you both referred to the tax rate being a bit higher next year. Not so much into the details as to why but more what numbers are we talking about, 100 basis points, 200 basis points?","Colleen Johnston","","I think Mario you got it right on. I would say versus and taking as a base the effective adjusted tax rate for 2014, I would say we're probably about a point to two points higher in 2015.","Mario Mendonca","Thank you.","Rudy Sankovic","I think we have time for one last question, please, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Darko Mihelic at RBC Capital Markets.","Darko Mihelic","Thank you for letting me squeeze in here; just -- my question is actually on capital as well, but I wanted to ask it in a different way, and what I'm really looking at is the U.S. retail segment.","Riaz Ahmed","What are you asking, Darko?","Darko Mihelic","When I look at the capital there, it seems that the capital base is growing a touch faster than RWAs. We also know that you're going to have to comply I guess with U.S. regulatory demand in the next couple of years, so the question is, should we expect to see the capital build continue even though you have modest earnings expectations such that we get a low return in this business in the next two, three years, and I guess turning that on its head, if we do have low return expectations on this capital, question over to Colleen; is there anything that we have to think about with respect to goodwill write-downs and so on?","Riaz Ahmed","","Darko, it's Riaz. So I think it's been a while; I can't remember exactly when, but three or four quarters ago, I had highlighted that as the U.S. rules continue to develop and the Basel III rules continue to develop. In our business, we're seeing a convergence between the amount of capital that the U.S. regulators are requiring and the amount of capital we're holding for the same risks at the consolidated level. So I don't think you should necessarily assume that as we go through and meet the rest of the Dodd-Frank requirements that our capital requirement are automatically rising, that is not the correct way to look at it. Right now, in fact I would say that we're experiencing a high level of convergence between the two.","Colleen Johnston","And Darko, it's Colleen. So we obviously have to go through an annual process of testing our goodwill evaluation, and we've gone through that process, and I think it's safe to say we have a generous buffer in that calculation. So I don't have any concerns whatsoever concerning goodwill.","Mike Pedersen","Darko, it's Mike. I was asked earlier about upside, and I didn't answer it. Needless to say the modest language is with respect to the short-term outlook 2015. I think there is lots of growth opportunity in the U.S. business beyond 2015, we have productivity upsides, we have cross-sell upsides, we have lots of growth upside not even factoring in the fact that as rates rise obviously we stand to benefit somewhat from that, and the headwinds we face in 2015 are largely temporary in nature.","Darko Mihelic","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","A - Rudy Sankovic","Okay. Thank you, Darko. I'll ask Bharat for final remarks.","Bharat Masrani","Thanks, Rudy. In typical TD style, we give you all the headwinds that we think that are going to be out there in '15, but notwithstanding that we have a fantastic business model, we have a brand that is second to none. Our mix of businesses is to die for, and we have a great team. And so, as long as we execute I feel very, very good about the Bank's long-term prospects as to what we can do together, and in case if I don't see you folks before the end of the year, wish you happy holidays, and thank you very much.","Rudy Sankovic","So with that, we will end the meeting; and thank you everybody for joining us.

Additional information on items of note, the Bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q2 2018 Report to Shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Gillian and thank you everyone for joining us today. Q2 was another terrific quarter for TD. Earnings increased 20% crossing the $3 billion threshold for the first time and EPS rose 21% to $1.62. All of our businesses performed well, revenue growth was strong as we continue to drive new business to a differentiated customer experience. We managed expenses well, delivering positive operating leverage across the enterprise and lowering our efficiency ratio. Our capital and liquidity metrics are robust with our CET1 ratio, ending the quarter at 11.8% up 120 basis points from the prior quarter, helped by the new BASEL II floor and continued organic capital generation.","And our return on equity increased to 18% reflecting an improving profitability profile. These impressive results speak to the power of our customer centric model, the advantages of our scale and diversification and the discipline we have shown in growing our businesses while staying within our risk appetite. They also reflect good execution against our strategic priorities. Over the last few years, we've been investing in our businesses to elevate our customer service proposition and position ourselves to succeed in the digital world. We have continued to evolve our distribution network to make sure we're providing customers and clients with the right touch points in the right channels at the right time.","We're reimagining every step of the customer journey to deliver richer, more seamless experiences and we are leveraging new technologies to help them engage with us more easily and offer personalized solutions they can trust and rely on. To further extend our innovation leadership, we recently became the first Canadian bank to join the Canadian Institute for Cyber Security at the University of New Brunswick. This builds on a cyber security office, which opened in Tel Aviv last fall a growing catalog of patent filings and our acquisition of artificial intelligence leader Layer 6, earlier this year.","These investments are central our ability to design the next generation of legendary customer and colleague experiences by tapping into some of the world's top technology ecosystems while developing homegrown talent in Canada and at TD all in the name of building the better bank. Our strong performance this quarter demonstrates our ability to innovate, execute and deliver for all our stakeholders.","Let me now turn to our business segment results. Canadian retail had a better quarter with net income up 17%. Strength was broad based without our banking, wealth and insurance businesses, all delivering double-digit earnings growth. We added volumes in key product lines by wining more of our customers' trust and business. We benefited from our number one in core deposits with rising rates driving further margin expansion. We reached milestone in our auto finance business with TD auto finance ranking highest in dealer satisfaction among noncaptive retail lenders by J.D. Power our first time in the top spot up from the number three position in 2017, demonstrating the success we have had in growing this business.","And credit quality remained strong reflecting our disciplined underwriting practices and favorable economic conditions. We also continued innovating to serve our customers better. In our real estate secured lending business we enhanced our digital homeowner's journey with the addition of a new mortgage preapproval tool.","Customers can now complete the online application in minutes and are contacted by a phone channel representative promptly. This best in class capability empowers our customers to get the advice they need in the moment for one of the most important purchases they will ever make.","In everyday banking we are proud to be the first of the big five banks to partner with the Canada Revenue Agency to automate direct deposit enrollment this quarter a simple but powerful innovation that is helping to deliver income tax refunds more quickly and securely. In our direct investing business the online account opening platform we launched in February is driving strong engagement in new client acquisition. The new onboarding tool provides a digital gateway to our red broker platform, complete with e-signature and the ability to transfer accounts to TD with ease and end to end self-service capability that no other Canadian bank offers.","These tools and platforms add to our portfolio VAS like TD MySpend, TD MyAdvantage and TD ForMe and complement the advice specialists we've been adding in our branch and phone channels as well as the professionals in our unique designed center of excellence. Together their formal set of omni channel capabilities that allow us to give customers and clients the care and insight they need to feel more confident about their financial life. This commitment to delivering personal connected experiences is how we build a premier retail franchise in Canada and the investments we are making today will power the next leg of our success.","South of the border our U.S. retail bank also delivered impressive results this quarter, with earnings up 21% to $673 million. The strong performance was supported by peer leading growth in loan and deposit volumes, higher margins from the rising rate environment and a lower tax rate. We delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage while continuing to invest in our business and with the contribution from TD Ameritrade up almost 90% from a year ago segment earnings pushed further above the CAD1 billion mark and segment return on equity rose to nearly 13%. Our U.S. retail franchises are benefiting from strong tailwinds and we are taking advantage of the opportunity.","As I mentioned last quarter we have been adding frontline staff in key areas and building out our small business banking offering. We have also continued to enhance our core capabilities and infrastructure. We recently launched a new mortgage and home equity platform which will help us get to US faster and improve the customer experience. Our efforts are bearing fruit. This quarter, TD Bank America's Most Convenient Bank received the highest customer satisfaction with retail banking in Florida, according to J.D. Power 2018 U.S. retail banking study.","Rounding out our businesses, our wholesale bank also had a strong quarter. Earnings were up 8% reflecting higher trading revenue and continued investments in the rollout of our U.S. dollar strategy. And TD Securities continued its record of winning significant mandates that highlight our top tier dealer status in Canada and our growing global execution capabilities. We advised Choice Properties REIT on their $6 billion acquisition of Canadian REIT the largest ever public M&A and debt financing in the Canadian real estate sector underwriting $3.6 billion of committed credit facilities and acting as book runner for their additional debt offering.","We continue to be active in the sustainable and green bond space, acting as joint lead on US$600 million in issuance, including the World Bank's SEK1.2 billion and NOK500 million issues, our first sustainable mandates, in these currencies as well as the province of Quebec's CAD$500 million green bond. And we were named Canada Derivatives House of the Year coming fourth in FIIG bonds, and most impressive SSA House in Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars by Global Capital a testament to the strides we've made in building our capital markets business.","As I look back on the first half of the year, I'm very pleased with our performance. Total bank earnings are up 17% year to date, and EPS is up 19%, reflecting momentum in our franchise businesses in a macro environment that remains more resilient than many expected. While we expect year-over-year earnings growth to moderate in the second half of the year, due in part to a very strong third quarter in 2017 our full year results are on pace to exceed our medium-term targets. As always we're taking advantage of the strong performance to invest in our continued growth and transformation as well as in the success of those we serve.","We were proud to launch the Ready Commitment at our annual meeting in March and have targeted $1 billion in total by 2030 in four areas that we believe are critical to building confidence in an inclusive tomorrow. Increasing access to the opportunities people need to build greater financial security, improving the quality of our environment so people and economies can thrive. Creating opportunities for everyone to participate and feel more connected to their communities, and supporting better outcomes for all. The TD brand stands for trust, confidence and legendary experiences, the Ready Commitment is an extension of this promise and will help prepare millions of people across North America to seize the opportunities and navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing world.","To wrap up it's been a great first half of 2018. We're delivering strong results today while laying a solid foundation for our continued growth. I'd like to thank all of our 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. United by our purpose to enrich the lives of our customers, colleagues and communities I know there's nothing we cannot accomplish together.","With that I'll turn things over to Riaz.","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you, Bharat. Please turn to Slide 5. This quarter, the Bank reported earnings of $2.9 billion and EPS of a $1.54. Adjusted earnings were $3 billion, up 20% year-over-year and adjusted EPS was a $1.62, up 21%. Results were strong across all our businesses. Revenue increased 12%. On a taxable equivalent basis revenue increased 6%, reflecting higher volumes and margins in the Canadian and U.S. retail segment. Credit losses declined quarter over quarter, reflecting the higher PCL in stages one and two taken in the first quarter and a stable economic outlook. Expenses were up 1%. We expect the rate of expense growth to be higher in the second half of the year as we take the opportunity to make further investments in our businesses.","Please turn to Slide 6. The Canadian Retail segment net income was $1.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year on good revenue growth, lower PCL and very strong operating leverage. Revenue increased on volume growth, rising margins and higher non-interest income in the insurance, wealth and banking businesses. Loans and deposits grew by 6% year-over-year with increases in both personal and business volumes. Margin was 2.91%, up 3 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to rising rates. Net interest margin has risen 10 basis points year-over-year.","Total PCL declined by 19% year-over-year. PCL impaired decreased by 8% reflecting strong credit performance in personal and business banking and PCL performing was nil this quarter. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 23 basis points, down 4 basis points quarter-over-quarter remaining at cyclical loans. Expenses increased 1% year-over-year. I'd also like to bring to your attention that we have introduced new disclosures this quarter for our Canadian real estate secured lending portfolio. In our MD&A and [step back], we are now showing the breakdown of amortizing and non-amortizing balances for our HELOC portfolio. As we note on slide 22 of this presentation 55% of our HELOC portfolio is amortizing.","Please turn to Slide 7. U.S. Retail net income was $770 million in U.S. dollars on a reported basis, and $827 million on an adjusted basis, up 30% year-over-year. The U.S. Retail Bank earned $663 million in U.S. dollars on a reported basis, up 20% year-over-year. The strong result was driven by 9% revenue growth, reflecting higher volumes, wider margins and fee income and the benefit of the Scottrade transaction, as well as a lower corporate tax rate.","Average loan volumes increased by 5%, reflecting growth in the personal and business customer segments. Deposit growth of 8% including strong growth in core checking accounts of 8% and 17% increase in sweep deposits from TD Ameritrade, due mainly to the Scottrade transaction. Net interest margin was 3.23%, up 4 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by balance sheet mix. Year-over-year net interest margin has increased by l8 basis points.","Total PCL decreased 17% quarter-over-quarter, the decline was driven mainly by a reduction in PCL performance due to seasonal trends in the credit card and auto portfolios coupled with lower volume growth in the U.S. commercial portfolios. Last quarter, we began providing the PCL ratio for the U.S. retail bank excluding the retail program partner's contractual share of PCL for the strategic cards portfolio, which is held in the corporate segment and offset in corporate non-interest expenses.","This net U.S. Retail PCL ratio was 45 basis points in Q2, down 7 basis points from last quarter. Expenses increased 7% year-over-year on a reported basis, reflecting higher investments in business initiatives, business volume growth, higher employee related costs and charges associated to the Scottrade transaction partially offset by productivity savings. The contribution from our investments in TD Ameritrade increased by 30% year-over-year on a reported basis and 88% adjusted for TD share of the charges related to the Scottrade integration. Segment ROE was 11.9% on a reported basis and 12.7% on an adjusted basis, up 270 basis points from a year ago.","Please turn to Slide 8. Net income for wholesale segment was $267 million, up 8% reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher PCL and higher noninterest expenses. Revenue increased 7%, reflecting higher trading -related revenue. Total PCL was $16 million. PCL impaired was a net recovery of $8 million quarter over quarter, reflecting a recovery of provisions in the oil and gas sector and PCL performing was $24 million, reflecting credit migration and a release of provisions in the prior quarter. Noninterest expenses rose 4%, reflecting continued investments in client facing employees supporting the global expansion of wholesale banking's US dollar strategy.","Please turn to Slide 9. The corporate segment loss, the corporate segment reported a net loss of $163 million in the quarter, up 2% year-over-year. The higher loss is driven by higher amortization of intangibles and lower noncontrolling interest in the current quarter, partially offset by higher other items, the higher contribution from other items was largely due to higher revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities in the current quarter.","Please turn to Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.8% at the end of the second quarter, up 123 basis points from the first quarter. We had strong organic capital generation this quarter which added 37 basis points to our capital position which was mostly offset by growth in risk-weighted assets. Our capital ratio position benefited from the transitional battle to floor which came into effect in the second quarter. As the new floor is not currently binding for TD this added 120 basis points to the CET1 ratio. We do not expect the floor to be binding to us for some time. Our leverage ratio was 4.1% and our liquidity coverage ratio was 123%.","I will now turn the call over to Ajai.","Ajai Bambawale","Well thank you Riaz and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide 11. Credit quality remained strong in the second quarter across all business segments as evidenced by reductions in gross impaired loan formations, gross impaired loans and credit losses. Gross impaired loan formations were $1.15 billion or 18 basis points down 2 basis points quarter over quarter and stable year-over-year. The decrease in the quarter was driven by the US retail segment, largely due to seasonal trends. Canadian retail remained stable and there were no new formations in the wholesale segment.","Please turn to Slide 12. Gross impaired loans ended the quarter at $2.99 billion down 2 basis points quarter over quarter and down 6 basis points year-over-year. Canadian retail gross impaired loans remained stable at 20 basis points. Gross impaired loans in our US retail segment were $48 million quarter over quarter, but more than offset by a foreign exchange impact of $81 million. Wholesale segment gross impaired loans decreased $31 million quarter over quarter to a zero impaired loan balance due to the full resolution of all impaired oil and gas exposures.","Please turn to Slide 13. This quarter our presentation has been amended to report PCL ratios both gross and net of the partner share of the US strategic card credit losses. In doing so, we remind you that the bank's contractual portion of the credit losses is reported is the U.S. retail segment, whereas the partner share is reported in the corporate segment. The bank's provisions for credit losses in the quarter were $562 million, or 36 basis points down 9 basis points quarter over quarter and stable year-over-year.","The decrease in PCL in the quarter was driven by continued strong credit performance in the Canadian retail segment and seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card and indirect order portfolios reflected in lower U.S. retail PCL and specifically for the U.S. strategic card partner share in the lower U.S. corporate segment PCL.","Please turn to Slide 14. Quarter over quarter $40 million decrease in embedded PCL primarily reflects continued strong credit performance in Canadian retail and seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card and indirect order portfolios. The quarter over quarter $100 million decrease in performing PCL is due to again U.S. seasonal trends, lower volume growth in the U.S. commercial portfolio and the prior quarter billed in Canadian retail. In summary, credit quality continues to be strong across all the bank's portfolios and we remain well-positioned for continued growth.","With that operator we're now ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take a question from Meny Grauman from Cormark Securities.","Meny Grauman","I want to ask about the PCL ratio the step down in Canada. So specifically how substantial do you think that step down is, if you could give us a little more color in terms of what's driving? Is it just the strong, the very low unemployment rate? And some guidance going forward in terms of where you expect that PCL ratio to turn?","Bharat Masrani","Yes, so I'm seeing good credit quality across the Canadian book, I'll say certainly on personal is pretty stable on commercial as well. I think it's the economic environment that's causing that. If I look forward, and I look at history for Canada PCLs tend to be quite stable. So I do expect overall, if you recollect that I'd given guidance around 40 to 45 basis points for the overall enterprise. I think if the macro environment remains supportive I do expect overall to be at the lower end of that range for the full year.","Meny Grauman","And then if I could just ask on the insurance business it looks like quarter over quarter improvement in earnings quite strong actually, we heard that the quarter wasn't so great I mean that's an understatement for auto insurance in particular, so that performance seems a little bit out of whack with just the bigger picture view of the P&C insurance business for the quarter. So wondering what was driving that if there's any additional insight you can provide on that business specifically?","Theresa Currie","Its Terri. So we feel good about the growth for the insurance business this quarter as you've cited, definitely premium growth is looking good in the business. There was an item in the quarter that we did note. In revenue there was renewal of some international reinsurance contracts, those -- the timing of which were -- a portion of those renewed in Q2. Some of that was offset in claims. Having said that -- without leaving offsetting claims, having said that if we just look at the core performance of the business we're feeling good about how the business is performing. In terms of auto specifically we would have continued to see elevated claims cost for the repair of vehicles that we talked about last quarter, and that is consistent with the industry. Having said that our prior year development was more favorable than that, and more than offset that trend.","Meny Grauman","Is there anything, I see -- if I go back to 2017 it looks like the past year's Q2 has been a very strong quarter, is there any seasonality there something that's changed that would make Q2 sort of the strongest quarter of the year in that business?","Theresa Currie","So, Q2 versus Q3 can sometimes see a weather impact in Q3 for instance that didn't happen last year. I would say there've been a number of investments we've been making in this business over time to improve our customer experience and to improve our capabilities and our claims capabilities and I think those things are paying off including inclusion centers that we've opened to help customers who find themselves in a difficult situation.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Steve Theriault with Eight Capital.","Steve Theriault","Maybe first for Bharat, Bharat you've gotten here 12% CET1, and a relatively modest 1% buyback in place. Wondering now with the elimination of the floor do we expect you to be more active in terms of repurchases given the excess capital, and is 1% the rightsizing for buybacks given where you're capitalized?","Bharat Masrani","Steve, yes, a few things I'd say and we've been consistent on this. Firstly there was the regulatory issues around capital have been less uncertain now, but that's totally clear, and there's a Basel III floor, the output floor I think [Australia] has suggested they are going to be coming up with some kind of guidance soon. So there are a lot of moving parts there although I would acknowledge that it is much more certain today than we had a while ago. I don't know from DDs perspective we've been consistent on this. Our capital deployment framework has not changed. We do want to make sure that we've more than adequate capital to invest in our core strategies. We want to make sure that we have the flexibility should we need to use our capital to build on capabilities we think are critical for the Bank's growth on an ongoing basis.","We have signaled that we are keen on acquisitions in certain types of markets in the U.S., certain types of offerings and\/or products and we continue to look for those. I've also said that in Canada of course we'll look at anything and everything that comes around, and we'd look at it, seriously as long as all these acquisition opportunities meet our strategy and there's financial hurdles that are appropriate and within our risk appetite. And then of course with all that, if we think that we've done all that and we still have excess capital, we will certainly think about buying back our shares. So that's how we are thinking about it, nothing has changed here. And so we will review this on an ongoing basis, as you rightly pointed out. We did announce a buyback and that is in the market as you know. We had a press release out last one. And so we will continue to consider that and we like acquisitions overall on the capital side.","Steve Theriault","And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Terri, the new disclosure around the HELOC, the mix of amortizing versus non-amortizing versus the 55%, you give in the disclosure. I'm wondering, can you tell us, if there is any change on this front with rates rising? Has it been pretty steady at around half for the last year, couple of years, is there any movement on that?","Theresa Currie","So if you think back to some of the prior conversations we have had on this topic and part of the reasons for amending the disclosure is to try to make this growth story more clear. And so you have seen and continue to see in this quarter year-over-year growth specifically in amortizing HELOC and that has been strategy, a scenario where we have an embedded growth opportunity and it's a great product very convenient and flexible for the right TD customer. And so in fact, that growth in the amortizing portion has exceeded and in fact, exceeded and continued to go. So proportionately, it would continue to be a more important part of the HELOC portfolio, I would expect going forward.","Operator","We'll now take next question Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.","Ebrahim Poonawala","I just wanted to follow-up. Riaz, I think you mentioned expense growth it was 1% up year-over-year. We have seen pretty significant improvement in the efficiency ratio year-over-year, down to like 50.1% adjusted basis. Just wanted to get a little more color in terms of how much higher expense growth, we should expect for the back half of the year and what that implies in your view for the efficiency ratio?","Riaz Ahmed","So as we called out in quarter one, we are looking at opportunities to accelerate some of our investments consistent with our overall strategy and priority. And so I repeat that this quarter we have a number of, let's say couple of hundred million dollars of additional expense initiatives that are in the hopper to be able to execute. And so I think if we are able to execute on all of them by Q3, Q4, I think you could see overall expense growth rates rise by maybe 1% to 1.5% for the year. I think if you look at expenses on a six months basis you also have to keep in mind that the foreign exchange rate does play a role in this. So expense growth ex-FX on a six month basis would have been closer to 2%. So I think if we end the year at 3, 3.5, I think that would be reasonable.","Ebrahim Poonawala","And I just want to follow-up on Steve's question on capital. Is it -- I guess, should we assume that you sort of operate with a little elevated capital level for the time being until you find that the M&A opportunity or until we get better clarity on Basel IV? I'm just wondering is there -- do you see a need to like bring this capital ratio down closer to 11% or not?","Bharat Masrani","We won't feel compelled to bring it down quickly just for the sake of it. I think as I said if there are M&A opportunities then we do look at that, we're a quality buyer and we viewed as such that's our brand. So we look at enough of these but the end of it if we come to the conclusion that for the next little while there is not going to be much use of it, then we will seriously consider increasing our buyback as well. So that's how I position it Ibrahim. I don't think we put timelines that by such and such date if we don't find something then we're going to bring our capital down that's not how we would operate. We would look at what's in the market, what are the opportunities, what might be coming down the pipe as well, because given our size and stated view and what kind of markets we would be interested in acquiring, a lot of inquiries are made of us. So we look at all of those and then at the end of the day if there are none that are acceptable or interesting then of course we will look at buybacks as well.","Ebrahim Poonawala","And just on M&A I think you have previously talked about interest in the US Southeast as far as bank M&A is concerned. Does sort of the environment today -- we have seen one transaction happen earlier this week. Do the valuations any of those look prohibitive to you in terms of doing deal or do you think we're in a better place right now from a regulatory standpoint to able to do a U.S bank M&A?","Bharat Masrani","You rightly point out when you get into a better environment, the value that not is attractive and that's part of if I guess the M&A world. We continue to look at the Florida market, the Southeast of the US is really interesting to us. We have a fantastic franchise there, we worked hard to build it, but we feel there is huge growth opportunities given our footprint in the U.S. The Northeast a lot of folks in the Northeast do have homes or vacation down in the Southeast of the United States also outside Canadian business. I think we have talked about this before. We have a few stores that we opened on the West Coast of Florida that for the most part catered to our Canadian clientele and those are growing very well for us. We like the Florida market, we like the Southeast market.","There are some opportunities there that are more interesting than others, but values will be an important consideration for us. As I have had said before not only do they have to fit strategically they have to make a financial sense and of course they have be within our risk appetite as well. So that's why you know we've been more measured because sometimes you meet one or the other and others and all of them are not suitable for us. But that would be an interesting one for us to look at. I think we've also said given our experience in this partnership deals in the credit card field that continues to be of interest to us. I know there is a lot of discussion on whether this is the right time in the cycle to be looking at those types of transactions.","We feel that if we get the right partners these businesses are attractive to the cycle and if the right opportunities were to present themselves we had look at it, seriously. So that's what we've said in the U.S. and then of course in Canada given our positioning here any kind of acquisition if it were to come along we would look at seriously. So that's our approach here but I think your key question our values, elevated of course, they are, but there is some offset in the environment and the prospects for the business going forward.","Operator","We will now take a question from Gabriel Dechaine with National Bank Financial.","Gabriel Dechaine","Just a clarification on one of your earlier responses. Riaz, you said expense growth 1% to 1.5% for the year and back half of like 3% to 3.5%, is that -- did I hear that correctly?","Riaz Ahmed","No Gabriel I was referring to the whole year. So if you look at the first six months and say that expenses without taking effect into account would be up 2% then if we -- that's another let's say a couple of hundred million dollars into Q3 and Q4 that should give us another 1% growth so that we would end up in the 3%, 3.5% territory for the whole year.","Gabriel Dechaine","I just want to ask about, and this is for Terri. Some of the pricing actions that we've seen from the bank in the last month or so on the mortgages, some are on the 5-year fixed and then on the variable rate, I guess that market has gotten more competitive. And then also, TD, specifically the fees, some of the banking fees we've seen, some tweaks there. How does that -- am I going to notice that? Should I make a big deal about it because it could have some tailwind effects.","Theresa Currie","So let me take level pricing and then fees as two separate topics. So real estate secured lending side for certain -- we are constantly watching two things supposed to grades in particular the cost of funds and then the competitive situation. And certainly at the end of April for the five year fixed rate our feeling was that from a yield curve perspective there was a opportunity to raise that rate and others followed us. In terms of the variable interest mortgage as you stated some competitive dynamic there. We are so comfortable that we are originating deals that customers rates that are competitive and continue to feel comfortable with our gross guidance that we have given as low around mid single digit for fiscal '18 for total proprietary real estate secured lending.","On the fees side, some of the revenue performance that you would have seen this Q2 would have been the decisions we made around overall fees last year playing their wave through across our businesses. Having said that there are a variety of things we look at and you may recall last year we actually took away the fee from any of our checking customers to make e-transfer and we actually do not charge a TD fee for a non-TD ATM use. So notwithstanding we made a portfolio of changes to fees across our businesses. We also in this quarter we have earned through some of the changes we have made to get back value to our customers in areas that are important to them.","So I guess that net-net I'd say the fees that you might have seen communicated this year would have been the same kind of thing we look across the portfolio. We consider where we can add value to customers. We consider how we are doing competitively. We communicate to customers in ways that they could perhaps not pay a fee through different behaviors or activities with us and we make those assessments. In terms of looking out and saying how material would that be, I'd say in the overall scheme of things, these were more tweaks overall for pricing changes in '18 and we expect them to be material in the back half for this year into next year.","Gabriel Dechaine","The last one here and this is maybe a bit of a random one, but I look across your current portfolio, balances are flat year-over-year. If I look at the non-amortizing HELOC portfolio, if I can find it here. Yes, it's also pretty flat. And if I look at your Canadian commercial real estate portfolio in the wholesale, it's growing but at about a quarter of the rate that I'm seeing from some of the other banks. I'm just wondering if I'm being -- if there's anything there? Are there any markets where you're maybe pulling back. You're seeing things you don't like or is this something that you view and you're not happy with it and you actually want to change it?","Theresa Currie","So let me do that one in three pieces as well then. So on the commercial loan front, we're growing commercial loans albeit at a lower pace than our overall -- sorry, real estate loans, commercial real estate loans at a lower pace than our overall commercial loans. I would say we're happy with the growth of that business and the risk profile of that business. And as Paul and his team work in the market to deal with our customers they're not shy to not do business that they don't think makes sense from a risk perspective. If you talk about the float HELOC, that again is that strategy that we have been deploying around the improvements we made to our amortizing HELOC product as a credible mortgage substitute for customers.","And you may recall we have an embedded growth opportunity where we didn't have those product enhancements or that exact capability to make it a mortgage substitute for customers, over the past few years and we enhanced the competitive of that product and so really we look at total real estate secured lending growth and those amortizing balances have been growing more quickly than the float balances and we're completely comfortable with that. And again hitting the growth that we've been communicating.","And then as it relates to cards if you look at the portfolio overall the Visa products are doing particularly well. So these are the enhancements we've made to our line up in particular on cash back and everyday rewards, where we're performing better than what we'd expected when we launched those products. Overall our Visa retail sales are above the Visa industry average and so very comfortable not only with our leadership position in cards but the growth in the Visa portfolio. We've been rationalizing and streamlining the overall cards business, I've talked about this in the past period of time.","And so we did sell a portion of the [indiscernible] portfolio some in Q1 some in Q2 and we've done last retail cards services business, those are completely in line with our expectations, and we've been continuing to improving the profitability of our MBNA business by doing fewer lower yielding promotional loans for instance. And so putting all together the portfolio itself is not overall growing quickly as you said but the parts of that that are strategic for the growth for the future are doing particularly well.","Gabriel Dechaine","Well, it sounds the MBNA is a little bit higher, I guess further out on the risk curve, if you're not pushing that one as much as the other Visa, it sounds similar I guess to what's taking place in the float HELOC in the sense that you're not chasing growth in those markets?","Theresa Currie","On the MBNA for sure what we're not -- we're really looking at a volume sort of profitability trade off there, the promotional loans is less of a perhaps risk decision more of a -- we want to make sure we're getting paid for the business that we're doing. But overall we definitely are not in the business of chasing risks that's outside our appetite in any lending product.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Sumit Malhotra from Scotiabank.","Sumit Malhotra","Terri I'll stay with you for a minute. First couple of days, first couple of banks we've heard from there is been some different comments on the trend and the real estate secured books. So when I look at your new disclosure with the amortizing HELOCs and mortgages. Your year-over-year growth is in the 5% to 6% range. Actually didn't look too bad sequentially either in what sometimes is a slower period. As you look out for the second half of the year, I think historically, we can agree that, we have seen stronger real estate related loan growth from the banks in the second half of the fiscal year. Is that your expectation that you should have a relatively normal rate of growth in the range or on a year-over-year basis or are there still some impacts to be [sell] from the changes that have taken place over the past year?","Theresa Currie","So for sure overall, we would expect to hit the mid-single-digit guidance for fiscal '18. As you noted, on a proprietary basis we spend about 6% total RESL growth year-to-date. At the higher end of that range, if by the end of the year, we were at the lower end of that range I would expect as through the year to deliver similarly, to the proprietary RESL growth we have last year. We did have some pull forward in Q2 for sure of November and December pre-approvals. And Q2 applications were a little bit later. Having said that, we're starting to see a little bit of the spring market come to fruition and we've made significant investments in this business, which gives me the confidence to standby in the guidance. We have been adding to our mobile mortgage specialists in high growth markets.","We have continued to invest in our credit operation centers, so that we can [tend] for our customers to the only question, they want answer is to qualify, they can get that answer more quickly. In terms of our branch advisers, we've been tooling them up and given them more training. And then as Bharat mentioned, we've been significantly enhancing our digital capabilities for real estate secured lending for mortgages in particular. And as we're excited now have not only the ability for buyers to understand how much they can afford to connect seamlessly to a branch or an advisor to in a proprietary and exclusive experience seek listings that are in their desired neighborhood to work through a pre-approval hold rate for 120 days and then get mortgage specialists on the phone to help them to the process. And so because of all of those investments I feel confident in the guidance.","Sumit Malhotra","One of the areas of differentiation with the group has been utilization or willingness to use the third-party or independent broker channel. You're still one of the banks that, at least from the data I have seen is involved there. How would you characterize from a distribution perspective your use of the third-party independent broker channel? Is that something that you're comfortable with pricing, documentation, those type of issues or is it an area that you have pulled out from any way?","Theresa Currie","So we want to be available for our customers in their channel of choice and that could be digitally as I just described through the branch, through the mobile mortgage specialists or many customers do speak out the help of a broker and we don't want that to preclude them from becoming a customer of TD on a franchise basis. We're very careful in ensuring that any partner that we deal with the Bank, meets our risk appetite. Those are underwritten to TD standards. There is good second line overview of the adjudication that happens and we don't feel like we're overpaying for those deals versus other deals that we make. So it's a great client acquisition strategy for us.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks for that. Last one for me is for Bharat, when we talk about M&A with TD, maybe I shouldn't but the talking points haven't changed much for number of years whether its credit card portfolios or perhaps adding capabilities in the Southeast U.S. I was wondering, we don't talk too much about is as your investment in Ameritrade, it's probably our fault because it's really strong investment for the bank for a number of years now. This year we are seeing a big increase in part because of some of the changes in the U.S., but also your participation in the Scottrade deal. When it comes the capital deployment how do you think through the merits of helping Ameritrade develop its business? Is that something that your partners with that company drive or is the fact that you on a smaller stake mean you're more focused on growing your own Bank business in the U.S.?","Bharat Masrani","I'm so glad you brought it up Sumit, as you rightly point out it is TD Ameritrade. We have been involved in this sector for many, many years. In fact, we entered the United States in 1996 in the online brokerage business. So it is very much a part of our thinking and as you know TD Ameritrade looked at Scottrade, TD was happy willing to participate in the transaction by acquiring Scottrade Bank. So we're committed. It's been a great business for us, continues to be a great business. We have ongoing programs that that are critical you know for TD to ensure that we have the right offerings for our mass affluent clientele in the United States that is in the millions. So it is an important offering that we have for our clients as well.","So it is very much part of TD and then of course if there are opportunities there as was the case with Scottrade you know, we would look at it very seriously and make sure that if it made sense with TD Ameritrade and with TD Bank that we want to do whatever it takes to further the strategic advantage that business has in its market. So it is an important business for us and we are happy to support it and it's done remarkably well for us as well, as you rightly point out.","Gillian Manning","I will just kind of break in and say that we're a little bit short on time, so I would like to ask the analysts to try to stick to one question.","Operator","We will now take question from Robert Sedran with CIBC Capital Markets.","Robert Sedran","Riaz, like I just want to follow up on your expense comment and I'm sorry I missed it, but as you think about accelerating investment in the second half is there a particular business segment or geography in which that's going to happen? Is it more directed to the U.S. because that's where the tax benefit is coming from, or is it more platform wide?","Riaz Ahmed","I think Rob you can think of it as platform wide, we have priority both in Canada as well as the U.S. and across all three segments. So I think you can expect it to be widely dispersed. Does that help Rob.","Robert Sedran","Sure, I will ask, I had another question -- clarification but I'll take it offline.","Operator","We will now take a question from Nigel D'Souza with Veritas Investment Research.","Nigel D'Souza","I just had a follow up for Terri on the new HELOC disclosure. I just wanted to make sure I understand the mix there between fixed and floating. Am I correct in saying that the non-amortizing portion is essentially entirely floating and the amortization is fixed? Or is there a mix between floating and mix without book as well?","Theresa Currie","You were right the first way that you described it. The amortizing is the fixed the non amortizing is the float.","Nigel D'Souza","On the single digit -- mid single digit growth rate of '18 is that on the entire RESL book or just the amortizing portion of your RESL book?","Theresa Currie","We think about it as total real estate secured lending which would include both as amortizing isn't growing more quickly in fact than non-amortizing in our past history or recent history and it would be proprietary growth.","Nigel D'Souza","So just to follow up on that point. Are you expecting in the back half that amortizing HELOC balance to offset sequential decline to flattish RESL mortgage book we are seeing in Q2?","Theresa Currie","We have been offering this to customers that where it makes sense for them as a mortgage substitute. So for some customers the mortgage might be the right product, for others that might be an amortizing HELOC or fixed term HELOC. So I'd consider them as one from a customer perspective and then it would be which is right for which customer.","Operator","We will now take a question from Sohrab Movahedi from BMO Capital Markets.","Sohrab Movahedi","Terri, I wonder if -- are you in a position to talk about what the decline rate in the commercial lending business has been? In other words you said you guys are not shy about turning down deals. Can you comment on -- if the decline rate has been trending higher or lower? And whether or not the spread on the new book, how does that compare with the back book?","Theresa Currie","As I probably don't have those specifics, so I'd probably take that one offline.","Operator","We will now take a question from Darko Mihelic with [RBD] Capital Markets.","Darko Mihelic","Just a quick question on the U.S. NIM and the rather big jump quarter over quarter. I'm wondering if you can just speak to expectations for that going forward maybe mix in a little bit of rate hike sensitivity for me again. It's just that it caught me a little bit off guard and I am wondering if there is something in there that that might make a decline over the next quarter or two?","Ajai Bambawale","So quarter over quarter, obviously up 4 basis points. And the main drivers there would be increase in rates and deposit rates in particular. We are seeing lending rates pretty flat and the offset to the rate hikes that we have seen it would be the mix of the business that we continue to grow the deposit book, on an absolute dollar basis faster than the loan book and that would be the offset there. And as we have talked about before the way we should think about this is [sum] of price in June rate hike and all things being equal, and depending on mix and yield curve and all the other things that go into that, we would certainly see an environment for improving NIM should rate hikes continue to occur.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Mike Rizvanovic from Macquarie Capital Markets of Canada.","Mike Rizvanovic","I just want to go back to Terri on your fee-based revenue in Canada. So what I'm wondering is we hear a lot about the cost savings that are set to come in the coming years. What is your view on the risk to revenue? And I'll tell you why I'm asking. So when I do look at other jurisdictions that are far ahead of Canada in terms of the digital transformation, their fee structures are significantly different than what we see here. What are your thoughts on that? Is it more of a longer term view?","Theresa Currie","So, for certain if that were to play out here it would be an industry impact as opposed to TD specific impact. I think we're continuously ensuring as we think about the products and services that we offer to our customers that they're meeting their expectations and delivering value. And there've been times in the past when some of those fee dynamics have changed and we have continued to evolve the product construct or the cost of doing business to allow us to continue to produce good results notwithstanding those changes.","Mike Rizvanovic","And so when you do see the J.D. Power rankings come out and for a number of years now, we've seen the online platforms, that do offer free everyday banking fees or no fee banking, if you will. Does that concern you at all? I know it's probably mostly millennials, I would imagine, but they are going to make a growing portion of your client base over time.","Theresa Currie","When we do research with customers in Canada what they tell us even our most digitally active customers is that it's important for them to have a branch based capability with their bank, they call it a real bank. And so we're continuing to ensure that we're delivering as Bharat said legendary personal connected experiences, omni channel experiences and for customers that even the most digitally active that ability to have some place to go when they've a problem or when their questions are more complex, continues to play an important role for them in selecting their financial institution.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Scott Chan with Canaccord Genuity.","Scott Chan","Just on the U.S. side, if I kind of look at the loan book in U.S. dollars, on the personal side, it seems kind of flattish across many of the portfolios of HELOCs, mortgages, cards, et cetera. In terms of looking forward should we be thinking about more of the year-over-year growth rate that you exhibit there or is there something in that -- in the quarter that kind of just caused slowness because it's just slowness versus other U.S. peers that seemed a bit slower, than I saw?","Bharat Masrani","I just want to make sure I am clarifying your flattish sort of growth comment, you're talking about Q-over-Q, Q1 to Q2, correct?","Scott Chan","Yes, that's right. Yes.","Ajai Bambawale","Yes, so if you go back to last year it's not dissimilar to what we would have seen in Q1 to Q2 in 2017, and I do think on the personal lending side you do get the seasonality. People paying down cards and forms of debt coming out of the holiday season, receipt of tax refunds, and things like that. So that's not uncommon. And -- but more generally if I think about the year-over-year business, up 5% certainly we're leading peers and we still remain bullish in our ability to outtake share from our competitors really across many asset classes and if you look over year-over-year basis, auto loans are growing 7%, cards up 15%, commercial story is a little bit different. In commercial is that, we're seeing a lot pay downs, all-time low utilization rates and many, many outlets for commercial assets these days. But again, there, we see ourselves as underweight in certain various commercial businesses and we still see for quite some time to come our ability to take share there as well.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the TD Bank Group's Second Quarter 2015 investor presentation. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rudy Sankovic, Head of Investor Relations for the Bank. Please go ahead.","Rudy Sankovic","Thank you, Operator and good afternoon, everyone.

With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As Rudy mentioned, Colleen will be up shortly to discuss our Second Quarter results in detail, but let me start by sharing my thoughts on this quarter and our progress so far this year. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance. For Q2, we generated adjusted EPS of $1.14, up 5% from last year, a good result. All of our businesses performed well and we continue to benefit from favorable FX and solid credit performance. On the capital front, our common equity Tier 1 capital position increased to a strong 9.9% and both our liquidity and leverage ratios are comfortably above our targets.","Our Canadian retail segment delivered earnings growth of 6%. Good volume growth, stable margins and strong fundamentals in wealth and insurance helped drive results. A solid lending market fueled demand for new originations in business banking, Real Estate secured lending and auto finance. Wealth Management posted record, long-term Mutual Fund sales, up an industry-leading 60% year-over-year.","And, in our Canadian branches, customers can now apply for an account at one of our stores south of the border at TD Bank, America's most convenient Bank. TD is also the only Bank in Canada that now offers customers the ability to conveniently pay their U.S. bills online or on their Smartphone. Two examples of our cross-border banking convenience.","Our U.S. retail segment performed in line with our expectations. Earnings growth was 2%, despite a drop in security gains versus last year. While our first-half performance was slightly ahead of our targets, our expectations for the full year continued to call for modest earnings growth. Our fundamentals remain strong as we outgrew the competition in loans, checking accounts and household growth. We had excellent credit performance and good expense Management.","You would have seen our recent announcement about our program agreement with Nordstrom, to purchase their existing U.S. Visa and private-label credit card portfolio and to become their exclusive credit card issuer in the U.S. We're proud to have been selected in this competitive process for our customer-centric approach and proven capabilities by an organization who shares our common values on customer experience. Nordstrom is one of the most respected retail brands in the world and this announced transaction will build on the success of our growing North American credit card portfolio.","Our wholesale segment delivered an impressive quarter, up 19% from last year driven by higher fee base and trading revenue. ROE was strong at 18%. TD Securities' focus on serving our U.S. commercial and corporate client base is noteworthy. It helps TD bring more to the table, deepens existing relationships and builds on our franchise-driven model. This is what we mean when we say think like a client, act like One TD.","When I talked about expenses last quarter, I reviewed our various areas of focus with caution that it will take some time before we see a meaningful impact to our expense base. We do expect to see an improvement in our efficiency in the medium term. While it's still early and we have more work to do, I was pleased with our Q2 expense performance. Excluding FX and variable compensation, our expense growth was 2.2%.","Having said that, our operating environment remains challenging. Prolonged lower rates, a slowing Canadian economy, mixed recovery signals from the U.S., continued expectations for low oil prices and regulatory and legislative pressures in both the U.S. and Canada will continue to result in slower revenue growth. Additionally, our industry is changing in fundamental ways and at breakneck speed, as new technologies lower the barriers to entry and innovative competitors emerge.","I have said many times before, TD is an adaptable organization. In light of these external pressures, we have continued to find ways to be a fitter and faster organization, easier for our customers to do business with while continuing to create room for investment in the future. As you saw today, we reported an after-tax restructuring charge of $228 million.","Today's charge reflects progress on many fronts along our productivity agenda and the related annual expense savings represent roughly 2% of our total expense base which will be fully phased in by 2017 giving us more assurance that our rate of expense growth will be controlled in the future, given a slower growth environment. The restructuring is part of our ongoing focus on adapting to the current environment while building for the future. Given the significant growth we have experienced in the last decade, including integrating our acquisitions, we're now focused on optimizing the performance of our enterprise.","The charge spans Real Estate optimization, including branch and store mergers, call center and corporate premises, process redesign to improve agility, efficiency and effectiveness and a continuous review of how we deploy our people to deliver against the evolving multi-channel customer expectations. This phase focused mainly on the United States and some functions in Canada and we expect to complete most of this work by the end of this year.","Some of the cost savings will be reinvested in advancing our digital and mobile capabilities, including modernizing our technology infrastructure and adding additional resources and expertise to improve our agility and speed to market. This will enhance the customer experience and help us compete with players who are not encumbered with legacy systems. Technology is increasingly influencing customers' expectations and preferences to change.","Speed and innovation matter and we will continue to make significant investments in digital technologies. As we do so, our focus remains on offering legendary experiences across all channels with the safety and soundness that protects the interests of our customers. We strive to be the high-touch Bank in a high-tech world. What's more, we anticipate these investments would help improve our efficiency in the medium term.","When I talked to you about our outlook for 2015 earnings growth six months ago, I cited higher credit losses and increasing effective tax rates, as items that would impact performance going forward. Both of these factors have been more benign than we expected. Additionally, the U.S. dollar has been stronger than last year which has meant higher than expected earnings. Expenses are being tightly managed and I'm pleased with the discipline I'm seeing across the Bank in big ways and in small ways.","However, in the last six months, we have seen more pressure on revenue than expected and given the lower rate environment in the U.S. and declines in Canadian interest rates, my view on 2015 has not fundamentally changed since the start of the year.","Despite these near-term challenges our ability to grow our volumes at a healthy rate, the strength of our credit portfolios and our progress on the expense front are all positive signs of momentum in 2015. More importantly, we continue to parlay our cost core strengths, our customer-centric model, the diversity of our business mix, our organic growth capabilities into new growth opportunities. These include a growing Wealth Management Business on both sides of the border, increased opportunities for our wholesale franchise and the continued growth of our U.S. platform.","In closing, I remain optimistic about our growth prospects today and the moves we're making to improve our franchise. While change is never easy, I'm continually impressed by the commitment and professionalism of all of our people. It is because of them that TD continues to be a great franchise with an exciting future. Thank you very much and now I'll pass it over to Colleen.","Colleen Johnston","Well thanks, Bharat and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. This quarter we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.14, up 5% year-over-year. The quarter reflected good growth from retail and wholesale versus last year, up 9% and 19%, respectively. The corporate segment posted a loss of CAD139 million. We continued to benefit from a strong U.S. dollar.","Adjusted total revenue increased 6% year-over-year or 2% excluding FX, led by strong loan deposit and wealth asset growth and higher insurance, fee-based and trading-related revenue. Growth this quarter was partially offset by margin compression, reduced security gains and lower corporate segment revenue. Adjusted expense growth was 8% year-over-year or 4% excluding FX.","Expense growth was driven by higher variable compensation and increased project and initiative spend, increases in base expenses were partly offset by productivity savings. Excluding variable compensation, expenses were up 2.2%, a good result. Overall a strong result for the Bank this quarter. Please turn to Slide 5.","This slide presents our reported and adjusted earnings this quarter with the difference due to four items of note, two of which you have seen before. With respect to the other two, the after-tax litigation charge was due to an adverse judgment and the evaluation of other developments and exposures in the U.S.. We also took a restructuring charge this quarter of CAD228 million after-tax to reflect various productivity initiatives. I'll comment more on this item in a later slide. Please turn to Slide 6.","Canadian retail delivered a good quarter with Adjusted Net Income of CAD1.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The increase was driven by continued good loan deposit and wealth asset growth and higher insurance earnings, but was partially offset by expense growth. Loan and deposit growth was good this quarter. Total loan growth was 5% year-over-year with Real Estate secured lending volume up 4%, strong business lending growth of 9% and 17% higher auto lending volumes. Deposits increased by 5% due to strong growth in core checking and savings accounts which were up 9%. Business deposits were up 6%.","Margin increased 1 basis point sequentially primarily due to the impact of a credit mark release in the acquired credit portfolios partially offset by the lower rate environment. We expect margins to remain under modest pressure in the second half of the year as a result of product mix, seasonal factors and competitive pricing. Credit performance was flat year-over-year. ","Higher personal PCL, up CAD24 million, mainly on higher auto PCL and prior-year recoveries was mostly offset by lower business banking PCL which decreased CAD23 million from a single commercial provision in the prior year. Adjusted expenses were up 4% year-over-year primarily due to higher employee-related costs including higher revenue-based, variable compensation in the wealth business and business growth, partially offset by productivity savings. Canadian retail produced 50 basis points of operating leverage when insurance claims are netted from revenue. Overall, a good result for Canadian retail. Please turn to Slide 7.","U.S. retail, excluding TD Ameritrade, had earnings of U.S.D433 million, up 2% year-over-year. Results for the quarter reflected strong fundamentals, including very strong loan and deposit growth, solid credit quality and good expense control, partially offset by margin compression. Revenue decreased 2% year-over-year relating to target and lower security gains. Excluding these items, revenue growth reflected strong volume and fee growth partially offset by margin compression.","Average loan growth showed continued strength and was up 10% year-over-year with a 4% increase in personal loans and a 17% increase in business loans. Average deposits increased by 5%. Margin declined nine basis points quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by product mix due to lower credit card balances and lower loan margins. We expect margins to experience modest pressure for the second half of the year mainly due to competitive pricing and product mix primarily driven by auto and business lending.","PCL decreased 33% year-over-year driven primarily by target. Excluding target, PCL was flat. Expenses were up 1% year-over-year primarily due to higher expenses to support growth and higher regulatory costs partially offset by ongoing productivity initiatives. Expense Management has been a key business focus this year.","While earnings for the first six months are up 8% in U.S. dollars, we expect earnings growth to be modest for the full year reflecting a challenging revenue environment. Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade in U.S. dollars were down 1% year-over-year in line with TD Ameritrade earnings. All-in, a good performance in the U.S.. Please turn to Slide 8.","Net income for wholesale was CAD246 million, up 19% year-over-year, a strong result reflecting broad-based contributions from all businesses. Revenue increased 16% year-over-year due mainly to higher trading, debt and equity underwriting fees and strong corporate lending growth. Non-interest expenses were up 10% primarily driven by higher variable compensation and foreign exchange translation. ROE this quarter was 18%. Please turn to Slide 9.","The corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of CAD139 million in the quarter compared to a loss of CAD30 million in the same period last year. The higher loss was a result of a prior-year gain on sale of TD Ameritrade shares, lower favorable tax items and prior-year releases for incurred but not yet identified credit losses. Please turn to Slide 10.","Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.9% in the Second Quarter versus 9.5% in Q1 of 2015. The increase reflects solid organic capital generation and RWA reductions primarily in wholesale. This quarter, we've disclosed our liquidity coverage ratio for the first time. We're comfortably above the 100% minimum target that OSFI has provided. I've included a slide in the appendix to provide further insight into LCR. Overall, we continue to remain well positioned for the evolving regulatory and capital environment. Please turn to Slide 11.","With respect to the restructuring charge announced today, the CAD228 million after-tax amount reflects a detailed and thoughtful productivity review which has been taking place over the last several months. Approximately 50% of the charge was related to our U.S. operation. This review focused on three key areas. First, a focus on process redesign with a view to simplifying and streamlining processes across the Bank.","Second, Real Estate optimization including branch and store consolidation in Canada and the U.S. and the cancellation of a limited number of de novo store locations in the U.S. which didn't make as much sense given changing consumer behaviors. We do, however remain committed to opening new branches and stores in key growth Markets as we move forward. Third, an organizational review primarily targeted at streamlining our executive and corporate Management structures mainly in non-client facing areas. This was something that Bharat provided an update on last quarter.","Ultimately our goal is both customer- and employee-oriented. As a result of think process we will improve our service levels, make it easier for our customers and clients to do business with TD and for our employees to get business done all while improving both efficiency and effectiveness. The expected annual savings from the restructuring is roughly 2% of our expense base. Fully realized in 2017, but with most savings in 2016.","In the last couple of years, our rate of expense growth has been pressured by many factors including technology transformation, regulatory investments, investments in digital capabilities, including mobile and business-as-usual growth. The run rate savings from these restructuring charges will allow us to lower our rate of expense growth while still investing in future capabilities.","Before I hand it over to Mark, I want to briefly mention the federal budget proposals related to synthetic equities. It's early to precisely size the impact given the consultation period and potential mitigation. However, what I can tell you is that the pre-mitigation impact of the proposal, assuming November 1 implementation, is 1% to 2% of EPS. And, with that, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you, Colleen and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 12. Credit performance remained strong across all portfolios throughout the Second Quarter. Gross impaired loans and new formations remained at cyclically low levels and are in line with results over the past four quarters. Provision for credit losses is up slightly, returning to a more normalized level when taking into account the Canadian debt sale which occurred in the First Quarter.","With respect to our oil and gas exposure, outstanding exposure remains stable at CAD3.8 billion representing less than 1% of total loans and acceptances. Our oil and gas book is performing within our expectations and we're not seeing a significant deterioration in consumer credit quality in the impacted provinces. As it is still early days, however, we continue to maintain a cautious approach across retail and non-retail exposures impacted by low oil prices.","We continue to see high quality originations across the portfolio and moving forward, I anticipate credit quality to remain strong through the remainder of the year. With that, Operator we're ready to begin questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Steve Theriault from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Steve Theriault","So Bharat, you're nestled up against 10% core Tier 1. Are you thinking about or what point do you think about rein stating the buyback that you were a little bit active within 2013 and 2014?","Bharat Masrani","Steve, I think I mentioned or talked about this before I give you the answer as to how we think about capital generally, what's capital deployment thinking and the first thing we obviously look at it is how much capital do we need to support our strategies related to organic growth and growth generally and that's always been our top priority. We've also used capital when it is appropriate to make sure that we have all the capabilities that we require to adapt and compete in various markets in which we operate.","I think Epoch is a good example of that. We've also been very active in using up our capital to optimize our U.S. balance sheet. We've talked about assets as something that we're really interested, as long as they are asset classes that fit our risk appetite and give us returns that are in keeping with what we consider to be reasonable, then we will certainly be using our capital to deploy to make sure that we take advantage of such opportunities and then we also talked about whenever we do see any opportunities for tuck in acquisitions or frankly being opportunistic events that might take place on both sides of the border, we would certainly be aggressive in pursuing those if they made sense for us and once we go through all of that thinking and if we still find that we have more capital than obviously we would seriously think about how do we maybe look at buybacks or anything similar so that's our capital thinking. I think the level you're seeing now is good. It's healthy.","There is still a lot of uncertainty out there on what exactly are the requirements, what kind of rules might get finalized and we have good organic growth opportunities as well so I think it's premature for me to comment on exactly what we would do but I just wanted to give you some context on exactly how we think about capital and how we deploy it.","Steve Theriault","You mentioned in your comments, Bharat regulatory pressure in Canada. Is there anything specific you'd mentioned to on the horizon you'd expect to take that materially or incrementally lower?","Bharat Masrani","What I meant there was just building out the different forms of infrastructure, making the right investments, when obviously, we're watching for and prepared for any eventuality that might result in various Basel deliberations or what might apply nationally but in addition to that there is a significant infrastructure build just to meet the new expectations that are out there and those are not insignificant, so we like all major banks, I'm guessing, are quickly building up those capabilities and that requires some dollars as well, so that was what I meant by talking about expectations.","Steve Theriault","Okay, if I could sneak a quick one in for Mike. Thanks for that, Bharat. Just really quickly in the context of the restructuring I'm looking at your store count or branch count, its floated right around 1300 plus or minus maybe 10 for some time. With the implementation of some streamlining and overlapping branches, would you expect that to drop materially below the 1300 count?","Mike Pedersen","Yes, so as I've said before, it will go up and down as we go through the quarters. As part of this charge, we've decided to close another 24 stores. That brings the total of stores that we merged into others for the year at about 45 and we'll probably open about 21 this year and we'll probably open roughly the same next year, so you know we're just taking a very careful look at customer transaction patterns and where we're acquiring customers and in some cases we have mature stores that can be merged into others with really negligible customer impact and would rather deploy some of that capital to open stores in growing areas in order to acquire more customers at a faster rate gain share and so on.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sohrab Movahedi from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sohrab Movahedi","A couple of quick ones. Mike, you will go through the CCAR process in the U.S. this year. Are you anticipating any incremental costs above and beyond what you would have spent already in preparation for that?","Bharat Masrani","So again, looking back over the last few years in the U.S. in our expense base is the gradual build of capabilities and infrastructure required to meet the broad array of regulatory change that we've seen in the U.S. and that includes spend to prepare for the DFAST exercise and the CCAR exercise next year. We're trying our hardest to derive productivity gains that moderate the impact of those initiatives and so far we've succeeded and we're going to continue to stay very focused on that. I think in terms of expenses we've had a very strong start to the year. We're down 1% year-over-year so far. I do think expenses will be a little bit higher in the second half of the year, in part for the reason that we're talking about the regulatory build but more related to the fact that more of our store openings are taking place in the second half than did in the first year. There's some timing related to Marketing and so on so as much as possible I don't think you'll discern any impact of regulatory build.","Sohrab Movahedi","And very quickly for Mark or for Bharat for that matter. TD has historically not been shy in the past of using sectoral look provisions when there's a variety of unknowns on the horizon. With what's happening in Alberta with the slowdown in Canada with the fears of the oil and gas, is [indiscernible] something that you're thinking about just to allay any investor concerns specifically on the loan book?","Mark Chauvin","It's Mark and I'll address that question. I think in the current environment, that would be addressed through our normal provisioning process and they would capture changes in risk and the portfolio and we're tracking Alberta very closely. It's very heightened alert but what we're seeing is very little if any change in the core credit metrics that would say that any, in fact that has not driven any increase in the reserves for those areas on the consumer credit side. Now maybe it's a little early and it's not over yet but I would say anything that is required will be captured naturally in our reserve process.","Operator","The next question is from Sumit Malhotra from Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.","Sumit Malhotra","To go back to the restructuring charge or maybe more importantly on what it means for expenses going forward, in the not too recent past the Bank had been targeting a level of expense growth, core expense growth ex of foreign exchange or acquisitions of 3% year-over-year but you had backed away from that for a couple of reasons. As you undertake this restructuring and talk about streamlining the cost the rate of growth going forward, is it that 3% level that you're looking to get back to and if so what's the time frame we should be expecting that?","Colleen Johnston","It's Colleen. I think I've talked about our general rate of expense growth in recent years in the 3-4% range and as we look forward, what we're really trying to do is to continue to invest in the future and we've called out some of the important investments in technology transformation investment in digital and mobile, other investments and regulatory infrastructure but that isn't brand new.","We've been doing that over a number of years and in fact our base costs are growing so obviously doing this more comprehensive restructuring process is going to allow us to have higher productivity gains and hopefully bring our rate of expense growth down below that range that I've cited for you. I don't want to name a specific number but that would be our goal, again is to continue to make the right investments in the future while lowering our rate of expense growth.","Sumit Malhotra","Maybe try it a different way. I know when we talk about operating leverage its normally been focused on the Canadian banking segment but from the top of the house perspective, that one's been a more challenging endeavor for TD and you would think some of the issues such as acquisitions or FX are going to cut both ways on revenue and expenses, so not to tie you down too much here, but how does the Bank think about operating leverage from an all Bank perspective and is that a more realistic goal given some of these investments that you'll be undertaking?","Colleen Johnston","I think if you look at the first half performance of the year and the fact that obviously we're posting negative operating leverage for the first six months I would call out a number of items that we've earned through broadly but a number that affected the revenue line. You look at the TD Ameritrade gains which happened in Q1 and Q2 of last year, substantially lower security gains, same quarter last year, we had a tax related item but which affected revenues and taxes, so those items we don't have similar types of items in the latter half of 2014 so I think what you'll start to see is an improvement in the trend around operating leverage.","I don't want to make any firm commitments for the immediate year but certainly our goal is to make sure that we can improve our efficiency over time and reduce that productivity ratio in the medium term and that is our goal and I think the restructuring charge the work that we're doing in fact that's continuing is going to help us do that, given the slower revenue growth environment.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Gabriel Dechaine from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Gabriel Dechaine","Just a quick one on the U.S. margin and the follow-up, one of the factors in your report that explains the decline sequentially was from higher margin loans maturing. I just want to get a sense if that's a one off type situation or if there's a cohort of loans that is slowly repricing through the system and that could be a persistent issue?","Mike Pedersen","Yes, Gabrielle, it's Mike, so I guess just context I'd say on margin our outlook hasn't changed a lot from the last couple of quarters. We said in Q4 and last quarter that while it would bump around a bit quarter by quarter, it would likely be roughly at the Q4 2014 level for the full year this year so in Q1 the margin went up by six basis points and it was then down nine this quarter and this quarters decrease was really due to three things and roughly similar measure. The first was loan margin compression.","The second was strong deposit growth and the third was slower target volumes, so haven't changed our outlook much. As I sit here at the half year mark if there's one thing that looks a little different and this is to your point it is that our loan mix is a bit different than we expect it with stronger than expected growth in sort of the bigger ticket commercial loan bracket and also in auto finance. This is all good business for us and obviously adds net interest income but these are relatively lower margin loans so the mix change may represent a bit of downward pressure in the next couple of quarters but not a lot.","Gabriel Dechaine","And then the restructuring, I'll ask about PCLs actually. Something that in the U.S. actually as well this quarter we saw big reduction year-over-year and I think that's mostly target. I don't want to dwell too much on this quarters, that specific item but it seems like say recurring benefit that TD has been having from credit I estimate one of the biggest beneficiaries of lower credit costs or lower PCL almost over the past several years and these items just keep popping up in a good way for you. I'm just, what does this say about how you've managed the Bank and is the well running dry at some point? Do we have any visibility on more of these types of recoveries taking place?","Mark Chauvin","It's Mark. What we saw in the last quarter was a reduction really. All of the asset classes with the exception of target are kind of running at their normalized level I would refer to it as and with target you had a seasonal reduction volume that did result in that reduction but I would expect it to come back to a more normalized level next quarter and in terms of your more general question I think we're at the point where we're seeing kind of at the low end of the cycle of credit losses and I personally would not expect to see material significant downside going forward, on a positive downside.","Gabriel Dechaine","You keep saying that but we keep seeing loan losses going down.","Mark Chauvin","Ask me next quarter.","Bharat Masrani","We have a great Chief Risk Officer.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Meny Grauman from Cormark Securities. Please go ahead.","Meny Grauman","My question is on the back of the Nordstrom deal but really the Nordstrom target deals together and it's really about I guess bigger pictures, do you have a concern that you're moving into a more monoline relationship in the U.S.? You're solving a short-term problem but do you have a debate internally about the issues longer term? It seems like in both deals cross-selling is limited and provides limited opportunity there and so the question is how big can you go with these deals, target was 6 billion, Nordstrom 2 billion. Is there a certain point where you say enough and how do you think about where that line may be?","Bharat Masrani","I think if you step back to about four years ago and say what were we trying to do with the card business, we were clearly a laggard in the card business and both in Canada and the U.S., we sought out to increase our scale and our performance which in Canada we achieved having a tremendous amount of organic growth of outcomes through our branch sales and then added the MBNA portfolio and Aeroplan portfolio to that. Now in the U.S., we started by having a three pronged approach.","We thought we would take some strategic partners. As I said before I don't view the strategic partner business as one that we're doing more from a market share purpose but more from a strategic and tactical point of view and then we also went to increase our Bank card as well as our retail cart capabilities, so if you look at target, we added a tremendous amount of balances, we developed a very good partnership with a brand name that we're happy with and you look at the we added some capabilities, some terrific talent and we earned a very good amount of credibility in the marketplace and we're able to, we have been able to repeat that with Nordstrom where we're very proud to have a Nordstrom and TD as brands stand side by side as partners. Both of us are very committed to the customer experience. We're a customer centric organizations both of us and we like the transaction.","We like the returns that we're going to get on this. I think we expect the portfolio to grow over time and we expect that we'll continue to deepen our partnerships in various areas but it not just related to the relationship between the retail partners and TD. You have to realize we also get scale with the processes and networks and so it gives us a very good perch from which we can look at the development in the payment space a little more broadly so there's a lot of benefits to this transactions and we're delighted to partner with Nordstrom.","Meny Grauman","And going back to the second part of my long question, is there a dollar value that you have in mind or how do you think about that in terms of how big that business in particular can be?","Bharat Masrani","Well in terms of the dollar value from our risk management perspective, we would look at asset concentration limits and how we think about that internally in relation to the aggregate size of our balance sheet and the capital we have deployed in the business but as I said earlier we aren't looking at these deals from a market share perspective so I don't anticipate that bump up against any of those kinds of considerations for this part of the business.","Meny Grauman","And if I could just sneak one more in. You talked about relating to the brand closing changing in consumer behavior and I wonder if you could explain that in a little more detail. Are you just talking about the use of internet mobile or is there something more going on that you're seeing?","Mike Pedersen","It's Mike. Colleen has pointed to Tim and I so you'll hear from the two of us. So the obvious thing happening with the advent of new ways of banking mobile and online and so on we're seeing transactions in our stores drop by 6-7% a year and that gives us an opportunity both to change and enhance the customer experience and to become more efficient and more productive so the things you're seeing us doing whether it's the heavy investment in digital or the optimization of our store network or the introduction of new smaller stores that are focused on advice and sales as opposed to transactions is all a function of that.","This is also why in the context of the restructuring charge we've revisited a few of the planned openings that we had and had decided not to proceed with 16 of them. These were decisions you Mick on a long time horizon and when we made the decisions to open these stores, it was quite a different environment in terms of customer behavior so as we looked at our new store pipeline we've decided not to move forward with these and again invest in a different part of our distribution systems.","Bharat Masrani","And from a Canadian perspective, the only addition I would make is that not much of what Mike said is also actually applicable to Canada in terms of transaction migrations, branch formats, but the transaction decline in our branches in Canada is about half that rate of the United States and that's generally true of Canada versus the United States industry.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mario Mendonca from TD Securities. Please go ahead.","Mario Mendonca","Colleen can we revisit your answer to Sumit's answer? Without providing hard guidance your answer was still helpful but I want to go one step further. It looks like the restructuring activities will be done by the end of 15. What would be helpful to understand is does the slower expense growth play out in 16 or are you really highlighting 17 as the time frame?","Colleen Johnston","Mario, I would be expecting that the slower growth starts in 16 because the majority of the savings we talked about 2% of the expense base, really about 90% of that number is coming into 2016 and then with real realization into 17 and as we've suggested in our remarks, that our work is also continuing in particular on the organizational review. To date we've done the U.S. in some parts of Canada so we're continuing to work on all areas of productivity.","Mario Mendonca","There is more work to do there obviously. If there were additional restructuring charges in subsequent quarters it would be fair to say those restructuring charges would be significantly smaller than the 337 we saw this quarter?","Colleen Johnston","I think it's hard to estimate at this time, Mario, because the work is ongoing.","Mario Mendonca","Let me flip over to something different, margins. Rather than looking at it on a segmented basis sometimes it's helpful to look at it on a consolidated basis and depending on how you calculate it the margin sequentially was down and I estimate as much as ten basis points which is a fairly significant number for TD. I know it's not domestic retail. We know what's going on in the U.S. that was helpful but it would appear to me there was more going on perhaps in Treasury or on the corporate segment. Did anything play out in Treasury or corporate that would cause the margin to be down that much sequentially?","Colleen Johnston","Let me just check your number. I thought we were down three base us points quarter-over-quarter on the margin.","Mario Mendonca","The way I would do it is take out the trading numbers and try to clean it up for trading. But if that's not a number you can speak to now I'll take it offline.","Colleen Johnston","That's not the way we look at it. We were down three basis points and math Matt icily that makes sense when you think about the U.S. being down nine and Canada being up slightly, so there was a small impact in wholesale but mathematically it was exactly what we expected the total bank to look like.","Mario Mendonca","Okay I'll revisit.","Colleen Johnston","I'd be happy to sit down and go through your math and the way you think about it.","Mario Mendonca","Sure and maybe one final thing then. That was helpful to provide us the outlook on 1-2% from the impact on dividend rental agreements but what would be helpful is to understand how it plays out on the Income Statement. Would it just show up as lower revenue or higher tax rate like a higher reported tax rate? Is that how you think about it?","Colleen Johnston","Yes I'd probably prefer not to get into the details right now. It's a little bit premature and there are different impacts on whether it be on the funding side, whether on the TB side and tax side, so I think it's a bit premature to comment until we know exactly how the rules get bedded down.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Peter Routledge from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.","Peter Routledge","Just a follow-up to the prior question. You mentioned it's 1% to 2% pre-mitigation. Can you give us some color on what mitigation is? Is that new products or is it offsetting trades?","Bob Dorrance","It's Bob, Peter. I think mitigation just means working with the affected counterparties. I think it's somewhat premature and hard to say what that might be given we're still in the consulting phase. We still need to work with the various clients that are impacted or potentially impacted and it will be somewhat a function of what they decide their strategies want to be.","Peter Routledge","Since I have you, Bob, a couple questions. I noticed the RWB reductions for TD overall and it looks like some or most of them are in your segment. Was there an earnings impact, did you sell assets and what would have been the earnings impact of that?","Bob Dorrance","No, there was not an earnings impact, Peter. It was broadly a function of benefit from the movement and exchange rates and how they affected exposures and our derivative portfolios, combined with some improvement in some of the parameters that we've been focused on working with risk a little while and then also the business has been actively trying to manage the optimization of the capital such that we're earning the returns we need to return.","Peter Routledge","It brings up the broader issue, a very strong quarter and I wonder and I know this business is volatile but I wonder to what extent can we look at this quarter's performance as representative of sustainable returns from your growth initiatives, put in place over the past year versus unusual or unsustainable gains that we shouldn't count on.","Bob Dorrance","Yes, I think that gets into the area of unforecastability. What I like to look at is are we actually improving the earnings power that we have in the business such that were Markets to continue to be as constructive as they are, would we earn the same amount and I think we've been focused on is improving our earnings power and as I've talked about in recent times, the amount added in the U.S. dollar space so we continue to grow both our clients on the government institutional and corporate side in U.S. dollars and we grow our products capability in people in U.S. dollars and that's helping significantly I think in the potential for the business.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert Sedran from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Sedran","Would like to ask about the insurance business. As pleasant as the weather is these days it wasn't for much of the quarter so I wouldn't have expected to see that positive claims experience as a driver of the result, so can you give us a sense of what was happening during the quarter and whether this might signal something beyond an unusual quarter and that this business is back into perhaps providing a better growth trajectory than it provided in the last little while?","Bharat Masrani","So as you know over the last couple of years, we've been spending a lot of time in getting the fundamentals right for the business, so a lot of the activity we've undertaken to return the business to search for profitable growth areas and to secondly improve our claims Management process. We've shed some international activity that wasn't adding value and we're continuing to increase investments in the business in the infrastructures and in terms of talent, so the outcome of that is that our revenue claims and expense lines have somewhat been bumpy but the bottom line is definitely getting better and we have happier customers. That being said the second quarter was actually good from a weather perspective.","If you look at the weather out in Alberta February through April its been very warm, so our current year accident claims are down and then we didn't have any really much of catastrophic losses to cover in the quarter, so the outcome of all of that has been that we had a very good bottom line performance but I'm not quite ready to declare that is a run rate.","Robert Sedran","Is there anything incremental you can add about Ontario-Ottawa specifically?","Bharat Masrani","I think the Ontario-Ottawa we've made tremendous progress in making sure that some of the issues that were dogging us in terms of underwriting and pricing are fixed to the extent that we can control those. I think the Ontario budget which is now tabled as Bill 91 continues to show the Ontario governments commitment to control cost, some of which I think will be reinvested in the rate reductions that the government promised to deliver on which so far seems like they are about half way through, so I think that work the government is doing is very productive for driving lower insurance premiums for the customer and to put the industry on a more sustainable framework, on more sustainable footings, so I think what we're seeing is a lot of positive outcomes and of course a lot of the devil will be in the details when the regulations get released so we're going to be anxiously watching that.","Colleen Johnston","Rob, it's Colleen. Maybe I can just make one point to amplify something is just that when I think when you look at the insurance business, you really want to look at revenue net of claims because those numbers do move around between those two lines for various reasons, so but I think the underlying reason for the good claims performance are the reasons that was cited.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Darko Mihelic from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Darko Mihelic","First just a housekeeping question, Colleen and Page 11 of your supplemental line number 14. Can you just remind me what bounces that number around and why is it up so high in Q2 versus Q1 and which business segment benefited from that?","Colleen Johnston","So that's, there's nothing unusual going on in that line. That truly is the non-trading FX and that, those amounts just relate to amounts that are held in various parts of our operations including our branches, so certainly some of that would go into the retail Bank.","Darko Mihelic","And then just getting back to the restructuring discussion. One of the things that you highlight is that the restructuring charges to help slow expenses, the rate of growth because of an increase in necessary investments and higher base costs, can you talk about higher base costs? Can you give us an idea what's driving costs at the base level up? Is it just inflation and what level of growth are we seeing there and do you expect that to elevate from recent growth in cost space?","Colleen Johnston","So when you look at the kinds of things that affect our base, so inflation, merit increases were still giving annual merit increases to our team, cost of doing business across our various businesses, volumes are rising obviously we want to become more efficient and lower our unit costs as well but the reality is that the business of the Bank is growing and as I say those kinds of costs like merit in recent years, pension has certainly with lower rates has been something that has driven up our base costs as well, so again, we need to find ways to make sure that we can offset those increases and afford the investments that I've elaborated on previously.","Darko Mihelic","But is it fair to say that the rate of growth in base cost is somewhat less now than it was say a year or two ago?","Colleen Johnston","I wouldn't necessarily say that, no. Same ballpark.","Darko Mihelic","Same ballpark so that really hasn't changed, okay?","Colleen Johnston","No.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sumit Malhotra from Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.","Sumit Malhotra","Just wanted to check in on a point that Bharat made earlier on the call in that one of the headwinds of the bank expected coming into 2015 was higher tax rates. Now we've certainly heard about the recently the equity derivatives, synthetic equity derivatives, creditor insurance changes. When I look at TD's TB tax rate on an all bank basis in the 21% or 22% range, why hasn't that headwind that you envision played out and I don't know how specific you can get but do you see that headwind being revisited as a potential threat to your earnings growth going forward?","Colleen Johnston","If I step back, Sumit and look at my adjusted effective tax rate in 2014 it was 17.5%, this year my projections would suggest that that effective tax rate will be up maybe a point to a point and a half which again is slightly lower than I'd expected. We had some positive tax items last year and again some of those have recurred but I do expect the direction of the effective tax rate to continue to rise as we head into 2016.","Sumit Malhotra","And that number that you mentioned that's non-TB, right?","Colleen Johnston","Correct.","Sumit Malhotra","Okay, because it doesn't look like on a TB basis or maybe this isn't the best place to do it but it doesn't look like its actually moved that much and I was just curious as to why that's been the case given even Bharat\u2019s comments earlier.","Colleen Johnston","There are various factors that will affect the rate. I tend to look at the adjusted effective tax rate. You're right. The level of tax exempt income will affect that number. In fact it did in this particular quarter which is why our rate looks a bit elevated but the fundamental direction of the effective tax rate is upward.","Operator","Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Bharat Masrani. Please continue.","Bharat Masrani","Thanks very much. So just in conclusion, very good quarter and I want to take this opportunity to thank nearly 85,000 TD folks around the world who continue to deliver for our shareholders. With that, I will conclude the call. Thank you very much, everybody.","Operator","Ladies and Gentlemen this concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation.

Additional information on items of note, the bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to the forward-looking information are all available in our Q4 2015 report to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Rudy and good afternoon, everyone. As Rudy mentioned, Colleen will be up shortly to discuss our financial results in detail, but let me start by sharing my perspectives on our performance.","Overall I am pleased with our results this quarter. The bank generated EPS of CAD1.14, up 16% from a softer quarter in the prior year. Good volume growth, along with positive operating leverage and a stronger U.S. dollar helped drive our results. As expected, we saw increased credit provisions, but quality remains strong.","Our full-year EPS of CAD4.61 was up 8%, a good outcome in mixed market conditions. These results were driven by revenue growth across all of our businesses along with stable credit quality and improvements in productivity. We ended the year with CET1 of 9.9%.","We continue to have strong capital leverage and liquidity ratios and today we announced a CAD9.5 million share buyback program in 2016, subject to regulatory approvals. This is to offset dilution from the dividend reinvestment plan and issuance related to stock options.","Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Canadian retail earnings were up 8%, driven by growth in personal and commercial banking and insurance, strong asset growth in wealth and a healthy increase in loan and deposit volumes. We delivered good operating leverage and credit quality across all products remains high. TD continues to stand out as the brand of choice in the marketplace. J.D. Power recently awarded TD Wealth top honors among the big five banks in its Full Service Investor Satisfaction Survey and Ipsos recognized TD as the best bank in customer service among the big five. 2015 marked the 11th consecutive year that we received this award.","Our U.S. retail earnings were up 5%. We continue to deliver above-average volume growth and good expense management while maintaining solid credit quality. Our U.S. wealth business has good momentum exceeding CAD100 billion in assets under management for the first time. This quarter, we completed our acquisition of Nordstrom's Visa and private-label card portfolio. This builds upon our leadership position in the North American credit card business.","What's more? TD Bank, America's most convenient bank, continues to earn accolades in the marketplace. Money magazine named us the best big bank in America for the third year in a row. And for the second time, J.D. Power ranked TD as the best small business bank in the Northeast.","On both sides of the border, our retail businesses are facing margin pressures due to the prolonged low interest rate environment. It is difficult to predict exactly when rates will rise and at what pace. Until they do, I am confident that our diverse business mix and business model centered around organic growth will continue to drive positive results.","TD securities had a very good year as well. Full-year earnings were up 7%, driven by solid trading results and strong loan growth. In Canada, we continue to win more key deals. And south of the border, we are seeing good progress in growing our corporate, government and investor client businesses by leveraging our local scale and network. The U.S. represents a significant growth area for our wholesale business.","In 2015, TD made progress on the expense front and delivered positive operating leverage despite the low growth environment and continued investments to drive future growth. The difficult measures we took this year to permanently reduce our cost structure and increase expense discipline were necessary and effective. We took this step to streamline our processes, add capacity to invest in the future and moderate our ongoing expense growth. Most importantly, the organizational review which is largely behind us, will enhance our competitiveness by making us more agile and bring us closer to the customer.","Now let me comment on our three key priorities for 2016. First, we will focus on organic growth. We have growth opportunities across all of our businesses and a proven track record of delivering against them. In Canadian personal and business banking, we will take market share in underrepresented products and geographies. In wealth, we will reaffirm our leadership in direct investing and accelerate our growth initiatives to capture share in the mass affluent and high net worth segments.","In the U.S., we are well positioned to benefit from an improving economy. We expect to continue outgrowing the competition driving profitability, both by attracting new customers and deepening relationships with our existing base. And in TD Securities, we will further leverage our brand and capabilities to target key segments and grow our U.S. presence.","Second, we will continue to adapt and innovate. New technologies provide us with opportunities to extend our leadership position in service and convenience. TD will lead new initiatives, make new investments and form new partnerships in the digital space over the coming years. Our focus will remain on providing our customers with a truly seamless experience wherever, whenever and however they want to bank.","To this end, we will further modernize and simplify our information technology infrastructure and invest in our omnichannel capabilities. You will also see our retail space adapt in innovating ways that help us enhance our personalized advice and human experiences. This is what helps differentiate TD, both from traditional and nontraditional players. We have the high-tech high-touch bank.","Finally, we will remain relentlessly committed to improving productivity. We will further simplify our processes, optimize our physical distribution costs and improve our sales efficiency. These efforts will free up more of our people's trying to serve TD customers and clients and free up more of our bank's resources to reinvest in our growth strategies.","Let me now comment on the economic environment and what it means for TD going forward. In Canada, we expect modest GDP growth of around 2%. Sustained low energy prices is a headwind to the economy and despite that our business model positions us for growth. In the U.S., robust spending in domestic sectors is expected to offset some weakness in exports, which on an overall basis should position us for continued growth and outperformance.","When it comes to earnings growth outlook, our aspirations have not changed. Our objective remains to deliver 7% to 10% EPS growth over the medium-term. For 2016, we expect earnings to benefit from strong growth in loans, deposits and wealth assets, prudent expense management and the likely impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and possible U.S. interest rate hikes. However, while credit quality is expected to remain strong, provisions will likely normalize and we will see a higher effective tax rate. On balance, it is difficult to see how we will get into our medium-term range in 2016.","To conclude, I couldn't be more proud of nearly 85,000, TD bankers around the world who continue to deliver for our shareholders year-in and year-out. Thank you for your efforts.","With that, let me turn it over to Colleen.","Colleen Johnston","Well, thanks Bharat and good afternoon, everyone.","Please turn to slide four. Before we look at the fourth quarter in detail, let's start with a brief review of 2015. For the full-year, total bank adjusted net income was CAD8.8 billion, up 8% from 2014. Adjusted EPS was $4.61, also up 8%.","Our retail businesses had a great year. Canadian retail delivered strong earnings growth of 8%, driven by good growth in loans, deposits and wealth asset, net of margin compression, lower credit losses, higher insurance earnings and positive operating leverage. U.S. retail earnings grew 21%, reflecting good organic growth and the stronger U.S. dollar.","In U.S. dollars earnings grew by 5% due to strong loan and deposit growth, steady credit performance, good expense management and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by margin compression and lower security gains.","Wholesale banking earnings increased 7% this year, due largely to strong top line growth. The corporate segment loss increased in 2015, due largely to nonrecurring positive items in 2014. We were pleased to achieve positive operating leverage for the year. We finished the year with a CET1 ratio of 9.9%. Overall, a good performance from our businesses in 2015.","Please turn to slide five. This quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of CAD 1.14, up 16% year-over-year. The quarter reflected strong results for Canadian and U.S. retail up 10% and 6%, respectively. Wholesale delivered earnings growth of 23% versus a soft Q4 in 2014. The corporate segment loss posted a loss of CAD 161 million. We continue to benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar.","Adjusted total revenue increased 11% year-over-year, net of claims or 3.5% excluding FX and acquisitions, led by good loan deposit and wealth asset growth, higher insurance premium growth and higher fee-based and trading revenue. Growth was partially offset by margin compression. Adjusted expense growth was 7% year-over-year, or down 1.1% excluding FX and acquisitions. Quarter-over-quarter, expenses rose CAD62 million on the same basis. We achieved strong positive operating leverage in the quarter. Overall, a strong finish to the year.","Please turn to slide six. This slide presents our reported and adjusted earnings this quarter with the difference due to four items of note. This quarter, we completed the second phase of our productivity review representing a CAD349 million pretax restructuring charge. I will comment further on this later in my presentation. We have also incurred CAD51 million charge after-tax related to the Nordstrom transaction.","Please turn to slide seven. Canadian retail delivered a strong quarter with adjusted net income of CAD1.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year. The increase was driven by continued good loan and deposit volume growth, wealth asset growth, lower credit losses, higher insurance earnings and good expense management. Loan and deposit growth continued at a good pace in Q4 2015. Total loan growth was 5% year-over-year with real estate secured lending volume up 5%, business lending growth up 9% and auto lending up 16%. Deposits increased by 6% due to strong growth in core checking and savings accounts, which were up 10%. Business deposits grew 5%. In addition, wealth management assets were up 7%, mainly driven by new client money.","The margin declined for basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to deposit margin compression and seasonal factors, very similar to our experience in last year's Q4. We expect margins to continue to remain under modest downward pressure, depending on product mix and competitive factors. PCLs decreased 12% year-over-year due largely to business banking PCLs which declined CAD26 million year-over-year, driven by higher recoveries. Adjusted expenses were flat versus last year, reflecting productivity savings from strong expense management, partially offset by higher revenue-based compensation in wealth.","For fiscal 2015, Canadian retail produce 135 basis points of positive operating leverage when insurance claims are netted from revenue. Overall, a strong result for Canadian retail. I should note that in 2016, we expect lower tax benefits in our insurance business of CAD30 million to CAD35 million per quarter due to legislative tax changes.","Please turn to slide eight. U.S. retail, excluding TD Ameritrade, posted adjusted earnings of $407 million, up 6% from Q4 2014. Results for the quarter reflected strong organic volume growth and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher PCLs. The fourth quarter included one month of the Nordstrom acquisition.","Revenue increased 6% year-over-year due to strong volume growth, broad-based fee growth and the addition of Nordstrom, partially offset by margin compression. Strong loan and deposit growth continued in the quarter. Total loan growth was a strong 12% year-over-year with a 5% increase in personal loans and a 17% increase in business loans. Average deposits increased by 7%.","Margin increased nine basis points quarter-over-quarter, with just over half of the increase attributable to the acquisition of Nordstrom's credit card portfolio. The balance of the increase was driven by balance sheet mix and accretion. We expect margins to remain under modest downward pressure in 2016.","PCL increased 47% year-over-year due mainly to provisions related to the flooding in South Carolina and the Nordstrom acquisition. Expenses increased 5% year-over-year, mainly due to the impact of Nordstrom, higher legal costs and investing for business growth, partially offset by ongoing productivity savings. Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade in U.S. dollars increased 9% year-over-year due primarily to strong asset growth and higher transaction revenue. Overall, a strong result from the U.S. bank this quarter.","Please turn to slide nine. Net income for wholesale was CAD196 million, up a strong 23% from a soft quarter last year. Revenue increased 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher trading related revenue, corporate lending growth and the positive impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by lower debt and equity underwriting fees. Prior year results included a reserve build for FVA. Noninterest expenses were up 2%, driven primarily by the impact of foreign exchange and higher operating expenses, partly offset by lower variable compensation. ROE this quarter was 13%.","Please turn to slide 10. The corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of CAD161 million in the quarter compared to a loss of CAD165 million in the same period last year. The slightly lower loss was a result of lower net corporate expenses, partially offset by higher incurred but not yet identified credit losses due to higher loan volumes and some modest credit migration.","Please turn to slide 11. Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.9% in the fourth quarter versus 10.1% in Q3. The decrease was driven primarily by the impact of the Q4 restructuring charge and growth in RWA due to strong loan growth in wholesale and the U.S., including the acquisition of Nordstrom. Both our leverage and liquidity ratios are consistent with last quarter. We announced our intention to launch an NCIB for 9.5 million or approximately 500 million of common shares subject to regulatory approval. This is primarily to offset the share issuance for the dividend reinvestment plan and stock option exercises. Overall, we remain well-positioned for the evolving regulatory and capital environment.","Please turn to slide 12. With respect to the restructuring charge announced today, the CAD243 million after-tax amount reflects the second phase of our productivity review which was first recorded in the second quarter of 2015. Similar to Q2, the second phase of the review focused on three key areas, process redesign and business restructuring, retail branch and retail real estate optimization and an organizational review. The expected ongoing annual savings from the restructuring are approximately CAD600 million once fully realized in 2017. Some of this will be reinvested back into the business to fund technology and digital innovation.","With that, now let me turn it over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 13. We have had another good quarter to close out a strong year from a credit quality perspective. The increase in provision for credit losses during the quarter was attributed to one-time provisions of $34 million to account for the South Carolina floods, $18 million in provisions relating to two borrowers in the oil and gas segment and lastly an increase in incurred but not yet identified provision for losses largely due to volume growth. The full-year annual provision for credit loss rate was constant year-over-year at 34 basis points. Gross impaired loans remained stable at 58 basis points, up two basis points year-over-year. Based on current economic forecasts, we would expect 2016 performance to be largely in line with 2015.","I would like to speak in more detail to two specific areas. First, this quarter we saw an increase of $140 million in gross impaired loans resulting from the renewal of legacy HELOC interest only products which are no longer offered by the U.S. bank. Let me take a minute to explain why this occurs and why we don't believe it will result in material increase in credit losses.","If a customer does not qualify under current underwriting standards when their interest only HELOC comes due to renewal, we are required to classify the exposure impaired based on regulatory guidance, even if the customer is still making their payments. To put this into perspective, of the total U.S. legacy interest only HELOC impaired population, 90% are current with their payments. We expect this trend in increased gross HELOC impaired loans to continue during 2016 leveling off by year-end. Based on the current strength of the U.S. economy, increasing home prices and existing reserve levels, we do not expect to experience material increase in HELOC credit losses in 2016.","Next, with respect to our oil and gas exposure, we were not surprised by the level of impaired loan formations this quarter. Ongoing analysis indicates that the oil and gas nonretail credit portfolio continues to perform within expectations, given the current level in near-term outlook for commodity prices in this sector. We are beginning to see signs of deterioration in the oil impacted provinces consumer credit portfolios, which again are well within our earlier expectations. Based on ongoing stress tests conducted against the credit portfolios, I remain comfortable that the potential impact of low energy prices on the bank's credit losses remains well within the range of a 5% to 10% increase over 2015 levels.","With that, I will turn the presentation back to Colleen.","Rudy Sankovic","Sorry. Operator, can we turn it over for questions, please? So I will turn it over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go ahead with our first question from Gabriel Dechaine of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Gabriel Dechaine","Good afternoon. The general allowance, you talked about the overall growth in the loan book, but also some migration. I am wondering if the migration issue is related at all to some of the data I am seeing in your supplement here on page 76. It shows a big increase, CAD9 billion, quarter-over-quarter, in RWAs for corporate exposures. And then if I look at page 66, there is a fair bit of migration into the noninvestment grade category in the lower end of the investment grade category. Are those related? And if not, what was behind the capital move?","Mark Chauvin","Hello, it's Mark. Maybe I will take the provision question first of the allowance. The increase in the general allowances, the old terminology for it, which I continue to use, was really two-thirds volume growth. So just an increase of business activities and there is no other growth in the various sectors, which you pointed out and I would say about one-third of it would be migration in the oil and gas sector because we had anticipated through the lower oil prices that this would increase, the accounts would drift down into lower noninvestment grade or even into the non-pass grade and that's living within the expectations that we originally expected. And originally we also expected that it would be relatively small in the impaired area and that's been consistent with what we thought as well.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. And the capital?","Bharat Masrani","Gabriel, this is Bharat. I am not understanding the question related to capital.","Gabriel Dechaine","In your RWA disclosure, big increases in RWAs for corporate exposures? And then in --","Bharat Masrani","Volume growth.","Gabriel Dechaine","That's volume growth. Okay.","Colleen Johnston","Just on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we did have strong RWA growth. And as I mentioned, it was mainly in the U.S. bank as well as in the wholesale side. And that's business volume.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. And then just my bigger picture question. Colleen, you said some of the CAD600 million would be reinvested. What does that mean? Proportionally, how much is reinvested? How much is falling to the bottom line, if you will? And then I guess, Bharat as well, going through these big changes and big restructuring, we just see the numbers, but is it making it more difficult to manage the bank or to manage the culture? More specifically, TD may have been historically more of a revenue focused bank, at least in my opinion and drilling down this cost culture, I wonder how much of an impact that's having on the bank and your strategies?","Colleen Johnston","So Gabriel, why don't I start? So I did mention the CAD600 million in savings by 2017. So we had about CAD100 million savings in 2015, about CAD400 in 2016 and then another CAD100 million or so in 2017. So it takes a while to fully phase that in. I will just step you through sort of the math and the way we think about our overall rate of expense growth and I know I have done this before, but I will just step back in terms of the general math.","So it we look at 2015, we did have higher investment in projects and initiatives and that drove on its own about 2% expense growth and our base expenses grew by about 3%. So that's, I will get into an explanation of that as well. But then we achieved productivity savings, which then reduced our expenses probably by about 2%. And we also had a few positive nonrecurring items this year that helped us. And then remain growth was due to higher direct drive variable compensation.","So I explain a few of the amounts of projects and initiative. As we have mentioned, we are investing more in our digital and mobile capabilities, technology modernization and transformation and it's important there to be able to increase our agility and reduce costs, regulatory infrastructure, particularly areas like Dodd Frank. So an increasing project portfolio also impacts depreciation costs going forward because some of our project costs are capitalized. So that gives rise to an increased investment in projects and initiatives.","And then base expenses, we have things like merit [ph] and volume growth as well. But then, we obviously do try to bring our unit costs down. So then obviously looking ahead, as revenue growth remains challenging, we need to make sure that we can reduce our expense growth and that's where we restructuring does come into play in some of the numbers that I just mentioned. And the name of the game at the end of the day is to try to moderate our rate of expense growth and I think you certainly saw us do that in 2015.","Bharat Masrani","And Gabriel, this is Bharat. On the second part of your question, in a simplistic way revenue growth, again this is simplistic, comes in two ways, at least from TD's perspective. First and foremost is in our performance, our desire to grow the bank and we make share on a consistent basis and that part of the revenue growth continues to be the story at TD and I feel great that we are not losing our mojo on that.","The second part of revenue growth comes from the macro environment. And what we have seen over the recent past and we have been talking about it, is that the operating environment is challenging and that part of the growth for the oil industry is challenging and hence you see how revenues have worked out. So I think you know your supposition that we are losing our revenue focus and revenue mojo would be incorrect in the way I look at it.","With respect to driving cost down and looking at that side of our P&L, I would say that, this is nothing new to this bank. It is very much part of our culture to adapt to the environment we find ourselves in. When you have a low growth revenue environment, the way I described it, we will adapt and we will adapt to make sure that our business model continues to be viable and that we are investing for the future and there is lot of forces here. Most of them are positive, in fact, from my perspective, but it requires investment and that's what we are doing. We are adapting to the environment as we have done many, many times before and I would consider that to be one of the strengths of TD.","Gabriel Dechaine","Well, I wasn't implying you were going to lose revenue focus but thanks for the answer there. And Tim and Colleen, it's been a pleasure dealing with you over the last few years. Good luck in your new roles and hopefully we cross paths again.","Tim Hockey","Thank you.","Colleen Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steve Theriault of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Steve Theriault","Thanks very much. Just to follow-up to start a little bit. Bharat, you said in your opening remarks that your organizational review is largely behind you. After Q2 charge, you made it known that there was another one likely on the way in Q4. So my question is, is that it on the restructuring front for the foreseeable future? Or is there the possibility of a Phase 3 coming over the course of 2016?","Bharat Masrani","The current program that I talked about in Q2 is now, we are at the tail-end of it. It is complete. And that's the best way I can answer your question. Never is a long time, Steve. So I don't want to be commenting multiple years here. But the phase that I talked about in Q2 and the difficult decisions we to have make around it to reposition the bank as we have done is now complete.","Steve Theriault","Okay. So not forever, but certainly over the next year or so, you wouldn't expect to see anything else?","Bharat Masrani","This phase is complete, yes.","Steve Theriault","Yes. Okay. And then seeing some even better momentum this quarter in indirect auto in Canada and in the U.S., so for Tim and\/or Mike, just wanted to confirm that this momentum's coming from prime and super-prime segments? Are you getting any more comfortable waiting a little bit more into the near prime space? I know you flagged some new systems as a catalyst for growth. So now you have had some time, I guess to use those systems. You have seen some acceleration. Can you talk about the kind of growth you are expecting maybe next year and maybe comment on the competitive environment generally, particularly in the U.S.?","Tim Hockey","So why don't I start in Canada and look backwards as opposed to forward a little bit maybe. And so you saw the 16% growth. As you know, the prime book that we have is about a little less than 90% of the total book and in fact it was growing much faster than our non-prime segment throughout 2015. That's largely driven by, in fact almost predominantly driven, the growth in originations year-over-year in the subvented loans which are, from our point of view, a higher degree of profitability. Even with lower margin, they actually have even lower PCL rates. So we are quite comfortable that it's a combination of a strong auto market as you saw in North America, number one and that we are not going any way of the risk curve and in fact with our relationships with OEMs, we are quite comfortable that we can grow a profitable subvented business. Going forward in Canada we see similar trends but probably not taking the share that we have in this past year.","Mike Pedersen","It's Mike. From a U.S. perspective, you have probably seeing how strong auto sales have been in the U.S. Record levels for the last three months. And we are doing very well in this environment. To answer your question, our growth is overwhelmingly in the super prime and prime segments and we are gaining share there. Our current mix is about 60% super prime, less than 10% near prime and the rest is prime. So very, very high quality credits and the credit metrics are excellent. I would say that we look at this on an ongoing basis, depending on what's going on in the sector in terms of pricing margins and so on. So we will swing from those numbers from time to time, but the growth is very good.","I would just add that in the U.S., this is a business where service matters. And as you know, that's something TD is very good at. And in our U.S. auto business this year we have moved from number 14 in J.D. Power to number three this year because of some of the changes we have made recently. So that's part of what's driving our good growth.","Steve Theriault","And is the end result of the new systems better distribution into the dealers? Or does it lend more comfort to your underwriting standards over time? Maybe I don't understand the new systems well enough.","Tim Hockey","I think it's a little bit of both. There was a bit of bumpiness last year in Canada when we introduced it. So some of the share gain is getting through that, frankly and as Mike said, better service to the dealer gets better response times and so as a result that helps you build share.","Steve Theriault","Okay. Thanks. And Tim and Colleen, my congratulations as well. All the best.","Tim Hockey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will comes from the line of Meny Grauman of Cormark Securities. Please go ahead.","Meny Grauman","Hi. Good afternoon. Mark, you mentioned deterioration in consumer credit in oil provinces. I am wondering if you could just be more specific in terms of what you are seeing? What's that deterioration that you are referring to?","Mark Chauvin","Yes. So we have been watching it very closely, especially the impacted provinces, which would be Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland. And what we are seeing in two categories, being the indirect auto but the non-prime segment primarily and then in the card segment, we have seen a gradual increase in delinquency rates over the last four or five months. And they haven't translated into a very large PCL at this point. I would say in the cards, it's really somewhat de minimis. But we are seeing it in the non-prime auto which is maybe in the single digits. So CAD4 million to CAD5 million range that we would attribute in the Q4.","So in many respects we look at that as an early indicator because that would be the customer that maybe would be more challenged than the typical customer. Now, I would stress that these two categories are less than 1% of our total book and that we expected to see losses of this level. So after a couple quarters of saying we haven't seen them yet, now we are starting to see them. But they are not changing our view or my expectations relative to the impacts. It's kind of just being consistent to what we thought.","Meny Grauman","All right. Thanks for that. And then maybe just a bigger picture question for Bharat or Tim. Seems like Canadian P&C banking is getting tougher and not just related to macro development. It seems like lagging competitors are getting better and strategies are seeming to converge. I am just wondering what your perspective is? And what you are seeing in terms of competitive dynamics? And how they are changing more recently?","Tim Hockey","Meny, it's Tim. I think that's true. The competitive elements because the space itself in traditional retail banking has always been our basic bread-and-butter and I think it will be more competitive. But this is a team that, as Bharat has said, adopts and I could probably say, I haven't been here many years that I have never seen the innovation quotient inside the organization as high it is right now, which is a wonderful thing to say and it's all centered on serving our customers better. And so you will start to see some great things in the future rollouts just as you have in the past that will continue to keep us at the forefront of competitiveness.","Meny Grauman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sohrab Movahedi of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sohrab Movahedi","Thank you. Tim, just on Canadian retail, 2013, 2014, 2015, the mix ratio on an adjusted basis has been in the 42.2 to 42.7 range. So is that about as good as it is going to get? Or is there opportunity with some of these restructuring charges and the like that that number can drift lower?","Tim Hockey","Well, I am tempted to make predictions but I am looking at Terry next to me and I don't think that's probably a good idea going forward. Look, we have constantly been striving for an ever lower mix ratio. But over the last decade, a good portion of that has been through increasing operating leverage as a result of strong revenues. So as you know, even with the restructuring charges and with a lower expense growth environment, it is also a lower revenue growth environment. So our target continues to be to reduce the efficiency ratio even lower but that will probably slow over the next period of time with low revenue.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay. And Mike, last year this time around you provided some metrics around I think number of products per customer or something that you would track up internally, as to how well you are deepening the relationship with your customers in the U.S. Do you have what whatever metric that you measure? Or what is that this year versus last year?","Mike Pedersen","Yes. So it's up in all of the respects that I measured last year. I am very pleased with the progress we are making on deepening relationships and that goes for retail, for small business, for commercial, for corporate. This is a broad effort across the entire U.S. bank. The ones I have probably mentioned last year are ones like these. So one thing we measure is how many products and services does a customer sign-up for when they are brand new, i.e. when they come into our store for the first time. And in 2014 that was 2.7 products and services. It's now 4.3, which is a terrific increase. And even in the last quarter, it was up another six basis points.","An example of that is that it used to be that new customers, 37% of them would walk out with a savings account, it's now 61%. Another thing I might have shared was for existing customers. So this is all our eight million customers and when we began this in 2014 they had 4.82 products and services per household. We measure it in households for existing customers. A year ago that had gone up to 5.17. We are now at 5.46. And that was up seven basis points in the fourth quarter. And as an example of the progress there, our card penetration when we began was at 9.6% of households, it's now at 15.3% of households.","So really good progress. On commercial banking, for example, I will stop now, but there are our referrals to, our closed referrals to wealth and treasury management are both up by more than 25% year-over-year. So this is a major focused going well.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay. Perfect. I am sorry. I am going to sneak in one last one here. Since 2012, lots of focus on the cards business, MBNA, Aeroplan, Nordstrom. About, by my math let's say a couple of billion dollars of capital deployed, but probably close to CAD500 million, CAD550 million of integration and various other after-tax charge as well. Are you getting the types of IRRs you expected to get from these portfolios?","Riaz Ahmed","Sohrab, it's Riaz. So the short answer to your question is yes. I think if you look at the target acquisition and then the portfolio acquisition there and then we added Nordstrom to it, I think you can safely assume that we are very happy with those deals because they contribute a fair bit to our understanding of the business and also as we, in the longer term, think about how we could pursue more servicing retain deals.","And in Canada Aeroplan, as we had indicated earlier, we are now the lead issuer and if you look at the premium we paid to get Aeroplan was rather little. So that has been a transaction that has worked out nicely for you us and as we continue to work that asset and work with Aimia, we have a very improved relationship. We have got some fantastic product improvements that we continue to work on. And so that relationship has been very good for us.","On the MBNA side, we acquired a good capability there and you can see in our numbers that we are beginning to grow that business again and it's starting to edge our balances back up again. So I am very pleased with that. And I think, again, over time the platform that we have there will prove out to be very strategic to us in how we develop the U.S. business as well. So yes, I am very happy with the overall acquisitions and how they are doing.","Sohrab Movahedi","So like, for example, you would have factored in this 50 after-tax this quarter on the Nordstrom acquisition?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Sedran of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Sedran","Hi. Good afternoon. Mike, I am used to CAT losses in TD Insurance but less so in the banking businesses. I am curious what kind of loans we are talking about in South Carolina related to that flood? What kind of security may or may not be attached to them? What kind of assumptions you have around the performance of those loans.","Mike Pedersen","Yes. It's Mike. Most of it is residential real estate loans. There is some small business, some commercial.","Robert Sedran","So was the expectation that the flooded property is worthless and therefore the loans are, as well? Or is there some collection assumed on that?","Mark Chauvin","So it's Mark. The difference was that the properties that were impacted were in areas that would not normally flood. Therefore, they didn't have flood insurance. So it was largely the fact that they are not insured.","Robert Sedran","Okay. So, the loan is effectively worthless then in those cases?","Mark Chauvin","No, I would not say that. I think that would be extreme. It's proven that we have a situation in Alberta that was very similar and that wasn't the case. But the reality is, there is an assessment made of the properties and the areas where the insurance was less and we just did what we thought was an appropriate reserving level.","Robert Sedran","Can you give a sense of the LTV on these loans?","Mark Chauvin","No, I wouldn't have that detail at this point.","Robert Sedran","All right. Maybe I will follow up. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sumit Malhotra of Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks. Good afternoon. For Bharat or Colleen, when I look at page two of your supplement, you give us your efficiency ratio on an enterprise basis, adjusted. And I think it's been three years now that this ratio has moved in the wrong direction for the bank. Now that you have taken this level of restructuring charges in 2015, do you think we are at the stage now where, whether it's an official target or at least a goal of being able to deliver positive operating leverage or lower efficiency on an all bank basis for TD, becomes a more realistic objective going forward?","Colleen Johnston","Sumit, I will start. It's Colleen. So when you look at that efficiency ratio as published, we don't show that, net of claims revenue, net of claims, which is actually really the way we think of when we think of operating leverage, because there is a lot of revenue items that move between revenue and claims in the insurance business. So we think that's sort of the better way to look at it. So obviously, on that basis, we did achieve positive operating leverage for 2015 which would indicate an improvement in the efficiency ratio.","So I will turn it over to Bharat to talk about his view of the ability to drive positive operating leverage going forward.","Bharat Masrani","Hi Sumit. So of course our goal, our aspiration is to generate positive operating leverage. What we have said is that there may be instances and sometimes it takes a few quarters where there are compelling investment needs as well. We never want to give up the opportunity to make the right investments for future growth. And that's how we have been running the bank for many, many years. So there could be instances where we are not achieving our goal, but our overall aspiration and goal is to drive operating leverage for the whole bank.","Sumit Malhotra","And in the aftermath of the restructuring, do you think this is something you can deliver more consistently in the coming years? Or is a lot of that benefit offset elsewhere in your view?","Bharat Masrani","No, as Colleen mentioned, our expectation is that the restructuring charge will continue to allow us to make the right investments, but it will also result in the lower expense growth than you might have seen previously. So we say our expense growth will be more moderated going forward, thanks to the restructuring efforts that we undertook as well allow us the capacity to reinvest. And investment, we feel, is important. That's the way TD has been able to drive growth consistently and we feel that we should continue doing that.","Sumit Malhotra","Well and then quickly for Mike Pedersen, when I look at your business on a constant currency basis, 5% earnings growth in 2015, but for all that, for all my questions about expense growth it looks like your expenses were actually outright down along with provisions. Your outlook calls for another year of moderate growth in earnings. In your view however, is this to be driven more by revenue now? Or is that a piece of the puzzle that you still see as challenged heading into 2016?","Mike Pedersen","Yes. So it's a good question. So the outlook is basically that in the absence of rate increases, we still expect modest growth and that's because we expect good volume growth and good expense management. But we do think will have margin pressure, although perhaps more moderate than this year and we think PCLs will normalize. And then there is always potential regulatory headwinds and so on.","On expenses, we will invest in the business, but we do want to see positive operating leverage in the coming year and rate increases would obviously be a revenue upside in that respect. The expenses in 2015 for the full-year were down over 2014, if you take out Nordstrom. So we are very pleased with that. I don't think will repeat that in 2016. We are investing in digital, in our sales forces, new stores, technology, regulatory stuff and we have of course got inflation and so on. But as I said, expect positive operating leverage in 2016 for the U.S. business.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Peter Routledge of National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.","Peter Routledge","Hi. Thanks. A quick one for Tim. On page 16 of the presentation, you show the net interest margin for Canadian retail. And I understand why deposit margins might be dropping. But I was curious as to why loan margins weren't rising, particularly since it looks like indirect auto is your fastest growing asset class.","Tim Hockey","So of the four basis points of the Canadian retail, three at the P&C level, essentially we had, as you noticed a couple basis points due to lower deposit margins. We have about one that's from, as we always have in Q4, seasonally lower real estate mortgage breakage activity and then there is a number that is basically smaller items which are sort of balance sheet mix. As you know, there is a prime-BA compression effects that is happening. But it was sort of late in the quarter. So that would be a small effect. Although that probably would be a bit larger in Q1. But I would say, overall other than those factors, it continues to be quite a competitive environment. I would say mortgage margins in particular in Q4 were more under pressure than you normally would have seen.","Peter Routledge","Okay. And then coming back to the capital question, I notice on the same schedule Gabe referenced, RWAs in your standardized class are growing much faster than in your internal ratings base. So wonder what dynamics are going on that is causing that?","Bharat Masrani","Peter, the growth that Mike referred to in the U.S. bank were on standardized basis for the U.S. bank, right.","Peter Routledge","Yes. So that's where I am going. If you were to be able to shift the U.S. bank from standardized or parts of the U.S. bank from standardized to internal, what does that do to your RWA inflation? I mean, absent any one-time change in RWA, on a roll forward basis, do you get less RWA inflation when you get to internal ratings based approach?","Bharat Masrani","I think Peter, that we would. Although as you know, AIRB approach is also more procyclical. So you would get lower inflation, but you might get more volatility.","Peter Routledge","Okay. And where are you in terms of moving from standardized to AIRB in the U.S.?","Mark Chauvin","Peter, it's Mark. So our applications have been filed with OSFI. So we are really doing it for Canadian rules. And really our expected timeline to hear is sometime in 2016.","Peter Routledge","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mario Mendonca of TD Securities. Please go ahead.","Mario Mendonca","Good afternoon. A question perhaps for Riaz. The bank's Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, 9.9%, leverage ratio 3.7%, tied for the lowest in the group in both cases. What I am trying to understand is, from your perspective, the bank's perspective, does TD's business mix support a lower capital ratio? It might be lower leverage ratio. Is that something that is tolerable because of the business mix?","Riaz Ahmed","When we had undertaken a deeper examination of the capital ratios and how they might behave under various scenarios Mario, we remain very comfortable and so I think that where we are at CET1 now and leverage ratio feels fine to me.","Mario Mendonca","And these scenarios clearly are informed by the business mix then? Like, that's the reason why you don't get the volatility. Is that fair?","Riaz Ahmed","No, we are not, for example in the deeper subprime businesses is an example. And as I mentioned earlier, our U.S. bank is also on a standardized basis and we have a lower risk wholesale dealer. So I think that you would expect all that to be consistent with our results.","Mario Mendonca","Okay. Just taking this one step further then and this is a discussion on ROE. It's the issue that's been running through my mind a lot lately. TD is the only bank that doesn't provide an ROE outlook. And I bring this up in the context of the CET1 because if we were to try to normalize for that CET1, then TD's ROE would be still lower. And it's also entirely reasonable to expect that the ROE drops further in 2016 given everything we are talking about. The nature of the question is this, when the senior executive team sits down to meet on various issues, does ROE and an ROE outlook, does that get any air time at all?","Riaz Ahmed","Mario, we continue to look at ROE very much so. I think if you look at our capital mix and say that, it is the appropriate ROE mix. We have to also look at the fact that we acquired a fair number of our businesses and particularly the U.S. segment. So you have to look at our ROE. We have never written anything off in the past. So if you are doing a peer analysis, you have to sort of look at that and adjust for those as well, because people tend to forget what you did for meeting the past. So I think overall we feel comfortable and I think where our ROEs are currently, I think is a reasonable place to be given the market conditions we are in now.","Bharat Masrani","This is Bharat. Let me add something to it. Of course we look at ROE. And returns are important to the bank. And I think in addition to what Riaz just said, it is also important to see what kind of operating ROEs we are generating out of our businesses, because that is very important to us as we know whether we are generating good returns on organic growth strategies, which is a key pillar for our success going forward and I feel quite comfortable that on an operating basis not only in many cases we are outperforming many of our competitors, but we are showing healthy levels on a consistent basis. So I just wanted to make sure that that perspective is added as well.","Mario Mendonca","It's a sincere question because the markets awarded TD the highest multiple. So maybe the answer is, it doesn't matter. That's kind of why I was asking the question. I appreciate your time.","Bharat Masrani","That's a good question. And I think the bottom line is, of course we look at returns in everything we do. It's an important metric. But it is important to keep our history and I think you rightly pointed out, the business model we have and what concentrations we have in retail versus wholesale and the type of retail businesses we do, all that plays into what kind of risk-adjusted returns you should expect from the bank.","Mario Mendonca","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Darko Mihelic of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Darko Mihelic","Hi. Thank you. A question for Mike. Just so with respect to the NIM being up nine basis points, half of that being to Nordstrom, what was the other half up for? And then secondly, why do you maintain such a dour look on margins? Given that Nordstrom is only in there for one month in this quarter, so presumably it will have a nice positive impact for the rest of next year. What is it that's causing such a dour look on margins?","Mike Pedersen","Yes. So I wasn't talking about the Nordstrom effect, Darko. So like ex-Nordstrom. So to answer your first question, a little over half of it was Nordstrom. The other was mostly mix. So we had strong loan growth and then there was a bit of accretion. And those things offset some loan margin compression. And so if you look at the loan margin compression and you will see this with the other banks, we continue to see some pressure there, probably in the neighborhood of three basis points in the quarter. I think that will continue but moderate going into 2016. But that is a core trend still and the issue is that higher margin loans are rolling off than what were originating. So market forces aside, it should start to abate late in 2016 and into 2017 depending on the category. So as I look out at the margin outlook for 2016, I still think that take out Nordstrom and what else may happen in terms of mix and accretion and so on, that there are core pressures both on loan and deposit margins. Obviously a rate increase or two would also help that. But that's the context of my comments.","Darko Mihelic","And just to confirm, there's nothing on the tractoring side that's changed.","Mike Pedersen","No.","Darko Mihelic","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would not like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bharat Masrani for closing remarks.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you very much, operator. Just to conclude, great quarter, very happy with the progress we are making in the bank, good year-over-year performance and looking forward to 2016 or a good start to 2016. So I will just take a minute to recognize some executives that you have dealt with over many years. We have new positions, new responsibilities for some of them. The first three I will mention is Riaz, Tim and Terry. I think many of you met with them and dealt with them. So I wanted to thank them for building the bank we have and looking forward to working with them in their new positions as they add even more value to the TD shareholder. And I also want to take this opportunity to thank Colleen. This is Colleen's 40th investor call, as the bank's CFO and you have dealt with her on an ongoing basis. Colleen obviously has done a terrific job for the bank. Thank you for that, Colleen. And I know you have set the bar very high for Riaz. And I am sure he will be thinking about that through the holidays. Thanks very much and I think Colleen wanted to say a word. Before I pass it on to her, in case if I don't see many of you before the holidays, Happy Holidays and the very best for the New Year.","Colleen Johnston","Well, thanks Bharat and if you will indulge me, I would just like to say that being CFO of this venerable institution for 10 years has really been a dream come true for me and I have absolutely loved it. A big part of that has been our investors and analysts. And it's been a true, true privilege to work with you as CFO. I just can't say that enough. So thank you for your trust and confidence and for your wise advice. It's actually been fun. And to my incredible team, what can I say, you are awesome and tireless and you are second to none anywhere in the world. And I couldn't have asked for more from you.

Additional information on items of note, the Bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our 2018 MD&A and the fourth quarter 2018 earnings new release.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Gillian, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Q4 was a great quarter for TD and it caps off a strong year for the bank. We executed well in all of our businesses guided by our long-term strategy as a purpose-driven organization, operating from a position of strength as we build a better bank for tomorrow.","Given our few key measures that underscore the quality of our results in 2018. Earnings surpassed $12 billion on a full year basis, up 15% from last year's $10.6 billion, itself the high watermark, and EPS rose 17% to $6.47. Revenue grew 8% and we achieved 400 basis points of operating leverage. Return-on-equity rose to nearly 17% driven by increases in all of our business segments. Our CET1 ratio increased 130 basis points to 12% including 20 million common shares bought back during the year. We also delivered good value for our shareholders, our dividend paid increased by 11% on a full year basis. We delivered above average total shareholder return this fiscal year, and we led our Canadian peers with DSR over the 3, 5 and 10-year periods. And today we announced our intention to repurchase up to an additional 20 million common shares for cancellation subject to regulatory approval.","Let me now highlight some key accomplishments in each of our segments. Canadian retail had a very successful year in 2018 with earnings up 10%, surpassing $7 billion. Our banking, wealth and insurance businesses all performed well as customers entrusted us with more of their business. We strengthened our market leadership position in key product lines maintaining our number one ranking in credit cards, direct investing and direct distribution in affinity insurance; taking share in private banking, and extending our lead in personal non-term deposits, the bedrock of our high quality balance sheet. And we made further inroads across our other core products continuing to take share in real estate and unsecured lending, and delivering another year of strong growth in business loans and deposits.","We are also very pleased this week to announce a long-term agreement with Air Canada to become the primary credit card issuer for their new loyalty program when it launches in 2020. The agreement delivers stability, continuity and value for our TD Aeroplan customers and reinforces our leadership position in the Canadian credit card business. The Canadian retail business is winning with customers the way we always have, by putting them at the center of everything we do; that means working together as one TD, working across our business and functional teams to bring the whole bank to our customers. We continue to invest in our best-in-class branch network because our customers tell us it's important to them, and we are excited to take the next step with future Ready building on our leadership in comfort and convenience, future Ready will see us elevate our advice proposition and equip our colleagues with the tools and training they need to help our customers move forward with greater confidence.","We're designing our digital capabilities the same way, by centering everything on the customer experience, and it's working, we have the number one Canadian banking app according to AppNe [ph]. We rank first in digital banking in Canada according to comScore with the highest number of unique users, the strongest engagement, and the greatest reach. And the new sales tools we've added like EasyApply [ph] are gaining similar recognition without checking and savings mobile experience taking top spot in the latest Forrester survey. Taken together, we have a compelling omni-channel strategy that's driving record high levels of customer acquisition and retention. Our focus on delivering personalized connected experiences to customers in their channel of choice is a winning approach and a key differentiator. It helped drive the strong results we saw in our flagship Canadian retail franchise this year and the business is well positioned for continued success in 2019.","Our U.S. retail bank had a banner year in 2018 as strong growth across our businesses was amplified by the benefits of higher rates and U.S. tax reform. Earnings rose 23% to $2.7 billion, an increase of more than $1 billion over the last 5 years. We achieved 300 basis points of operating leverage while continuing to invest in our businesses, and our efficiency ratio declined to the 55% range with a contribution from TD Ameritrade doubling segment earnings rose 33%, and segment return-on-equity reached nearly 13%, up 3 percentage points on a full year basis. Our U.S. retail bank continued it's strong momentum building on our roots in retail, small business and commercial banking, we have added capabilities in our building scale in auto-finance, and corporate and specialty banking, wealth and cards, allowing us to attract new customers and deepen relationships with existing ones.","We've made significant investments to support this growth across all areas, we've optimized our store network, invested in frontline staff, introduced new digital capabilities, and continue to modernize our technology and data infrastructure to make banking simpler, faster and more seamless for customers. Our U.S. retail banking model is grounded in our people-centric culture and brought to life by our brand and community giving. It's a value proposition that is clearly resonating as we have continued to generate peer leading loan and deposit growth and household acquisition, and it sets us up very well for 2019.","Rounding out our strong results this year earnings in our wholesale segment again surpassed $1 billion and ROE climbed to 18%. We grew revenue in our capital markets business and we continue to win significant mandates globally and take market share. We maintain our leadership position in the Canadian market occupying the number 1 or number 2 spot in key domestic rankings, equity and equity options of black trading, debt trading, syndicated loans, M&A announced, equity underwriting, and government and corporate debt underwriting. TD Securities won an impressive range of advisory and lending mandates throughout the year, this quarter we acted as sole financial adviser to George Weston on the acquisition of an additional 61.6% interest in Choice Properties REIT from Loblaw.","We made significant progress building our U.S. dollar franchise with 5 years of continuous market share gains, and a steady rise up the league tables. And we reinforced our credentials in the green and sustainability bond space, a growing segment of the market that is well aligned with the bank's commitment to support the transition to the low carbon economy of the future.","Our wholesale business continues to perform very well; we strengthened our leadership in the Canadian market, and we continue to expand our markets and banking business globally to meet the needs of our growing client base. We are winning increasingly complex mandates, thanks to investments in our capabilities and strong partnerships across the bank through our one TD strategy; it's an impressive track record of success, we feel good about our momentum which we expect will continue in 2019.","Overall, it's been a tremendous year for TD, our proven business model is a powerful enabler, the impressive results we've delivered reflect a diversified business mix, a North American footprint which offers growth in scale opportunities in a focused geography that helps us maintain our distinctive culture and a risk appetite that has always served as our compass. The consistent earnings growth our model generates is a source of capital strength allowing us to make long-term investments in the customers, communities and colleagues who are at the center of our purpose driven strategy, and our commitment to shaping the future of banking to meet the demands of the digital age. We shared some of these highlights in our annual report, I invite you to read my message to shareholders in the pages that accompany it which present our strategy in more detail, as well as a purposeful investments it is enabling.","Now let me conclude with a few thoughts on the year ahead. Our businesses enter 2019 with continued good momentum and a favorable backdrop. The Canadian and U.S. economies are performing well, we expect further margin expansion on the back of higher rates, and credit quality remains positive. We have a proven business model with diversification and scale underpinned by a strong risk culture, strategic and differentiated advantages that have enabled TD to deliver consistent returns through the business cycle. Our view is that we can continue to deliver adjusted EPS growth in 2019 within our 7% to 10% medium-term target range. As you will appreciate though, we are watching market, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, and there are current and emerging strains in the energy and automotive manufacturing sectors of the economy. If these factors intensify they could impact our view of the year ahead.","To wrap up, I'm proud of what we achieved in 2018. We are focused on our strategy and executing effectively against it, it's a strategy that is deeply rooted in our unique and inclusive culture, and the sense of shared responsibility each of us feels to make the organization even stronger. I'd like to thank our more than 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication to our vision, purpose and strategy; our people are our greatest asset, they are what makes TD the better bank. I would also like to thank our customers for the trust and confidence they place in TD. I'm excited about the opportunities we have before us in 2019.","With that, I will turn it over to Riaz.","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you, Bharat and good afternoon, everybody, please turn to Slide 5. For 2018, the bank reported earnings of $11.3 billion, and EPS of $6.01, up 8% and 9% respectively. Adjusted earnings were $12.2 billion and adjusted EPS was $6.47, up 15% and 17% for the year respectively.","Revenue increased 7% with growth across all our business segments, and expenses increased 4% on a reported and adjusted basis as we continue to invest in people and technology to execute on our strategy. Excluding the impact of FX, adjusted expenses increased 5%. PCL increased 12%, primarily reflecting higher PCL in the U.S. retail and corporate segments, including higher provisions for the U.S. strategic cards portfolio, the partner share of which is held in the corporate segment, and offset in corporate non-interest expenses. Canadian retail and U.S. retail delivered net income of $7.2 billion and $4.2 billion for the year respectively, and wholesale reported over $1 billion in earnings.","Please turn to Slide 6. This quarter the bank reported earnings of $3 billion and EPS of $1.58, adjusted EPS of a $1.63, up 20% reflecting strong results in all of our businesses. Revenue increased 9%, provision for credit losses increased 19% quarter-over-quarter, and expenses were up 11%.","Please turn to Slide 7. Canadian retail segment net income was $1.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year on good revenue growth, partially offset by higher expenses, insurance claims including CATS [ph] and PCL. Revenue increased 8% year-over-year reflecting higher loan and deposit volumes, margin expansion, higher insurance revenues and wealth trading and asset growth. Loans grew 6% year-over-year with increases in both, personal and business volumes, and deposits increased by 3% reflecting growth in business and personal deposits. Wealth assets grew 1%, margin was 2.94%, up one basis point quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher interest rates and partly offset by balance sheet mix. Net interest margin is up 8 basis points on a year-over-year basis.","Total PCL increased by 7% quarter-over-quarter, mainly reflecting higher impaired PCL. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 25 basis points, up one basis point quarter-over-quarter. Expenses increased 11% year-over-year reflecting higher marketing and promotion costs, higher employee-related variable compensation in the wealth businesses, and increased spend on strategic initiatives.","Please turn to Slide 8. U.S. retail net income was US$855 million on a reported basis, and US$874 million on an adjusted basis, up 34% year-over-year. U.S. retail bank earnings rose 26% year-over-year, a strong result reflects 8% revenue growth on higher deposit margins, loan and deposit volume growth, fee income growth, and a lower corporate tax rate. Average loan volumes increased by 3% reflecting growth in the personal and business customer segments, deposit growth was 5% including strong growth in core checking accounts of 7%, and an 8% increase in safe deposits from TD Ameritrade.","Net interest margin was 3.33%, flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Year-over-year net interest margin increased 15 basis points driven by higher deposits margins. Total PCL increased 10% quarter-over-quarter mainly reflecting higher impaired PCL. The U.S. retail net PCL ratio including only the bank's contractual portion of credit losses in the strategic cards portfolio was 50 basis points in the quarter, up 4 basis points from last quarter. Expenses increased 3% on a year-over-year basis reflecting higher investments in business initiatives, business volume growth and increased employee-related costs, partially offset by productivity savings. On an adjusted basis, expenses were up 5%.","The contribution from our investment in TD Ameritrade increased by 111% year-over-year on a reported basis, and 96% on an adjusted basis; adjusted for TD share of charges related to the Scottrade acquisition. Segment ROE was 12.8% on a reported basis, and 13% on an adjusted basis, up 330 basis points from a year ago.","Please turn to Slide 9. Net income for wholesale was $286 million, up 24% reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses, taxes and PCL. Revenue increased 32% reflecting higher trading related revenue and fee and advisory revenue. Total PCL was $8 million compared to a benefit of $14 million in the prior quarter. Non-interest expenses rose 28% reflecting higher variable compensation, higher initiative spend, and continued investments in client-facing employees supporting the global expansion of wholesale banking as U.S. dollar strategy.","Please turn to Slide 10. The corporate segment reported a net loss of $181 million in the quarter compared to net income of $41 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in reported net loss was primarily attributable to the dilution gain on the Scottrade transaction in the same quarter last year, and an increase in net corporate expenses, partially offset by an increase in contribution from other items. Net corporate expenses were higher primarily due to the positive impact of taxes adjustments in the fourth quarter of last year.","Please turn to Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12% at the end of the fourth quarter, up 35 basis points from the third quarter. We had strong organic capital generation this quarter which added 39 basis points to our capital position, our leverage ratio was 4.2%, and our liquidity coverage ratio was 129%. We announced our intention to amend our NCIB [ph] for upto an additional 20 million common shares subject to regulatory approval.","I will now turn the call over to Ajai.","Ajai Bambawale","Thank you, Riaz and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide 12. The strong credit quality we saw throughout the year carried into the fourth quarter. Gross impaired loan formations were $1.4 billion or 21 basis points, up 3 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and up 2 basis points year-over-year, reflecting new formations in the Canadian commercial portfolio from which we anticipate immaterial credit losses and seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card and auto portfolios. Consistent with recent quarters there were no new formations in the wholesale segment.","Please turn to Slide 13. Gross impaired loans ended the year at $3.15 billion or 47 basis points, up 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and down 2 basis points year-over-year. The primary contributors to the quarter-over-quarter increase in gross impaired loans were new formations in the Canadian commercial portfolio, seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card portfolio, and the impact of foreign exchange. The wholesale segment maintained a zero impaired loan balance quarter-over-quarter.","Please turn to Slide 14. Recall that our presentation reports PCL ratios, both gross and net of the partner share of the U.S. strategic card credit losses. We remind you that the banks contractual portion of credit losses is reported in the U.S. retail segment whereas the partner share is reported in the corporate segment. The bank's PCLs in the quarter was $675 million or 41 basis points, up 6 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and up 2 basis points year-over-year. The primary factors contributing to the quarter-over-quarter PCL increase were an increase in the wholesale portfolio largely due to a prior period benefit, a one-time impact related to methodology enhancements in the Canadian result portfolio, and seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card and auto portfolios.","As experienced in previous years, PCLs typically rise in the fourth and first quarters in the U.S. credit card and auto portfolios due to back to school and holiday shopping. Volumes and delinquencies historically decrease in the second and third quarters as customers receive tax refunds and catch up with their payments.","Please turn to Slide 15. Impaired PCL remains stable for the banks and the segments on both, a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Performing PCL increased $80 million quarter-over-quarter for the bank reflected in the corporate segment attributable to the U.S. strategic cards partner share and the wholesale segment due largely to a prior quarter benefit. For 2018, the full year rate is 39 basis points, up 2 basis points from 2017 driven primarily by volume growth, seasoning and mix in the U.S. card and auto portfolios.","Please turn to Slide 16. Given the recent decline in oil prices and widening price differentials, I'd now like to take a moment to discuss our oil and gas exposure. Drawn loans in the producer and services segment are $3.8 billion representing less than 1% of total bank gross loans in acceptances. Off $3.8 billion, $600 million or 0.09% of total gross loans and acceptances is to producers exposed to Western Canadian Select off which 83% is investment grade. Excluding real estate secured lending, consumer lending and small business banking exposure to Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador represents 2% of the banks gross loans and acceptances. Overall, our underwriting standards remain consistent with those that saw us through the last price decline, and we remain comfortable with portfolio quality.","Now moving back to total bank results. In summary, credit quality continues to be strong across the banks portfolios, and we've remained well positioned for continued growth going into 2019. Subject to quarterly seasonal fluctuations and provided economic conditions remain supportive, I expect fiscal '19 PCL to be in the range of 40 to 45 basis points.","With that operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Gabriel Dechaine.","Gabriel Dechaine","First question is on the commercial real estate portfolio in Canada. And a couple of observations; one, you have been generating much lower growth than your peers, half in that category. And then I do see some divergence though between what you call resi and non-resi whereby resi is growing fast and non-resi is actually going down. Just wondering; A) are you deliberately holding back growth in this category? And B) what's in the resi -- in the subcategories that might be causing that divergence?","Theresa Currie","On the sort of overall portfolio of commercial real estate, you're right, the growth has been more muted versus the other areas of the commercial lending growth. I would say, if you look at our underwriting policies and approach through the cycle we have been -- and Ajai just mentioned this, very consistent approach through the cycle. What we've seen in the marketplace is a pricing dynamic in some cases that we aren't willing to match from an economic standpoint, and some covenants that don't meet our risk appetite. And so taken in combination we're making prudent decisions and walking away sometimes when it doesn't make sense. As it relates to resi versus non-resi we would be sticking with core high-quality clients in the resi category, and as I said just continuing to make prudent business decisions going forward.","Gabriel Dechaine","Thank you for that and I know we're in a bit of a rush here, but I want to sneak one in for the U.S. business. Our FDIC [ph] premiums are no longer deductible I think in calendar 2019. Is that going to be having a big impact on your profit growth outlook for next year in that business?","Bharat Masrani","It's like we look at a whole host of issues going into the New Year, it is one aspect of it, and obviously this was just announced. And effective for 11\/1 going into 2019, so we'll work through it but we see this as a manageable item for the upcoming year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve [ph]. [Operator Instructions].","Unidentified Analyst","For Terry, there is obviously noise in the hillock versus the mortgage line; but in aggregate, do you look like you're continuing to take market share almost 7% rev [ph] growth this quarter. Can you talk about your outlook for next year? 2018 has featured a lot of share growth but looking ahead, the hillocks [ph] start to normalize, come off the boil, or do you think you still have more market share to gain in '19?","Theresa Currie","So we would continue to be looking at mid-single digit growth for our proprietary total real estate secured lending portfolio in '19. The reason we feel comfortable with that, the reasons actually remains similar to what we've talked about in the past, as you'll recall with the Hillock [ph] hybrid mortgage product, we've made many improvements to that product to make it a real mortgage substitute, a convenient and flexible option for the right customers, were fourth in market share in that category, and so the growth in originations we're seeing is about 90% to existing TD customers, and we're comfortable that we will continue to grow our business in that regard to customers who love us for their day-to-day banking and have borrowing needs or borrowing elsewhere.","In addition to that, we've continued to invest in our mobile mortgage specialists and have added just shy of 250 year-over-year, so they're an opportunity to meet our customers in their channel-of-choice. We've continued to invest in our homeowner journey end-to-end digital capabilities, and the pre-approval capability that we launched just a few months ago has delivered strong pre-approval volumes and is delivering our good business as well. We have continued to invest in our credit operation center, so that's helping us to adjudicate loans more quickly and get customers to the answer they are looking for more quickly which meets their needs. And then finally, we've been helping to train our people in our branches to ensure that our advisors are confident to meet our customer's needs. So in aggregate, with those investments we do see the prospect of similar growth next year.","What I would say is that there was some pull-forward obviously with B20 [ph] launched January of 2018, so we could see the rate of growth a little bit lower in the first half but still looking at mid-single digits for the full year.","Unidentified Analyst","Just a quick one for Riaz, a bit of an odd one. The professional advisory services line, it's up like $100 million quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year; that's a pretty big number for advisory services, or anything outsized or anything you mentioned there?","Riaz Ahmed","I think it's mostly in relation to all the various initiatives that we have underway and the execution of those initiatives. So I think you should look at it in the context of continuing to just build our systems and capabilities out.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Sumit Malhotra.","Sumit Malhotra","Maybe a couple of clarification questions to start on numbers-wise for Riaz. Just on capital, from the level you're at right now, if I think about the items we know that are coming; Greystone, MEA [ph], and the RWA updates, is 30 to 35 basis points an appropriate range for the impact of those three combined?","Riaz Ahmed","I think assuming that that would be a reasonable consideration, as you know, our RWA growth can bounce around from time-to-time but yes, about 30 basis points should be about right.","Sumit Malhotra","And then, when you were going through your prepared comments for the U.S. segment; you mention the ROE which has moved up nicely this year. When I look at your sub-back on Page 6, and I'll start by saying I know there is moving parts when we look at segmented returns on equity or returns on capital. But your equity base that you show us in that segment hasn't really changed much in the last couple of years even though, obviously you've been running new business, you've been increasing your earnings power. How does that get allocated because I would think equity would grow alongside what's happening in the business? And I apologize if this is something I should know and I've forgotten but any help there would be appreciated.","Riaz Ahmed","No, I think you're quite correct Sumit in pointing that out but the allocation is based on required equity and as our systems of risk measurement and risk weighted assets measurement mature you see some benefit of that accruing to that line and so you're quite correct that it's been fairly stable but you should think about it in the context of -- that it's coincidentally stable and not that it doesn't reflect appropriate volume growth.","Sumit Malhotra","So even with RWA up $9 million to $10 million year-over-year, the equity requirement in the business doesn't move alongside of that?","Riaz Ahmed","Well, because I think when the RWA grows, there are other factors in the calculation of capital that may offset it Sumit, and so we'll -- we can take it through that calculation if you'd like to.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our last question from Nigel D'Souza.","Nigel D'Souza","I just want to follow-up on gross and fair loans for the quarter and touch on the point you made on seasonality. So I understand the seasonality effects in Q1, especially in credit cards from potential hangover related to a holiday shopping and spending there, but could you kind of provide more color on what type of seasonal factors you see impacting autos and credit cards in Q4?","Ajai Bambawale","What actually occurs is right starting from the back-to-school period, going upto the end of the holiday shopping season, you do see a buildup at volumes and you do see delinquency pressures because consumer wallets are stretched; so when you see the delinquency numbers go up that attracts seasonally performing PCL and that continues to build right I would say in Q4 and Q1, Q1 tends to be the high watermark. And then as customers get their tax refunds in Q2 you start seeing that number come down. I would actually encourage you to go to the U.S. retail PCL numbers, look at the last three quarters and look at the change between Q3, Q4 and Q1 each year, you'll see it there.","Nigel D'Souza","When I look at the breakdown of impaired loans and this is on Page 20 of your supplement pack, there is 120 build in your industrial construction and trade contractors bucket in Q4 relative to Q3. Could you speak to or just press more color what exactly impacted that line item?","Ajai Bambawale","So I would -- so it seems that line item, I would call it isolated, quite frankly, and from my perspective it's well secured. I'd actually be very surprised to see any credit losses, so you should think of it more of as isolated.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mariel Mendonca [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Ajai, just to sort of follow-up on that last question; you said it was well secured that impairment, is it fair to say there have been no PCLs on that line item at all?","Ajai Bambawale","There are minimal PCLs I'd say, it's well secured. It's isolated and it's very, very nominal. I believe that that could\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","And you see no trends that you would highlight in any other loans in that category then, that's specific to that one?","Ajai Bambawale","I don't and that's why the use of the word isolated.","Unidentified Analyst","One follow-up, and this is more of a general question that I've asked a few now -- a few banks. On Page 30 of your supplement, you first specifically to -- you offer some pretty good detail on the PCL ratios in various categories and specifically in business and government, the PCL ratio is only 3 basis points and that's been true for your bank, and frankly, all the banks now for some time. Can you help me think through like what is a -- an average is always a tough word but what do you think is a normal level of PCLs for business loans for you -- for TD or a bank generally in Canada?","Ajai Bambawale","I mean, I think the PCLs have been in single digits. I would say probably in the 10 to 15 basis point range. Again, we've been in a very, very benign environment for a long time and I think over a period of time you'll see some normalization. But again from what I'm seeing there is nothing on the horizon, our portfolio quality is pretty strong right now and as Bharat said, the economic outlook continues to be reasonable as well but as the cycle changes, some normalization of credit in commercial will occur.","Unidentified Analyst","And when you offer that outlook of say -- I think you said 40 to 40 basis points for 2019. What number is in your mind -- at the back of your mind for the business loans; is it something like 10 basis points? Is that reasonable to get you to the 40 to 45?","Ajai Bambawale","I mean, I don't have that detail available but I'll tell you, like -- in the 40 to 45 basis points I have assumed some normalization of commercial credit in Canada, some normalization of commercial credit in the United States, and certainly some normalization of commercial credit or wholesale credit in the dealer.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Sohrab Movahedi.","Sohrab Movahedi","On the U.S. segment, the U.S. loan growth; it kind of continues to be in that low single digit. Talk us through a little bit how -- what's the outlook for that?","Bharat Masrani","As we've been talking for the last several quarters now, we've been saying very directly at these quarterly calls that more moderate loan growth would be expected across a number of portfolios. I think as we've come into more of our size and some of our commercial and corporate and specialty portfolios, A) that would have naturally brought down the growth rate you would have seen from a few years ago; market conditions, that we've been talking about and there is certainly high demand for quality paper out there amongst all of the banks. There is also other macroeconomic factors of slowdown in M&A and customers, and many of our commercial and corporate clients are quite flush with cash on their own balance sheets these days.","On the consumer side, it's also been more moderate; I think you would have seen many of the U.S. banks calling down home equity and mortgage rates as the refinance boom has slowed, especially given a rising rate environment. That said, I would just say that for our business in the U.S. we still believe that we can continue to take share and while these number on any given quarter will bump around a bit, we continue to believe we will remain an outlier in growth and while 3% growth is a little bit more muted, as I said at the upfront, it continues especially amongst our peer banks in the U.S. and larger banks continue to put us at the top of the pack. If you look at some of the quarter-over-quarter number, Q3 to Q4, you would have seen a decent growth from Q3 to Q4, and I think this does bode well going into the new year. But all things being equal, we think we'll continue to take share on both, personal loans and commercial loans going forward.","Sohrab Movahedi","Ajai, did you disclose the oil and gas exposure because you're worried about it or just because you thought we would be asking about it?","Ajai Bambawale","I think it's topical, so I disclosed it. Quite frankly, I'm not worried about it because our quality is very, very good. And as you saw the slide, and I highlighted the impaired levels, quite frankly, they are negligible; so we are not seeing any quality issues either on the non-retail side and even retail so far is pretty strong but it's topical and I thought it was appropriate to highlight it.","Sohrab Movahedi","Understood. And maybe if I can just sneak one in for Terry as well; maybe it's a better conversation Terry for next quarter but given the Aeroplan announcement, I was a little bit perplexed that after as many credit card transactions that the bank has done over the years there is still a need to call out charges related to systems that you think you're going to have to take over the next couple of years. Can you elaborate on that right now or is it better we wait until next quarter?","Theresa Currie","No, I'm happy to elaborate on it. So delighted to be in the position as Bharat said, to have been able to announce this long-term partnership and to be the primary credit card issuer for the Air Canada loyalty program. It is the -- Aeroplan has been the premier loyalty program in Canada and we are very excited about the offering with Air Canada going forward. As we work through the partnership and launching value for both, the current and prospective card holders. Over the next couple of years we did identify about $100 million in investment, that will be launching some new cards in the lineup, it will be rebranding for the new value proposition and lining up to the offers available going forward. It will also be enhanced some digital and channel capabilities with the opportunity to interact in Air Canada channels, and that will allow us to provide for cardholders a more personalized experience, and offers that are relevant to their travel preferences, and some of these investments we'll be able to be leveraged more broadly in our visa portfolio; so when we take a look at what we will be delivering for our -- for Canadians and for our current card holders and the cost of that versus the benefits to our business and the customers we feel very comfortable with that tradeoff.","Sohrab Movahedi","But is some of that marketing spend?","Theresa Currie","This would be more branding and launch activities than marketing spend.","Sohrab Movahedi","I think of them both as the same thing. Thank you.","Theresa Currie","Maybe the way to say it is, the cards will need to be rebranded to Air Canada cards.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Darko Mihelic.","Darko Mihelic","I just have a couple of questions. The first is, just wanted to verify the bounce in trading from last quarter, just a reversal of what happened last quarter and I think you guys are musing about changing your accounting for trading; is that -- has that occurred? I didn't quite catch it.","Bob Dorrance","There was a modest reversal of -- would occurred in terms of mark-to-market of the trading deposits in Q3 which was outsized, so there was some benefit in Q4. And I think we've said that for the year that line item was dominimus [ph] for the year but there was unfortunately a volatility in Q3. And we are moving to account for that line item or those mark-to-market through the fair value OCI Convention, that starts in this quarter. So it will reduce volatility once the whole book gets remarked in that fashion, in the interim of the outstanding book though however we'll still be going through P&L.","Bharat Masrani","And I think really, the -- when you look at the trading revenue quarter, in the last number of years the quarterly range has averaged around 4.25 to 4.50 but there is volatility in trading revenue. So this quarter was modestly ahead of what the average has been but meaningfully ahead of both, the previous quarter and year ago's quarter, both of those quarters were weak quarters, hence a pretty large increase; it's not a large increase relative to the average but it's a large increase relative to weak quarters and that we're the competitors.","Darko Mihelic","So presumably some of the volatility of trading revenues though should decline in the go-forward basis under the new accounting approach or...","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. That is due to the -- the volatility related thereto -- related to the market and trading causes, so we'll now go through OCI, so that will come out. And I think we've always felt that these are -- there is inherent volatility in trading revenues caused by markets, as well as positions and the combination of the two. So, I think when you look on an annual basis there is a reasonable amount of stability but the inter periods are volatile as you noted.","Darko Mihelic","And if I could just turn to the U.S. retail segment, just for -- a kind of a discussion I suppose on the outlook for the net interest margin. And maybe you can help me understand -- I mean sometimes in the -- we get annual disclosures and sometimes things pop out at me that look a little bit peculiar and the one thing that really popped out for me in the annual report was when I looked at the cost of our U.S. business deposits, it looks like they almost doubled year-over-year and went from 211 basis points to 419. And I'm just wondering if that was an anomaly and if that maybe sort of slowed down the NIM expansion and maybe looking forward we should expect -- well maybe, I'll just leave it there or maybe you can let me know if the forward NIM outlook for the U.S. is maybe more robust than what we saw in 2018?","Greg Braca","First, I should probably level set that as we'll talk here quarter-after-quarter, any given quarter the NIM given so many inputs into that equation will bump around and if I just take you back to the comparison from Q2 to Q3, we were up quite healthy 10 basis points, quarter-over-quarter. And in Q4 on a Q-over-Q basis it was flat and I would primarily signal that it was mostly because of mix even though we had one rate hike halfway through Q4. I would just provide maybe just a little bit of a view in that, in Q1 we would expect another increase in our net interest margin, just from the basis of what we have rolling off in our investment portfolio and the on\/off rate for -- versus old investments versus where the market is today. So I'd say that we would expect further NIM expansion in Q1.","Riaz Ahmed","Darko, I'll just add to that. I think the table that you're looking at is specifically the business and government U.S. line where as interest rates come up, betas and business and government deposits tend to give it\u2026","Bharat Masrani","And maybe I would just add a little on the beta's Riaz. Darko, you know, we watch this very, very closely and we get asked the question well. X sweeps, deposit rates are a little slower than we would have seen in the past few years, we're 4% up year-over-year, still quite healthy comparison against most of our peers are in zero to very low-single digits, we continue to take share but I'll go to the quality story, especially at this point of the rate cycle. And if you look at our consumer DDA balances, those consumer balances are up 7% year-over-year, small business checking account balances are up over 5% year-over-year. And -- so the headline number for growth is one thing but we're also paying very close attention to the whole beta conversation and it should be also a lens of quality of growth and not just chasing half deposits.","Darko Mihelic","I mean, I guess what I was getting at was the deposit data just seemed overtly high on the business side. And I was just wondering if that was -- I guess it didn't impacted the overall margin as much as I thought it would; so we can take that question offline if at all possible, I just want to follow-up on that.","Bharat Masrani","Yes, we have to do it because I would generally say that our beta's are well within our peer range across interest bearing and non-interest bearing products, and we can certainly follow-up on that.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Meny Grauman.","Meny Grauman","A question from the annual report, your macroeconomic variables in the scenario analysis; oil prices seem to be conspicuously missing from there. So I'm just wondering, I guess you have a wide range of variables to choose from but is there anything in that that you don't feel it is as important a variable in your scenario analysis?","Ajai Bambawale","It's Ajai, let me answer that. So I think oil prices are important but they're an input into our macroeconomic model; so to the extent they impact GDP or unemployment, they certainly drive our moderate results. So they are important but they are an input into the model.","Meny Grauman","And then if I can just ask about TD Ameritrade and the question really is, do you feel that this -- that this business is going to be a drag when it comes to 2019, just on a growth basis you talked about just how strong the year was for this business in 2018 and I'm wondering how you're approaching the outlook for 2019. I know there is an element of market dependency but what's prudent here in terms of expectations?","Bharat Masrani","As you now walk through 2018 and as you can see in TD Ameritrade's own disclosures that there was a number of tailwind that contributed to their performance, the non-recurring one would obviously be our U.S. tax reform but the ones that are more sustainable are the lift in interest rates as well as the additional customers and volumes that were made available via the Scottrade acquisition but also a higher level of general trading activity in the markets. So I think you can look at the guidance that TD Ameritrade gives in relation to it's earnings and you'll conclude -- you'll see that they continue to feel that there is still a fair bit of growth to go here.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Doug Young [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Bank just backed to the U.S. NIMs, I'm just hoping to get a little bit of color on your outlook more on NIM in the context of mix shift versus deposit margins versus loan yields. And specifically on the loan yield side, are you starting to see -- because loan growth has been so slow; are you starting to see an increased competitive pressure and pressure on the loan yields yet or that does not exist at this point?","Bharat Masrani","No, I think -- first, I'd say just on the commercial portfolios, it certainly has been very competitive in the markets for quality drawn paper across many segments and industries. And our view of this has been, first, we're going to have a lens from a risk appetite standpoint and we're just not going to go out on the curve, notwithstanding where we feel we might be late in the cycle and we're going to be conservative of what we do. And secondly, I would say that our view of growth -- I'll go back to the quality story that I mentioned on deposits. We're going to grow from a credit quality standpoint and from a return standpoint, and a relationship standpoint; and if we can't get it those ways, we walk away from a lot of transactions every day. But notwithstanding that we still think we can continue to outpace the growth of the market and we think we've got room to run.","On the consumer side, there is a dynamic going on, refi's have been very slow, most banks have got double-digit decline in home equity balances with a rising rate, and certainly we've been growing cards and auto a little quicker given we would subscale or relatively smaller players in those businesses over the last several years. And that's why we would -- on the other side of it we'd call out the increases in PCL given mix and the growing balances around those portfolios, so that's been a focused area of growth and we think we're still doing it the right way for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Just on the NIM outlook, is most of the uptake really going to come on the deposit margin side; is that really -- or is there a little bit of mix left in there that come through?","Bharat Masrani","So for us the way we would look at it, the loans are a spread business, and the way we would look at the deposit book of businesses, that's why we're so focused on quality growth is that we want DDAs and we don't want the hot money growth, and we want deposits that can be invested longer term. And we do think all things being equal, in a rising rate environment we're managing beta's quite well and we think rates continue to rise over '19 and NIM should generally be higher.","Unidentified Analyst","And then Bharat, I mean it's a good problem to have 12% CET1 ratio, obviously, some of that comes back next quarter with some of the transactions you've done. I mean, everyone always talks about what's the minimum level of CET1 ratio but what's the maximum you're willing to take this upto? And why not be a little more aggressive on the buyback or at least put in a little bit more that you could be -- have a little bit more tool on the buyback?","Bharat Masrani","We've talked about other banks capital framework, how we think about capital and I won't go through all the details; but you know, we have terrific opportunities to continue to invest in our businesses. We will look at M&A transactions, if they make financial and risk sense to us and strategic sense to us, there are certain areas we've outlined that we would be quite interested in. And on top of that, we -- last year we announced the 20 million share buyback and we completed it, and we announced another one this quarter; so I feel quite comfortable, we continue to apply our framework in a disciplined way. And if circumstances suggest that we should up our buyback then we will certainly consider it, and that's how I'm looking at this Doug. It's a consistent story from us, nothing different.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, that's all the time for questions that we have today. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr.Bharat Masrani for closing remarks.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, operator. And thank you to all of you for joining us this afternoon. And I'm very happy with how the bank and the numbers the bank has delivered for the quarter, that caps off a great year at TD. I do want to take this opportunity to thank our dedicated and great employees around the world, 85,000 strong, who continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders including our shareholders. So a big thank you from all of us here. And as well for folks on the phone, it is that time of the year, in case if we do not meet in the next few weeks then wish you the very best for the holidays, and we'll see you in the New Year.

Edmund Clark","Thank you, Rudy, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Colleen is going to be up to discuss our fourth quarter results, but I'd like to start by talking about the year as a whole. So 2013 was a strong year for TD's key retail franchises in terms of their fundamentals. But that did not translate into strong earnings growth for the Bank. Total Bank earnings were up 1% for the year, and earnings per share were flat as record results in the Canadian and U.S. Retail Banking and Wealth were largely offset by challenges in our Insurance and Wholesale business. These headline numbers are not what we would hope for. But, excluding the impact of the Insurance losses we recorded in the third quarter, adjusted EPS would have been up a solid 6% for the year. And the strong performance of our large retail businesses and the investments we have made in future growth mean we are very well-positioned for 2014 and beyond.","Our Canadian Personal and Commercial Bank had a very good year in 2013, earnings up 11%. Personal loan volumes held up well, business lending roles are robust 12%. And we made further investments in our growth strategies; most notably, signed agreement to become the primary insurer of Aeroplan Visa credit cards starting January 1, a deal that entrenches our #1 position in credit cards in Canada.","We also levered great results on the expense front, achieving a record low efficiency ratio. And we did all this while continuing to be recognized by J.D. Power and Ipsos as a leader in customer service across our distribution channels, from branches to ATMs, phone, from online to mobile. Mobile, we rank first for the number of mobile customers in Canada.","Wealth had a record year, with our Direct Investing, Advice, and Asset Management businesses, all performing well. We continue to grow net new client assets and now have over $1 trillion in assets under administration and assets under management when you include TD Ameritrade.","On the manufacturing side, a number of our retail funds were recognized for their strong risk-adjusted performance at the Lipper Awards again this year.","And we completed the acquisition of Epoch Investment Partners, strengthening our competitive position in investment management and adding capabilities to advance on U.S. wealth strategy. One year after announcing the acquisition of Epoch, we couldn't be more pleased with how the business has performed. Assets under management have grown steadily from the $24 billion that we announced at closing to $40 billion today, including some funds transferred Epoch from internal and external advisors. In addition, client retention has been excellent; we've won several new mandates; and investment returns have been strong. In short, Epoch is delivering everything for which we hoped, and the combined team is working very effectively together.","As you may have seen today, we announced that we have extended the TD Ameritrade's Stockholders Agreement. We like our current ownership structure in TD Ameritrade. This provides the public shareholders with increased certainty around what will happen in January 2016. We also announced that we plan to sell 5.5 million shares we currently hold in TD Ameritrade.","Our U.S. Personal and Commercial Bank had a landmark year in 2013, achieving $1.6 billion earning target we set out 3 years ago. Bharat will have more to say about this remarkable achievement, but let me take this opportunity to say how proud I am of our team at America's Most Convenient Bank for meeting this ambitious goal, despite the headwinds, very significant headwinds. We succeeded by delivering on our promise of legendary service and convenience, executing on our \"take share\" strategy, and billing the business with acquisitions like Target, a signature win that has put us in a position to win more business or providing strong support to our bottom-line results.","In addition to this impressive performance in our larger retail businesses, we did face some challenges in 2013. Our Insurance business had a difficult year. We continue to see good premium growth, with the last three quarter and the third quarter -- recorded in the third quarter, related to severe flooding in Alberta and an increase in reserves for Ontario auto had a significant impact on our full-year results. As we said at that time, we believe the auto insurance business in Ontario can be a good business and one that strengthens our franchise. However, the operating environment remains challenging, and so we continue to refine our business model.","Our Wholesale bank also saw a drop in earnings this year largely due to higher levels of securities case last year, but also related to lower trading revenue this year. Nonetheless, business did produce return on equity within our 15% to 20% target range, and I am very pleased with how we manage to continue to deliver on our strategy of being a top 3 integrated dealer.","Finally, on the expense front. We ended the year above our 3% target for core expense growth, excluding acquisitions and FX. While I'm disappointed with this result, I am comfortable with the reasons for it. The additional costs were partly related to litigation matters connected to a commercial dispute in our wholesale business, as well as higher variable expenses in our Wealth Management business reflecting stronger-than-expected revenue growth, this is a good problem to have.","Adding it all up, I'm pleased with our performance this year. The strength of our underlying earnings is reflected on our robust Basel III capital position, which ended the year at 9%, while absorbing the impact of the repurchase of 9 million shares. As we suggested last year, when we increased our target payout ratio, we also delivered healthy dividend growth. Dividends paid are up 12% in this fiscal year, which helped drive a 22% total shareholder return for the year.","We also announced the two-for-one stock split today, which will take effect in January. In order to facilitate the split, we increased the dividend by $0.01.","It has almost been 15 years since we last split our stock in July of 1999. And during that time, investors in TD have enjoyed a compound annual total shareholder return of 11%.","Let me now turn to the year ahead. At the start of this fiscal year, I said we would have to work hard to get into the 7% to 10% range, and we came close, as I said earlier, delivering 6% EPS growth, excluding the insurance losses, following 8% EPS growth in 2012. I think, we'll have to work just as hard next year to get into the bottom end of that medium-term range measured against our 2013 earnings, excluding the insurance losses. We'll have some win at our back from the investments we made in our growth strategies like Target, Epoch and Aeroplan. But the operating environment remains challenging, and we don't expect much relief in 2014.","Interest rates are still low in absolute terms and persistent rate weakness in Europe and Asia suggests that the low rate, and therefore, lower revenue environment could be with us for some time longer.","And while the U.S. economy is showing welcoming signs of recovery, we expect more subdued growth in Canada, reflecting a slowing housing market and consumer -- and continuing consumer deleveraging.","So let me talk what all that means for each of our businesses. We feel quite good about Canada's retail growth prospects, which include Wealth and Insurance next year.","On the banking side, we expect solid volume growth, stabilizing margins and continued good expense management. And we expect to complement that with stronger growth in Wealth, leveraging the power of the TDCT relationship, as well as in cards as we bring Aeroplan on board.","We are also feeling very good about the long-term prospects of the U.S. Retail. While we won't see those long-term prospects fully reflected in earnings growth next year, loan volumes remain very impressive. And we are starting to see the stabilization improvement in core margins as we had expected. Target is also expected to continue to perform very well. But the strength in core earnings will be offset by a smaller contribution from security gains, given the backup in longer-term rates. Overall, we expect our U.S. Retail bank retail, which will include U.S. Wealth and Epoch next quarter, to deliver modest earnings growth in 2014.","In our Wholesale bank, we will continue to focus on delivering 15% to 20% returns while continuing to build out our franchise model in Canada and the United States.","To wrap up, we delivered good results in 2013 and invested in our businesses and distribution channels to power future organic growth. With our deposit-rich balance sheet, we are well-positioned to benefit from a normalization interest rates, when they occur, but we are not basing our plan on assuming that they will. Rather, we are focused on innovating the businesses we acquired, leveraging organic growth to maximum effect, and improving operational efficiency.","We also continue to streamline our cost base, with our goal to reducing core expense growth, excluding acquisition effects [ph], to below -- well below this year's levels. The payout from the work we've already done on this front is significant and will allow us to maintain an even higher project and initiative spend next year as we strive to improve customer experience and extend our leadership position across North America.","It's an exciting time to be at TD, and I'm very proud of our people, almost 90,000 strong. You've made TD the best customer-driven banking franchise in North America.","On behalf of the senior management team, thank you for your hard work. I can't wait to see what you're going to accomplish for us together next year.","With that, let me turn things over to Bharat, who as you know, is our incoming COO. He's been back in Canada since July and he's going to share a few thoughts with you on how the tradition -- the transition, not tradition; but Riaz is going to going to maintain the tradition, is going. Bharat.","Bharat B. Masrani","Thank you, Ed, and good afternoon. It's great to be back in Canada. Transition is going extremely well. As you heard, since returning in July, I have spent much of my time reacquainting myself with our Canadian operations. This has included traveling across the country to meet with employees and customers. Everywhere I go, I see evidence of the tremendous expansion in our Canadian franchise over the last decade. I'm so impressed with what the team has achieved in building our businesses and laying the foundation for future growth.","The key message remains one of continuity. And so, the TD story will continue to be about growth, about building great franchises, about creating real value for our customers and clients and sustaining a work culture that unlocks the full potential of our employees.","As you know, for the past -- for the last 7 years, I've been focused on growing our U.S. operations; and as Ed said, we recently reached a milestone there. I want to take this opportunity to salute my U.S. colleagues for their outstanding efforts in delivering on our $1.6 billion earnings target. When we announced that target at our 2010 Investor Day, we were yet unaware of all the hurdles we would have to overcome. At the time, a starting point for full-year earnings was $900 million. In the 3 years since, we lost about $650 million in net income to the unforeseen effects of Reg E, Durbin and Dodd-Frank, as well as margin pressure from the low rate environment. But we found ways to replace the last income and generate an additional $700 million in net income after tax.","Security gains, as part of our capital management activities, helped as did improved credit conditions and a series of acquisitions that enhance our capabilities and expanded our footprint. But over and above this, we delivered peer-leading, loan deposit and fee growth. In fact, our underlying organic growth was well ahead of our 2010 target. None of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the entire team at TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank. I know this is just the beginning for our incredible U.S. team.","I'll now turn it over to Colleen to review our results. Colleen?","Colleen M. Johnston","Thanks, Bharat, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me walk you through our results. Let's start with a brief review of 2013.","For the full year, total Bank adjusted net income was $7.2 billion, an increase of 1% from 2012; and adjusted EPS was $7.45, flat year-over-year growth. These results were negatively impacted by the Q3 insurance losses related to severe weather-related events in Alberta and Toronto, and increased general insurance claims, which totaled $0.45 per share. Excluding this impact, adjusted EPS would have increased by 6% compared to last year and Canadian retail results would have increased 11% year-over-year.","TDCT had a record year, delivering $3.8 billion in adjusted earnings, up 11% over 2012, driven by good volume growth, lower credit losses and effective cost management.","Wealth Management delivered record results with earnings up 15%. Higher fee-based revenues, improved trading activity and the Epoch acquisition, all contributed to the growth in earnings.","Our Insurance business had a difficult year, with earnings down 61% due to the charges I mentioned previously. We believe the auto insurance business can be a good business. However, the operating environment remains challenging, and we continue to refine our business model.","U.S. P&C had a record year, with adjusted earnings of U.S. $1.6 billion, up 13% as a result of strong loan and deposit volume growth, higher fee-based revenue, increased gains on sales of securities and the acquisition of Target's card portfolio, partially offset by higher expenses to support growth, and lower margins, excluding Target.","Wholesale Banking had a softer year, with earnings down 26%, primarily driven by lower security gains and a tougher trading, and investment banking environment, partially offset by lower expenses. We finished the year with the strong pro forma Basel III, common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9%. Overall, we were pleased with our results in a number of our businesses.","Please turn to Slide 5. Turning to Q4, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.90, up 4% year-over-year. Total bank adjusted net income of $1.8 billion was also up 4%. Our segment results include retail-adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion, up 19% over last year. Wholesale net income of $122 million, down 61% largely due to lower security gains and elevated expenses. And the Corporate segment posted a loss of $53 million. Overall, a very strong result for our retail businesses, with a softer wholesale quarter.","Please turn to Slide 6. This next slide presents our reported and adjusted earnings this quarter with the difference due to 7 items of note. There a few items this quarter I'd like to highlight: Litigation charges were related to the previously-announced regulatory settlements; restructuring charges of $90 million after-tax. We indicated last quarter that we are going to take a harder look at our expense base in order to drive permanent efficiencies for the future. More on this to come in a moment. Setup cost of $20 million, after-tax, for Aeroplan as we get ready to become the primary Aeroplan visa card issuer in January 2014.","Please turn to Slide 7. Canadian P&C delivered a strong quarter, with adjusted net income of $948 million, up 14% year-over-year. Loan and deposit growth was good this quarter. Total loan growth was 5% year-over-year, with real estate secured lending volumes up 4% and business lending growth up a strong 12%. Personal and business deposits increased due mainly to strong growth in core checking and savings accounts, partially offset by lower-term deposit volume.","NIM was down by 2 basis points sequentially, mainly due to lower deposit margins from the low-rate environment. We expect modest downward pressure on NIMs, with quarterly margins bumping around in 2014, depending on product mix, seasonal factors or rate moves. Credit performance continues to be strong, with PCL in Personal Banking down $66 million from last year, primarily due to lower bankruptcies, principally in credit cards. Business banking PCL declined by $16 million due to higher commercial recoveries.","Adjusted expenses were relatively flat versus last year as volume growth and investment in the business were partially offset by broad-based productivity gains. Operating leverage was 250 basis points due to good expense management. Overall, a great result.","Please turn to Slide 8. Looking at our Wealth and Insurance segment. Wealth had a record quarter, with earnings up 26% year-over-year due to higher fee-based revenue from growth in client assets and market appreciation, improved trading volume, and a positive contribution from the Epoch acquisition.","Our Insurance business reported earnings of $141 million, an increase of 50% over last year due to higher insurance revenue, primarily from premium volume growth. Insurance claims increased by 3%, primarily due to higher current year claims and volume growth, partially offset by lower unfavorable prior year claims development and lower cost of weather-related events. Wealth and Insurance expenses increased from last year, primarily due to the inclusion of Epoch and higher variable compensation.","The contribution from TD Ameritrade was $77 million, up $26 million or 51% from last year due to higher trading activity, increased fee-based revenue and increased investment gains.","Please turn to Slide 9. The U.S. Personal and Commercial Bank had a good quarter, with adjusted earnings of US$384 million, an increase of 7% over last year. The increase reflects the Target acquisition, strong organic growth and improvement in credit quality. Adjusted revenue increased by 18% year-over-year due to the Target credit card acquisition, strong organic loan deposit and fee growth, partially offset by a lower margin and lower gains on security sales. Excluding Target, average loans were up 10% year-over-year, with a 14% increase in personal loans and an 8% increase in business loans. Average deposits increased by 11%.","As we mentioned last quarter, our level of security gains at $15 million was significantly below the $60 million to $80 million guidance. We expect that next year's gains will be meaningfully lower than that range per quarter as there is much less need to sell securities at an elevated pace. We believe we've now immunized our AOCI as much as we can through security sales, reclassification to held-to-maturity and more capital-friendly hedging strategies. As well, the recent spike in loan rates has reduced the gains in the portfolio. Our net interest margin was up by a 9 basis points sequentially, as a benefit of recent increases in long-term rates and a -- the positive impact of acquired loan accounting more than offset loan margin pressures. After normalizing for acquired loan accounting, we expect our margins to continue to stabilize or increase slightly from the current level.","Driven by the improvement in credit quality and business loans, adjusted PCL decreased by $25 million or 12% from the elevated level last year. PCL is likely to move up from these levels over time. Adjusted expenses were up versus last year due to Target expenses and investments in growth initiatives, partially offset by productivity improvements. All in, a strong results for our U.S. business.","Please turn to Slide 10. Net income for our wholesale business of $122 million was down 61% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This was driven by lower security gains, higher noninterest expenses in the quarter and a higher effective tax rate. Revenue was down by 17% over last year due to lower security gains in the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher trading related revenue. Trading revenue was driven by approved fixed income markets. Trading revenue in Q4 was $342 million, above our normalized level of $300 million.","Noninterest expenses were up by 13% compared to last year due to litigation matters associated with a commercial dispute, partially offset by lower operating costs.","Please turn to Slide 11. The Corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of $53 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of $29 million last year.","Please turn to Slide 12. Core expenses for the year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions, were up by 3.9% over last year. We ended the year above our 3% expectation, driven primarily by litigation expense in wholesale and higher variable expenses in Wealth due to higher than expected revenues in the fourth quarter. It may be helpful to provide you with a breakdown of our 4% core expense growth this year.","Productivity initiatives reduced our cost base by over 2%, offsetting underlying growth and base expenses. Increased investment in the business and higher pension costs driven by low interest rates drove the overall increase in expenses year-over-year. I mentioned earlier that we've taken restructuring provision in the quarter. This is expected to help optimize our branch network and to streamline other operations across TD to drive permanent efficiencies. We anticipate these actions will reduce our run rate next year, but be partially reinvested in the business. We're targeting at 2014 core expense growth well below 2013 levels, including the savings realized from productivity initiatives.","Please turn to Slide 13. Our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 9% in the fourth quarter, an increase from 8.9% in Q3, primarily due to organic growth, but partially offset by our share buyback program and volume growth. We expect the Q1 '14 Basel III CET1 ratio to decline modestly due to the previously announced Aeroplan card acquisition from CIBC and the phase in OSFI CVA rules.","We were pleased to announce our stock dividend which will have a two-for-one stock split effect in January. To facilitate the split, we're adding $0.01 to our quarterly cash dividend. We've repurchased over 9 million shares under our share repurchase program. This should help EPS growth by approximately 1% next year, all things being equal. Overall, we continue to remain well-positioned for the evolving regulatory and capital environment.","Please turn to Slide 14. I'd like to briefly comment on 2 items. Starting in Q1 of 2014, we'll be presenting our retail segments slightly differently. There will be 2 retail segments in Canada, the realigned segment will include Canadian Wealth, excluding TD Ameritrade and Epoch and Insurance, in addition to the current Canadian Personal & Commercial Banking business. The U.S. Retail Segment will include the existing U.S. P&C business, but add U.S. Wealth, Ameritrade and Epoch. There'll be no changes to either wholesale or the Corporate segments. In order to facilitate transition to the realigned segment presentation, we plan to continue to provide net income information for the Canadian P&C and Wealth and Insurance businesses. We also plan to restate the 2-year historical information before the end of Q1 '14, so that everyone will have time to understand the impact before we formally start reporting on this new basis. Also, the enhanced disclosure task force has been working hard on improving risk-based disclosures and in October of 2012 published 32 recommendations. This was a major priority for OSFI and the Canadian banks during 2013. Sincere thanks to the TD team for their extraordinary efforts in making this happen. We've outlined the recommendations and references to TD's disclosures on our IR website. Additional enhancements to these disclosures are expected in 2014. Our IR team will be happy to review any of the 32 disclosures with you. With that, let me turn the presentation over to Mark.","Mark R. Chauvin","Thank you, Colleen and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 15. Q4 continues to reflect the strong credit performance we've seen throughout 2013. Total PCL for 2013 was just under $1.6 billion, an improvement of $188 million or 11% over 2012, after absorbing increased credit losses resulting from the Target acquisition. At the same time, loan volume grew by $36 billion or 8%. This translates into a full-year PCL rate of 37 basis points for 2013 versus 46 basis points last year. Canadian gross impaired formations remain flat year-over-year with strong volume growth in the Personal and Commercial portfolios. Canadian Personal and Commercial loss rates were at the lowest level experienced during the last 5 years.","And in the U.S., a recovery in Real Estate has led to improved loan-to-values across the residential real estate portfolio and commercial credit quality continues to improve.","Looking forward, I expect more of the same. Consistent strong credit quality throughout 2014 which should translate into stable loss rates, assuming the economic environment plays out as we expect. Now, I'll turn the presentation back to Rudy.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thank you very much, Mark. And I'll now open it up for questions and to give everyone a chance to participate, please keep to one question and then requeue if there's time. For those participating in person here in the room, can I ask you to identify your name and firm before asking your questions. And before ending the call today, I will ask Ed to offer some final remarks. So why don't we get started in the room?","Question-and-Answer Session","Michael Goldberg - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division","I always seem to get the short end of the stick by asking first, so I got a 2-part question with that way. First of all, we recently saw Manulife do it's fourth subdebt issue in 2 years. While it looks like given the uncertainties of the NBCC and bail-in, you and other banks are shut out of the subdebt market. Could you give us your thoughts on how you think that this is going to evolve and when it's going to evolve for you?","Rudy J. Sankovic","Bharat Masrani?","Bharat B. Masrani","Michael, as you know, the -- it is expected that the federal government will issue guidelines on bail-in fairly shortly. We don't exactly know what those guidelines are going to say, but as over time, I think as the market transitions into NBCC and with the bail-in framework, could be a good news and this a -- the whole industry has to finance the same way. So, I do expect that with the credit quality that the Canadian banks have that we will be able to tap the market successfully. But I don't think there's a particular hurry for us to do so.","Michael Goldberg - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the second part, let's put it that way of my question is, what are the operational efficiencies look like that you discussed in Footnote 19 of your press release?","Colleen M. Johnston","When we talk about -- are we talking about the restructuring charge now, Michael?","Michael Goldberg - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division","That's right.","Colleen M. Johnston","Yes, so there were a number of initiatives really across the bank. The ones I would call out in particular were some optimization of our branch network in both Canada and the United States and the number of other initiatives that are intended to reduce costs permanently and take those costs out of our base going forward. So that was the essence of the $90 million restructuring charges quarter.","Michael Goldberg - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division","Can you be a little more explicit about what that optimization? Any changes that amounts to?","Colleen M. Johnston","Yes, I mean this is really been part of a program that we started a couple of years ago. And as we mentioned last quarter, we were intensifying the efforts. So, we've been really focused on making productivity a competitive advantage for TD and a lot of that is about looking -- is about leveraging our scale and buying power to reduce our costs base, really looking for efficiencies right across the organization, whether it be in terms of distribution, in terms of structure, in terms of various activities in our corporate areas, or operations areas as well. So the charge that you're seeing is really quite broad-based, but I would call out the fact that we've -- we fine-tuned the network a bit on both sides of the board.","Michael Goldberg - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division","It doesn't sound like this means branch closures or consolidations. Or does it?","Colleen M. Johnston","We would call it optimization. I can refer to my colleagues here, but we would refer to it really is optimizing the network because we are in fact, continuing to increase our branches and opening new branches. But it's really a matter of optimizing and in fact, consolidating branches is the way would characterize it.","John Aiken - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John Aiken from Barclays Capital. Question for Mike. Mike, very impressive loan growth in the U.S. retail platform. Can you talk to the competitive landscape that you're seeing particularly in auto, but of course, on the other lines and whether or not you think you could sustain your relative growth or your market share gains will -- well simultaneously protecting the net interest margin gains that you been able to produce?","Michael B. Pedersen","There's no question that the growth is slowing but we're continuing to see that we're outperforming and the growth -- the slowing is mostly in mortgages and auto. But we're still significantly higher than the industry. So we expects slower growth going forward, but we still expect to outperform.","John Aiken - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Are you seeing competitive response in terms of pressure, what's being offered on loans?","Michael B. Pedersen","Yes, there's significant competitive pressure, whether it's on commercial loans or mortgages or in auto, but we're still able to compete and still able to take share.","John Aiken - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Then what does that mean for the outlook for margins on outside of what to the contribution Target has had to the portfolio?","Michael B. Pedersen","On loans?","John Aiken - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On loans, yes.","Michael B. Pedersen","There's pressure on loan margins, but in our case, that's not quite as bad as it might be given that we're disproportionately deposit-heavy and our deposit margins are looking better, which is leading to our view that margins overall will be stable to improving going forward.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thanks, John. So why don\u2019t we go over to the phones. Operator, please?","Operator","Our first question comes from line of Steve Theriault with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steve Theriault - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a quick follow on the auto question and if I could ask a question on the U.S. branch network. So, just to finish, to continue on John's question, I noticed that the loan growth was this quarter in Indirect Auto in the U.S. of $300 million and the run-rate pretty consistently for now -- the better part of a couple of years have been $600 million to $1 billion. So I guess the question, is there a structural deceleration there in the growth levels, given tighter margins are for whatever reasons will be slower on a run-rate basis looking out the next year? And the other piece, Mike, was I'd been hearing that branch hours are being scaled back somewhat in the U.S., sort of getting Intel that some of these branches that were open until 8:00 p.m. are being scaled back to 5:00 p.m. some days of the weeks. So maybe you could talk just a little about -- and maybe just update into the restructuring question as well? But maybe you could discuss a little -- any of initiatives you have to scale back down or scale down branch hours in the U.S.?","Timothy D. Hockey","So Steve, it's Tim. Let me take auto finance question. No question in U.S. there. As we said before, very competitive environment. We're actually reacting to that environment and to the thinner margins by -- now that we have over 9,000 U.S. dealers and we've had a little bit of time to operate with to those dealers, optimize that network because as you can imagine, there's a little bit of an 80-20 rule at play. So as a result, we expect that going forward, we'll have an actual smaller number of dealers as we concentrate our efforts from a servicing point of view on those dealers that really want partner up with us. And so as a result, we expect to have slower originations over the next few quarters as we make that transition.","Michael B. Pedersen","So, it's Mike. There's no change in our strategy. We, from time to time, tweak our hours, but always on the basis of what customers want, need and on the basis of customer usage. This is a very important differentiator for us and we continue to have the best hours in every market we operate in, and that'll continue to be our goal. In terms of stores, we expect that our store network will continue to grow on balance. So we'll open stores in high-growth markets where we're underrepresented in terms of stores or branches. So for example, this year, we'll open an additional 15 stores in New York City. I'm aware that there are U.S. competitors that are closing hundreds of branches, but our situation is a bit unique in that -- we're newer and growing. Our average households per store is 3,200 versus the average industry of 1,400. So other things being equal, we're not really over-branched. And I'd also say that we do -- we are of the view that in the distribution system of the future and with all our investment in mobile, online and so on, that stores will have a slightly different purpose, that they'll look different and so on. So in that sense, the stores that we're opening this year are about 35% smaller in terms of square footage compared to stores we've opened in the past.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thanks, Steve. Next question, please operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gabriel Dechaine with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Gabriel Dechaine - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions here. So you have disclosed the pension cost adjustment for 2013. It's not a real big number. I'm just -- it's not my point. I just want to know, what kind of increase in rates and what do we need to see for those expenses to start going the other way? And then, Colleen or Mike on the U.S. margin, you mentioned something about and I feel in your MD&A, acquired credit impaired loans and debt securities classified as loan. What was the accretable yield this quarter and what is meant by increased NII, I guess, from debt securities caused by these loans?","Colleen M. Johnston","Gabriel, hi, it's Colleen. I'll take both of those. So the last question was around the language-related to the NIM. So normally, I think, that was probably a lot of words to say the more accounting-driven versus what we would call core margin. So if you look at that 9 basis-point increase in the quarter, we would say that just over half of the increase was more accounting-driven relating to our acquired loans, in particular Target. And then the remainder was an increase in the core margin, as we've talked about, which is due to the expansion of deposit margins, partly offset by a bit of a decline in the loan side. And your first question was on the pension item. So we have disclosed the impact of the new accounting rules and as you say, our impact does seem to be somewhat smaller, perhaps on the other banks. We believe that's because of the fact that we have a -- had a smaller gap between our discount rate and our assumed rate of return, which is really what the new standard is focused on. So the impact on that as we will be for these new standards, obviously we'll be restating next -- last year's results and that's going to have about the $22 million impact. $22 million impact. So as we move forward, our assumption at the moment based on real rates were at the end of the year, we're assuming that our pension expense after this adjustment, IFRS adjustment is going to be relatively flat next year. So whereas this year, our pension expense increased by about $140 million, as I said earlier in my remarks, it was about 1% of our expense growth before. We expect that to not be a factor as we move into 2014.","Gabriel Dechaine - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. I mean, what kind of rate movement do we have to see before those expense increases become reversals? And I didn't quite get the acquisition comment on Target. So you acquired Target, you got all of these on NIIs, it's not like any accretable yield, right? It's just their contribution?","Colleen M. Johnston","Yes. So back to Target, they are just -- when you acquire loans, there are just tend to -- usually be some small accounting adjustments that happened as the portfolio season. So that was really -- it was a relatively small adjustment. But this is the same general phenomena that we have around acquired credit loans or acquired credit. And back to the pensions again, we're obviously, if rates rise, if loan rates rise, then we will see a reduction in pension expense going forward.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thanks, Gabriel. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Routledge with National Bank Financial.","Peter D. Routledge - National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions about Ameritrade. First of all, it sounds like Ricketts are selling off their position. 2 questions. Will another large shareholder, as large as TD, replace them or will just be widely held? And then, the follow-on would be do you guys have -- I understand your goals with respect to the ownership stakes being the same, but do you have more flexibility as a result of this ownership change?","W. Edmund Clark","Sure, I got -- let me just answer the first question. So if you look out what the basically this agreement provides for is -- in 2016, what you'll see is that the Ameritrade board will consist of 5 TD representatives, 6 independents and plus the CEO. And so, that will be the composition of the board and the agreement provides for that carry on for the next 5 years. I wasn't sure what your second other question was?","Peter D. Routledge - National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division","I mean, my perception was always with Ricketts on the board, you're very unlikely to accelerate taking a larger share in Ameritrade, if that's what you wanted with a sizable minority shareholder not there anymore. Did -- don't you have more flexibility if you chose to, say, 5 years from now?","W. Edmund Clark","I'm not sure either way on that. But I guess, what I think, we're saying is if you look at the interaction of the Basel rules with our ownership, that this a pretty optimal structure that we have right now and we're quite content to stay with this structure and really that's the -- if this agreement does or say, we're going to clearly stay with this structure over the next 5 years.","Peter D. Routledge - National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division","And then final, on this -- the sale of the Ameritrade shares, will there be any gain on that?","W. Edmund Clark","There might be a small gain.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thank you, Peter. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brad Smith with Stonecap Securities.","J. Bradley Smith - Stonecap Securities Inc., Research Division","I guess this is probably a question for Mike. Just with respect to the TD Ameritrade insured deposit accounts, which I think ended the quarter at about $73 billion. This is the fastest growing deposits of the bank and it's my understanding that you're paying a fairly hefty fee for them. I think it's probably something north of 125 basis points a year. With the struggle for margin in the U.S. My first question is, #1, can you make a positive return on these deposits? And #2, what are the types of investments that you can actually fund reasonably with these deposits with respect to the maturity duration issues and things like that?","W. Edmund Clark","I think you got us all upside down. And so, the answer is no. We do get a fee of 25 basis points for Ameritrade. We have to pay them LIBOR for these and so there's a margin that's left to us between that -- where LIBOR trades and this is quite -- this is an outstanding deal for Ameritrade because they get to gather the surprises and not put up capital and it's an excellent deal for us. So big win on both sides.","J. Bradley Smith - Stonecap Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, but I mean aren't you paying something north of $700 million a year in fees at Ameritrade?","W. Edmund Clark","Well, what you're trying to -- I think what you're trying to say is what do we is paying in LIBOR, when we paid LIBOR on $70 billion?","J. Bradley Smith - Stonecap Securities Inc., Research Division","I'm just saying what are you paying in fees relative to the deposits themselves? And I believe it's North of 125 basis points.","W. Edmund Clark","No. We pay no fees to Ameritrade. No fees Ameritrade. What we pay them is LIBOR on these deposits and the question is can we invest their deposits at LIBOR and we think we're smart enough to be able to actually do that.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Great. Thanks, Brad. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mario Mendonca with TD Securities.","Mario Mendonca - TD Securities Equity Research","A broad question on capital. 4 of the 5 large banks sort of have put up Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratios of 9 plus, including your bank. And while I don't think we're going back to the hay days of 4%, 5% share buybacks, is there something the industry is waiting for, looking for before the pace of buyback accelerates?","Riaz E. Ahmed","Mario, It's Riaz. Well, I think what you're seeing is that the whole capital question on a global basis isn't completely settled. We know, for example, that OSFI has issued guidelines which give the Canadian banks particular direction. We know that by 2016, there is 1% surcharge that is to be introduced as a result of the banks -- for those banks that are being designated as D-SIBs. And so I think the -- what you're seeing is banks holding more flexibility than you might otherwise, just to deal with more global uncertainties as the questions around leverage ratios, for example, are still raging and questions around related to ring fencing around the various jurisdictions are still going around. So I think you're just seeing banks hold more flexibility for now.","Mario Mendonca - TD Securities Equity Research","Do you think -- where do you think that the Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio will settle that, when everything sort of settles down, including information about the leverage ratio which I understand is coming along fairly well, OSFI is being at least intimating that they're not going to treat that as a regulatory minimum, but rather a tool, a regulatory tool. Where do you think the Basel III ratio shakes up the industry, Canada?","Riaz E. Ahmed","Yes, I would say, Mario, your guess is as good as ours. I say the information that you have around the convergence of leverage ratio and the whole debate around the U.S. leverage ratio and the BCBS leverage ratio and use of U.S. GAAP and IFRS GAAP is about the same as I understand it, that there is a desire to bring together a greater convergence. But, where it ultimately settles out, your guess is as good as mine.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thank you, Mario. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley.","Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. One, first just on the expenses. I know you just spoken to expecting sort of a seasonal uptick of around $100 million in the fourth quarter and obviously, there was some items that impacted this quarter. How should we think about that sort of seasonal pattern in 2014?","Colleen M. Johnston","So Cheryl, it's Colleen. So -- yes, let me step back from expenses. Generally, it is my favorite topic. So I think first of all, we've been talking all year long about the idea that we wanted to start to even out on level, in particular level of project and initiatives spend, as opposed to seeing it skewed so much towards the end of the year. And I think we achieved a lot of success in doing that this year. Our underlying project and initiatives spend is much more even and we think that this ultimately a wiser way to spend money and to pace our implementation. So we're happy with that. When we talked to you last quarter, we said we thought we could come in within the 3% increase in core expenses for the year and clearly, that didn't happen. So and better than that 3% growth, we expected expenses to be up about $100 million quarter-over-quarter. What you did see is that the increase in adjusted expenses was up about $220 million. So if you take out some foreign exchange, we would say that versus our expectations, the miss was about $100 million. And we've already called out the litigation-related charges in the wholesale bank and then performance-related or direct drive that was in the Wholesale -- in the Wealth business. So if you combine that, that was really the lion's share of the $100 million that the amount that was over our expectations. So I think going forward, what you should see in the first quarter is you should see our expenses down. I would say probably somewhere in the $150 million plus category or range. But going forward, we're going to continue to work to sort of say let's achieve more evenness in our expenses throughout the year. But I think you'll probably see a slight skew towards higher expenses in the fourth quarter.","Cheryl M. Pate - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick one for Mike. On the mortgage business, which has obviously been an area of really strong growth for you guys and slowing a bit, obviously given the environment now. Can you just -- maybe give us some more color on how you differentiate yourselves in terms of product and is your mortgage product more targeted towards the purchase market or how should we think about that as the dynamics of the industry change as mortgage rates sort of move up from here?","Michael B. Pedersen","So I think our advantage is more in our distribution network and the fact that we're growing our store network and expanding into markets where mortgages are easier to get. And we have a particular advantage because having grown as we have, we're very deposit-focused and less than 3% of our customers actually have mortgages with us and customers like dealing with TD. We have fantastic customer satisfaction. So, as you go to them and open a conversation about mortgage there, very inclined to speak to us. So that's the real upside we have, just being very underpenetrated in this business in our U.S. banking.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thanks, Cheryl and I think we got a couple of minutes. And I think, I'll let Ed wrap up with final remarks.","W. Edmund Clark","Well, I'm going to make a very short and sweet. From our point of view, while this wasn't a perfect year, it was obviously a miss on insurance.

Welcome to the TD Bank Group Q3 2016 Investor Presentation. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Gillian Manning, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gillian Manning","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to TD Bank Group's third quarter 2016 investor presentation. My name is Gillian Manning, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations at the bank.","We'll begin today's presentation with remarks from Bharat Masrani, the bank's CEO; after which, Riaz Ahmed, the bank's CFO, will present our third quarter operating results; Mark Chauvin, Chief Risk Officer, will then offer comments on credit quality; after which we will invite questions from prequalified analysts and investors on the phone.

Additional information on items of note, the bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q3 2016 report to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Gillian, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Q3 was a good quarter for TD. Earnings were C$2.4 billion, an increase of 6% from a year ago, and earnings per share were C$1.27, also up 6%. In our Canadian Retail segment, strong fundamentals in our personal and commercial banking and wealth businesses were offset by the impact of the Fort McMurray wildfires and a higher tax rate. Our U.S. Retail segment delivered impressive results across the board, with revenue expense and credit metrics all performing well. And our Wholesale Banking had a very strong quarter with higher lending and origination activity.","We also delivered good results on the capital and liquidity front. Our CET1 ratio rose to 10.4%, up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. Our leverage and liquidity coverage ratios remain above target. And we passed a major milestone, successfully completing our first CCAR submission in the U.S.","Turning to our businesses. Canadian Retail earnings were C$1.5 billion in the third quarter, down 3% from a year ago. Personal and commercial banking earnings rose 1%. Volume growth, higher fee income, and disciplined expense management helped offset higher credit provisions and lower margins. These continue to affect the year-over-year comparison but both improved sequentially.","Our wealth business had a very strong quarter, with double-digit earnings growth and another quarter of C$10 billion in net asset growth. The insurance business saw earnings decline as a further improvement in prior year's claims development was offset by higher claims cost this quarter, largely relating to Fort McMurray. I'm pleased to report that we reopened our Fort McMurray branches in June, and we continue to assist our banking and insurance customers as they return to their homes and community. We were proud to be the lead sponsor of last month's Fire Aid Concert in Edmonton, which raised over C$2 million to support the rebuilding effort, including TD's C$500,000 donation to the United Way of Fort McMurray.","Our U.S. Retail bank had a record quarter with earnings of US$512 million, up 14% from a year ago. Revenue growth was 7%, and expense growth, including acquisitions, was 3%, resulting in almost 4% of operating leverage. We recorded good growth in loan and deposit volumes. Credit provisions rose only modestly, and margins increased sequentially and year-over-year. We also continue to see the benefits of a stronger U.S. dollar in our consolidated earnings, with segment earnings up 21% from a year ago in Canadian dollars. I'm very pleased with the performance of our U.S. franchise. The work we've been doing to acquire new customers and deepen penetration is paying off across all our distribution channels.","The Wholesale Bank had a very impressive quarter, with earnings up 26% from a year ago to C$302 million. Growth was broad-based, led by higher fee income in Canada and increased activity in our U.S. dollar product offerings for corporate, institutional and government clients. We also had several notable wins in the quarter. We completed significant transactions with Suncorp [ph] and Altice N.V. and our equity research team achieved the No. 1 ranking overall in the Thomson Reuters Analyst Awards. All in all, a great performance across all of our Wholesale businesses. We're generating strong franchiseable earnings as we execute on our strategy of deepening client relationships and expanding our service offerings.","Overall, I feel good about our results at this point in the year. Three quarters into fiscal 2016, earnings are up 5.6% and EPS is up 5%. On the credit front, while the recent firming in oil prices is a welcome development, we made a further addition to our collective allowance this quarter to reflect volume growth and negative migration in oil and gas related exposures. Overall, credit quality remains strong and credit metrics are performing as expected.","Looking ahead, the environment is likely to remain volatile. The global economy is adjusting to the fallout from Brexit, low or negative interest rates, and still sluggish GDP growth. In Canada, the economy lost steam in the second quarter and there has been heightened concern about the Vancouver and Toronto housing markets. The picture is brighter in the U.S. where job growth and rising wages are supporting domestic demand, but other economic data have been mixed.","Amidst these shifting conditions, our North American platform and diversified business mix position us well. In our businesses, we continue to mine the growth opportunities in Canadian Retail that we identified at our Investor Day last fall. We're building on our momentum in U.S. Retail in our demonstrated ability to take share, and we are leveraging the strengths of TD Securities on both sides of the border. Overall, we remain focused on generating organic growth, holding the line on expenses, and investing productivity savings and improving the customer and employee experience.","Last quarter I told you about TD MySpend, a real-time money management app, which we have just launched. It's an intuitive tool that has resonated with customers looking for a simpler way to manage their finances. In May, TD MySpend was rated the No. 1 free app in Canada across all categories, and just four months later, we have more than 0.5 million users. We also relaunched our digital offering in the U.S. this summer. The new platform works on iOS and Android devices and has a variety of new features, including thumbprint ID and an enhanced mobile remote deposit experience, better navigation and self-service options, and a secured messaging capability that enables customers to communicate directly with us through the app. It's been downloaded almost 2.5 million times so far and the feedback has been great.","To wrap up, it was a good quarter and a good year-to-date. We're advancing our growth strategies, executing with excellence and continuing to innovate. I'm confident about our business model, proud of our team, and very excited about where we are headed.","With that, I'll turn it over to Riaz.","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you, Bharat, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. This quarter the bank reported earnings of C$2.4 billion and EPS of C$1.24. Adjusted earnings were C$2.4 billion and adjusted EPS was C$1.27, both up 6% year-over-year. Revenue increased 9% year-over-year, or 5% excluding FX and acquisitions, led by loan, deposit, and wealth asset growth. Adjusted expenses increased 7% year-over-year, or 2% excluding FX and acquisitions.","PCL increased year-over-year but declined 5% quarter-over-quarter. Segment reported earnings were C$1.5 billion for Canadian Retail, just under C$800 million for U.S. Retail and C$302 million for Wholesale, and the Corporate segment reported a loss of C$241 million, or C$183 million on an adjusted basis.","Please turn to Slide 6. The Canadian Retail segment earned net income of C$1.5 billion, down 3% year-over-year. Revenue growth of 3% was more than offset by higher insurance claims and a higher effective tax rate in the quarter. Total loan growth was 5% year-over-year, with personal lending volumes up 4% and business lending volumes up 10%. Deposits increased by 8%, reflecting growth in core checking and savings accounts, which were up 10%. Business deposits grew 8% and wealth assets grew 7%. Insurance claims increased 15% year-over-year, primarily due to the net impact of the Fort McMurray wildfire as well as other weather-related claims, partially offset by more favorable prior year\u2019s claims development. Margin increased 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting higher seasonal revenue, partially offset by lower lending margins. PCLs decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting lower delinquencies in personal banking. Expenses increased 1% year-over-year, and on a year-to-date basis, expenses are up 1%.","Please turn to Slide 7. Aggregate adjusted U.S. Retail earnings were up 16% year-over-year in U.S. dollars and 21% in Canadian dollars. The U.S. Retail bank posted earnings of US$512 million, up 14% on an adjusted basis from Q3 2015. Results for the quarter reflected higher revenue, positive operating leverage, and good credit quality. Total loan growth was 13% year-over-year, reflecting an 8% increase in personal loans and a 17% increase in business loans. Deposits increased by 9%. Margin increased 3 basis points quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a positive hedging impact and higher deposit margins. PCL increased 6% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to growth in the commercial banking portfolio. Adjusted expenses increased 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher employee cost and business initiatives, partially offset by productivity savings. Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade increased 31% year-over-year, primarily reflecting asset growth, higher trading volumes, and a favorable tax liability adjustment, partially offset by higher operating expenses.","Please turn to Slide 8. Net income for Wholesale was C$302 million, up 26% year-over-year from higher revenue. Revenue increased 12%, reflecting increased origination activity from debt and equity capital markets, higher corporate lending fees, and higher trading-related revenue. PCL was C$11 million, a C$39 million decrease quarter-over-quarter, reflecting lower specific provisions in the oil and gas sector. Non-interest expense increased 1% year-over-year.","Please turn to Slide 9. The Corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of C$183 million in the quarter compared to a loss of C$161 million in the same period last year. Net corporate expenses increased year-over-year, reflecting ongoing investments in enterprise and regulatory projects. The contribution from other items increased C$6 million year-over-year, reflecting higher revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities, partially offset by higher provisions for incurred but not identified credit losses.","Please turn to Slide 10. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.4% at the end of the third quarter, a 30 basis point increase, primarily due to organic capital growth. This quarter, we implemented AIRB models of our U.S. Retail exposures and advanced management approaches for operational risk. The impact was approximately neutral to CET1. Our leverage and liquidity ratios are consistent with last quarter. Overall, we remain well positioned for the evolving regulatory and capital environment.","I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you, Riaz, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11. Credit quality remained strong for the quarter as evidenced by reductions in the bank's overall level of gross impaired loan formations, gross impaired loans, and credit losses. Gross impaired loan formations are down C$229 million, or 4 basis points for the quarter, to C$1.2 billion. U.S. Retail accounted for the majority of the decrease with formations down C$122 million, driven by legacy interest-only HELOC and U.S. commercial loans. Formations in Wholesale decreased C$94 million due to lower formations in the oil and gas sector.","Please turn to Slide 12. Gross impaired loans are down C$99 million, or 4 basis points for the quarter, to 59 basis points. The Canadian Retail gross impaired loan rate at 27 basis points for the quarter remains at cyclically low levels. U.S. Retail was the main contributor to the decrease, with an improving trend in formations and resolutions within the legacy interest-only HELOC portfolio, along with good performance in the U.S. commercial portfolio, partially being offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. Wholesale gross impaired loans increased C$33 million due to two new formations in the oil and gas sector.","Moving to Slide 13. As indicated in previous quarters, U.S. strategic card PCLs are reported on a net basis for segment reporting, only including the bank's contractual portion of credit losses. For the purpose of the credit slides, we continue to report gross losses to better reflect portfolio credit quality. Provisions for credit losses were C$563 million, down C$29 million, or 3 basis points quarter-over-quarter, to 39 basis points. The primary factors impacting PCL in the quarter were: first, a C$39 million decrease in provisions for the Wholesale portfolio; second, a slower rate of reserve build for incurred but not identified losses recorded in the Corporate segment; and lastly, a C$34 million increase in U.S. Retail driven by volume growth. Year-over-year, the bank's provisions for credit losses increased 6 basis points due to a higher rate of reserve build and an acquisition in the U.S. strategic cards portfolio.","Please turn to Slide 14. The pace of new impaired formations and losses in the non-retail oil and gas producer and servicers segments slowed during the quarter as the price of oil stabilized in the C$40 to C$50 range and gas prices strengthened. Consumer losses in oil-impacted regions moderated and continue to be offset by favorable performance in the rest of Canada. Assuming oil and gas prices continue at current levels, I remain comfortable with my prior guidance for possible losses due to low oil and gas prices.","To conclude, the key takeaways this quarter are: credit quality remained strong and the credit impact associated with low oil and gas prices stabilized during the quarter.","With that, operator, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll now take the first question from the line of Meny Grauman with Cormark Securities. Please go ahead.","Meny Grauman","Hi, good afternoon. Revenue growth in the Canadian P&C business is a little bit under 2% year-over-year, below average. And I'm wondering how you view that. How much of that is a frustration? How much of that is just a reflection of your concern about the market specifically? There's been a lot of talk obviously about the housing market and some problem areas there.","Teri Currie","So maybe I'll break that into two pieces. Just in terms of revenue growth and sort of outlook, we\u2019re committed to the growth opportunities that we talked about in the fall in the Investor Day. We expect good volume growth across our businesses, good claims management, good wealth client acquisition. We're continuing to see record primary checking customer acquisition, which continues to give us great opportunity to continue to deepen relationships with those customers like we talked about in the fall Investor Day. We have opportunities where we're under sharing unsecured lending business, credit card, mutual funds and we're continuing to make good progress in all of those.","In our unsecured line of credit business, we had record acquisition in Q3. In our private investment and advice business, we had record growth in Q3. And when we look at external market share across a number of categories, mortgage unsecured lending, auto finance business, loans, personal long-term deposits and mutual funds, we're continuing to gain share. So I\u2019d say we have a good outlook on growth going forward.","In terms of the comments around the housing market, again, we continue to, I think, apply the same good standards we have over the past period of time across Canada, doing good business with customers across Canada. Market share, as I said, in mortgages is increasing. It's going up. We continue to feel good about the quality of our portfolio, about our standards, about the quality of our originations, and I would say, across markets, continue to generate good business. I would say that in the B.C. market, if we look at externally available data, our net portfolio growth and our market share would be slightly below the average.","Meny Grauman","Thanks for that. If I could just ask a question on the restructuring as it\u2019s flowing into run rate savings. You talked about C$600 million by 2017. How much of that is in the numbers right now?","Riaz Ahmed","Meny, it's Riaz, I think we're entirely on track with the guidance that we had given at the time that we took the restructuring charges.","Meny Grauman","Okay. And then I just noticed, related to that, the occupancy and equipment categories in the expense side had noticeable declines quarter-over-quarter. And I just wanted to know, how much of that was just maybe seasonal noise or how much of that was a product of the restructuring efforts?","Riaz Ahmed","I think you'd probably have a combination of both in there, Meny, and I think with the way the quarter-over-quarter numbers work out, I'm not so sure that I could give you more specific than that.","Meny Grauman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Good afternoon, guys. Just in terms of, if you can, Riaz, talk a little bit about the capital build. It was pretty strong this quarter. As you look out over the next six, 12 months, if you can remind us what sort of the capital deployment priorities are? And also if you can tell us what the outlook is in terms of acquisition opportunities in the U.S., if there's a geography we're focused on or particular assets that you would prefer to buy?","Bharat Masrani","Ebrahim, this is Bharat Masrani. On capital, as I've said previously, we look at our capital deployment strategies on a regular basis with various items coming into consideration. We start with how much are we going to need to support our core businesses with respect to growth. We also look at are there any particular gaps within our franchise that we need to either acquire or build that is going to require capital to be used. And we have done that consistently over the past little while. We also look at how the regulatory regime might be emerging or what expectations might be out there. So that is as well looked at. And then, as you pointed out, we also look at potential M&A activity in our markets. And for us, we have a stated strategy of looking at acquisitions in the U.S. I previously said that we would certainly look at any asset plays. You've seen us play an active role in the card space. Those are transactions and deals that we are very happy with and would love to have more. With respect to big acquisitions, we've said in the Southeast of the U.S., if there are tuck-ins available, we would certainly be interested and look at them seriously. So there is a whole framework we use from a capital deployment perspective. And that's how we assess the level of capital we may need or what else we should be doing.","Ebrahim Poonawala","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from the line of Gabriel Dechaine from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Gabriel Dechaine","Good afternoon. Can you hear me?","Bharat Masrani","Yes.","Gabriel Dechaine","So I just want to ask about that collective. It\u2019s the fifth quarter in a row I believe you're boosting the collective? I get that there's portfolio growth driving that. But is it really a regular item that we should expect to record? It has been five in a row. And it seems to me like it might be also putting you in a better position ahead of the IFRS 9 transition, which is in the first quarter 2018, I believe. Is that one way of thinking about it?","Mark Chauvin","It's Mark, Gabriel. I don't believe we did it last year, so it will be four quarters in a row that you'll be correct on that. And I would say that if you look at this quarter's increase, the C$40 million that was driven in the Canadian business, which includes wholesale, was really primarily due to negative migration in the oil and gas sector specifically. And we incurred that in the early part of the quarter, but we\u2019ve really seen it taper off since then. So I'm not looking for that to continue. The balance of the increase was really in the U.S. And I'd say it's split two ways: half pretty much goes to volume and you would expect the provisions to increase with volume; and the other half would be for foreign exchange. It's not linked to forthcoming IFRS 9.","Gabriel Dechaine","Do you have any indications on IFRS 9 yet or do you know when you'll do it to give us a sense?","Mark Chauvin","No, we're working through it. But, at this point, and looking at the methodology and how it's implemented, I'd say we're couple quarters away from having clarity on what the impact would be.","Gabriel Dechaine","Are you still thinking about it as a capital issue primarily as opposed to an earnings issue like on the transition? Because I know some estimates out there are for a pretty big increase in the collective provision for banks, not necessarily Canadian banks, but it would affect you.","Riaz Ahmed","I think, Gabriel, whatever catch-up adjustment there is to the allowance would certainly affect capital and we'll await guidance from regulators in how to deal with that. But I don't think we view it as a capital item. It is an accounting as to how you provision against future credit losses and that's how we're looking at it.","Gabriel Dechaine","All right, okay. Then just a follow-up on Meny's question. Teri, I appreciate the response you gave on all the things you\u2019re encouraged by and some of the growth that you're seeing in your business. I was just wondering, do you view this as a disappointing quarter for the last few quarters? The growth has been on the soft side. Or do you think this is more of a transition period and we'll have better results out of the Canadian Retail business in the next year or so? And then I'll slip in this one for Mike. Margins were up in the U.S. Is that something we should expect more of? Or do you expect it to stay flat from here on out? Because the Fed rate hike outlook doesn't look so rosy right now.","Teri Currie","Teri here. For the first part, I'd say our results were as advertised this quarter and I think that as I said before and as we talked about in the fall, we've got some really strong levers of growth in terms of deepening relationships with our existing customers that I do believe will pay off as we move forward. And we continue to remain committed to the medium-term objectives that we talked about.","Gabriel Dechaine","That was like 5% to 10% growth? Or 7% I think? Or...","Teri Currie","7% at the Canadian Retail level.","Gabriel Dechaine","Yeah, okay.","Mike Pedersen","And it's Mike. On the other part of your question. Yes, we had 3 basis point increase this quarter. It was really up for two reasons. One was some positive accounting benefit related to our balance sheet management. This is revenue neutral but resulted in higher net interest income and lower other income. And then the other reason was slightly better deposit margins because LIBOR was a bit higher and that benefits our rate-sensitive deposits. In terms of outlook, we'd still say that we expect relatively stable margins and NIM for the near term. And frankly, both on deposits and loans.","Gabriel Dechaine","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Sedran with CIBC. Please go ahead.","Robert Sedran","Hi, good afternoon. Actually, just a quick follow up on that question from Gabriel on the collectives. Just to be clear, in terms of the part that was related to migration, to the extent the losses do present themselves under identifiable, will they require a fresh specific or are you going to be able to dig into the collective to cover them?","Mark Chauvin","The way it would work is collective allowances for the performing book, so you have a certain amount that\u2019s set aside based upon the risk rating. When it becomes impaired, it comes out of the collective, so whatever was there is gone or is reversed. And you, based upon the specifics of the loans, set up a specific provision. So the answer is that, yes, the specific is covered partially by what was in the collective. It depends upon the size of the specific.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. Because otherwise it sounds like you\u2019d have to reserve for the same loan twice. But it sounds like you're...","Mark Chauvin","No, there are no collectives against impaired loans. Always specific.","Gabriel Dechaine","Understood. Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from the line of Sohrab Movahedi with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sohrab Movahedi","Thank you. Mike, the U.S., maybe can you talk a little bit about the \u2013 I know Bharat talked about the vibrant economy over there and the expectations and the outlook over there. If you can speak a little bit to your business and the types of volume growth and operating leverage that you were able to deliver this quarter and how you feel about that as far as the next, call it, four to six quarters are concerned.","Bharat Masrani","Yes, so I'll just start by saying that given our size in the U.S., there is a limit to how much our performance correlates with the overall economies. It\u2019s obviously better if it\u2019s strong. Our view is that our outlook is fairly good just based on the opportunities we have in the business and the competitive advantages we enjoy. In terms of the economy, the consumer is certainly strong and we're seeing that in our business. We're seeing strong business lending growth as well. There is a bit of a paradox there, in the sense that we've seen some weaker investment numbers in the U.S. economy recently. But I think it helps us that we are underweight in some of our U.S. lending businesses and have built strong capability and teams and our brand resonates well with the corporates and commercial customers. So we're finding that we're being very successful in growing that business.","The operating leverage was particularly strong this quarter. We're enjoying good revenue growth right now as volumes are good and our margin is stable. And my sense is that volumes will continue to be strong. It's possible that in some categories it will moderate a bit. Those might be commercial and auto, although I'm not seeing that yet. But as was the case with Teri's comments, we are very disciplined about our credit and we'll continue to do what's right for our franchise. And for the foreseeable future, I see our growth being good in the U.S. And in terms of expenses, I think hopefully, we'll be able to sustain the kinds of expense growth that roughly or broadly you are seeing right now, and therefore, we should be able to continue to deliver a positive operating leverage.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay. And just to go back to the collectives and business volume growth. You're not reaching I'll call it as far as credit quality or your risk appetite to generate the volume growth here, are you?","Mike Pedersen","No. To be clear, the business that we're putting on is very high quality. In fact, as we put on new business, whether it is in commercial or other areas, it's improving our portfolio. Whether you're looking at lagging indicators or leading indicators, we're not seeing any evidence of deterioration in the credit portfolio. I'll invite Mark to comment because he might be more objective.","Mark Chauvin","No. I think it's safe to say with the exception of the oil and gas sector, which we now see as kind of stabilized, portfolio quality throughout all of our other portfolios is really at very strong levels. That's certainly true of the U.S. And the reality is that volume growth will bring with it an increase in the collective. I mean that's just the way it works. If you're putting on incremental loans, everything else being equal, you're going to have an increase in your collective allowance.","Sohrab Movahedi","So, Mark, you're saying nothing to really read into a bank who's CEO is a former Chief Risk Officer that it\u2019s adding to the collectives? This is just \u2013 we shouldn't read too much into this?","Mark Chauvin","Well, no, I'd say we do an analysis of our change in collectives because it tells us a lot about our portfolio. And you look at it for increases that are driven by volume, or they can be driven by risk, which is a migration, which was in the oil and gas sector, but not in the other parts of the portfolio or methodology change. And really what we saw this quarter was other than the oil and gas sector, it was volume and the quality in the U.S. kind of offset some of the increase. It was improvement in the collective.","Bharat Masrani","Sohrab, I would just add that regardless of who the Chief Risk Officer of the bank might need, TD has always had a tradition of solid risk management and I'm glad to report that that continues.","Sohrab Movahedi","Glad to see it's continuing. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from the line of Sumit Malhotra with Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks. Good afternoon. My questions will be for Teri on Canadian P&C. I was interested that you stated that you feel you're still taking market share in residential mortgages. Because when I look at the last page of your supplement, it looks like for the past six months, the resi mortgage balances in Canada have actually been pretty flat, and I think we can agree that this quarter, in particular, is usually one that we have seasonal strength. Before you answer that, I just want to say I don't necessarily think that slowing the pace of growth in this business is a bad thing, given where we may be in the cycle of the housing market. But just wanted to come back to you and maybe Mark, it's tough to see from these numbers how you're taking share. And secondly, has there been any deliberate change on your part in terms of origination standards that has resulted in this slower pace of growth?","Teri Currie","So on the share, obviously, those are lagged numbers that we get externally. So I would say those numbers are the most recent that we have to measure how we're doing. In terms of this quarter, we had record mobile mortgage sales force originations and record branch originations. So we've had strong growth in the portfolio. I would say, we've done that by maintaining the same disciplines that we've had in the past. So I'm not concerned about the quality of the portfolio or of those originations. We'll have to wait and see through external reporting because obviously it is lagged, whether that does play out in increased share. But for what we know today, we're continuing to grow solidly.","Mark Chauvin","It's Mark. And from my perspective on the risk of new originations, which is really what you\u2019re getting at, I think the key part is to have a consistent underwriting strategy or underwriting guidelines that are the same throughout the cycle, and so they don't get weaker in exuberant times. And we're very strong in trying to do that. But, of course, over the last three or four or five years with increasing home prices, you do look at them and you say, I want to make sure that I'm comfortable with these underwriting standards and that they're good for our customers and that they will pass that test. So there have been some changes clearly. We put a lot more focus on income confirmation to ensure that the mortgages that we do provide to the individuals that they can service them certainly at the time that we provided it.","When we make exceptions, we put a structure in place to say that let's elevate the thought process of the decision-making, so when you're making exception that's out of the underwriting standard, it's not a bad thing as long as there's a compensating factor just to make sure there's a compensating factor. And the other is, we've put more focus over appraisals just to make sure that there's second pair of eyes on them and that we\u2019re comfortable with them. So these are things that naturally occurred over the last three or four years, and clearly, they\u2019re going to have an impact on areas that grow really quickly, because our policy is not to deviate from them regardless of how the market is going.","Sumit Malhotra","No, that's some really good color and I want to reiterate this point again. We might be sitting here a year from now and saying, hey, you guys were right to perhaps have a slower pace here. And for Teri, I mean, you've got some external data. Our data is the stuff that the banks tell us. And on that basis, we can see here that the mortgage growth has been slower. And again, I appreciate that color from Mark, because I think it makes sense given where we are in the cycle to perhaps put some changes in place.","Let me wrap up. The other question I had for this segment was on expenses. And we know you announced a couple of restructuring charges last year. And on the back of that, we're seeing, if I round the last four quarters on a year-over-year basis, the expense growth basically comes to zero. And Teri, as we look to 2017, I'm sure some of the benefits, if I can call it that, from the restructuring, will still be in place. But when we look at this lack of growth in expenses and compare that to some of the investments you're making in the business, what is a more reasonable level of expense growth that we should expect for Canadian P&C in 2017? I'd be surprised if it's zero again, but I'll hear that from you.","Teri Currie","So I wouldn't expect zero as we move forward. Obviously, we're continuing to pay attention to delivering over the course of the year a positive operating leverage. So that will be something, in that as we think about our plans for 2017 that we manage ourselves to over the course of the year, there may be some quarter-over-quarter differences and we will continue to make the investments we need to make. I wouldn't expect us to return to prior levels of expense growth.","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks for your time.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from the line of Doug Young with Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Doug Young","Hi, good afternoon. I guess my first question is for Riaz. The model refinements on the CET1 ratio, by my math, added about I think it was around 31 basis points to the CET1 ratio. And I apologize, I think you mentioned there was an offset in your prepared remarks, and I'm just wondering what that offset was and if you can give a little more detail. And then just around the movement of the U.S. Retail portfolio to the AIRB methodology, is that mostly done now for the U.S. or is there more portfolios that could move over? And if so, can you quantify what the potential impact would be?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes, I think on the CET1 impact, Doug, you have to look at, we transitioned U.S. Retail portfolios and we also went to the advanced measurement approaches for operational risks. So that is one offset that you would see. So in your flow of risk weights, you'll see that offset. The other thing you have to just be mindful of is when from a bank is reporting both on standardized and AIRB basis, the Basel calculation around expected credit losses are compared to your general allowances and adjustments are made to your capital that you'll see in our capital calculations in the supp pack. So the net will follow that \u2013 well, it turned out to be about neutral. The additional portfolio that remain to be transitioned is the U.S. non-retail portfolio, and that is still a work in progress.","Doug Young","Any timing of when would that be? Fiscal 2016, or is that most likely a fiscal 2017 event?","Riaz Ahmed","I think it's hard to call. As you know, there's a lot of modeling and work and data involved and then there's a regulatory approval process. So I think it's difficult to call what the timing on that would be.","Doug Young","And then just two maybe follow-up questions for Canadian Banking for Teri, I guess. I think just looking for a little more color on your NIM outlook, because it looked like NIMs were a little bit better than what we expected this quarter. And then also on the credit side, it looked like there may have been a bump in auto lending. Just wondering if you can elaborate on that. Thank you.","Teri Currie","So on the NIM, that was a seasonal change, as Riaz mentioned, and so we would stay with our guidance that you've had of modest downward pressure, a combination of low interest rates, product mix, and competitive pricing. On auto lending, are we talking volumes or NIM?","Doug Young","No, more credit.","Teri Currie","Yes, so in terms of increased volume?","Doug Young","Is that what drove the higher PCL for auto lending was volume or was there any...","Teri Currie","A few factors. One of the main factors would be volumes.","Doug Young","But you\u2019re not noticing any material increase in delinquencies or pressures on the credit side on that book?","Mark Chauvin","It's Mark. I'd say that on the consumer side, in the oil-impacted provinces, that's an area that we have seen. We mentioned that we've seen increases there. I'd say the auto is probably the leading increase in that category. And they are big numbers and they're offset by the rest of Canada, but clearly that's where we're seeing it.","Doug Young","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from the line of Mario Mendonca with TD Securities. Please go ahead.","Mario Mendonca","Good afternoon. First a question, again back to domestic banking. On page, I believe it\u2019s five of the supplement, we see that risk-weighted assets are down to C$99 billion from C$110 billion last quarter. Maybe there's a simpler explanation for that significant change? But I don't know off the top of my head?","Riaz Ahmed","Mario, transition to advanced measurement approaches for operational risk?","Mario Mendonca","That was the C$10 billion, C$11 billion move in the quarter?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes.","Mario Mendonca","Okay. By the nature of all the questions that are coming up, Teri, it's clear that the market is collectively scratching \u2013 we\u2019re all collectively scratching our heads on why this premium domestic retail bank isn\u2019t keeping up with its peers. So I know the banks do a lot of peer review. Is there anything you can think of from a structural perspective, maybe it's a mix of loans, mix of deposits, or anything that would explain why TD has lagged over the last little while in domestic retail banking? And I'm referring to margins, loan growth, a couple of things. Is there anything that you could point us to?","Teri Currie","So on the margin front, the biggest factor has been low interest rates and the cost of funds for residential mortgages in particular.","Mario Mendonca","And do you think that TD is different in some respect from your peers, because the TD's margins have been materially lower or declining more than the peer group.","Teri Currie","So we\u2019ve had a pretty good look at that and I think we feel that we\u2019re all in relatively the same place as it relates to NIMs and the outlooks for NIMs going forward.","Mario Mendonca","Year-over-year, TD's NIMs are down about 10 basis points. This is year-over-year in domestic retail. What we\u2019re seeing for the group is about half of that, maybe a little less than half. So there's nothing then, Teri, you can point us to that would explain why TD\u2019s margins are lower or deteriorating faster?","Teri Currie","Nothing beyond the lower interest rates, competitive pricing, and the cost of funds for mortgages.","Mario Mendonca","Okay, and then in other income just the fee side, that's another area where it does appear that the bank has lost some momentum relative to the peer group. Is there anything going on on the fee side that you would point us to?","Teri Currie","Nothing that I could point to particularly. I think on the fee side the increases have been primarily due to repricing.","Mario Mendonca","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And, at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Bharat Masrani for closing remarks.","A - Bharat Masrani","Thank you very much, operator. So just to wrap up, another good quarter from TD. And I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our nearly 80,000 TD Bankers around the world for continuing to deliver legendary experiences to our customers as well as continuing to deliver good performance for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and see you at next quarter end.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call.

Welcome to TD Bank Group\u2019s Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Gillian Manning, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gillian Manning","Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon and welcome to TD Bank Group\u2019s third quarter 2017 investor presentation. My name is Gillian Manning, and I\u2019m the Head of Investor Relations at the Bank.","We will begin today\u2019s presentation with remarks from Bharat Masrani, the Bank\u2019s CEO, after which Riaz Ahmed, the Bank\u2019s CFO, will present our third quarter operating results. Mark Chauvin, Chief Risk Officer, will then offer comments on credit quality, after which we will invite questions from prequalified analysts and investors on the phone. Also present today to answer your questions are Teri Currie, Group Head, Canadian Personal Banking; Greg Braca, President & CEO, TD Bank, America\u2019s Most Convenient Bank; and Bob Dorrance, Group Head, Wholesale Banking.","Please turn to slide two.

Any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation represent the views of management and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank\u2019s shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank\u2019s financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance.

Additional information on items of note, the Bank\u2019s reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q3 2017 report to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Gillian, and thank you everyone for joining us today.","Q3 was a great quarter for TD. Earnings were $2.9 billion and EPS was $1.51, both up 19% from a year ago. All of our businesses performed well in the quarter. Revenue growth was strong as we continue to harness the power of One TD to help our customers meet their financial goals. Insurance claims fell and we recorded a broad-based decline in credit provisions. Our efficiency ratio improved to its lowest level in over three years and we benefited from an improving operating environment with the resilient economic conditions further strengthening performance on both sides of the border.","Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with these results, which reflect the power of our client-centric model, a diversified business mix, and the investments we\u2019ve been making to enhance our omni-channel distribution capabilities, increase our productivity and enrich the customer experience.","The strength and stability of our earnings has also contributed to robust capital and liquidity metrics. Our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 11%, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter and our leverage and liquidity coverage ratios remain above target. Reflecting the strong fundamentals, we announced our intention to repurchase up to 20 million common shares for cancellation subject to regulatory approval. This builds on the 15 million common share buyback we completed in the second quarter and will better align our CET 1 ratio with our lower risk earnings profile, high-quality balance sheet, and proven ability to generate organic capital, while ensuring we remain well-capitalized with the anticipated closing of the Scottrade acquisition and implementation of IFRS 9.","Let me now comment on each of our business and how they performed in the quarter. Our Canadian retail segment earned $1.7 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Personal and commercial banking had a very strong quarter with 8% revenue growth, led by record originations in our real estate secured lending business and continued strength in checking and savings accounts, and business loan and deposit volumes. Credit provisions declined and remained at cyclically low levels. And expense growth moderated further, as we had indicated, resulting in positive operating leverage. Our wealth business performed well this quarter with earnings up 7%. We generated $8 billion in retail net asset growth, driven by strong mutual fund sales in our asset management business. And we continue to take share in our direct investing and advice businesses.","Insurance also had a good quarter with earnings up sharply year-over-year, reflecting more favorable experience of cats in our footprint this quarter. Our insurance business is well-positioned for the future. We are seeing strong adoption rates of our applications and tools including TD MyAdvantage a usage-based auto insurance app, which is designed to encourage and reward better driving habits. All-in-all, it was a great performance for Canadian retail as we continue to execute on our growth strategies and make customer-centric investments in our business. This quarter, that included making changes to our checking accounts to offer customers more convenience and features they\u2019ve told us they value. We also improved our credit card lineup with two cash back cards that round out our product offering; take up has been very strong on both fronts.","We enhanced our end-to-end digital capabilities in cards and real estate secured lending including signing an exclusive contract with the Canadian Real Estate Association that has added 25,000 national property listings to the mortgage affordability calculator in our digital home buying app. In small business banking, over half of all loans, up to $75,000, are now adjudicated in less than two minutes, delivering a much better customer experience. And TD Auto Finance had record volumes this quarter, reflecting our success, growing our wholesale relationships, which now number nearly 400, up from less than 50, a few years ago. These are just a few examples of the ways in which we are evolving our products and how we deliver them to help our customers feel more confident about the financial future.","Our U.S. Retail Bank also delivered strong results this quarter with earnings up 15% year-over-year to U.S. $519 million, our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Revenue rose 10%, led by loan and deposit growth, increased fee income, and higher margins. While loan growth slowed across the industry, we continued to take share while remaining within our risk appetite.","We managed expenses very effectively, generating over 500 basis points of operating leverage and driving our efficiency ratio to an all-time low. And our return on equity is higher with segment ROE above 10%. We turned in the strong financial performance while continuing to invest in enhancing our digital capabilities and our brand promise to Bank Human.","Last quarter, I told you about our new TD Send Money P2P service. It\u2019s off to a very impressive start with customers performing nearly 300,000 transactions so far. We\u2019ve also had good success with TD ASAP, which allows customers to authenticate directly to an advisor in a contact center from the digital device. TD ASAP authenticated its millionth call this month. Together with TD Voice Print, which authenticates using voice recognition, we are now pre-authenticating nearly 50% of all customers calling into our core banking queue. And TDAF, our auto finance business ranked highest in dealer satisfaction among non-captive lenders with retail credit by J.D. Power in the U.S., demonstrating again, our ability to compete and win by delivering a legendary customer experience.","Our wholesale bank performed well in Q3 with earnings of $293 million, comparable to a very strong quarter last year. Revenue rose 5%, reflecting higher trading and corporate lending. We continued to grow our U.S. dollar businesses and we won several mandates in the quarter, underscoring the success of the investments we have been making to grow or customer focus dealer.","On the heels of our work with Canadian National Resources last quarter, we were joint bookrunner on their recent bond offerings, the largest concurrent cross-border multi-tranche U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar offerings ever completed. We were also joint bookrunner for the Inter-American Development Bank\u2019s U.S. $2.3 billion issuance, the largest 10-year U.S. dollar sovereign supranational agency deal so far this year, a testament to the strides we have made in building our SSA business.","Overall, I feel good about our performance at this stage of the year. Three quarters into fiscal 2017, earnings and EPS are up 15%. A better result than we anticipated at the start of the year. This performance is partly attributable to a more favorable operating environment in the U.S. and more recently in Canada where stronger than expected economic growth has boosted activity in our businesses and driven a further decline in credit provisions from already low levels. Together with margin expansion in our U.S. Retail Bank, this has been very constructive for earnings growth. But, our good results also reflect our distinctive strategy and focus on execution. Time and again, our disciplined approach has enabled us to deliver consistent earnings against the variety of backdrops, and it allows us to move forward with confidence investing in our people and businesses to ensure we are ready to support our customers.","At this time, our thoughts are particularly with the people of British Columbia and Houston who are struggling with the wildfires and floods that have swept through their regions. We are making advice and assistance available to our customers in supporting the relief effort through donations to the Red Cross, and we will be there to help you as you return to your communities and begin rebuilding.","To wrap up, it was a very good quarter for TD, and it has been a good year to-date. We\u2019re delivering a profitable risk-adjusted growth while continuing to adapt and reinvent ourselves to serve our customers better. I\u2019m delighted with the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives, and I\u2019m proud of our people who are leading the way on our journey together to build the better Bank.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Riaz.","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you, Bharat. Good afternoon, everybody. Please turn to slide four.","This quarter the Bank reported earnings of $2.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year, and EPS of $1.46, also up 18%. Adjusted earnings are $2.9 billion and adjusted EPS was $1.51, both up 19% year-over-year. Results are strong across all of our businesses.","Revenue increased 7%. Net interest income rose 7%, reflecting loan and deposit growth and higher margin on average earning asset in both the Canadian and U.S. Retail segments. Non-interest income rose 6%, primarily due to fee income growth in all businesses and higher trading revenue. Expenses increased 5%, reflecting higher employee-related expenses and investments that we\u2019re making in our businesses. Provisions for credit losses declined 9% year-over-year, reflecting favorable credit performance.","Please turn to slide five.","Canadian Retail segment\u2019s net income was $1.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year, reflecting strong revenue growth, lower insurance claims, and lower provisions for credit losses. This brings our year-to-date earnings growth to 8%. Revenue rose 4%. Total loan growth was 5% year-over-year with increases in both personal and business lending volumes. Deposits increased by 11%, reflecting growth in core checking and savings accounts, and business deposits. Margin was 2.84%, up 3 basis points quarter-over-quarter, reflecting balance sheet and business mix. Balance sheet mix was favorable as deposit growth outpaced loan growth, reducing the need for wholesale funding. While many factors affect margins and they will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the improving economic environment in Canada is expected to support a more positive trend in the margin on average earning assets.","PCL was stable quarter-over-quarter and declined 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was a result of lower provisions in the credit card, personal lending and auto lending portfolios. Expenses increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher employee-related expenses and higher investment in strategic technology initiatives, partially offset by product activity savings.","Please turn to slide six.","U.S. Retail net income was $678 million in U.S. dollars, up 11% year-over-year, or $901 million in Canadian dollars, an increase of 14%, year-over-year. The U.S. Retail Bank earned US$590 million, up 15% year-over-year. The strong result was driven by 10% revenue growth, reflecting continued growth in loan and deposit volumes, a more favorable interest rate environment and fee income growth. Average loan and deposit volumes increased by 5% and 7%, respectively, both reflecting growth in personal and business customer segments.","NIM was 3.14%, up 9 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher interest rates. While many factors affect margins, we expect continued improvement in the event of further U.S. rate increases. The increase in PCL quarter-over-quarter primarily reflects parameter changes to the retail portfolio in the prior quarter. Expenses increased 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher employee costs, charges for store closures, and volume growth partially offset by productivity savings. Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade, decreased by US$9 million, year-over-year. We achieved a double-digit segment ROE for the second consecutive quarter.","Please turn to slide seven.","Net income for wholesale banking was $293 million, reflecting higher revenue and lower PCL, offset by higher non-interest expenses. Revenue increased 5%, reflecting higher trading and corporate lending revenues, partially offset by lower underwriting. We recorded no PCL in the quarter compared to $11 million of specific provisions in the oil and gas sector in the third quarter last year. Non-interest expenses increased 15% year-over-year, reflecting high variable compensation and investments in our U.S. businesses.","Please turn to slide eight. The corporate segment posted a net loss of the $150 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $241 million in the same period last year. The smaller loss reflects an increase in the contribution from other items and a decrease in net corporate expenses, partially offset by a loss on the previously announced sale of the direct investing business in Europe, which is reported as an item of note. The higher contribution from other items reflects incurred, but not identified credit losses recognized in the third quarter of last year, higher revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities this quarter, and higher tax charges recognized in the third quarter of last year. Net corporate expenses were lower, reflecting the positive impact of tax adjustments in the current quarter and timing of certain other expenses.","Please turn to slide nine.","Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11% at the end of third quarter, up 20 basis points from the second quarter. We had strong organic capital generation this quarter, which added 38 basis points to our capital position. The increase in risk-weighted assets before the effects of FX translation largely reflects Basel I floor offsets from reduction in Basel III credit and operational risk weights. We have some ability to manage the floor and its impact on capital through the use of market strategies to reduce higher RWA exposures. Our leverage ratio was 4.1% and liquidity ratio was 124%. And as Bharat noted, we announced our intention to amend our normal course issuer bid for up to an additional 20 million common shares subject to regulatory approval.","I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you, Riaz, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 10.","Portfolio quality remained strong during the quarter as evidenced by reductions in gross impaired loan formations, gross impaired loans, and credit losses on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Gross impaired loan formations ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, down $54 million or 1basis point, driven by lower formations in the Canadian RESL portfolio. There were no new formations in the wholesale portfolio.","Turning to slide 11.","Gross impaired loans reduced $305 million or 4 basis points for the quarter to $2.99 billion. The decrease for the quarter was due to a $197 million impact from foreign exchange and resolutions outpacing formations in the Canadian RESL portfolio.","Moving to slide 12.","As indicated in previous quarters, U.S. strategic card PCLs are reported on a net basis for segment reporting, including only the Bank\u2019s contractual portion of credit losses. For the purpose of the credit slides, we continue to report gross losses to better reflect portfolio credit quality. Provisions for credit losses are $512 million for the quarter, down 2 basis points, remaining at cyclically low levels.","To conclude, the key takeaways this quarter are, credit quality remains strong across the Bank\u2019s portfolios, and we remain well-positioned for continued quality loan growth.","With that, operator, we are now ready to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll first hear from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up. Riaz, you mentioned in terms of -- if I heard you correctly, positive margin outlook, both in Canada and in U.S. going forward. I just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of, it feels like after the GDP data this morning, we\u2019ve seen uptick in the market expectations for potentially September or maybe October rate hike in Canada. Can you talk about, in terms of what happens to the margin, if we don\u2019t get any additional rate hikes? And if we do, and how sensitive is that to the overnight [rate] [ph] versus everything about the five-year part of the curve?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. Ebrahim, as you know, upto now this year, this fiscal year, deposit margins have -- generally tend to widen when you get the interest rate increases that we\u2019re seeing. But, upto now, this year, you would know that in the market, credit spreads have been tightening, and so that can provide some offset into -- as liquidity premiums are compressed. So, overall, product margins have to now remain reasonably stable in aggregate. And in our case, the margin on average earning assets increased mainly because of the mix in the way the balance sheet is funded. So, I think that absent any further increases in interest rates, I think we would expect that the margins continue to bump around and remain reasonably stable.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Understood. And same thing in the U.S., good margin expansion this quarter, if we don\u2019t have the fed moving between now and year-end, should it be stable or there\u2019s still more juice from the June rate hike that should flow through into the fourth quarter?","Riaz Ahmed","I think that be a little bit leftover to come through, but it\u2019s now largely reflected in our numbers as the effect of the rate hikes have been reflected fully in the quarter.","Ebrahim Poonawala","Understood. And just very quickly on a separate topic, wanted to get your thoughts on -- you\u2019ve been active in terms of the private label card space. As we think about what\u2019s happening with the retail sector overall, like how do you view that business, like do you still think that\u2019s an area where you want to pick up share, you want to look for portfolio acquisition opportunities or are you reevaluating sort of your long-term investment outlook for that business?","Riaz Ahmed","Ebrahim, as you know, in the U.S., we have a very liquid balance sheet and the loan to deposit ratio remains at around 1 to 2. So, I think opportunities to acquire assets on attractive risk sharing terms, continues to remain a priority for us, and we will be continuing to look for those opportunities and cultivate them.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll hear from Meny Grauman of Cormark Securities.","Meny Grauman","Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the strong growth in non-interest income in the U.S., 19% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms, and I understand some of it is related to the accounting changes. But, I was wondering if you could scale that, sort of talk about how much of that is growth, absent that accounting change. And then, also, were there any significant fee increases in the U.S. in Q3, anything in terms of a big jump up in fees? Thanks.","Greg Braca","Hi. This is Greg Braca, thanks for the question. So, correct, some of that 19% increase is clearly from the change in fair value accounting that we signaled in Q1. But, I would also signal that there was strong non-interest income, fee income growth across many of the lines of business in the U.S. in Q3. That coupled with three extra days in the quarter on a sequential Q2 to Q3 view contributed to some of that growth.","Meny Grauman","Okay, thanks. And then, if I could just ask about Canada, you referenced obviously the very strong GDP numbers this morning. And if you look at personal loan growth of 4% year-over-year, a little bit on the lighter side, particularly if you look at mortgages, in particular up 1% year-over-year, credit cards 1% year-over-year. So, I\u2019m wondering why not be more aggressive in mortgages in particular, given the economic environment here? How much of that growth rate is really tied to you are being cautious rather than competitive dynamics?","Teri Currie","Hi. It\u2019s Teri. So, in terms of overall RESL growth, I think we feel pretty comfortable, and this is in line, if you particularly take out private label purchases with our mid single digit growth that we\u2019ve been projecting. We do look at total RESL growth, so that mortgages and FlexLine. And again, ex-private label purchases that year-over-year growth should be just shy of 5%. And I think we\u2019re very comfortable, we\u2019ve said before that we lend prudently through the cycle. And we\u2019ve been strategically repositioning that growth towards FlexLine where we have an embedded growth opportunity where it is a product for our customers that is more flexible for the right customer and stickier for us in terms of not having renewals associated with it. And I\u2019d say, given the puts and takes in the Canadian marketplace and some of the changes we\u2019ve made to our lending policies, in particular I\u2019ve noted before, reducing lending to borrowers who are financing multiple rental units above a certain number we\u2019re under indexed in highest growth markets of GVA and GTA, and we\u2019re very comfortable with that. So, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re pretty much on track with what we\u2019ve been projecting. We\u2019ll continue to lend prudently and put good risk-adjusted business on our book.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Gabriel Dechaine of National Bank Financial.","Gabriel Dechaine","I also had a card-related question, just a quick one here. Card fees look like they picked up quite a bit, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s Canada driven. And then, I guess looking forward, Aeroplan, that relationship\u2019s become an important one for you obviously and changes that were announced earlier little while ago. How do you plan to manage through the transition of Aeroplan over the next few years?","Teri Currie","So, it\u2019s Teri again. So, just in terms of cards overall, it was a strong quarter for cards, in particular spend levels on visa, on our core credit cards was above industry levels. We feel good about that. The fees are being generated by good growth in that portfolio, particularly again in our core cards. We are managing our growth and repositioning our product line-up, as you\u2019ve seen with the launch of our new cash back credit cards. So, feeling like we\u2019ve got a well sold out now product suite for Canadian cards and cash back was a real gap for us before.","In terms of Aeroplan particularly, versus you step back in the travel category, we\u2019re very well-positioned across all of our cards in the travel category with both Aeroplan and our First Class Travel card portfolio and card offerings for our customers. Obviously with Aeroplan, like an Aimia and all the other stakeholders in the market, we are paying close attention to how the situation is evolving. Right now, for our cardholders, given the 2020 date that Air Canada has stated that the offer will remain for our customers. The spend levels on that card are holding up very well, people are still engaging well with the product, acquisitions a little bit later. I would say that and as we pay attention to the evolution, we are watching it closely. Our goal is to ensure that our customers are well-served and they get a good value from the cards that they carry with TD. And again, we\u2019re very comfortable with our overall offerings in this category and across the board, to be able to manage the situation as it unfolds.","Gabriel Dechaine","You plan on deemphasizing marketing at all of the Aeroplan or no change?","Teri Currie","We\u2019d continue to make available all of the cards to our customers that are on our shelves in a way that\u2019s appropriate to meet their needs.","Gabriel Dechaine","My next question is for Riaz. You\u2019re late to the party on the efficiency momentum in a good way, fashionably late, I guess. And strong efficiency performance, operating leverage this quarter, and that\u2019s very positive. But, we saw that from other banks at the start of the year and then it faded and it\u2019s actually kind of disappointing this quarter. I\u2019m wondering, how sustainable your performance is. Are we going to have some sort of catch-up investment spending on the horizon that might through you off course a little bit or do you expect to smooth things out from here on out or let\u2019s say over the next year or not in perpetuity?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. Gabe, as we\u2019ve said in the past, we do look at each of our businesses and product lines, and assess what opportunities there may be to make investments in each of those businesses and product lines, whether it may be in the customers side of things or the operation side of things. And we don\u2019t necessarily time them in a particular, and they don\u2019t -- they are not really manageable within straight line quarter, quarterly outcome. So, we make the investments when it is appropriate to do so and let you judge whether on a quarter-to-quarter basis how you feel about our performance. I think overall, we have the lowest -- one of the lowest efficiency ratios in the banking industry. So, we feel very comfortable with that.","Gabriel Dechaine","Well, I guess more directly, like what we saw in the Q1 this year, is that -- we could see something like that developing?","Riaz Ahmed","Well, I\u2019ll just remind you, Gabe that when we took restructuring charges that we did in 2015, what we said is that we were making room to make investments, and that is exactly what we did in the quarter subsequent to that. So by the end of Q1 2016, our expenses were at a low point. And as we started making the investments in Q1, you saw a larger growth rate but we told you that that growth rate would moderate and it has been. So, I think we\u2019ve been doing exactly, as you would expect us to do.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay, understood. And a quick one for Teri. You said that -- was there any change -- you are not purchasing third-party mortgages as much as you were last year. Has there been any change in the origination mix from more proprietary channels and less in the broker channel?","Teri Currie","So, I think I\u2019ve mentioned this before the net margins of those purchases hasn\u2019t been as economic over the past period of time. And as such, we\u2019re purchasing when it makes sense. And so, proprietary originations, as I said, just shy of 5%. We will make purchases when the economics are right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Sedran of CIBC.","Robert Sedran","Just a quick one, a clarification of prepared remarks, actually. So, can you help me understand why you would simultaneously have a DRIP issuing from treasury and a buyback?","Riaz Ahmed","Rob, we offer the DRIP, as you know at a 0% discount as a service to those for our investors who like to have an ability to receive their dividends in the form of stock and then we offset that in the annual repurchases to offset the dilutive effect. So, it\u2019s more a service to our retail investors in particular. ","Robert Sedran","So, do you see this as a net buyback or just offsetting the impact of the DRIP?","Riaz Ahmed","Well, the offsetting the impact of the DRIP and options buyback was really in the previous quarter; this buyback is more pure.","Robert Sedran","Okay, thank you. And then, just a follow-up on some of the comments that Teri was making on the FlexLine The growth does seem to accelerate this quarter. I\u2019m just curious if you can provide a little bit of -- little more granularity behind? In other words, are these new accounts to the bank, are they just new accounts on FlexLine period or are they draws from existing lines that are already open? And of the new accounts, are they new to TD or are they perhaps coming from some of your mortgage customers?","Teri Currie","So, let me just step back with what I\u2019ve been saying over time. So, we were off market in terms of the competitiveness of our FlexLine products going back a couple of years ago, and we\u2019ve made investments to improve that product. Now, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that investment pay off. So, it\u2019s very much on strategy. The growth is new originations, utilization is very stable, and primarily that growth is in the fixed term portions of the FlexLine product. We have quite an embedded growth opportunity in this product for our existing TD customers. And so, new originations are in line with strategy.","Robert Sedran","So, it\u2019s mostly taking for an existing TD customers at the moment rather than new customers of the Bank. Is that fair?","Teri Currie","It is both, because we\u2019re signed FlexLine in more than one channel. But, I would say, our primary opportunity that we\u2019ve been focused on is other financial institutions borrowings to TD.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Nick Stogdill of Credit Suisse.","Nick Stogdill","Hi. Good afternoon. Teri, just sticking with the HELOCs actually. Could you just talk about how B20 might impact your outlook for this product? And would the impact on the FlexLine from B20 be any different for that of a mortgage product?","Teri Currie","I am not sure that I see a real impact to the product in terms of the loan-to-values for a fixed origination or float origination would be well in line with evolving B20. So, I am pretty comfortable that we should be able to stay on the pace that we\u2019re on.","Nick Stogdill","Okay. So, FlexLine can continue to grow at the current pace and with the overall market, if B20 did kind of get implemented later this year, there would be no difference\u2026","Teri Currie","Sure with the fact that we have an embedded growth opportunity in this product, we have lots of room to continue to originate FlexLine to TD customers in particular.","Nick Stogdill","Okay. Thank you. And then, just on the efficiency in Canadian banking, if we exclude wealth, it looks like a new all-time low below 42%. And I know you\u2019ve been focused on slowing the pace of expense growth there. So, maybe if you could just talk about the sustainability of the efficiency ratio at this level or maybe what we should expect going forward?","Teri Currie","If we step back just in terms of the expense growth year-over-year that we\u2019ve been talking about through the year, we\u2019ve been saying that it would moderate over the year, and it has. Like Riaz said, we will continue to invest in our business when it makes sense. I\u2019ve been a bit opaque on what that investment has gone toward in the early parts of the year. But given this quarter, many of those investments are starting to pay off for us with new customer capabilities. We see now from a digital perspective, we continue to be the highest in terms of unique users to our mobile app. 60% of our digital users are mobile active users, which is a new high that we achieved. All of our branches have iPads and Wi-Fi that we can use with our customers to help them take up our digital properties. We this year or this quarter launched such that a Canadian can now purchase a checking account, a savings account or a credit card end-to-end online. And if you are a TD Canada Trust customer, you can do that with a pre-approved card in two minutes. We have digital mortgage application end-to-end start to finish.","So, from a digital standpoint, those investments we\u2019ve been making have been paying off. The cash back cards that we talked about are the enhancements to our checking account lineup, and we are the only Canadian bank with mobile app in both traditional and simplified Chinese. And I\u2019d say all that just to say that if we can make those kinds of investments in the future and those pay off, we would continue to do that, and that means efficiency ratio bumps around.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Chan of Canaccord Genuity.","Scott Chan","Hi. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the Ameritrade-Scottrade acquisition in terms of expected closing date. It seems like, it could be held up by fed approval. Is that something that you could update on?","Greg Braca","Hi. Yes. Scott, it\u2019s Greg Braca. I would say that we\u2019ve commented earlier that we expect the transaction to close during the fourth quarter. And all things being equal, we expect that to continue to occur.","Scott Chan","Okay, great. And just sticking to the U.S., there is lot of talk on the Canadian side in terms of personal mortgages, HELOCs. Just looking for an update on the U.S. side in terms of kind of the expectations there and what you\u2019re seeing on the ground in terms of growth in products such as the mortgages, HELOCs and potentially auto?","Greg Braca","Sure. Thank you. So, well, first, we\u2019ve signaled since Q4 last year that the aggregate loan growth we\u2019ve seen at the Bank in the U.S. was going to come off some of those peaks, because some of commercial and corporate banking businesses we had grown into somewhat of a more of a natural size. But we continue to focus on mortgage, home equity, credit cards and many of the consumer products, given the age and maturity of the business in the U.S., as you\u2019d expect, whether it\u2019s you\u2019re looking at household penetrations, or how much we\u2019ve gotten of the national share of our customers\u2019 wallet versus peers. We still got a lot of upside to go there and we do think there is more growth to come from all of those products.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Doug Young from Desjardins Capital Markets.","Doug Young","Good afternoon. Teri, just back to you, in terms of the mortgage growth 1%, HELOC growth 11% in that pivot and shift. Just want a clarification, any implications for NIMs or PCLs if that pivot continues?","Teri Currie","So, comfortable that there would be no implication to PCLs on the pivot. And in terms of NIMs, FlexLine is a more profitable product for us.","Doug Young","Okay.","Teri Currie","And it also is more sticky and that they don\u2019t have renewals on an ongoing basis.","Doug Young","Okay. And then, and Riaz, I guess in past in Q4s, we\u2019ve seen mix tick up as there has been higher accruals, and just trying to get a sense as you\u2019ve signaled in the back half that you expect expenses to come down as we go into Q4. Is this quarter indicative of what we should be thinking of or is there going to be a typical bump up in expenses as we move into Q4?","Riaz Ahmed","Dough, there are obviously things such as taxes and other things that do get accrued in Q4. So, it is not unreasonable to a expenses that tick up like that. As you know, we\u2019ve moderate that uptick a fair bit. And I expect that this year will be similar. So, but, overall, what we said is that expense growth would down moderate on a year-over-year basis. And so, I think that continues to -- expect to deliver that.","Doug Young","Is it fair to go back the last few years and just look at the difference in Q4 versus Q3 as a sense or is it -- you indicated that maybe you can moderate some of that sensitivity.","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. A lot of that -- it can depend on the level of projects you\u2019re undertaking and issues like that. So, I\u2019m not so sure that that would give you an accurate perspective, but directionally you can get a view.","Doug Young","And then, just lastly, risk-weighted assets in corporate came down $14 billion; I know, exposures came down by a similar amount. It did have a decent impact on your risk-weighted assets in the CET 1. Just hoping to get a little bit more color on that.","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. On a quarter-over-quarter basis for risk-weighted assets, Dough, overall, they were down from about $420 billion to $408 billion. A large part of that is FX translation, which materializes into risk-weighted assets. But for CET 1 purposes, we hedge effects. So, you don\u2019t see that impact come through on the CET 1 as much. And then the offset would be through the Basel I floor, which picked up this quarter.","Doug Young","But, corporate itself, then exposure is down, was that FX related or was there just something going on in the corporate loan book, like in the corporate division?","Riaz Ahmed","No, I mean, we have treasury activities in the corporate division. So, it would be number of different parts moving around. I wouldn\u2019t attribute it to any one thing.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll here from Sumit Malhotra of Scotia Capital.","Sumit Malhotra","I want to start with Teri and maybe Riaz, just on the deposit growth in Canada and how that\u2019s affecting NIM. So, Teri, when I look at the numbers you provided us here, commercial deposits or business deposits for TD in Canada, I think they\u2019re up something like 6% on the quarter and 16% year-over-year. First off, just making sure those numbers are -- those are correct. What is driving that level of commercial growth starting with the quarter, but even if just look back over the last little while, it\u2019s really been accelerating?","Teri Currie","So, I would -- I think, I\u2019ve said this once before, I think this is Paul Douglas who leads commercial bank lending business in a very good ways, he\u2019s been focused over many years on organic growth, on building relationships in the marketplace and that consistency and having bankers locally and close to customers has paying off. And we\u2019ve seen that in strong deposit gathering and solid loan growth over a long period of time.","Sumit Malhotra","And the deposit uptake has nothing to do with the change in pricing. It just -- it seems strange to see that magnitude of increase without having to pay for it and business is somewhat commoditized?","Teri Currie","I can assure you that Paul is not buying [ph] business. ","Sumit Malhotra","All right, if that\u2019s the case. And Riaz, your comments on NIM benefiting, is this -- I never really thought of TD, especially in the context of the Canadian banks as one that was that wholesale reliant, anyway. But, is this as simple as to say that you\u2019re getting more deposits from actual TD customers, so whatever little bit that is lessening your reliance on having to go outside, that\u2019s the pick-up that you expect to see in NIM?","Riaz Ahmed","Well, as you know, if you break down our balance sheet, Sumit, and it\u2019s pretty evident in the sub-pack were looking at business loans that are in Canada, we are a net asset generator; and in the U.S., we\u2019re a net deposit generator. So, in Canada, we do use wholesale funding to fund the Canadian Retail segment and when that loan to deposit ratio -- when the deposits outpace loans in terms of growth, you get a very nice benefit in your margin on average earnings assets.","Sumit Malhotra","All right. My last question or second question is going to be for Mark, and looking at and thinking through the trend in your provisions. You gave us a lot of information here, so I\u2019m going to try to keep it high level. But last two quarters, your aggregate provision level on a core base is about 500 million, somewhat noticeably down from what we had seen over the last year, year and a half despite the fact that the loan growth has continued. Specifically, it seems to be the incurred but not identified line. I know, in Q1, there was some noise specifically relating to auto, I believe in the -- auto and credit cards in the U.S. But, I just wanted to ask you, Mark. This new level that you\u2019ve been at in provisioning in the low 30 basis-point range, do you view that as more sustainable then the 40 issue you were running at before? And specifically in the incurred but not identified line, what\u2019s been the key driver that has brought that level down so sharply this quarter compared to where it was running previously?","Mark Chauvin","Let me go answer that in two parts. First, for the loss rate of low 30s or 33 basis points this quarter. I would say, less indicative of a strong credit quality, during benign economic conditions. And I would put that, the lower end of the range, and you\u2019ll probably -- a level that based upon our mix of our balance sheet would be unlikely to get stronger. But, in strong economic conditions, like we\u2019re enjoying and forecasting, something in the 35 to 40 to me would kind of be the range, I would expect.","When you talk about provisioning, incurred but not identified, they\u2019ve been maintained relatively constant in terms of dollar amount. So, the percentage you are saying is reducing, which is probably an indication of strength in credit quality. We did build in the -- during the last year and a half in the oil and gas sector, and we did see negative migration during that period, which we\u2019ve seen a reversal of that in the last several quarters. But, those reserves have kind of been taken up by volume growth but that will translate into a lower percentage coverage. But from my perspective, we\u2019re following the very same methodology that we\u2019ve always used for establishing reserves across the portfolio, and that hasn\u2019t changed.","Sumit Malhotra","And I\u2019ll leave it by saying, and it was touched on earlier in the call, seemingly improving economic backdrop in Canada. You talked about what you\u2019ve seen in the U.S. for the most part. So, from that perspective, you are not necessarily going to get better from here but a low 30s ratio isn\u2019t out of line with the strong economic environment in both countries. That\u2019s a fair statement in your opinion?","Mark Chauvin","I\u2019m not sure if I go low. [Multiple Speakers]","Sumit Malhotra","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question will come from Darko Mihelic of RBC.","Darko Mihelic","Thank you. I have three questions. I just want to be real brief with them. Just going back to, Greg, your answer with respect to the fee income year-over-year growth. If I look at it, just want to make sure I understand. This is really purely a modeling question. So, if I think of $124 million increase in those revenues, how much of that is true and how much of that would be just the absence of that previous accounting noise?","Greg Braca","Well, I\u2019m not so sure that we have a split up, the category of non-interest income and gave that level of detail. But, what I can say is that we have seen good strong fee income growth because of new account generation, account growth, household growth, and good commercial activities. And after one more quarter, this fair value hedge comparison year-over-year goes away. So that would be more of a true-up than to what we are really generating in fee income on a go forward basis.","Darko Mihelic","Okay. And then, maybe over to Riaz, this fair value accounting is now in the corporate segment. Was it particularly negative or positive this quarter?","Riaz Ahmed","Actually, this particular quarter, it wasn\u2019t that influential, Darko.","Darko Mihelic","Okay. And then, my last question is with respect to the Canada segment. What is the impact of the sale of the direct business in Europe? And really, would be helpful to get the revenue expense and net income impact of that. It seems -- sense is that you may have been losing money for you recently. But, any help would help with the model.","Bharat Masrani","Yes. I think, Darko, it\u2019s relatively immaterial operation. So, I get your point about the line items, but I think if you look at retail performance in aggregate, you wouldn\u2019t end up concluding much out of it.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll hear from Mario Mendonca of TD Securities.","Mario Mendonca","Riaz, if we could start with this other, other income that is -- it\u2019s about a $180 million this quarter when I add back the $42 million loss on the European wealth management, and that compares to a loss of $52 million last year. So, that swing is pretty big year-over-year. You gave us a list of things that would have affected that. One of them was treasury activity. Can you give me a sense as to how much the treasury activity would have driven of that nearly $230 million delta year-over-year?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. I think that you\u2019re thinking of within the non-interest income line the components, other. So, there is a fair bit of activity that goes through there, Mario. There is, as I said earlier, the hedging impacts that go through there, the direct investing loss that you mentioned that goes through there. There can be cumulative translation adjustments that get realized into income that goes into there. And so, there is a fair number of, like equity pickup on smaller investments et cetera. So, it is a fairly wide -- lots of different line items that have those kinds of fluctuations. But hedging related activities in last year would have been considerably more negative than this year.","Mario Mendonca","Does that directly fall to the bottom-line?","Riaz Ahmed","Well, it does fall to the bottom-line, Mario. But, as we\u2019ve explained before in the past, hedging activities, the hedging effectiveness issue is really an accounting timing issue and less of an economic issue. So, over the course of the hedge term, it all works out. But, because of the way the mark-to-market pieces of the accounting work, you can sometimes and it contributes positively and sometimes it contributes negatively, and it just creates a noise as a result of that, which is why we moved it off to corporate.","Mario Mendonca","Part of where I am going with this, now I want to go to a very broad question is the sequential increase in EPS, adjusted 1.34 to 1.51 is obviously very big. And a portion of that sort of relates to that line and that\u2019s why I am trying to get a better sense of what\u2019s in there, so I can determine the sustainability of the result. But, let me ask it then very broadly, Riaz and perhaps Bharat. Do you see this new move to 1.51 as a new step up and now this is the new sustainable EPS quarter level for the Bank or is this a highly unusual number that we shouldn\u2019t put us much weight or is it somewhere between?","Riaz Ahmed","Let me give you sort of some numbers there or thoughts to work with, Mario, and then, I\u2019ll let Bharat address the thematic issues, if you like. All these numbers that we\u2019re referring to, whether it\u2019d be the fact that we had collective allowances a year ago; we don\u2019t have collective allowances this -- in the quarter, this year. We had a better insurance claim performance, because we had catastrophes and Fort McMurray fire last year, we don\u2019t it this year. We talked about the hedging effectiveness, as you pointed out. So, all of these numbers can have the effect of moving our comparisons around a little bit. But, what I would emphasize is that they\u2019re really in the context of business as usual and should be thought of as part of the Bank\u2019s performance.","Bharat Masrani","Mario, what I would add is that if you look at the macro situation, you saw the Canadian GDP number come out today, and you\u2019ve seen the U.S. number get revised up. You\u2019ve seen interest rates move. You look at TD\u2019s business mix in relation to those moves and you say that the overall environment, the operating environment is much more friendly than it might have been a few years ago or even last year. So, you\u2019re seeing that play out in our numbers now. Now, as usual, there are lots of puts and takes here. Sometimes, you might have a situation that a geopolitical event or some economic issue that might be regional or a major move in certain commodities might pull that back. So, it\u2019s hard to predict exactly where you might be. But, I feel that from a operating environment, if you believe that some of these growth numbers in both these major economies will continue to be sustained, then, it\u2019s a positive environment for TD.","But as usual, as Riaz just mentioned, you will have -- we\u2019re not running the bank to go quarter-by-quarter, if there are opportunities for us to make the right investments. I think Teri talked about it. We will certainly take advantage of those opportunities. If there are issues that make sense for us that may result in our efficiency ratio moving around, we worry less about that than perhaps some might. So, yes, this can bounce around. But, the overall economic environment and the interest rate environment is more positive than we\u2019ve seen over the recent past.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bharat Masrani for closing remarks.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Operator. And thank you to all of you for joining us today. I know this was a little early as in before, but I\u2019m told by Riaz and Gillian that this was in response to some of the feedback we were receiving. So hopefully, we are -- we\u2019ve been able to do this call in sufficient time. I\u2019m very happy with the quarter. The team\u2019s right across the world, 83,000 strong, continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. And I look forward to talking to you folks again in the next 90 days or so.

In a rapidly changing environment, we succeeded by staying true to our customers centric strategy drawing on the power of One TD to support our customers today as we transform the Bank to serve them better tomorrow. Riaz will review our results in more detail but let me single out a few measures that underscore the strength of our performance.","Earnings and EPS increased by 14% this year and total bank net income of $10.6 billion across the $10 billion mark for the first time. Revenue growth was strong and we achieved 260 basis points of operating leverage while investing for the future.","Return on equity rose to 15% with gains in all of our business segments. We generated 140 basis points of organic capital over the course of the year enough to fund the Scottrade acquisition and our share buybacks while maintaining strong CET1 and leverage capital ratios. We increased our dividend paid by 9% for the full-year and total shareholder return was 25%.","I will now highlight some of the key accomplishments in each of our segments. Canadian retail had a terrific year with earnings up 9% to $6.5 billion reflecting good revenue growth and positive operating leverage. In personal and commercial banking, we maintained our market leadership position in core banking business lines and had strong growth in anchor products including double-digit increases in checking accounts and business deposits and record originations in real estate secured lending.","We grew our lead in personal non-term deposits and took share in priority areas like HELOC and unsecured lending, and with the introduction of our new cash back and every day rewards cards, we have a top-notch suite of retail and business credit cards.","In our wealth business we continue to execute on our growth strategies recordings share gains in our direct investing and advice channels particularly private investment advice where we've taken share for nine consecutive quarters. We also generated $6 billion in long-term fund sales more than twice the level in 2016. And our insurance business had another good year with record pretax income and lower claims reflecting fewer severe weather events and favorable prior year's claims development.","Across our Canadian retail businesses, we continue to win new customers by delivering personalized connected experiences we had deepening relationships with existing ones by bringing more of the bank to them. That's what our One TD strategy is all about partnering across business and product areas, leveraging our scale and best-in-class distribution network to enable customers to interact with us seamlessly.","We've also been making purposeful investments to build the Bank of the future simplifying processes, building scalable platforms and solutions, and leveraging our in-house team of designers, developers, engineers, architects, data-scientists and researchers to help our customers feel more confident about their financial lives.","We've outfitted all of our Canadian branches with Wi-Fi and iPads and doubled our network capacity improving response times by more than 50%. We continue to add digital capabilities like a unique way of customers to understand the cost of home ownership, search for a property and get prequalified for a mortgage, the one seamless online experience.","We have the number one-ranked mobile banking app in Canada according to Silicon Valley based firm App Annie and the highest number of mobile unique visitors according to comScore. We've added a mobile creating tool to our award-winning web broker platform which moves our direct investing business even further ahead of the competition. Over 10% of trades in DI are now taking place via mobile.","And for the 13 years in a row, TD Canada Trust won the Ipsos Award for overall customer service excellence among the big five banks, as well as the ATM, online and mobile banking awards. Overall, a great performance by our flagship Canadian retail franchise in 2017.","Our U.S. Retail Bank also delivered impressive results this year with earnings up 16% to US$2.2 billion. Revenue grew by double digits reflecting margin expansion in the rising rate environment and healthy volume growth. We manage expenses well achieving 500 basis points of operating leverage and reducing our efficiency ratio by almost 300 basis points for the year and our return on equity increased by 100 basis points.","You'll recall that in 2013 we reached a target we had set to deliver US$1.6 billion in earnings in our U.S. Retail Bank. Four years later we've grown that by over $0.5 billion by adding customers and taking share in virtually every line of business.","In the Consumer Bank, we are building on our strength and checking account acquisition and deepening relationships. In the Commercial Bank, we've tripled the size of our corporate and specialty book. We were just ranked highest in small business banking in the South region according to 2017 J.D. Power Small Business Banking Satisfaction Study for the first time. And TD Auto Finance rank highest in J.D. Powers 2017 Dealer Financing Satisfaction Study among non-captive lenders earlier this year.","We've built our cards and wealth platform through strategic relationships and selective acquisitions and we've generated productivity savings that we are redeploying in frontline staff and investments to drive the next leg of our transformation from new customer and commercial lending platforms to digital tools like TD voiceprint, TD ASAP, TD Send Money and our banking app which rank number 3 in mobile bank app satisfaction according to the 2017 J.D. Power U.S. Banking App Satisfaction Study.","We were also pleased to close the Scottrade transaction this quarter further strengthening our relationship with TD Ameritrade. The contribution from our investment in TD Ameritrade increased 7% this year bringing U.S. Retail segment earnings to US$2.6 billion up 15% year-over-year.","Rounding out our strong results in 2017, earnings and our wholesale segment rose 13% surpassing $1 billion in ROE climb to 17%. We have substantially increased the earnings power of TD Securities which continues to build on its leadership position in the Canadian market and occupied the number 1 or number 2 spot in the key domestic rankings including equity and equity options block trading, government and corporate debt, underwriting syndicated loans, M&A announced and completed and equity underwriting.","We also made significant progress building our U.S. dollar franchise and growing our lead managed corporate SSA and FICC businesses. Our One TD strategy has been critical to this success. Our corporate investment, banking and global markets team are working with all-bank partners to grow the collective bank franchise, and TD Securities continues to partner with the U.S. Commercial and Retail teams on a client coverage model that will drive growth in both businesses.","We also demonstrated our commitment to environmental leadership and support for the transition to a lower carbon future. TD Securities has helped to underwrite nearly $11 billion in green bonds since 2010 and led a US$1 billion issuance with TD this year one of the largest green bonds ever issued by a Bank.","Overall 2017 was a strong year for TD across the Board and we expect to carry that momentum into 2018. As always, there are issues on the horizon from the impact of the latest mortgage rule changes in Canada to the NAFTA renegotiations to geopolitical uncertainty but the macroeconomic environment remains broadly supportive. The Canadian and U.S. economies are growing. The job market is healthy and wages arising and interest rates are likely to continue increasing at a moderate pace.","While there are global risks, these conditions if sustained may enable us to deliver total bank adjusted EPS growth for 2018 inside a 7% to 10% medium-term target range. Our vision to be the better bank positions us uniquely well to thrive in a world of disruption and innovation. Over the years, we continually reinvented ourselves to serve our customers better and with the investments we're making today we are not just keeping pace with the changing world but helping define the shape of the one to come.","Initiatives like our agreement with Kasisto, a leading provider of conversational artificial intelligence to integrate their high banking platform in our top-ranked mobile app allowing authenticated customers to gain more insight into their spending through an interactive AI-Powered Chat Interface.","In our cybersecurity office in Tel Aviv, another first for a Canadian Bank. The access it gives us to one of the world's leading cyber and technology ecosystems will strengthen our ability to attract top talent in this critical area.","As I look around, I see the tremendous progress we've made and I'm excited about what lies ahead. I've always said that we succeed at TD because we have the best people. This year we were named in Media Forbes 2018 Canada's top 100 employers list for the 12th time, as well as DiversityInc.'s top 50 companies in the U.S. for the fifth consecutive year. I'm very proud of what we accomplish this year and I can't wait to see what we will achieve together in 2018 and beyond.","With that, I will turn things over to Riaz.","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you, Bharat and good afternoon. Please turn to Slide 4.","In 2017, the Bank reported earnings of $10.5 billion and EPS of $5.50 both up 18%. Adjusted earnings were $10.6 billion and adjusted EPS was $5.54 both up 14%. Revenue increased 5% with growth across all of our business segments and expenses increased 3% resulting in positive operating leverage.","PCL decreased reflecting a favorable credit environment. Canadian Retail and U.S. Retail delivered net income of $6.5 billion and $3.3 billion respectively for the year and wholesale reported over $1 billion in earnings.","Please turn to Slide 5. This quarter the Bank reported earnings of $2.7 billion and EPS of $1.42 both up 18%. Adjusted earnings were $2.6 billion and adjusted EPS was a $1.36 both up 11%. Results reflect growth across both Canadian and U.S. retail businesses.","Revenue increased 6%, net interest income rose 5% reflecting loan and deposit growth in a more favorable interest rate environment. Noninterest income rose 7% primarily due to the dilution gain on the Scottrade transaction reported as an item of note. Excluding this gain, adjusted noninterest income rose 2%.","Expenses were down sequentially and year-over-year reflecting productivity savings, some tax adjustments in current quarter and the impact of the sale of the direct investing business in Europe partially offset by higher employee related expenses and higher investment in technology initiatives.","Provision for credit losses increased 15% quarter-over-quarter primarily reflecting seasonal trends in credit cards and auto portfolios in U.S. Retail. Segment reported earnings were $1.7 billion for Canadian Retail, $776 million for U.S. Retail and $231 million for wholesale. The corporate segment reported a gain of $41 million or a loss of $104 million on an adjusted basis.","Please turn to Slide 6. Canadian Retail segment net income was $1.7 billion up 11% reflecting revenue growth and lower PCL partially offset by higher insurance claims. Revenue rose 5% reflecting loan and deposit growth and higher-margins. Total loan growth was 5% year-over-year with increases in both personal and business lending volume. Deposits increased by 8% reflecting growth in core checking and savings accounts and business deposits.","Insurance claims rose 5% reflecting higher current year but we had fewer weather related events and more favorable prior year's claim development. Margin was 2.86% up two basis points this quarter primarily as a result of recent increases in interest rates. While many factors affect margins and they will continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the current economic environment and the possibility of further rate increases is expected to support a positive trend for margins on a full-year basis. PCL continue to reflect a very favorable credit environment and expenses increased 1% year-over-year and we had nearly 400 basis points of operating leverage on a net of claims basis.","Please turn to Slide 7. U.S. Retail net income was US$621 million up 16%. U.S. Retail bank earnings rose 16% in U.S. dollars or 18% adjusting for the cost associated with the Scottrade transaction. The strong results was driven by 10% revenue growth reflecting a more favorable interest rate environment and continued growth in loan and deposit volumes.","Average loan in deposit volumes increased by 6% and 7% respectively reflecting growth in personal and business customer segments and an 11% increase in suite deposits from TD Ameritrade primarily driven by the Scottrade transaction.","Margin was 3.18% up four basis points quarter-over-quarter primarily due to higher interest rates and balance sheet mix. We anticipate the operating environment to remain relatively stable in 2018 characterized by good economic growth and rising interest rates which bodes well for continued loan and deposit growth, and improving net interest margin.","The 19% increase in PCL quarter-over-quarter reflects seasonal trends in the credit card and auto portfolios. Expenses increased 7% reflecting higher employee costs and investments in business initiatives partially offset by productivity savings. On an adjusted basis excluding the cost associated with the Scottrade transaction expenses rose 5%, the efficiency ratio was 59.1%, and we had nearly 500 basis points of operating leverage. Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade rose by US$12 million on a year-over-year basis.","Please turn to Slide 8. Net income for wholesale was $231 million reflecting lower revenue partially offset by lower noninterest expenses and lower taxes. Revenue decreased 6% reflecting lower trading-related revenue due to weaker capital markets activity.","Noninterest expenses decreased 3% year-over-year reflecting lower variable compensation partially offset by operating expenses related to the establishment of TD Prime Services in the U.S.","Please turn to Slide 9. Corporate segment posted net income of $41 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $138 million in the same quarter last year. The increase reflects the dilution gain on the Scottrade transaction in the current quarter and a decrease in net corporate expenses partially offset by lower contribution from other items. This lower contribution from other items reflects lower revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities, and a favorable impact from tax items recognized in the same quarter last year.","Please turn to Slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.7% at the end of the fourth quarter down 30 basis points from the third quarter. Strong organic capital generation added 32 basis points to our CET1 ratio this quarter. During the quarter we repurchased close to 8 million common shares at a cost of 13 basis points of capital and closed the acquisition of Scottrade which absorbed another 23 basis points of capital.","The increase in risk weighted assets largely reflects - the effects of the Basel I floor principally an increase in exposures where Basel I has more punitive risk weights than Basel III. Our leverage ratio was 3.9% and our liquidity coverage ratio was 120%.","Please turn to Slide 11. This quarter we are providing an initial view of the impact of IFRS 9 for financial instruments which is being implemented effective November 1, 2017. As of October 31, 2017 the current estimate subject to refinement is an overall reduction to shareholders equity of approximately $36 million of which $96 million is attributable to the adoption of the expected credit loss methodology partially offset by $60 million due to classification and measurement changes primarily reflecting securities required to be measured at fair value. Based on the current regulatory requirements, the expected impact to CET1 capital is a decrease of 15 basis points which is almost exclusively due to the Basel I regulatory floor.","I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you, Riaz and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide 12.","The strong credit quality we experienced throughout the year continued into the fourth quarter. Gross impaired loans formations remained stable at 1.2 billion on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. U.S. Retail formations increased 68 million quarter-over-quarter largely due to seasonal trends in the credit card and other portfolios and one new impaired borrower in the commercial portfolio. There were no new formations in the wholesale portfolio.","Turning to Slide 13. Gross impaired loans ended the year at 3.1 billion stable at 49 basis points quarter-over-quarter and down nine basis points year-over-year. The 100 million increase in gross impaired loans in the quarter is primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange.","Moving on to Slide 14. As indicated in previous quarters, U.S. strategic card PCLs are reported on a net basis for segment reporting including only the banks contractual portion of credit losses. For the purpose of the credit slides however, we continue to report gross and losses to better reflect portfolio credit quality.","Quarter-over-quarter provisions for credit losses are up 90 million with six basis points to 39 basis points. Canadian retail PCL of $243 million or 25 basis points continued the solid performance we've seen throughout the year representing cyclically low loss levels. U.S. Retail PCL is up 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 76 basis points or $358 million which is in line with our expectations.","As experienced in previous years, PCL typically rises in the fourth quarter and first quarter due to seasonal trends in the credit card and other portfolios driven by the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons. Volumes and delinquencies historically decreased in Q2 and Q3 as customers received tax refunds.","For 2017 the full-year loss rate of 37 basis points represents a four basis points decrease from 2016 driven by improved credit quality in the oil and gas sector. To conclude, credit quality remains strong across the Bank's portfolios and we remain well-positioned for continuing growth into 2018.","With that, operator, we are now ready to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Meny Grauman with Cormark Securities.","Meny Grauman","Question about the PCL ratio, 37 basis points in 2017, I\u2019m wondering what do you expect the impact of IFRS 9 to be on that ratio sort of isolated? And then, if you could just talk more broadly about PCL ratio next year?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. So based upon our current view of the economic forecast, we don't expect IFRS 9 to have a major impact on creating reserves over the next year itself. And if I look at kind of give you a range of where we - last year it was 37 basis points, we\u2019re looking for continues strong economic conditions would put something for the enterprise around the 40 basis point range plus or minus, maybe two or three basis points, which in my view based upon the overall product mix of our balance sheet represents very continued strong performance, but it would be dependent upon the economic conditions remaining favorable.","Meny Grauman","And then, if I could just a question about, insurance earnings down in the quarter on a year-over-year basis about 20%. I\u2019m wondering if you could provide a little bit more color into what drove them?","Teri Currie","It's Teri. So if you look at the full-year, I think we feel very good about the overall performance to the insurance business for the year. There was an item in the fourth quarter that we disclosed around current year accident benefit and that provision was increased.","What we\u2019re seeing is the cost to repair vehicles as they become more technologically enabled. It takes longer, it\u2019s more complicated and it cost more. That\u2019s an industry phenomenon and over time that gets dealt with in the price, the premiums, that was partially offset by fewer weather-related claims quarter-over-quarter, as well as a higher release to prior year developments quarter-over-quarter - sorry, year-over-year for the quarter.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Sumit Malhotra with Scotia Capital.","Sumit Malhotra","I just want to start with Bob in terms of the trading revenue performance in the quarter. We\u2019ve seen different trends across the group has been weaker for most - for all members in the group, but certainly in different forms of magnitude. I wanted to ask specifically about your result in the quarter end? And what some of the key factors were and more importantly what you think the trend is as we start 2018?","Bob Dorrance","As you noted it is quite volatile with respect to comparisons and even within the groupings quarter-over-quarter in our results, the different categories can vary. We had on the FICM side, the real issues were that both the fixed income markets as well as the corporate credit markets were remarkably strong with very little volatility and as a result of that we saw very much reduced secondary activity in terms of trading, as well as very little trend established in the marketplace.","The markets remained relatively open with respect to origination revenues but on the trading side in both corporate credit and interest rates was very slow. And similarly on the equity side with the reduction in synthetic equity you can see that trend obviously is in place. And then that area is very much dependent on client activity and we experienced the quarter where we had the limited client activity.","Going forward I think you really need to see I think all people in my area would say that - what the welcome would be some form of either volatility or some form of repricing some assets that would get people more engaged and the trading of them. So offsetting that I think we continue to see good origination activity markets are very receptive to new issues in fixed-income and corporate credit comes up price that's it.","Sumit Malhotra","So trading is specifically Bob where last day of November fair to say it hasn't felt that different so far in Q1 relative to what we saw in Q4?","Bob Dorrance","Yes, I see it on a trading side of the business - markets are fairly good but they\u2019re not that active on the institutional front.","Sumit Malhotra","Last one from me is for Mark just thinking about the provision in the U.S. and specifically I'm looking at Page 34 of your supplement. When we look at the U.S. provision quarter-over-quarter, I'm looking at the line that the incurred but not identified and you went from a recovery of 7 million last quarter to 48 million in Q4. Is it fair to say that the bulk of that is the - what we would call the collective change in the credit card book and specifically that seasonality that you talked about is this driven more from a reserving perspective because of expectations or are there trends in the business that you see worsening that causes you to increase that particular life?","Mark Chauvin","No, it is really resulting from the seasonal trend which really is primarily in the credit cards with the retailers. And so what you have is a combination as you go into this quarter and the fourth quarter and next you have increasing volumes plus kind of more demands on individuals so you see a slight deterioration in quality and both of those factors will drive increased reserves.","But what we've seen every year over the past four or five years in the second quarter is that the volumes come down as the car balances get paid off and people start to manage bring things a little more current. So it\u2019s not - I wouldn't say it's a trend that we're concerned about it's one that we\u2019re very familiar with, it's extremely repeatable and it's consistent. It\u2019s exactly what we expected actually.","Sumit Malhotra","So I\u2019ll end it here. If I look at your 2017 provisioning, Q1 you're 42 basis points, Q4 you're 37 and to your point you are in the low 30s in the two middle quarters. As a result of that U.S. seasonality and based on your economic outlook you think that seasonal pattern is a reasonable way to think about things for 2018?","Mark Chauvin","For the U.S.?","Sumit Malhotra","For the U.S.","Mark Chauvin","You're absolutely correct, and for the U.S. yes.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Nick Stogdill with Credit Suisse.","Nick Stogdill","Another credit card question, just looking at the fee line area was down sequentially and year-over-year I believe there might be an adjustment going through this quarter if you could just give us some more color on the size and what caused it and will that have an ongoing impact on the run rate credit card fee growth?","Teri Currie","It\u2019s Terri again. So we have every year a look at the long-term redemption rate for our TD proprietary cards that picked up a little bit and this was a liability adjustment for that reason. It's a good news story in fact because the reason that that ticked up was that with the launch of our new credit cards in particular cash back everyday rewards including and then including in that first class travel and MBNA.","We have really good client engagement with those cards that rewards site and the program and so that plays out well in sort of earnings through the year. But it caused a little bit of an adjustment in that liability for the quarter it\u2019s an unusual item.","Nick Stogdill","And how much ballpark did it contribute to the year-over-year decline or sequential decline and then would the redemption rate be higher going forward so we should expect maybe lower growth a little bit in the fee line?","Teri Currie","I\u2019m quite comfortable with the prospect of growth going forward for the card\u2019s business and the fees. We had basically retail sales in our full credit card business up 8% year-over-year. So good engagement, good quality business being done a very competitive lineup. This is really something that we take a look at annually and it may or may not change going forward it\u2019s a marginal change, it was a material to our overall result.","Riaz Ahmed","Nick, it's Riaz. If I can just add overall obviously what Teri suggested also means that our customers are very happy with the card. So in the end I think it turns out to be good news, but if you look at - if you\u2019re referring to the card services line on Page 11 of the sup pack on all those noninterest income lines I think you also have to be mindful of the fact that a number of those revenue items are in U.S. dollars. And so we also had a lower - a stronger Canadian dollar so FX translation would affect the number of those if you're looking at them from a trend line perspective.","Nick Stogdill","And then just one clarification on the insurance earnings or the review is that an annual type review or is there something more specific or a trend that you saw that caused you to review the accident benefit provisioning?","Teri Currie","It\u2019s Teri again. It would be an ongoing review. It was simply recognition of the fact that we have seen this change as the industry in the cost of vehicle repairs. And again we should see that play out in pricing over time.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Theriault with Eight Capital.","Steve Theriault","Just to complete the circle maybe on cards, Teri can you talk a little bit about your outlook for card growth next year. You addressed the service fees, I think but card growth in the quarter I think was 1% so maybe you can put that in context of the work you're doing on the cash back cards and what you're seeing in terms of spend on the year ago card?","Teri Currie","So just overall we feel great. We continue to maintain a strong market share position number one in cards as you know. We talked about in the past we\u2019ve made investments this year to continuously improve our lineup including as you mentioned the cash back cards and the everyday reward cards. Customers are taking up the cash back card in particular above our own expectations which is good news and again strong retail sales up 8% year-over-year.","We have made and I mentioned this in the past some, let me call it volume rate trade-offs in terms of our MBNA business doing fewer low yielding promotional loans that's actually - we\u2019re giving up some volume, but it's improving the profitability we doubled the probability of that business this year.","So overall we feel great I think we've got TD credit card to meet any Canadians needs including a great travel line up including first class travel. And I have no reason to expect retail sales to do anything but continue to perform well.","Steve Theriault","And then for Greg on U.S. and direct auto, I see that picked up in the quarter maybe some of that seasonal, but I think that is some of the best growth we\u2019ve seen in some time after a pause over the last year. So maybe just any comments on is there a change in tax, is there any update on pricing maybe getting a little bit better in auto or worse for that matter. What\u2019s the outlook for that business looking into next year?","Greg Braca","Yes, so thanks for the question Steve, a couple of comments as you rightly called out for the better part of four or five quarters now, we've called out that - we\u2019d likely start to see moderating order growth given the size of the portfolio, the coverage of our portfolio and as we've been watching the overall industry as a whole wanted to make sure we remained in a good position there.","Additionally as we've also been talking about for a few quarters we've moderated the mix a little less high prime more into the prime space and we bled in a little near prime business to build some margin into the portfolio. I think particularly to your question if you think about Q4, auto sales in general both new and used after the hurricane season were quite strong in some of our southern markets including Texas, Florida and the Carolinas. And some of that uptick was the natural result of that, but again at 6% year-over-year it's sort of where we've been signaling our growth for the last few quarters, mid single digits sort of growth year-over-year.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Mario Mendonca with TD Securities.","Mario Mendonca","First Mark Chauvin, if you could help me think through this PCL seasonality just one more time. Last year, going from Q4 2016 to Q1 2017, the lift in PCLs was big, and I\u2019m talking across the entire bank here. There may have been something going on in Canada that I don't recall, but that sort of nearly $100 million lift from one quarter to the next, is that conceivable going into Q1 2018?","Mark Chauvin","So Mario, I guess, - I don't have my memory what it was for the U.S. but the - I would expect a further lift in the U.S. in Q1, really to capture kind of the Christmas buying season and the increase in the volumes and the card portfolios resulting primarily from that area, which would come back in the - which would come down in Q2. And that's what we've witnessed in the past in the U.S. and that's what my forecasts are showing me this year again.","Mario Mendonca","So that $100 million lift from one quarter to the next at this point, that's not something you could speak to just now.","Mark Chauvin","I\u2019d like to analyze the hundred better to save it to. I would focus it on the U.S. part. I mean, last year there were oil and gas issues, and there were things that - there's been a few other changes here, but if I just focused on the U.S. I think it would be very appropriate comment.","Mario Mendonca","Riaz, something question for you. The sensitivity to interest rates has become an increasingly important input into the way I look at banks and the questions I get from investors and I know you've been - the bank hasn't been open to updating the guidance from May 2013, but one of your largest peers did recently, is there anything that you can offer us to augment our understanding within rate sensitivity, perhaps just ranges or an update on the 2013 guidance?","Riaz Ahmed","Mario, as we've said before looking at the full picture of upside rising rate have complex and includes a number of factors, which could include business product mix, balance sheet mix changes in the shape of a yield curve, hedging cost accretions, affects, betas etcetera. But I do understand that there is a real interest from investors and analysts to better understand our NII upside to future interest rates.","So if I were to give you a very simplified view which is, that if we took our balance sheet as of October 31, and assumed an instantaneous 25 basis points rate increase - short rate increase, then the NII upside is about $150 million, subject to all those assumptions that I talked about earlier, and if we split about $100 million in Canadian retail and $50 million in U.S. retail.","Bharat Masrani","Riaz, this is just at the short end, it\u2019s not the overall\u2026","Riaz Ahmed","Rate hike, it - taking away all those other assumptions that everything else being equal.","Mario Mendonca","So over a full year that's what we\u2019ll see.","Riaz Ahmed","Correct.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Gabriel Dechaine with National Bank Financial.","Gabriel Dechaine","I wanted to ask you about the Basel I floor impact, that $33.5 billion I've heard of you raised tied to that item. That's the kind of a number I usually associate with a large acquisition, but I'm not getting the accretion or anything like that. So I recall last quarter, Riaz, you talked about some strategies or actions that you're looking at to alleviate some of this RWA pressure? Or is it more realistic that we see OSFI get more lenient, I guess? Some of the other banks have hinted at that.","Riaz Ahmed","Well I think the - as others have correctly called out the industry has made representations to OSFI. So we look at the impact of the Basel 1 floor, because it does give incorrect incentives to the banks. And the methodology that Basel 1 used as you will recall was very different from the Basel III methodology, so we\u2019re really applying a very old formula to look at how the floor is calculated.","So we are in consultation with OSFI on the matter. Now there are some capital markets tools that are available to manage the Basal I floor but I think up until we get a resolution of our industry dialogue with the regulators I think I'd just rather wait it out.","Gabriel Dechaine","I understand that. And I know - and you can't, I guess, bank on release coming. So let's say in a steady-state, how should we think of that number changing over time in relation to where you're currently growing the business? What are - where are the primary source of risk-weighted asset inflation coming from? Is it mortgages? But - it seems kinds obvious, but these are complicated.","Riaz Ahmed","Well, I think that Canadian industry\u2019s shape, overall shape is that the assets in Canada tend to be lower risk weighted for all the reasons that you are already familiar with. So if you look at the run rate of how the Basel floor has been built up which is disclosed in our sub-pack, then I think you can use that as a reasonable going forward run rate. But I think for us in particular having said that we are a low risk bank, it would be reasonable to expect that we would be first to trip the Basel I floor and then that it would built up.","And to your point, it has - therefore accumulated to $33.5 billion by October 2017, I think it would anecdotally look at our IFRS 9 results and also say, yes, that is a reflective of - that is reflective of the - of a lower risk portfolio approach that we use. But I am quite hopeful that this will be resolved but hard to call the timing on it.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. And if I could throw one in there for Teri. I've asked the other banks, so I might as well ask you. The B20, any - are you seeing some demanding for pull-forward? It doesn't seem to be -- well, you are getting growth in uninsured mortgages, so maybe that is the case. And then into 2018, how much do you originate now, like new originations? And the downside to that from B20, what would that be?","Teri Currie","So, on the first point, it\u2019s hard to tell whether we\u2019re seeing pull-forward I think anecdotally we think that that is the case given the January 1st timing of the rule. In terms of quantifying the impact to originations, there are a lot of moving parts and I think we feel comfortable that the numbers have been cited by our peers would be something that would be representative of the impact that we might experience as well. As many have stated it\u2019s not a pure mathematical exercise then just assuming people would behave the same way they did in 2017.","There\u2019s lots of ways that borrowers can chose secure including buying less expensive properties, amassing a down payment over a longer period of time, accessing more down payment funds, expanding their amortization. So, I would say on balance we expect our impact to be in line with the industry.","Gabriel Dechaine","Thank you for that. Mark Chauvin, have a good retirement.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Rizvanovic with Macquarie Capital Market.","Mike Rizvanovic","I just want to go back to the B20 for a second. Just wondering, do you build into that guidance - what seems to be relatively modest in terms of the impact in originations, do you build into the fact that we're looking at mortgage rates being about 60, 70 basis points higher? And maybe more importantly, are you including perhaps another two rate hikes by the Bank of Canada, which is I think where the market - what the market currently expects for 2018? And if you don't, will your guidance change? And would it be more meaningful?","Teri Currie","I think the way that I think about it would be what we\u2019ve said and what continue to say looking forward is our proprietary total level growth should look like mid single digits and we would continue to expect that even with what we've just said about B20. We think headwinds would come at that if B20 was above those ranges we just talked about or if there were further interest rate rises that could potentially mute lending activity.","Mike Rizvanovic","And then just quickly - so if the impact is as modest as some of your peers and yourselves seem to be indicating, do you think that maybe heightens the risk that the regulator maybe looks to do more to cool down the market? I just can't imagine if originations are not really coming off, then that means that credit growth is probably running at roughly the same pace. Do you see that as an additional risk?","Teri Currie","I think it\u2019s hard to predict what might happen. What I think is happening now as people are looking at what are the impacts of the cumulative changes that have occurred and how did they play out and I think then decisions might be taken based on how that all works out in the end.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Doug Young with Desjardins Capital Markets.","Doug Young","Just probably two quick questions. On the seasonality, Mark I understand the seasonality and the credit card book, just can you remind me the seasonality on autos, or is this more a function of just you are going down to near prime from prime and super prime, is that the seasonality, if you can kind of just flush that out?","Mark Chauvin","There is a small element of seasonality on autos which is really driven by just more competing needs for funds during this period and you see a slight deterioration in credit quality, which we have - which we see come back in subsequent quarters, so we identify that as being seasonal, but it is the minority. The majority of really what we see is in the credit cards with the retailers.","Doug Young","And then, I guess Riaz, operating leverage was delivered obviously in the quarter, the next ratio has come down quite nicely in the back half of this year, and as you look out to next year, can we think of similar levels of improvements? Can you talk a little bit about what would drive further benefits, or is this just abnormally good? Just want some color on that. Thank you.","Riaz Ahmed","Doug, as I\u2019ve said before, I really look to operating leverage on a business by business basis because each business has its own unique characteristics and attributes and in evaluating the performance of the business as we look to the maturity of that business in the marketplace, the level of investments that may be required, revenue growth that is achieved etcetera.","So, the aggregation of all of that that obviously is a great tailwind if everyone's doing particularly well which we did in 2017 but therefore it's hard to kind of call it on an annual basis across at the all-bank level because some businesses which may be high operating leverage, that said, high efficiency ratio businesses but low capital businesses maybe just as attractive to grow which could get the all-bank operating leverage number not to look so attractive. So I think of it more at a business by business level and let the aggregate add up to whatever it may.","Doug Young","So I mean others have provided, may not be not - well some have provided operating leverage target, some have provided efficiency ratio targets, any thoughts of doing something similar just to give us direction around expenses?","Bharat Masrani","I think overall, I would say, I would hesitate to give you a bank level outlook only because you know that our strategy is to grow revenue and to make the investments that we need to make to transform the business and get productivity savings out. So the combination of those could result in operating leverage being very strong in some years as it has been this year and may be less strong in other years as you've seen in prior years. So it's hard to call it out, but overall when you got an economy like this and we\u2019re calling out 7% to 10% growth rate, you can assume that operating leverage will continue to be good.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sohrab Movahedi with BMO Capital Markets.","Sohrab Movahedi","Maybe both for Riaz and Mr. Masrani. I mean, this 7% to 10%, maybe the Basel floor becoming more of a tailwind as opposed to a headwind, remind us of the capital priorities please. And you had done the buybacks this year. To the extent the opportunities present themselves, do you think this is a good time to also do buybacks? Or are you valuation-sensitive?","Bharat Masrani","Sohrab, this is Bharat. You've heard me say this before. I think we've been consistent on this, but as we deploy capital, the capital deployment framework, it's fairly straightforward. We want to make sure that we are supporting all of our growth strategies, and wherever capital is required, we will allocate it.","Secondly, we have also said that if there are any capability gaps in the bank, then we will certainly go out and buy those capabilities, if that is what is appropriate for us. There has also been some discussion on would some kind of acquisitions make sense, and we said, yes, some of them may.","For example, in the southeast of the U.S., and that continues to be the case. On the card side, we've talked about it previously. This is a very good business. We like it. We like the model that we apply to it, the way the risk is shared and the revenues. And we find the risk-adjusted returns to be very attractive. And as we're building out our U.S. card business, it does provide us with the scale that otherwise we would not have.","And so we go through a framework in that regard. And then there's also this issue of uncertainty around regulations and all that. Although we've grown through a good phase here with the level of uncertainty has reduced, but it has not been eliminated.","So we go through that thinking - and after all that, if we think that we still have the flexibility, then, of course, we would seriously consider buybacks as well. So that's the way we deploy our capital. And as you saw, we did two buybacks, and that's the way we got there. So time will tell based on how that works out, and we'll see whether these other requirements are there or not before we consider any buybacks.","Sohrab Movahedi","Just Bharat just to quickly follow up on that, I mean if you find yourself in the mid-11% range for how long could that capital level stay at those levels before you would trigger the buyback?","Bharat Masrani","The level of precision on this Sohrab is difficult because there are lot of moving parts you\u2019ve seen in our own case in the last one year I mean could we have or last little while predicted with the Scottrade transaction as to how that came about or the floor that you just talked about as to how it applies particularly to the TD and Riaz gave you a good understanding to some of the other questions as to why it appeared to have impacted TD sooner and probably more because the way our balance sheet works.","So there are lots of moving parts here. I wouldn\u2019t want you to start modeling a particular month or a particular week after we hit the magical number that you might think is good. So we\u2019ll see when we get there, we will obviously make a very deep assessment as to what makes sense for the bank.","Operator","And we'll go next to Darko Mihelic with RBC Capital Markets.","Darko Mihelic","Riaz, sorry to go here but you opened the can of worms on the NII and the impact on rates and I want to approach this question a little bit differently because we\u2019re not to going to be able\u2026","Riaz Ahmed","I said that's not what you said last quarter, okay go ahead.","Darko Mihelic","So I know we\u2019re not going to be able to solve for precisely everything that happens on the NII front but I guess I\u2019ll phrase the question this way. This past year we've seen some rate increases and we did see some margin improvement in the U.S. and in Canada, but the all-bank margin was actually down year-over-year. And as far as I can tell when I look through your data, it looks as though the culprit was interest-bearing liabilities in Canada and the U.S. in the business and government side had a fairly large increase there in those funding costs.","And so when I step back and just think about your commentary on 25 basis point rate hike, can you speak to whether or not what happened this year was sort of one-offish and perhaps we should not expect some sort of a repeat in 2018 and therefore as I think of 150 million of NII for 25 basis point rate hike, could I think of that is largely being positive the all-bank level. Any thought - is there any way you can help me with that.","Riaz Ahmed","There are two things I could suggest to you Darko, is first when you look at the all-bank margin and therefore consider the entire balance sheet it introduces a whole host of other business items that we don't generally focus on when we look at Canadian Retail and U.S. Retail.","So for example if you look at the size of the investment securities that we carry on our balance sheet, some of those are needed to meet liquidity requirements. And some of them are driven by our deposit which U.S. franchise where we have a low loan to deposit ratio.","And so that those items - and then you also look at the short-term balance sheet of the dealer and businesses such as repos and whatnot where they\u2019re funding approaches there that are taken into account in the all-bank NII and whose effect may overwhelm at 25 basis points rate hike because they're such a big part of our aggregate balance sheet but yet are very low risk activities, holding HQLA securities and holding exit deposits in the U.S. and conducting repo businesses et cetera are low risk businesses but they're not NII driven businesses necessarily, they are therefore other reason. So I don\u2019t think you can necessarily correlate that - what that impact could be should translate necessarily into an all-bank margin number because of these other factors.","Now you asked about anything that is one-offish that might not repeat in 2018, well if we got similar interest rate hikes in 2018 as we did in 2017 one delta will be betas - you would expect through the cycle betas to continue rising towards the efficiency of the rate hikes to your NII development we would expect that to reduce over time.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Bharat Masrani for closing remarks.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Operator, and just to conclude, great numbers from the Bank, terrific performance once again and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our nearly 85,000 TD colleagues around the world who continue to deliver for our shareholders.","And I know one of you in the call mentioned this, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity as well to thank Mark Chauvin. This is Mark's last analyst quarterly investor call before he looks forward to great retirement. Mark has given 35 plus years to TD and we are very thankful for those years Mark we wish you very well in your retirement.","And finally in case folks on the phone, if we don\u2019t get together happy holidays to you and your families, and we will see you in the New Year. Thanks very much.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

My name is Rudy Sankovic and I am the Head of Investor Relations of the bank.","We will begin today's presentation with remarks from Ed Clark, the bank's CEO, after which Colleen Johnston, the bank's CFO, will present our third quarter operating results. Mark Chauvin, Chief Risk Officer, will offer comments on credit quality, after which we will entertain questions from those present in the room and from prequalified analysts and investors on the phone.","Also present today to answer your questions are Tim Hockey, Group Head, Canadian Banking, Auto Finance and Credit Cards, Bharat Masrani, Group Head, US P&C Banking, and Mike Pedersen, Group Head, Wealth, Insurance, and Corporate Shared Services. Bob Dorrance, Group Head, Wholesale Banking, is joining us by phone today.","Given that this has been a busy reporting day for the analyst and investor community, we would like to ensure that this call be limited to an hour. So we please appreciate your cooperation.","At this time, I would like to caution our listeners that this presentation contains forward-looking statements and there are risks that actual results could differ materially from what is discussed. Any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation represent the views of management and are presented for the purpose of assisting the bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the bank's financial position, objectives, and priorities and anticipated financial performance, and may not be appropriate for any other purposes.

For additional information on these factors and assumptions, please see our Q3 2012 MD&A and 2011 Annual Report contained on Td.com.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Ed.","Ed Clark","Thanks, Rudy, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Colleen is going to be up shortly to discuss in detail our third quarter results, but let me start by sharing my thoughts on the quarter and telling you about how we feel about the rest of the year.","This was a record quarter for TD, with adjusted EPS growth of 9 percent versus the third quarter last year. Our retail business generated record adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, also up 9 percent from a year earlier and our wholesale bank delivered solid results in a very difficult market.","Among the highlights of the quarter was a renewed recognition of our best in class customer service. TD Canada Trust won J.D. Power for the highest customer satisfaction levels among the Big 5 banks for the seventh year in a row. We are the only bank in Canada to have the won the J.D. Power award. An amazing accomplishment and for the eighth consecutive year, TD Canada Trust in named the best of the Big 5 banks for customer service excellence by Ipsos from formerly known as Synovate.","Now, these awards speak to the high standards of service we deliver across the breadth of our platform from branch banking to phone to online banking and other direct channels. In addition, our investment advice business performed extremely well in the latest J.D. Power and Associates customer survey.","I am as proud of this recognition as I am of our strong financial results. It is a testament to our employees' enduring commitment to TD service and convenience model. Along with this positive news, we are very pleased to declare our $0.05 dividend increase today as well as an increase in our target payout ratio to 40% to 50% of adjusted earnings.","Latter brings us into line with our Canadian peers. We have maintained a cautious stance on this front through a period of unprecedented economic upheaval. We have heard though from investors loud and clear the growing importance of dividend income in today's low interest rate environment.","When our board considered this, together with our strong balance sheet, our stable earnings base, our superior ability to generate capital and the fact that the transition to Basel III is almost complete, they determined that the timing was right to make this change in our payout ratio.","Today's dividend increase is our second this year, which is consistent with the pattern of increases declared by the board since 2003, except for a brief pause during the financial crisis. Earnings growth permitting, the board has indicated that they would like to continue increasing our dividend twice a year as we progress towards a mid-point of our new higher payout range. This can reasonably be expected to result in dividend growth outpacing adjusted EPS growth.","Collectively, these decisions single the board's confidence in the resilience of our retail focused franchise banking model and our ability to continue to deliver sustainable long term earnings growth despite a challenging operating environment. So let me talk a little bit about that environment and what it means for our outlook.","Together with our strong numbers in the first and second quarter, today's record results add up to an impressive performance for the first three quarters of fiscal 2012 with adjusted earnings of $5.3 billion, up 11% over last year and adjusted EPS of $5.59, up 10%. We expect our fourth quarter results to come in at a level that will allow us to get into the lower end of the 7% to 10% adjusted EPS growth range for 2012 as a whole.","While we are pleased we are on track to meet our EPS objective this year, as we look ahead to 2013, we know we have our work cut out for us because the headwinds we have identified continue to gather steam. Persistence for generating in the global economy likely means a more prolonged period of low interest rates putting further down more pressure on our margins.","Revenue growth in Canada is slowing as households limit new borrowing and the latest round of tightening in the mortgage and insurance rules taking affect. In the United States, the regulatory environment remains a source of present day challenges and future uncertainty.","So when we said in 2012, that we would have to work hard to get into the 7% and 10% range, and we did, we would say today it feels like we are going to work even harder in 2013 given the headwinds and the higher starting point implied by this year's results. Still, we are confident that have made the right investments in organic growth and the new strategic initiatives to achieve that target over the medium term.","Expense management will play an important role in meeting this objective. We have been focused on making the investments necessary to have positive operating leverage. Recognizing it will be more difficult to achieve in an environment of slowing revenue growth. What we won't do, is engage in fire drills or other kinds of short term thinking. Instead, we will look for ways to generate permanent sustainable savings by changing the structure of our cost base and making productivity a competitive advantage for TD.","To wrap up, it was a great quarter. I am pleased with our results today. I am proud of the management team's impressive performance and I am absolutely confident in their ability to strike the right balance between reducing our cost base and continuing to invest for the future. We have been resilient so far by doing what we have been for the last decade. Staying focused, executing our business strategy, investing for the long term, and exploiting the growth opportunities for which we are very well positioned.","With that, let me turn it over to Colleen. Thank you.","Colleen Johnston","Thanks, Ed and good afternoon, everyone. Let me take you through the results.","Please turn to slide four. We are very pleased with our results this quarter, with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.91, up 9% year-over-year and total bank adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, up 11% from last year, driven by retail adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, up 9% from last year, solid wholesale results with net income of $180 million and a gain of $30 million in the corporate segment.","Please turn to slide five. This next slide shows you the reported and adjusted view of earnings this quarter. The difference between the two views was due to seven items of note. Let me mention two of these items. We had a positive impact of $18 million from the change in Ontario statutory income tax rate as well as an increase of $77 million to the previously disclosed litigation reserve.","Please turn to slide six. Canadian P&C had a record quarter with adjusted net income of $889 million, up 12% versus last year. Adjusted operating leverage was 2% this quarter with record adjusted revenues up 13% compared to last year and adjusted non-interest expenses up 11%. This year's acquisition of MBNA added 10% to adjusted revenues, 8% to adjusted expenses, 23 basis points to NIM and $96 million to PCL.","Better credit performance on MBNA acquired loans added to net interest income adding about $25 million pretax this quarter. Excluding MBNA revenues increased 3% while expenses were up 3% due to volume growth, investments in branches and other business initiatives. The strong performance this quarter was attributable to good loan and deposit growth year-over-year.","Retail lending volume growth was good but slowing, with real estate secured lending up 6% and auto lending up 5%. Business lending growth remained strong up 14% while overall deposit growth was also strong at 9%.","We also experienced better credit performance this quarter as PCL and personal banking excluding MBNA was lower than last year and overall credit quality remains strong. Excluding the impact of MBNA, margin was down 14 basis points compared to last year due to the low rate environment, portfolio mix, and competitive pricing.","Margin excluding MBNA was down 2 basis points sequentially. We expect the low rate environment will contribute to margin declines in Q4 as well as in 2013.","Please turn to slide seven. Wealth and Insurance, excluding the impact of TD Ameritrade delivered solid results in a challenging economic environment. Net income of $304 million was up 1% from last year. Wealth earnings were up 5% year-over-year. Transaction revenues declined due to decreased trading volumes and direct investing.","This was largely offset by increases in fee-based revenue in advice-based and asset management businesses and net interest income driven by higher margin. We are pleased with good net client asset growth despite lower markets.","Insurance earnings were down 3% year-over-year. Premium growth and the inclusion of MBNA more than offset by adjustments to reserves for claims liabilities and higher weather-related catastrophe claims. On a year-to-date basis, insurance earnings rose 18%. Please note that higher than expected weather-related events have continued during the month of August.","Expenses across the segment were down 1% versus last year, largely due to lower trading volumes and lower technology cost in wealth. The contribution from TD Ameritrade was higher this quarter as increased economic ownership and a weaker Canadian Dollar raised the contribution to segment results versus last year.","Please turn to slide eight. U.S. Personal and Commercial bank delivered solid adjusted net income of U.S. 355 million for the quarter, up 3% from last year. The increase was primarily due to strong core growth and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of the Durbin Amendment and run-off in legacy Chrysler Financial revenues, which was expected.","Average loans were up 14%, year-over-year, including a 36% increase in residential mortgages and a 9% increase in business loans, while average deposits, excluding government deposits and TD Ameritrade IDAs were up 9%.","NIM was down 11 basis points versus last year, mainly due to the low rate environment. Total PCL was down by 4% from last year, as the underlying credit quality of the U.S. loan portfolio continues to improve.","Adjusted expenses increased from last year, primarily due to investments in the core franchise including new stores. TD Bank opened its 1,300 location in the U.S. in early August. We are on track to add 35 new stores this year.","Please turn to slide nine. Wholesale delivered solid results this quarter with net income of $180 million, up 61% from a difficult quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher trading revenues due to improved fixed income and credit trading as compared to the difficult market conditions of Q3 of 2011.","Total trading related revenue in the quarter was strong at $360 million, which was above our normalized expectation of $300 million per quarter, and included gains recognized on trading positions previously considered impaired.","Partially offsetting increased revenue were increased PCL related to a single name and higher non-interest expense due to additional legal provisions and higher variable compensation. Annualized ROE for the quarter was strong at 16.7%.","Please turn to slide 10. On an adjusted basis, the corporate segment posted a gain of $30 million in the quarter. Corporate segment results are subject to some volatility as you have seen and are inherently difficult to predict. Results were down from last year due to lower net corporate expenses and favorable tax items, more than offset by treasury and other hedging activities.","This number was better than expected due largely to lower expenses. Some of this is timing and some of it reflects the early impact of our productivity focus. We continue to target a higher loss for the corporate segment in Q4 at the higher end of the $40 million to $80 million loss range and intend to address the target for 2013 next quarter.","Please turn to slide 11. Expense control remains a major focus across the bank as we position the bank for revenue headwinds of the slow growth economy and the sustained low interest rate environment. Our focus is on initiatives that will permanently improve efficiency and reduce the cost base of the organization, and ultimately make productivity a competitive advantage for TD.","At the all-bank level, we expect the pattern of increased Q4 expenses versus Q3 to continue, but at a lower rate than last year. We expect a quarter-over-quarter increase in adjusted expenses of approximately $250 million. Roughly 40% of the expected increase will be due to business volume and seasonality, about 20% will be marketing campaigns, with the remainder reflecting higher project and initiative spend.","Excluding expenses added by recent acquisitions and FX, we expect adjusted expenses to grow by under 3% this year, which was achieved while making investments in future growth, including 60 new branches in North America, 25 in Canada and 35 in the United States. We are targeting a lower expense growth rate on the same basis for next year.","Please turn to slide 12. Looking at capital, our Q3 Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.2% and our pro forma Basel III ratio was 7.7%. Our guidance remains unchanged on Basel III.","Please turn to slide 13. The board of directors has approved a $0.05 per share increase in the dividend, the second increase in 2012 and a higher payout range, now 40% to 50%. Including this announcement per share dividends will increase 11% this fiscal year.","And with that I will turn the presentation over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you, Colleen, and good afternoon, everyone.","Please turn to slide 14. As a reminder, the debt securities classified as loans and the acquired credit impaired loan portfolios have been excluded from the credit slides. Canadian credit quality remained strong across the portfolio with the credit quality indicators for the U.S. portfolio continuing to improve.","I would, however, like to comment briefly on the increase in gross impaired loans in the U.S. HELOC portfolio. In line with recent regulatory guidance a portion of our second lien HELOCs have been changed from performing to nonperforming status. The change was made to reflect cases where a borrower is current on this TD HELOC, but delinquent on any property loan held by another lender.","The net impact of the change resulted in a $74 million increase in gross impaired loans. As these loans are already factored into our reserves, the reclassification does not impact PCL. Lastly, I can confirm that there has been no change in the performance of our acquired portfolios and the debt securities classified as loans this quarter.","Now I will turn the presentation back to Rudy.","Question-and-Answer Session","Rudy Sankovic","Great. Thanks, Mark. We will now open it up for questions, and to give everyone a chance to participate, please keep to one question and then re-queue. For those participating in person in the room here, can I ask you to identify your name and firm before asking your question and before ending the call today I will ask Ed to offer some final remarks.","So why don\u2019t we get started in the room here and do we have any questions. Michael?","Michael Goldberg - Desjardins Securities","I always get cut off with one question. So I am going to give you a two-parter. Michael Goldberg, Desjardins Securities. To what extent does a make versus buy decision shake the U.S. Bank acquisition decisions? I guess there's a couple of situation recently where that question might be addressed.","Secondly, with your litigation experience and the recent Samsung decision in the U.S., how do you feel about litigation risk going forward?","Ed Clark","We are always happy, to give you, Michael, two shots here. So I would say the make versus buy, we haven't really moved up the paradigm. I think after we got the Commerce deal and then supplemented by the South deal and the FDIC deals, we believe we got our U.S. platform to a strategically viable size and that we weren't endangered.","As you know, my view has always been to go in the United States, you definitely have to get to a certain size in order to say competitive, and having got that with the platform, and the second component of that is also to run the bank like a North American bank rather than a Canadian bank that happens to own a U.S. bank, so that you will see that in our card strategy, you will see that in our auto loan strategy, you will see that in our direct bank strategy where we are really spreading the cost of investment across a retail earnings bases as the largest retail earning base in Canada by a significant margin.","So, I think we don't believe we are strategically challenged for size. Obviously, if we want to continue to grow and deepen the franchise, but we really look at acquisitions and say, what's the cost of growing by buying and what's the cost of growing by building? If buying is not cheaper than building, I think if it were anything we would have a preference to build rather than buy because you know exactly what you are building when you are building whereas when you are buying, you get a lot of other things that you wouldn't have built.","So I think that's how we tend to look at it without pointing any specific, we have active corporate development group that looks at everything. It certainly turns down at least nine things for every one that it does. Probably the number is 95 for every 100 that it looks at. So, they are very, very disciplined. So we obviously decided to pass on the acquisitions that happened.","It\u2019s not like everybody wasn't aware of all these acquisitions. So from our point of view, they just didn't make sense. In terms of the litigation atmosphere in the United States, I think when you go into the United States, you have got a regulatory environment that's different than you would feel in Canada and the litigation environment that's different than you would feel in Canada.","If you are not up to that environment, then you probably should get out of the kitchen. So I think there's an element and which you just have to accept that there is an environment where you may have the better part of the law but you are going to pay a price if you don't, in fact, deal with that.","So you are trying to get the right balance in what cases to try and what cases not to try. So when we look at our situation, we don't find it at this stage an overwhelming burden, but it's obviously an irritation to us to have these kinds of litigation charges.","John Reucassel - BMO Capital Markets","John Reucassel from BMO Capital Markets. Question either for Colleen or maybe Tim and Bharat. I think we are four years now into the very low interest rate environments that central banks have talked about. So, is the NIM pressure greater today than it has been or is it about the same? If it's the same, it seems you are being more cautious on NIMs today than you have been in the past? Could you just explain why the pressure is greater today than has been in the past?","Tim Hockey","So, why don't I start from the Canadian perspective. I am not sure that the NIM pressure is any greater. The competitive environment depends on the product and on the day and the month and the competitor. It goes up and down.","I think what we would be seeing today is even though we have gone through four years of low interest rates, the outlook for when that might turnaround continues to lengthen out. So it\u2019s not that we have lost faith but we are suggesting that it\u2019s probably not right to hope for a higher interest rate environment in the next little while.","So when we see an outlook, it\u2019s pretty clear that, as we said earlier, revenue is going to continue to be at low rates, not just because of margin pressure, but because we are also seeing the asset growth slowdown at the same time so we better plan for that and bring our expenses down accordingly, but it sure feels like NIMs in Canada will continue to drop down by ones and twos per quarter over the foreseeable future.","Ed Clark","I agree completely with that, but I think if you want to get a sense of how we see the world, I think the core way is to look at the five-year either U.S. Treasury rate or five-year Canadian rate. The reality is five year rate today is significantly lower than it was a year ago. So there has been a sea change in the last couple of years, by four years.","The European crisis has clearly changed interest rate environment for negative and if you have a view that the European crisis isn't going away quickly which I would subscribe to that just push across the world a pretty heavy downward pressure on interest rates. So rates have actually fallen significantly in the last 18 months. So I think if you want to watch our mood watch that rate.","Bharat Masrani","So just to add, I know there is a lot of focus on the volatility in the NIM numbers out of the U.S. and to some extent that is to be expected. In this acquired loan accounting, there is always noise in that number. As Ed said and Tim said, on the deposit side obviously you feel this effect of lower rates and we have been saying that that isn\u2019t a real effect.","The good thing is on the asset side, I think it's hanging in there in the U.S. and in our case, as you, know we have been growing our loans faster than deposits. So from a fundamental perspective, I feel good about that and I have also noted for many quarters now that because of the noise and the way we are repositioning our business from a loan perspective you should expect the range to be somewhere 350 and 375.","John, I think we have talked about this in the past. I think that continues to be applicable, but you continue to see noise in the number, but the pressure from a low interest environment on the deposits side is there.","Rudy Sankovic","Operator, over to the phones, please.","Operator","Thank you. You have a question from Gabriel Dechaine with Credit Suisse. Pleas go ahead.","Gabriel Dechaine - Credit Suisse","While we are talking about NIM in the U.S. there, so 15 basis points down quarter-over-quarter, I guess than over half of that's from is related to acquisition accounting, but the other half, If you can kind of break it down into what's coming from the competitive pricing environment, what's coming from the change in your mix and how much of that's coming from your securities portfolio?","Then just on the mortgages in the U.S. as well. You are one of the few banks or maybe few is an exaggeration, but one of the banks that is actually keeping the mortgages on balance sheet rather than selling them. Can you explain to me in your very simple terms how you are managing the interest rate risk if you are growing U.S. mortgage book?","Bharat Masrani","First on the margin. Yes I think for the most part, directionally your numbers are correct. Mix does impact a lot and mortgages come in at a lower spread than commercial loans do. So depending on what kind of generation we had in one quarter you are going to see volatility around that.","Investment portfolio, obviously, some of those investments as they roll, they are rolling at a lower rate, so there would be some noise on that as well, but as I indicated earlier and our hope is that we are rolling less of those investment portfolio of components as we continue to grow our core loan business and I think you have seen that in the U.S.","So those are the moving parts and that's why I said to focus on that number is right, but to try and get a level of precision is very difficult. There is also somewhat of an offset in the non-interest income. As we have talked before, we have lot of optimization initiatives in the U.S. to increase our fee income in response to Durbin, and Reg E, as well as the low interest rate environment because as you have seen with many banks that the amount of minimum deposits you have to hold before you start to charge fees has gone up. So those are industry trends that the system is adjusting to offset some of this pressures. On the second part of your question. Yes?","Gabriel Dechaine - Credit Suisse","If I can? Just before we move on to that, the range you gave is fairly wide, the 350 to 375. What would cause it to swing that much? Should we think of it more in the low-end of that range for next little while or is it just going to bounce around a lot?","Bharat Masrani","I think it will bounce around a lot. Last quarter, people were really ecstatic that the margin had gone up by 10 basis points or whatever. So it will bounce around a lot. Acquired loan accounting is a factor in that and this time it\u2019s about half and sometimes it\u2019s higher and sometimes it\u2019s lower, but I think trying to stay within that range is the appropriate way to do, but it will bounce around, but I am comfortable that the range is an appropriate range given what we know today.","On the second part, we have talked about why we are benefiting and why we are one of the few banks that is benefiting from the refi boom. With the lower rates there is a huge refi wave going on, and as I have said before, we did not have, in the U.S., any meaningful mortgage business through the legacy acquisitions.","We build out a new platform. We have many, many customers that love the wealth service, that love our offering, and as they refi their mortgages which are elsewhere, they would like to give a shot to TD and they re happy with the service and the products we have and the servicing we provide.","So overall, we have been a big beneficiary of that as most of the refis that are happening are not happening in our book. We are benefiting from other banks refinancing activities. So that's the reason why mortgages are going up.","In our product offerings, we work very hard to focus on products that carry less interest rate risk. So, for example, a lot of our originations come in 15-year product, instead of the 30-year product. There is a large demand, as well, for variable rate mortgages as well. So, that's a benefit from an interest rate risk perspective.","Thirdly, if you look at our overall balance sheet in the U.S. and more importantly for the TD Bank Group balance sheet, the amount of these mortgages we are keeping on balance sheet and the level of risk in that is manageable. In fact, there are offsetting parts within our own balance sheet that helps us to mitigate some of the risks that might come through this particular type of risk.","So again, like you said, in simple terms that would be the answer. If you do want to have more detailed and technical discussion, we can set up an offline call with you, but overall, feel very comfortable that this is still a relatively small part of our balance sheet. If it becomes meaningful, then obviously you may see a different form of strategy from TD in managing this book.","Rudy Sankovic","Thank, Gabriel. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Routledge with National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.","Peter Routledge - National Bank Financial","Thanks very much. Question for Tim. I am looking at page 27 of the presentation and just looking at some of the loan growth dynamics quarter-over-quarter and what strikes me is other than residential mortgages and arguably indirect auto, on the personal side you have got flat home equity, flat unsecured lines of credit, credit cards that are personal. Is that supply driven, i.e. is TD pulling back a bit on those? Or is that demand driven or households pulling back? Then what does that tell you about the state of household\u2019s finances?","Tim Hockey","So I would say that there\u2019s been no question that we have tightened probably faster than marketplace. So I would say this is probably due to timing more than anything else. As you know we have been quite vocal about the state of the Canadian consumer, but if you break down where the quarter-over-quarter growth is, on the mortgage side, it would be sort of in the middle of the pack, slightly up.","As you say, on the non-mortgage HELOC, there are high competitive pricing pressures on that. So we are essentially flat to slightly down. Auto finance, still doing well, but less strong growth in Canada and that's largely due to competitive behavior. On the card side, as you know, certainty because of MBNA we have had declines and that was planned.","On the business lending side, we are up fairly significantly. So all in, as you say, our quarter-over-quarter growth is at the lower end of the range. So do I expect that to normalize? I would think so.","As I said, it\u2019s mostly timing, but in terms of your last part of your question, in terms of the state of the overall consumer. Our view is that the changes that were announced and have started to be implemented is a result of the OSFI guidelines.","We will have additional effect that we haven't even yet seen in the marketplace, and all banks will tend to comply with that as quickly as they can, given systems and other conversion issues, but it should start impacting the marketplace effective immediately. So we will see the effect of that on the overall level of consumer indebtedness.","Peter Routledge - National Bank Financial","So supply is pulling back, but you don\u2019t see demand pulling back?","Tim Hockey","In certain categories, definitely demand is pulling back a little bit, but I would say our supply has decreased. Yes, decreased faster than demand.","Rudy Sankovic","Thank, Peter. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Sedran with CIBC. Please go ahead.","Robert Sedran - CIBC","Colleen, I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the $250 million expense bump you are expecting in Q4. Is it fair to assume that a similar size bump should be dropped into my model for Q4 of '13? Or are there some of the initiatives you were talking about on the expense side geared towards reducing that number and perhaps smoothing it out so you don't get that large number every Q4?","Colleen Johnston","I think it\u2019s fair to say that we would like to see that number smoothed out a little bit more. As I mentioned, last quarter we have been quite focused on this as an executive team and looking at some of the underlying reasons why we seem to have a more pronounced increase in our fourth quarter than you might find is typical with other organizations.","I think it all boils down in our view to making sure we are spending money wisely and that we have an appropriate pace and discipline around that spending, and I am certainly comfortable that the number we are citing for Q4 is well disciplined and being well spent, but I think we would like to see a bit more even pacing over the course of the year. So I would hope you would see a smaller number in Q4 of next year.","Robert Sedran - CIBC","So would that then mean that the $250 million would just be spread among the other four quarters? Or is some of that trying to be managed down as well?","Colleen Johnston","I think you would always expect, in my view, that you would have higher expenses in Q4. I would like to see it certainly at a lower number than we are citing this time around, and to that point, you would see some of that spread over the earlier quarters of the year.","Rudy Sankovic","Thank, Robert. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brad Smith with Stonecap Securities. Please go ahead.","Brad Smith - Stonecap Securities","Sure, thanks very much. I just had a very quick question regarding the capital allocated to the U.S. personal and commercial business. I am just curious about this business if you just look at page 7 in you supp pack, is there any positive return every quarter? But the capital allocated to it isn't changing at all from quarter-to-quarter, so is that capital leaving the business or is it somehow not being retained in the business?","Colleen Johnston","Brad, there are some measures that we have taken to optimize capital in the business and that can relate to the securities portfolio and the quality of that portfolio. So, we are always actively managing that. Generally, you would expect the capital allocated to be going up over time as the business grows, but you do see some of that optimization activity going on.","Brad Smith - Stonecap Securities","The capital was coming out of the business, would it not be reflected, Colleen, in their regulatory fillings?","Colleen Johnston","I think, as you know Brad, the regulatory filings do reflect a different basis than you see in our segment results and there are various reasons that we hold different levels of capital in the legal entity versus what you would see reflected in the segment.","Rudy Sankovic","Thank, Brad. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Theriault with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Steve Theriault - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much. A question for Mark, please. I noticed about $5 billion increase in corporate risk-weighted assets, which I think I can link back to the U.S. operations. So, I am wondering, are there any downgrades, methodology changes or maybe some recalibrations going on there that you can make us aware of?","While I appreciate you might not have that at your fingertips, so may I could ask Ed a quick follow-up. Just on the dividend payout ratio, Ed, over what period of time you think you want to get to the midpoint? Are we talking a year, are we talking more like three years? And would you consider a step function in the dividend at some point?","Mark Chauvin","Hi, so relative to the increase in RWA, and the increase in the U.S. side, U.S. is still operating on a standardized basis, so it really wasn't attributed to a change in models and methodology. It was really attributed to really asset growth.","Ed Clark","On the dividends, I don't think we would want to commit ourselves to a precise date that we would hit the midpoint here. Obviously, we want to do it in a reasonable period of time. So we don't want to take forever to do it but I think our basic message to you is that we will get to the midpoint and we are going to increase as long as reasonable earnings perform as we expect, twice a year, and historically we have always said, we will grow our dividends in line with our earnings.","Obviously, for a period of time now, we are going to be growing our dividends faster than our earnings, because that's the only way we can get to the midpoint, given where we are today. But obviously it will be to a certain extent what the environment produces, how fast we get there.","Steve Theriault - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Mark, I wouldn't have thought that the asset growth was that large, but I will follow-up offline.","Colleen Johnston","Yes, so it's tracking fairly closely, not perfectly, but that's the key driver.","Rudy Sankovic","Thank, Steve. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Aiken with Barclays. Please go ahead.","John Aiken - Barclays Capital","Good afternoon. Ed with TD\u2019s pro forma Basel III capital ratio quickly approaching 8% and consensus expectations out there looking for national SIFI charge of 100 basis points at some point, do you think that the Canadian banks are running the risk of actually increasing the potential SIFI charge because of the strength of the pro forma Basel capital ratios that their producing already?","Ed Clark","That\u2019s a pretty speculative question. No, I think is my short answer. I think I give too much credit to the people making this decision that they are not guided by that. I think they are genuinely guided by what the appropriate capital is. I think they are also equally sensitive to the fact that Canada is clearly and as current we are leading the world here but we can only lead the world by a little bit. If we get too far ahead of the world we put the Canadian banking system at a significant competitors' advantage.","So I think they are aware. They are monitoring pretty tightly where other countries and particular United States is moving and I don\u2019t think would want us to get completely out of step with that. So, no I don\u2019t think we are shooting ourselves in the foot by getting the capital place. I think we are being prudent and they are being prudent.","John Aiken - Barclays Capital","Thanks, Ed. You managed a speculative the question quite well.","Rudy Sankovic","Thank, John. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Mutascio with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Colleen, my first question to you is how much is left in the integration expense for MBNA and over how many more quarters?","Colleen Johnston","I think I will turn that one over to Tim Hockey.","Tim Hockey","I could bounce it back saying the decision over how many quarters is really up to Colleen in terms of the item of note. So let me give you a quick update on the MBNA acquisition. Generally, we are quite pleased at their credit performance and we are quite pleased at the integration of the team.","I can tell you that the systems integration is well into the planning phase. We have already taken a decision to actually, as you know, run it as a separate entity, but having said that, there is a lot of systems to build because we didn't buy the entire company. So our expectation is the tail end of next year, calendar, would be when we would do the first version of the integration cutover and we would follow it up quickly with a, call it Phase II, in the early part of calendar 2014.","Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus","Is there some more run rate we saw this quarter in terms of dollar amount?","Tim Hockey","It's going to be prolonged and we certainly are seeing some of the cost estimates go up and we have sent the team back with instructions to say, get those cost estimates back down. It's a far way out, but it's pretty clear that it will be, I think from a project expense on the item of note, it will start ramping up in the fourth quarter of this year and then it will come back down again in the latter half of next year.","Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus","Am I allowed one follow-up, Rudy?","Rudy Sankovic","Yes, please. Sure.","Chris Mutascio - Stifel Nicolaus","On the reserves, after five or six straight quarters of the dollar amount of the allowance for credit losses being pretty flat you build them up selling to over $100 million this quarter, despite the fact that your gross impaired loans were relatively were pretty well-behaved. Any thought process of why building reserves this quarter?","Mark Chauvin","That reserve build represented the continuing increase required for the MBNA portfolio as we build during the first year. So the build specifically for that was in the just slightly under $100 million.","Rudy Sankovic","Next question, please.","Operator","We have no more questions here on the phone lines.","Rudy Sankovic","Okay. Great, thank you very much and I will turn it over to Ed for some final remarks.","Ed Clark","Of course, as I said we are very pleased with the quarter. We recognize that we have got some tough headwinds facing us again for next year, but we had tough headwinds facing us from 2012 and we managed to achieve our target, and we are focused on delivering for the shareholders and that\u2019s where our drive is. So we are feeling pretty good about things. Thank you very much.","Rudy Sankovic","Thank you very much, Ed, and with that we will end the meeting and thank you very much for joining us and have a great day.

Please go ahead.","Gillian Manning","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to TD Bank Group\u2019s second quarter 2017 investor presentation. My name is Gillian Manning and I\u2019m the Head of Investor Relations at the Bank. We will begin today\u2019s presentation with remarks from Bharat Masrani, the Bank\u2019s CEO, after which Riaz Ahmed, the Bank\u2019s CFO, will present our second quarter operating results.

Any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation represent the views of management and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank\u2019s shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank\u2019s financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance.","Forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for other purposes.

Additional information on items of note, the Bank\u2019s reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q2 2017 report to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Gillian, and thank you everyone for joining us today. TD delivered a strong performance in the second quarter with net income and earnings up -- earnings per share up, both up 12% to $2.6 billion and a $1.34 respectively. Our results reflect strong revenue growth lower credit provisions and good expense management across our businesses with the standout performance by our U.S. retail bank. Our capital and liquidity metrics are equally robust. TD CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.8%, down less than 10 basis points even after the completion of 15 million shares buyback in the quarter, and our leverage and liquidity coverage ratio remain strong.","I'm very pleased with our performance so far this year. We have maintained our focus on growing profitable client centric businesses. We have benefited from favorable financial market conditions, which have boosted activity in our wealth and wholesale businesses and increased margins on our sizable core deposit base, and we are making good progress on the business and strategic objectives we laid out at the start of the year.","Let me now comment on each of our segments. Canadian retail net income rose to $1.6 billion this quarter, up 7% from a year ago. We had good revenue growth across our lending and fee base businesses and saw a decline in credit provisions. We continued to originate good risk adjusted loan volumes in the higher margin areas, we have prioritized including HELOC, commercial lending and business cards. We delivered strong growth in checking accounts, winning more of our customers trust and business and we had robust growth in savings and business deposits.","We also continued innovating to improve the customer experience. In February, we launched an integrated digital experience that guides customers through the home buying process. We\u2019ve seen 120,000 unique visitors since launch with 1,500 appointments and calls generated to our branches and mobile mortgage specialist. Our Wealth business performed very well again this quarter, generating 9% earnings growth and $11 billion in net asset growth, up 31% from a year ago with $2.8 billion in long-term fund sales. We continue to take share in our mutual fund and private wealth businesses.","TD asset management was ranked the number one pension fund manager in Canada for the sixth year in a row according to Benefits Canada, and we drove innovative solutions in TD direct investing, in Q2, migrating clients to our new active trading platform. In our insurance business, earnings grew 5% and we introduce innovative new solutions here too. This quarter, we extended the platform enhancement we\u2019re making by launching TD MyAdvantage, an app that helps customers save money on car insurance by encouraging them to develop safer driving habits. Take up has been very strong with early results exceeding expectations. Customers love the way the app gives them timely advice and a driving score after each trip, so they can lower their premier by becoming better drivers.","Overall, I'm pleased with our progress in Canadian retail. We\u2019ve made disciplined choices about where to grow and invest. We\u2019ve introduced changes to improve our advisory and distribution capabilities and are now -- that are now bearing fruit. And we are seeing increase momentum in many of our businesses. These positives strides reflect good execution and a continued focus on our long-term objectives. Before I wrap up with Canadian Retail, I would like to address two issues of interest to all of you. First, with respect to Air Canada\u2019s announcement earlier this month that it does not intend to renew its Aeroplan partnership with Aimia in 2020. Let me reiterate that it is business as usual with TD Aeroplan credit card customers at this time.","Air Canada has stated that Aeroplan members can continue to earn and redeem miles until June 2020. And that it expects to make Air Canada flights available for Aeroplan redemption beyond 2020. Aeroplan has stated -- has a stated objective of ensuring that its members retained access to strong redemption offering around air rewards in the future, and for our part, we're committed to ensuring that our customers continue to be well served with our market leadership position in the credit card space and our compelling suite of other cards including first-class travel and new cards we're launching in June. I'm confident that we can continue to offer a strong value proposition and help our customers meet their goals.","Second, at our Annual Meeting a few months ago, I spoke to shareholders about negative assertions by some media regarding sales practices at TD and in the industry. I told them that we were hearing -- that we were hearing, what we were hearing was not our TD and did not reflect the experience of most of our employees. I also said we will review the concerns that were raised. We've largely completed the assessment with respect to Canadian Personal Banking and pleased to say that my view remains the same. I value the assessment and there're some ways that we can continue to improve. I also want to take this opportunity to thank our employees. I recognized that this period has been difficult for them. Our business results speak for themselves. Our people have continued to outperform. Our premier retail model remains intact and we'll continue to win with customers by having the best employees.","Now shifting to our U.S. business, U.S. Retail Bank earnings were $554 million in the quarter, up 21% from last year. Revenue growth was strong again at 10% reflecting good volume growth, higher deposit margins and rising fee income. Provision for credit losses declined from Q1 and also fell year-over-year. Expense growth was 2% resulting in 750 basis points of operating leverage and reported segment ROE rose to a new high of 10%. As I reflect on the performance of our U.S. business, the benefits of our customer centric model have never been more evident. We continue to gain market share and outgrow our peers while remaining within our risk appetite. Our deposit rich balance sheet gives us significant upside to higher rates and with our franchise still relatively young, we've a meaningful opportunity to strengthen and deepen customer relationships.","We will continue to invest to support that growth including moving forward with the digitization of our distribution strategy. Our latest innovation this quarter is Send Money, a person-to-person platform we launched by joining the new P2P payments network that includes the top U.S. banks. TD is the first issuer to market providing this newly developed user experience, a capability that will give us access to a significant share of U.S. checking account customers via instant transfers. It's an exciting step forward for our U.S. retail business. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this performance and the contribution it is making to advancing our strategy of becoming a premier North American retail bank.","Turning to our Wholesale Bank, net income was $248 million this quarter, up 13% from a year ago. Segment revenue increased 7% driven by higher corporate lending fees and client activity in our equity trading business. We also continue to make investments to build our U.S. dollar business, adding people to our investment banking, debt-to-capital market and trading teams and enhancing our product offerings. TD Securities acted on several notable deals in the quarter. We served a sole underwriter and bookrunner for Canadian Natural Resources on its $11.1 billion acquisition of Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s oil sands assets. The largest sold E&P bank underwriting in Canadian history.","We were joint bookrunner on AltaGas\u2019 2.6 billion subscription receipts offering to partially funds its purchase of WGL Holdings in the U.S., a cross-border transaction that required a coordinated multi-product solution including M&A advisory, equity, credit and high-yield capabilities. And we will joint bookrunner on General Motors financials $3 billion senior notes offering. Overall, Q2 was another good quarter both for our wholesale bank and for TD as a whole. Together with the strong performance we delivered in the first quarter, total bank earnings are up 13% year-to-date and EPS is up 12%.","These impressive results speak to the power of our diversified business mix as well as our ability to execute with excellence and its rapidly changing environment. Business and market conditions may fluctuate, but our focus will not waver. We remain committed to driving profitable risk adjusted organic growth, continue to adopt and innovate and supporting our clients and customers in achieving these financial goals. To wrap up, I\u2019m very pleased with our first half results. I\u2019m confident in our strategy, proud of the hard work and dedication of our people, and excited about what we can accomplish in the months ahead.","With that, I will pass it over to Riaz.","Riaz Ahmed","Thank you, Bharat. Good afternoon, everybody. Please turn to Slide 4. This quarter, the Bank reported earnings of CAD2.5 billion and EPS of CAD1.31. Adjusted earnings were CAD2.6 billion, and adjusted EPS CAD1.34, both up 12% year-over-year. Revenue increased 3% reflecting retail loan and deposit growth, higher deposit margins in the U.S. and higher fee-based income related to wealth asset growth and corporate lending. On a taxable equivalent basis, revenue increased 7%. We had higher than usual tax-exempt dividend income this quarter, due to increased client equity in equity trading, which also resulted in the lower tax rate. Expenses increased 1%, adjusted expenses increased 4%, primarily reflecting investments in technology and business initiatives and higher employee related expenses including variable compensation. Credit losses from quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and results are strong across all of our segments.","Please turn to Slide 5. Canadian Retail segment net income was CAD1.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year, reflecting volume and fee driven growth and lower credit losses. Earnings increased across all of our businesses personal banking, business banking, wealth and insurance generating attractive ROE. Total loan growth was 4% year-over-year with increases in personal lending and business lending volumes. Deposit increased by 11% reflecting growth in core checking and savings accounts and business deposits. And wealth assets grew 12%. Margin was 2.81%, down 1 basis point quarter-over-quarter. We continue to expect moderate downward pressure on margins for the rest of the year.","PCL declined by CAD34 million quarter-over-quarter due to lower provisions in auto lending and by CAD27 million year-over-year due to lower provisions in auto lending, card and personal lending. Annualize PCL as a percentage of credit volume was 26 basis points, a decrease of 4 basis points year-over-year. Expense increases year-over-year reflected higher employee related expenses including revenue base variable expense growth in the wealth business, higher investment and the strategic technology and ditch diversion initiatives and enhancements to our products.","Please turn to Slide 6. U.S. Retail net income was $636 million or CAD845 million, both up 18% year-over-year. The U.S. Retail Bank, earned U.S. $554 million, up 21% year-over-year. The strong results was driven by 10% revenue growth, reflecting higher loan and deposit volumes, higher deposit margins and fee income growth as well as lower credit losses and well managed expenses. Total loan growth of 6% and deposits increased by 9% both reflecting growth in personal and business customer segments.","Net interest margin was 3.05% up 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The increase reflects stable loan margins and a 6 basis points increase in deposit margins, partially offset by balance sheet mix as deposits outpace loan growth. Deposit growth reflects strong customer acquisition and higher balances and contributes to net interest income growth, but when it outpaces loan growth it has the effect of dampening NIMs in our case, as excess deposits are invested in high quality, lower yielding securities. While many factors affect margins, we expect continued improvement with further U.S. rating increasing.","PCL decreased 41% quarter-over-quarter primarily reflecting seasonal decreases in the credit cards and auto lending portfolios. And PCL decreased 7% year-over-year as higher personal banking provisions are more than offset by lower business banking provision. Expenses increased 2% year-over-year reflecting volume growth and higher employer cost and higher FDIC charges all partially offset by productivity saving. Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade increased 5% year-over-year, and as Bharat mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to have achieved a segment ROE of 10% this quarter.","Please turn to Slide 7. Net income for wholesale was CAD248 million up 13% year-over-year, reflecting higher revenue and a net recovery of credit losses, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses this quarter and the lower effective tax rate a year ago. Revenue increased 7% reflecting higher corporate lending fees and increased client activity in equity trading, partially offset by lower fixed income trading. PCL was a net recovery of CAD4 million, reflecting the recovery of specific provisions in the oil and gas sector. Non-interest expenses increased year-over-year reflecting continued investment in our U.S. dollar business including adding bankers, enhancing and e-trading capabilities and the impact of the Albert Fried acquisition.","Please turn to Slide 8. The corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of a CAD102 million this quarter compared to a loss of CAD120 million in the same period last year. A smaller loss reflects a decrease in net corporate expenses year-over-year and an increase in the contribution from other items. The higher contribution from other items reflects provisions for incurred, but identified credit losses in the same quarter last year, and higher treasury revenues this quarter offset by higher expense provision this quarter and impact of certain tax items in the same quarter last year.","Please turn to Slide 9, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.8% at the end of second quarter relatively flat to Q1 2017. We had strong organic capital generation this quarter and completed our previously announced normal course issuer bid repurchasing 50 million shares. Our leverage and liquidity ratios are consistent with last quarter's level.","I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you, Riaz, and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide 10. Portfolio credit quality remains strong during the quarter as evidenced by reductions in gross impaired loan formations, gross impaired loans and credit losses. Gross impaired loan formations ended the quarter at CAD1.15 billion down a CAD127 million or 2 basis points, driven by reductions in Canadian commercial and indirect auto gross impaired formations. There were no new formations in the wholesale portfolio.","Turning to Slide 11, gross impaired loans are down a CAD109 million or 4 basis points for the quarter at CAD3.29 billion. The reduction is attributed to resolutions, outpacing formations in the U.S. HELOC, U.S. Commercial and Canadian Retail portfolio offset by a CAD78 million negative impact of foreign exchange.","Moving to Slide 12, as indicated in previous quarters, U.S. strategic card PCLs are reported on a net basis for segment reporting, including only the Bank's contractual portion of credit losses. For the purpose of the credit slides however, we continue to report gross losses to better reflect portfolio credit quality. Provisions for credit losses are down 7 basis points on both the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. For the quarter notable PCL trends by business segment are, Canadian Retail loss rates remain at cyclically low levels; further recoveries were recorded in the wholesale oil and gas segment with no new credit losses. Consistent with historical seasonal trends, U.S. credit card and U.S. auto portfolio losses reduced during the quarter, and U.S. commercial credit losses reduced.","To conclude, the key takeaways this quarter are credit quality remains strong across the Bank's portfolios and we remain well positioned for continued quality loan growth.","With that, operator, we're now ready to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Aiken from Barclays.","John Aiken","Riaz, just diving into the ROE on the U.S. segment, taking a look, we had earnings year-over-year growing by 70% does look like the risk weight assets have shown some strong growth. The average common equity in the group really hasn\u2019t seen the same level of growth. Can you remind me how the equity is allocated or across the segments into the U.S. retail in particular?","Riaz Ahmed","John, the risk weights are allocated in accordance with regulatory requirements. So, you\u2019ll remember that for U.S. retail, we are AIRB approved, and for non-retail, we follow the standardized methodology and that\u2019s the basis on which the capital is allocated to the segment John.","Mike Pedersen","John, it\u2019s Mike. Am I just jump in and not miss the opportunity to tell you that, we don\u2019t talk very much about ROE in the U.S., but something we\u2019re very, very focused on and all of our efforts whether it\u2019s expense management or acquiring more customers or deepening relationships, even a lot of efforts on capital optimization have obviously helped us to a better place overtime, but we will stay very focused on that going forward.","John Aiken","Thanks Mike. And that\u2019s leading into, I guess my follow-on question with this focus on ROE and the improvements that we see. How does that impact the discussion about inorganic growth on a go forward basis on your platform?","Bharat Masrani","John, this is Bharat. We\u2019ve said it many times that if the right compelling opportunity were to present itself, we look at it very seriously. Obviously, the cards space has been very attractive. The partnership deals that we\u2019ve done and should similar deal present itself, we will look at it seriously. And I\u2019ve also said previously that there were making type of these available particularly in the Southeast of the U.S. where and if it were helping us and accelerating our growth aspirations there. Then, those will be quite interesting for us. So, we\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t need to inorganically grow our franchise, we have the scale. We have the brand positioning and obviously the performance not to compel us to acquire, but should a compelling situation arise we look at it very seriously.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to our next question from Meny Grauman with Cormark Securities. Please go ahead.","Meny Grauman","The question I have is also about the U.S., good results in the U.S., but it seems like you\u2019re able to buck some macro trends that we\u2019re seeing across U.S. market including very strong commercial loan growth, even though we\u2019re seeing the fed data point in another direction. We\u2019re also hearing about credit issues and areas like credit cards and other loans. And I\u2019m just wondering your perspective and how you\u2019re able to avoid those negative trends? What\u2019s different in your business that\u2019s allowing you to put up these results and not seemingly show any of these signs of issues that seem to be going around you?","Mike Pedersen","So, Meny. It\u2019s Mike. I think you're raising two issues, one is the issue of the loan volume growth and the other is credit quality. So, I'll just make a few comments and then I'm ask Greg Braca to comment on the loan volume issue, he's been responsible for both auto finance business and the corporate lending business where a lot of this -- which are lot of this pertains, and then Mark can cover the credit quality issue.","So, just by virtue of context -- by way of context, we have said for the last few quarters that we might well see some tapering off of our loan growth and particularly in commercial and auto, and that is what has happened as we expected. We\u2019re still outgrowing our peers, so I would also say that TD is always disciplined about its credit adjudication and that goes in good times and bad times and that\u2019s helped us greatly over the years.","But at this point, given where we are in the credit cycle, we\u2019re being quite disciplined as well in our pricing, and if that means slightly lower volumes, that\u2019s okay with us. Having said all of that, loan growth has moderated a bit, but we\u2019re still outperforming. So, I'll just let Greg add some color and then Mark can take on the credit quality issue.","Greg Braca","So, thanks, Mike. As noted, we continue to still take share in aggregate in our lending business. And we\u2019re quite bullish on our ability all things being equal going forward to continue to grow our loan portfolio. As Mike noted, we have been saying, we\u2019ve had some very strong double-digit C&I growth for the last few years, and we\u2019ve been calling out that down that as we start coming into our own natural size across very many industries and businesses. We would naturally see a slower growth in C&I on a relative percentage basis year-over-year, as well as in the auto business, we\u2019ve also had double-digit growth and we said that we\u2019re not going to chase volume for the sake of return of credit quality and you're seeing a moderation in the auto space there.","In Q2, I would just also call out that Q1 and Q2 we\u2019ve seen some slow down in general across all commercial markets, a couple of things have been going on higher interest rates, we\u2019ve seen clients staying on the side lines or hitting the bond market and retiring bank debt that we\u2019ve also seeing less CapEx spend. And in the U.S., we\u2019ve decidedly seen a lot of our commercial clients sitting on the side lines for the last couple of quarters with a wait and see attitude with everything from decisions on taxes to infrastructure spend and the rules of the road in the U.S. with the new administration. So, notwithstanding all of that, and we continue to take share.","Mark Chauvin","And, Meny, on the side of the U.S. credit quality, I remain very comfortable with the overall quality throughout the portfolios. We always try to fall very discipline lending standards through a cycle and we really are avoiding the more volatile subprime categories, there is an any throughout portfolios. The expense of second quarter was very close to our expectations. As we sell given the seasonality nature of the cards and the indirect auto portfolio, you would expect to see decrease in Q2 which we saw. And also commercial loan losses in Q2 were very low.","Now, I'm not looking for major increases, but you can\u2019t have really lower losses for the extended period of time. So, I would look for the modest increase maybe in next quarter, but from a quality perspective I prefer to look at loss rates. And we\u2019re really in the current economic environment and borrowing a significant change in that, we\u2019re looking at the loss rates in the U.S., staying relatively consistent to what we\u2019re seeing for the -- in this quarter and for the balance of the year.","Bharat Masrani","Meny, this is Bharat. Just to add to that, we\u2019ve been talking about this for a few years now. The footprint we have in the U.S., the discipline that Mark, Greg and Mike talked about that we avoid certain sectors -- this has been the TD tradition and not going out of footprint lending, that's been a key component of our strategy as well and all those things combined to me franchise what it is, so yes if you're in the lending business once in a while you're going to take losses like any other bank but I'd like to think that we would continue to be on an outlier status given our stated strategy and now we're executing against them.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Theriault with Eight Capital. Please go ahead.","Steve Theriault","I had a question for Teri, but first just a follow-up, Riaz, you said in your opening remarks, you expect further NIM improvement in the U.S. with more fed rate hikes. So just want to make sure I understand that and the absence of additional hikes, so all of equal. Are you looking for the NIM to be flat or down with the mix changes, if deposits continue to grow faster than loans? Were there any benefits still left from the previous rate hikes over the last little bit?","Riaz Ahmed","There would be Steve some left from previous rate hikes, but I'd say there're absent further fed rate increases or steepening of yield curve that we would bump around where we're now with little bit of a positive bias.","Steve Theriault","And then for Teri, I was hoping you could speak to why a little bit why the HELOC books been grow considerably faster than the mortgage growth, I know they don't necessarily grow at the same pace but I remember times where the inverse was true but it's interesting that the mortgage growth is only 1% while the HELOCs continue to grow in the mid single-digit range, so I guess I'm wondering specifically if the HELOC growth is more draw down related versus origination related, any color there would be helpful?","Teri Currie","So, this is part of our stated strategy in terms of growing our products where we have an embedded growth opportunity, so we're quite pleased with the progress we're making. FlexLine is the better product for the right customer in terms of being more flexible, and it's also more profitable for us. We've been tilting our origination again for the right customers, so this is an origination story, at kind of almost 40% originations now in this category and so this is exactly aligned with our strategy, we're pleased with how it's performing.","Steve Theriault","Is that also a bit of tilting towards uninsured specifically or is that\u2026","Teri Currie","Not necessarily, we've been improving the FlexLine product to allow it overtime to have the same characteristics and choices or our regular mortgage product.","Steve Theriault","And I guess what have you -- I thought I'd ask on Aeroplan, I remember when the transaction was done and I think it was 2014, that Aeroplan was expected to become more integrated with some of the other offerings, like deposit products and what not, maybe mortgage products. I know that was the initial intention, but I\u2019d be curious to hear a little bit of how far that's gone. I've seen some promotional miles offerings, but I was hoping if you could give us a quick sense of how integrated the points program is in your product set? And if you expect any changes, no, Bharat said, there were changes for the card customers, but I'm wondering if you're thinking of any changes in terms of ancillary offering?","Teri Currie","Still for sure, no changes for our card customers, and in fact we\u2019re feeling comfortable with our overall competitiveness of our current offering, both first class travel and Aeroplan give our customers in the travel category a very good choice. To your specific question around other uses, usage of the points, we\u2019ve try some things and it\u2019s been limited, and we don\u2019t anticipate sort of any change going forward from what we\u2019ve been doing historically.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question Nick Stogdill with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Nick Stogdill","My question is also for Teri. Just on the expense growth this quarter, so we saw some improvement. I\u2019m just wondering if pause of operating leverage in the full year is still a target for Canada.","Teri Currie","We absolutely continue to expect positive operating leverage for the full year. The expense levels to remain at this level and growth level to taper off through the year.","Nick Stogdill","Okay. Thank you. And then maybe for Mark, just on the auto lending in Canada. Is it really implemented in Western Canada that\u2019s driving lower PCL and lower information?","Mark Chauvin","So Nick, I\u2019d say, there is two major factors. One is an improvement in the oil impacted regions and that\u2019s kind of working its way through the system. And other the factor and is equally prominent is that, it\u2019s really improved collection strategies. We did have some operational issues as we brought things together. Last year that resulted in increase and we worked our way through those, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s contributed to lower loss of the share.","Nick Stogdill","And then just a quick one, just an update on the Scottrade acquisition. Is that expected or can you refresh on that expected to close? And then when you announce that purchase, did you factor in higher rates since in the accretion outlook?","Bharat Masrani","So, this is Bharat, Nick. I think we have said, we expect the transaction to close somewhere in the fall timeline, that continues to be the case. And I\u2019ll let Riaz to talk about what the assumptions we had made.","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. Nick, whenever we look at acquisitions or just general business planning, we look at a number of scenarios on interest rate fund. And so we look at everything on a flat rate basis, but also look at sensitivities for the impact for interest rate increases. So both, all the scenarios would have been considered in the acquisition.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gabriel Dechaine with National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.","Gabriel Dechaine","I want to ask about the big TEB adjustment this quarter. I get that there is an adjustment to your tags, but also when you have a speed tax of trading activities, the negative revenue impact. But I\u2019m just wondering, what happen this quarter to drive such a large amount of TEB revenue? We see in the tax reconciliation of the big $307 million dividend receive figure in there. What -- and that the root of my question, how repeatable is that the performance because you call it out as this higher than usual equity training activity?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes. I think, you should think a bit about it just in the ordinary course of all kind of client activities. So sometimes this kind of activity is elevated, other times underwriting is elevated, otherwise M&A -- other times M&A is elevated, it\u2019s all client driven and a function of what the client flow looks like.","Gabriel Dechaine","But there was an anything in particular that you call out that the boost of this activity?","Riaz Ahmed","No, I think it is simply client demand activity. So, clients are active as what I\u2019d like to call out.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. Then on Page 1 of your supplement and I mean I\u2019ve never really looked at this the Page 1. But, slide \u2013 sorry, line 35, we see the after tax impact of a 1% increase in interest rate. I was just wondering, is that 67 million and it\u2019s down quite a bit since 2015. Is that a number? They are big caveat there and I know some interest rate disclosures have major caveat to pass them. Should I really be using this number for some indication of your rate sensitivity?","Riaz Ahmed","I think if you look at the MD&A, Gab. We\u2019ve described the net interest income sensitivity in a bit more detail, and it is a risk management measure rather than a way of looking at margin or NII upside. So, what -- when I say, it\u2019s a risk management measure, what I mean is that, it is calculated in relation to a target duration profile, and while that all sounds very technical, I\u2019d be happy to walk you through their technicality offline as to what the differences are.","Gabriel Dechaine","Maybe just shorten duration I guess is that?","Riaz Ahmed","Yes, the MD&A gives you full disclosure of how that calculation is arrived at and what it means. So, maybe for the purpose of the call, I might just leave at that and happy to take you through it separately.","Gabriel Dechaine","Last one here about the -- you did call out the deposit margins expanding. Are we still on the situation where a lot of these higher deposit margins have not been passed on to consumers? And also before I forget, Mike Pedersen, I think this is your last call, good luck in the future and miss talking to you.","Mike Pedersen","Thanks, Gab. Pardon me?","Gabriel Dechaine","I don\u2019t want to get patriot here so let\u2019s\u2026","Mike Pedersen","All right, I'm sure you won\u2019t, but thank you. So, I would say that we are gradually as each rate Fed rate increase transpires, seeing a higher deposit beta. So, it was a little higher as a result of the December 2016 increase than it was in December 2015, but it's still well below what you might consider as normal betas on the basis of historical presidents. My expectation would be that it will continue to rise, but it's been fairly low and most banks I think would say, it's been in teens, low 20s kind of stuff until now, but it should rise going forward.","Gabriel Dechaine","Sorry, teens, low 20s what's that in relation to?","Mike Pedersen","The beta percent.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Sumit Malhotra with Scotia Capital.","Sumit Malhotra","First question is on the insurance business. Strong contribution earnings wise this quarter and we know that business has been somewhat lumpy at times. Just wondering, if there was any update from the Bank in relation to some of the weather activity that we\u2019ve heard about in the last few weeks? And whether you have any comments as to how that may affect results in the second half of the year?","Teri Currie","Sumit, it\u2019s Teri. So, obviously, the flooding didn't impact Q2 given it happened after quarter end. We expect a minimal impact that's partly driven by just our share in the impacted area, relative to others, and so not a significant an exposure and so let's probably leave it at that.","Sumit Malhotra","So, nothing that we'll notice more than the usual volatility in this business?","Teri Currie","No, not from what we know today.","Sumit Malhotra","And then Teri over to you, a couple of questions, for the Canadian P&C business specifically away from wealth and insurance, obviously Bharat mentioned in his opening comments, a lot of let's say, unflattering headlines for the business, a few months back. But if I did know about any of that, if I just look at the results here today, certainly wouldn't have any indication that there was anything negative being said of other the Bank and that there was customer retrenchment in any form. So to put this to you in a couple of ways, when we look at revenue in this business, are you of the view that there has been or will be any kind of step back in revenue growth as a result of what we heard about? And secondly maybe very unrelated to this, we usually do see consumer loan growth book better for TD and all of the Canadian banks for the second half of the year along with the pickup in real estate activity. Is that seasonal strength in your view likely to be less so this year as a result of recent changes specifically in the Toronto market?","Teri Currie","So, on your first question, pleased in fact that we've had such strong revenue growth and continued that trend from Q1, and I think that speaks words off in terms of your question around our results been impacted or do we expect them to be impacted in a good business deposit growth, core checking acquisition at record level, strong total personal deposit growth, feeling good about business lending and unsecured lending, which will get at your second question. Really again taking advantage of those opportunities, we had outlined where we have embedded growth opportunity and you\u2019ve seen that in business credit card and unsecured lending, in mutual funds and in FlexLine as I talked about earlier.","If we think from a revenue and growth standpoint, we would feel good about the guidance we've given you before and would continue to expect to meet that guidance. On your second question around lending growth, we would still be in a place where we from a year-over-year perspective would expect proprietary lending growth to be in the mid-single digits. So, notwithstanding Ontario for housing or anything you've been reading in the media, while it's early to tell, our experience is formed by GDA and the fact that market in Ontario where the Greater Golden Horseshoe is fairly tight from a listing to sale perspective. I think our guidance still stands.","Sumit Malhotra","So, I'll leave it here, you mentioned GDA, you've obviously you gave us provincial disclosure. Looking at, at high level data, we did see sales decline relatively sharply in Vancouver for about six month period, before we've seen a pickup off late. Is that or I'll wrap it up here, did you see your lending volumes in Vancouver after the implementation of the tax pair back? And is that the expectation that you for Toronto in the near term?","Teri Currie","So, in GDA particular, so in both kind of higher growth market you mentioned, we have been under index relative to the competition. And so, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily point to this specific policy changes as an issue for us. And that\u2019s been purposeful in terms of some of the tightening to policies. We, as Mark mentioned have risk policy that we pay attention to recycle, and so that resulted in some under index growth. As it relates to the Greater Golden Horseshoe, we\u2019re not sure obviously because it\u2019s fairly days, and they were multiple measures that we announced. But given the tightness of the market, you might anticipate that it wouldn\u2019t be as longer period of delay.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Sohrab Movahedi with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sohrab Movahedi","Mike, the U.S. year-to-date, U.S. Retail year-to-date expense growth, you\u2019ve been able to keep it at looks to be like under a 4%. Is that a sustainable trend line as you look into next year?","Mike Pedersen","Yes. So I think that\u2019s right, I think year-to-date it\u2019s been an about 3.5, that was 5 in the first half or first quarter or 2 in the second quarter. I would say that\u2019s a reasonably good guide based on what we see right now in terms of the rest of the year. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little early to comment on next year. I would just say those that we have a strong focus on productivity and Greg and I have talk about that and he is sure that he is going to continue that. So that will continue to be a focus in the business.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay. And what sort of stuff may impact next year that makes a little bit more difficult to kind of commit to the growth rate?","Mike Pedersen","Well, we are always focused on creating operating leverage and investing in the business for the future. And we, I think it\u2019s fair to say operate in a very uncertain environment in the U.S. right now. So, that alone could dictate of the pace at which we invest and where we invest, but we also have a competitive environment that is evolving very quickly in terms of digital disruption and so on. And when you\u2019re looking out six quarters as you\u2019re asking me to that a long-time in today\u2019s reality, and I\u2019m just reluctant to predict what our expenses will be that many quarters in advance. Again, I\u2019d day there has been a strong focus on expense management and every indication I have is that will continue.","Sohrab Movahedi","Perfect. Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to push on it, I just wanted to see if there is something. I mean, I guess is the Scottrade Bank addition, will it have any negative implications here from an expense or operating leverage perspective?","Mike Pedersen","That\u2019s not something that I would consider in that respect.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Darko Mihelic with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead.","Darko Mihelic","Just a real quick one for Teri, with the review now over of your sales practices, maybe can you just touch on employee engagement and customer service scores and whether or not there is been sort of change there?","Teri Currie","Absolutely, so, I'm pleased to say that we continuously each year monitor our overall employee engagement and having recently received those results, they were very strong in fact up in branch banking in Canada this year. So, I think that\u2019s a good reflection of the private and people are feeling. I can also tell you having spent a lot of time in all of our markets across the country and branches and focus group with employees that they do not believe that what was portrayed in the media has anything to do with what they do each and every day helping our customers. They are proud TD Bankers who work hard to help our customers\u2019 dreams come true.","So, I would say motivation is good and we have some proof to back that up. And I'm sorry you had a second part to your question, customer experience. Customer experience level is not something that we report externally, but I can tell you that I think our business growth would indicate that our customers are engaged with us in a significant way as they were pre any of this attention.","Darko Mihelic","Okay. So, at the end it has been really good outcome for TD, no change to employee kind of compensation schemes. We should expect that really this business as usual, and that I'm bit surprised that I mean were there anything suspect from a system\u2019s point of you that would need to be address as a result of the first review?","Teri Currie","So, now you're asking me a different question. So, let me just say having gone through the review, as we would was kind of any review that we do, there are things that we learned that we can improve upon, and we\u2019ll be acting on those kinds of things. There is nothing I would say relative to our overall framework that I would holdout as part of that. But some kinds of examples would be improving training for particularly first line management and ensuring they have the coaching that they need and the mechanisms that we hear what they have to say. But overall, again the assessment reinforced what we thought going in, and we\u2019re pleased that will be a better business as a result of having spent more time listening to our people and our customers through this period.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Bharat Masrani. Please go ahead for closing remarks.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, operator. I am very pleased with the results as you know the numbers can do the talking here, and I want to take this opportunity to thank all the TD Bankers around the world, they continue to deliver for our shareholders on an ongoing basis. And I\u2019d also like to take this opportunity as somebody mentioned on the call. This is Mike's final earnings call. So, Mike on behalf of all your colleagues at TD and I know I'm talking on behalf of the folks on the phone as well, thank you for all your efforts, we wish you the very best in your retirement.","Mike Pedersen","Thank you.","Bharat Masrani","And Greg, I think he set to you up for expenses and revenues and all that.

Additional information on items of note, the Bank\u2019s reported results, and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information is available in our Q2 2016 Report to Shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, Gillian, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. TD delivered good results again this quarter. Net income rose to $2.3 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago; and earnings per share were a $1.20, also up 5%. Our Retail businesses benefited from good organic growth, positive operating leverage, and continued foreign exchange benefits from our North American strategy.","Our Wholesale Bank also performed well. While provisions for credit losses rose in both the retail and wholesale portfolios, this was largely a reflection of continued weakness in the oil & gas sector. Overall credit quality remains strong.","Overall, I am pleased with our performance for the first half of the year. Earnings are up 6% and earnings per share are up 5% for the year-to-date. Our CET1 ratio at the end of the second quarter stood at 10.1%, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter. And our leverage and liquidity coverage ratios remain in line with expectations, reflecting the strength of our balance sheet. Our reported results this quarter include a $116 million after tax charge related to our Direct Investing business in Europe; Riaz will address this in his remarks.","Turning to our businesses, Canadian Retail, net income was $1.5 billion this quarter, up 2% from a year ago, as we earned through a higher tax rate. Personal and commercial banking earnings were supported by higher loan and deposit volumes, increased revenue, and good expense management, offset by higher provisions and further margin compressions. Of note, in the quarter, we had record mortgage retention rates or renewals and we grew business banking volumes at double-digit rates. Our wealth business delivered more than $10 billion in net asset growth for a second consecutive quarter, despite challenging market conditions. And TD was ranked number one for pension fund assets under management by Benefits Canada for the fifth year in a row. Our insurance business continues to perform well. While earnings were relatively flat in the quarter, net income before taxes continues to grow, reflecting significant improvements in revenue and claims performance.","We continue to assess the effects of the fires in Fort McMurray, which occurred after quarter-end. Given that our businesses benefit from loss mitigating and sharing arrangements through insurance or reinsurance, we do not expect the impact to be material.","Our U.S. Retail segment generated earnings of US$459 million in the quarter, up 6% from last year. I am particularly pleased with our revenue performance, up 6% this quarter. Loan and deposit volumes increased at double-digit rates. We are acquiring new households faster than our competitors, and we\u2019re doing it by leveraging all our distribution channels with digital credit card sales particularly strong this quarter. While provisions for credit losses rose from a year ago, reflecting portfolio growth and allowance build, they declined quarter-over-quarter as did impaired loans. Core credit metrics remained strong. We also continue to see the benefits of a stronger U.S. dollar in our consolidated earnings with Canadian dollar earnings up 13% year-over-year and 15% including the contribution from TD Ameritrade.","Net income in our Wholesale Bank was $219 million this quarter, down 11% from a year ago as good top-line performance was offset by higher credit provisions related to the oil and gas portfolio. All of our wholesale businesses had an active quarter with underwriting and advisory revenues particularly strong. Domestic origination market improved and TD Securities won several significant mandates in the quarter, co-leading TransCanada Pipelines $4.2 billion bought deal and advising Shaw for its acquisition of Wind Mobile and disposition of Shaw Media. U.S. business also continues to perform well with origination activity strong during the quarter.","Let me take a moment to comment on provisions for credit losses. Mark will address this in more detail, but at a high level, credit metrics remained strong across our portfolios. We have seen continued weakness in oil and gas impacted areas, but trends in impaired loans and provisions are in line with expectations. Nonetheless, we made a further addition to our collective allowance this quarter to reflect credit deterioration in oil and gas exposures as well as volume growth in the rest of our portfolios. Overall, we\u2019ve been saying for some time that we expected credit to be a headwind to earnings this year, given the benign PCL rates we reported in 2015. That is now materializing. However, we remain comfortable that we are adequately reserved, and losses will be manageable.","Looking more broadly, environment remains uncertain. Global economic growth is trending up, but the pace of the recovery remains slow and uneven. The low growth, lower rate environment continues to affect recoveries in most developed economies, but conditions are stronger in our footprint. While recent economic data in the U.S. have been mixed, domestic demand appears to be firming and the investments we have made in our business are paying off.","We are well-positioned to continue to take share. In Canada, the economy is adjusting to a lower commodity price environment, albeit from last quarter\u2019s lows, and we\u2019ll feel the impact of the Fort McMurray wildfires but fiscal stimulus will provide some offset; and the lower cost of raw materials is driving growth in other parts of the country where our market share is higher.","Against this backdrop, we remain steadfast in our approach. We will continue to generate organic growth and compete where we see opportunities that are within our risk asset base. We will stay focused on managing base expenses as we have done very effectively so far this year. And we will continue to invest in delivering a better customer experience across all our channels.","Last quarter, I highlighted some milestones on this journey. Let me update on our most recent accomplishments. TD Bank, America\u2019s Most Convenient Bank scored another big win in 2016 J.D. Power survey, taking the number one spot for retail banking in Florida. This builds in our success in J.D. Power\u2019s last small business banking survey where we were ranked number one in the Northeast region.","In Canada, TD MySpend, the real time money management app we launched this month, already has more than 180,000 customers and double that many accounts. And we expanded customer service through Facebook Messenger to the U.S. after debuting it with great success in Canada, last December. We also announced that we will be introducing Apple Pay for our Canadian customers, a service we already offer in the U.S. We\u2019re excited to build on our leadership position in the digital space by adding Apple Pay to a strong suite of mobile payment options that include our TD app, Samsung Pay in the U.S., and our participation in UGO Wallet in Canada.","To wrap up, I\u2019m pleased with our results in the first half of the year. We continue to execute on our strategy of building for the future, operating with excellence, and adapting to an ever changing environment. As ever, a greatest trend is our people. We were reminded of that this month as we witnessed there with some remarkable response to the devastation of Fort McMurray. To the people of Fort McMurray, as you return home to begin the long hard work of rebuilding your homes and communities, TD will be there to support you, now and in the future. And to our colleagues, some of whom I met in Edmonton earlier this month, when I visited the region, I know how tirelessly you\u2019ve been working to support the recovery effort. Those of you with the TD mobile responsibly provided onsite emergency assistances, evacuated bank insurance customers, those that the TD Helps advice center were supporting customers with urgent financial needs, those of you at TD Insurance who gave immediate support to our evacuated insurance customers by arranging living allowances and finding temporary accommodation and who are now preparing to help customers rebuild, replace or repair their homes and automobiles when Fort McMurray reopens, and the thousands of colleagues who have made matching donations through TD to the Canadian Red Cross, thank you. The compassion and dedication are inspiring. I know we can accomplish great things together.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Riaz.","Riaz Ahmed","Thanks, Bharat, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide five. This quarter, the Bank earned adjusted EPS of $1.20, up 5% year-over-year. Canadian Retail earnings grew 2%; U.S. Retail adjusted earnings grew 15% in Canadian dollars, and 7% in U.S. dollars; and Wholesale earnings declined 11%, reflecting higher credit provisions in the oil and gas portfolio.","Adjusted total revenue increased 7% year-over-year, or 4% excluding FX and acquisitions, led by loan, deposit, and wealth asset growth. Growth was partially offset by margin pressure. PCLs increased year-over-year but declined quarter-over-quarter. Adjusted expense growth was 7% year-over-year, or 1% excluding FX and acquisitions.","Please turn to slide six. The Canadian Retail segment earned net income of $1.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year. The increase reflected loan, deposit, and wealth asset growth, and lower insurance claims partially offset by lower margins, higher PCL and a higher effective tax rate. Total loan growth was 6% year-over-year with personal lending volumes up 5% and business lending volumes up 11%. Deposits increased by 6%, reflecting growth in core checking and savings accounts, which were up 8%. Business deposits grew 4%, and wealth assets grew by 3%.","Margin declined 3 basis points quarter-over-quarter, reflecting certain adjustments made in the prior quarter, the low interest rate environment, and competitive pricing. We expect margins to remain under modest downward pressure, reflecting the interest rate environment, product mix and competitive factors. Credit losses increased 15% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher provisions this quarter and a sale of charged of accounts in the prior quarter. Expenses increased 1% year-over-year.","I would like to take a moment to give you an update on Fort McMurray. We are continuing to assess the impact of the wildfires. We expect we will experience some losses in our banking businesses and higher claims in our insurance businesses in the third quarter. However, as a result of our smaller footprint in Alberta and because of mitigants [ph] including reinsurance in our general insurance business, mortgage insurance in our personal banking, and third party insurance held by our commercial banking customers, we do not expect the impact to be material. I estimate less than $0.05 per share over time.","Please return to slide seven. The U.S. Retail Bank posted earnings of US$459 million, up 6% on an adjusted basis from Q2 2015. Results for the quarter ended, reflected strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher expenses and PCL. Total loan growth of 13% year-over-year, reflecting an 8% increase in personal loans and a 17% increase in business loans. Average deposits increased by 10%.","Margin was stable quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the full quarter benefit of the December, Fed rate increase, offset by lower loan margins and balance sheet mix. Overall, absent interest rate changes, we expect margins to be relatively stable in 2016. PCL decreased 23% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to typical seasonal reductions in credit card balances. Adjusted expenses increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting investments in the business and timing. Adjusted expenses are up 2.4% year-to-date excluding impact of acquisitions.","Earnings from our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade increased 13% year-over-year, reflecting asset growth and higher trading volumes in that business. Aggregate adjusted U.S. retail earnings were up 7% year-over-year in U.S. dollars and 15% in Canadian dollars.","Please turn to slide eight. Net income for Wholesale was $219 million, down 11% year-over-year, primarily due to higher credit provisions this quarter. Revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting lower fixed income trading and equity underwriting fee, partially offset by higher advisory and corporate lending fees. Credit losses were $50 million, a $38 million increase quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting specific provisions in the oil and gas sector. Non-interest expenses were down 1%, reflecting lower operating expenses and variable compensation, partially offset by some foreign exchange translation adjustment.","Please turn to slide nine. The Corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of $120 million this quarter compared to a loss of $139 million in the same period last year. Net corporate expenses increased slightly year-over-year, reflecting ongoing investments in enterprise and regulatory projects. Other items increased $38 million year-over-year, reflecting contributions from positive tax items recognizing the current quarter and higher revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities, partially offset by offset by higher provisions for incurred but not identified credit losses.","On a reported basis, the Corporate segment loss includes a $116 million after tax charge, reflecting impairment of goodwill, non-financial assets, and other charges related to our direct investing business in Europe. This business has had recurring losses indicating that the goodwill and intangible assets do not have continuing value. We are considering opportunities to prevent further losses in this business.","Please turn to slide 10. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.1% at the end of second quarter, a 20 basis points increase, due primarily to organic capital growth and unrealized gains on our AFS securities, partially offset by risk-weighted asset growth in other items in the quarter. Our leverage and liquidity ratios are consistent with last quarter. Overall, we remain well-positioned for the evolving regulatory and capital environment.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Chauvin","Thank you, Riaz, and good afternoon, everyone.","Please turn to slide 11. Credit quality remained strong as evidenced by a 3 basis-point quarterly reduction in the Bank\u2019s overall loss rate to 42 basis points despite further increases in collective allowances. Canadian Retail gross impaired loan formations have remained stable over the past five quarters at 19 basis points.","In Wholesale, further deterioration in the oil and gas producer portfolio occurred during the quarter, despite a recent strengthening in oil prices. This trend was expected as leverage borrowers exhaust available sources of liquidity. The four new impaired formations in the oil and gas sector totaling $142 million were expected, representing previously designated high-risk accounts. The $384 million decrease in U.S. Retail formations for the quarter was concentrated in the personal consumer segment. The legacy interest-only HELOC product accounted for U.S. $201 million of the decrease, resulting from completion of the remediation effort began over a year ago for major portion of the portfolio. A $126 million of the decrease was attributable to strengthening in the Canadian dollar.","Turning to the next slide. Gross impaired loans decreased by 2 basis points or $232 million to $3.57 billion. Canadian retail and commercial portfolio performance continues to trend their cyclical low level, unchanged at 29 basis points quarter-over-quarter.","In the U.S., our performance continues to be good across all the portfolios. The $353 million decrease noted during the quarter is due to a $297 million strengthening of the Canadian dollar and US$58 million decrease in legacy interest only HELOC gross impaired loans. The decrease in legacy interest only HELOC impaired loans resulted from the decline in new impaired formations, mentioned earlier, and the return of customers to performing status. Further reductions are expected this year.","Please turn to slide 13. As announced last quarter, U.S. strategic card PCLs are now reported in the U.S. Retail segment on a net basis, including only the Bank\u2019s contractual portion of credit losses. For the purpose of these credit slides, however, we continue to report the gross amount for U.S. Retail PCL to better reflect portfolio of credit quality. Provisions for credit losses were $592 million, down $56 million, or 3 basis points, quarter-over-quarter to 42 basis points. Canadian Retail credit loss rates increased 5 basis points during the quarter to 30 basis points, roughly in line with last year\u2019s performance of 29 basis points. U.S. Retail PCL was down a $123 million or 27 basis points during the quarter, primarily due to seasonal reduction in U.S. card volumes and strengthening of the Canadian dollar. Collective allowances for incurred but not identified losses recorded in the Corporate segment increased $60 million during the quarter due continued credit deterioration in consumer, commercial, and wholesale exposure impacted by low oil and gas prices.","Please turn to slide 14. Turning to oil and gas now. There has been little change in the composition of our oil and gas related exposure over the quarter. Drawn loans to the oil and gas producer and servicer segment increased $200 million to $4.4 billion, continuing to represent less than 1% of total gross loans and acceptances. Excluding real estate secured lending, consumer lending and small business banking exposures to Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador represents 2% of the Bank\u2019s gross loans and acceptances. As expected, credit deterioration and loan impairment in oil impacted portfolios and regions are continuing.","The recent increase in oil prices, while encouraging, is not likely to have an immediate positive impact. In the corporate and commercial segments, we are now seeing the impact of sustained low oil and gas prices, which is reflected for new impairments and related provisions in the segment this quarter. The signs of deterioration in the consumer lending portfolios in impacted provinces seen last quarter are continuing, but to-date increases in credit losses have been largely offset by stronger than expected performance across the rest of the country.","Well, we are regulatory performing detailed assessments of our oil and gas exposure as the challenges facing this sector play out. To-date, the pace of negative credit migration, new impairments, and credit provisions remain within our expectations. We continue to be adequately reserved for the problems that lie ahead, barring a significant decrease in oil and gas prices.","With respect to Fort McMurray wildfires, our immediate concern is for our customers and employees, and we\u2019re focused on providing whatever support we can in these difficult times. Our credit exposure to the region is modest, and future losses are not expected to be significant.","To conclude, the key takeaways this quarter are, first, credit quality remains strong in the Canadian and U.S. portfolios; and secondly, low oil and gas prices continue to represent a credit concern. Having said this, I remain comfortable that total losses attributed to low oil and gas prices are unlikely to exceed my previous guidance of 5% to 10% over 2015 actual levels, which equals roughly $100 million to $200 million per year for a period of two years.","With that, operator, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sumit Malhotra from Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.","Sumit Malhotra","My question is for Mike Pedersen and has to do with loan growth, loan growth in the U.S. You\u2019ve obviously had a very strong trend here over a period of time but it did seem like sequentially across your consumer portfolios, the pace of loan growth had slowed, particularly noticeably. And I know there has been movements in interest rates. I wouldn\u2019t have thought that was enough to put a real cramp or crimp in loan demand. Could you give me some color on what was happening in the quarter and whether there\u2019s been any change to the outlook as far as the consumer side of the equation is concerned?","Mike Pedersen","Yes, the issue there is that we had very large payoffs at the end of Q1 and in particular one very large loan. So, as you look at the averages quarter-over-quarter, that was in Q1, not in Q2. We\u2019re not seeing any difference in outlook other than that fact. And I expect to continue to see a good growth in business lending.","Sumit Malhotra","And just one more for you segment, and I\u2019ll leave it there. It has to do with timing and pace of expense investment. So, on the back of the restructuring charges you took last year, I assume that the pace of the expense growth would be slower, and we certainly saw that the last couple of quarters, a bit of an increase I think around 4% in terms of expenses year-over-year in Q2. As you think about the investment spend that you communicated to us, is the level of expense growth you saw this quarter, more in line with what we should think about or whether specific projects or timing that maybe impact to this pace of expense increase?","Mike Pedersen","Good question. So, if you look at the 4%, about 1% of that was the effect of M&A, so the strategic card alliance from last year and the extra day as result of the leap year, so if we take those out, it\u2019s more like 3%. In addition to that, we had a few issues in the quarter. We moved a call center from Texas to South Carolina, which is obviously not something that\u2019s going to recur, and then there was a bit of timing between Q1 and Q2. I kind of look at it for the first half, our expense growth was 2.4% ex the M&A. And my hope would be that as we look into the second half, it won\u2019t be too different from that; it\u2019ll bump around a little bit quarter by quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robert Sedran from CIBC. Please go ahead.","Robert Sedran","I am not sure if it\u2019s for Riaz or Mike again, but the margin this quarter with the benefit, the full benefit of the Fed move was flat, and the guidance going forward is -- irrespective of what the Fed does, I think it\u2019s going to be flat -- or sorry, even if the Fed doesn\u2019t move, it\u2019s going to be flat. What gives you the confidence that some of the trends that hold back the margin this quarter other than the Fed benefit, are not going to recur in coming quarters?","Mike Pedersen","Again, great question. And, we obviously had the full effect of the rate increase in Q2; so, we\u2019re looking forward from Q2. And so, this is all absent rate increases, to be clear. So simply, what\u2019s going on is that on the one hand, we expect deposit margins to be stable from Q2, again in the absence of rate changes. On the other hand, we are seeing some continued loan margin compression, but it\u2019s less this quarter than it was last quarter, and it was less last quarter than it was the previous quarter. So, the slowing is slowing down, if you will, or the compression is slowing down. And we think the loan margin compression will be offset by essentially mix. And that\u2019s both, the mix of loan origination but also the fact that we expect deposits to grow slower than loans. So effectively, deposit margin is stable and some offsetting stuff in loan margins leading to our expectation that margins will be relatively stable for the remainder of the year.","Robert Sedran","Do you have any insight, Mike, into why the loan compression or loan margin compression is slowing?","Mike Pedersen","Well, I think it\u2019s been going on for a long time. And there is at least two things going on, one is that the farther we get into this trend the less the effect of higher margin stuff rolling off and new stuff coming on at lower margins. But the other thing is that I think the competitive intensity we\u2019re seeing around pricing is slowing a bit, relative to where it was, say a year ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sohrab Movahedi from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sohrab Movahedi","Staying with the topic of NIM, maybe for Teri, in Canada the NIM got this declining trajectory. Do you expect that to continue into 2017?","Teri Currie","So, we would continue to project modest downward pressure to margins, again impacted by the interest rate environment, product mix and competitive factors. We did have in this quarter, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the issue of the recognition of the commissions paid to auto dealers that we talked about last quarter, and year-over-year acquisition related items, the credit mark release from the acquired credit card portfolio last year. So net-net, we still project modest downward pressure and still NII positive.","Sohrab Movahedi","So, modest more or less, in line with the last few quarters, except for this aberration of the last specific quarter?","Teri Currie","Absolutely.","Sohrab Movahedi","And if I can just sneak one in for Mark? Mark, the allowances, whether it\u2019s specific -- is relative to your credit RWA, seems to be around 95 to -- call it plus or minus 95 basis points. If I think or if I look at it over the last 5 to 10 years, that\u2019s probably more like 115 basis points, and it\u2019s probably peaked out in the 140 basis points, coming out of the crisis. When you think about your collectives and the additions that you make and what have you, is that a good way of thinking about where you may actually peak out at? Do you expect to be below trend line on this ratio or do you expect it to revert back up to let\u2019s say the 115-120 basis points average over the last 5 to 10 years?","Mark Chauvin","You\u2019re talking about a trend line for the portfolio. And really where we\u2019re experiencing difficulties in is very small part of the portfolio, being the oil and gas sector. So, I don\u2019t -- and if we look at the credit cycle now through the general portfolio, there is a very strong part -- a good credit loss rates across all the portfolios. And based on our view of the economy over the next year in both of our key markets, we don\u2019t see that changing between now and into the New Year. But on the oil and gas sector, I guess I do see that amount increase. I don\u2019t think of it in terms of RWA. I think where we are now is appropriate I can see further increases over the balance of the year as the issues play out. But, I really can\u2019t give you a number relative to what RWA would be.","Operator","And our next question comes from Meny Grauman from Cormark Securities. Please go ahead.","Meny Grauman","Just wanted to ask about expenses. We\u2019re seeing some competitors come out around with a fresh round of restructuring charges. I am wondering what you see as the potential for further restructuring charges that were helping through the year?","Bharat Masrani","Meny, this is Bharat. As you know, last year, we did go through a restructuring in the Bank, and that was necessary, and we\u2019re happy that that is now complete. And we have been able to improve our productivity and at the same time make the investments that are absolutely necessary in our Bank. So that portion is now for the most part behind us. So, I am happy that we are able to now get the benefits of that. And in my comments, I said we\u2019re going to be quite fixated in our base expenses, but at the same time make sure that we have enough capacity to make the necessary investments. So, that\u2019s how I would see it. You\u2019re asking me do you see future restructuring charges, I mean never is a long time but generally we are pretty happy with where we are and what we\u2019ve been through last year.","Meny Grauman","And if I could just ask quick question on trading, just if you could comment on the composition; it looked a little different than what some of your competitors have been reporting, especially in terms of fixed income and some of the drivers in that business; it didn\u2019t look like you saw as much of a lift as some of the other competitors, although admittedly maybe it\u2019s hard to compare too closely.","Bharat Masrani","Yes. I mean, I think it is hard to compare too closely. It can reflect obviously different mix of businesses that we\u2019re all involved in, both on a product as well as the geography. It\u2019s a short period of time, and we\u2019re just seeing it as well to one quarter has a lots of volatility in the numbers. So, I think we had a strong quarter in trading, basically started that after the middle of February. So, it was a shorter quarter. Having said that, I think it looks pretty stable relative to previous trends, and sort of all I can say on the -- I can speak to our quarter but I really can\u2019t speak to other things, pro forma on a relative basis.","Meny Grauman","So, just in terms of the fixed income business, there\u2019s nothing you\u2019d highlight as being sort of unusual in that business for the quarter?","Bharat Masrani","No, there was a reasonable amount of volatility in credit within the first half. And some of the credit parts of fixed income were negatively impacted in the first quarter and then positively impacted in the second quarter by the movement in credit markets. If you look at fixed income as a pure government business, there\u2019s different drivers to that. That had a better first quarter in our case and not quite a strong second quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Darko Mihelic from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Darko Mihelic","The question is for Riaz, I mean just trying to square something in the numbers, maybe you can help me with this. On page five of the presentation, you show revenues up 7% and expenses up 7%, but when you exclude FX and acquisitions, it\u2019s 4% and 1%. When I do some back of the envelope math using some of the other disclosures on the FX impact, it looks like the acquisitions, namely Nordstrom, I\u2019m presuming had expense growth that was far greater than revenue growth. Am I right in that first?","Riaz Ahmed","No, I don\u2019t think, Darko, that that math would work that way, because to the extent that our strategic cards portfolio is net positive and performing consistently, you wouldn\u2019t see that. I think it\u2019s just in a mix of Canadian dollars versus U.S. dollar revenue versus Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar expenses that you would find the differences.","Darko Mihelic","And just to be crystal clear on that, is the Nordstrom expenses, they are all reported in the U.S. Retail or is some of that in Corporate?","Riaz Ahmed","No, what would happen is that the retailers share of the net cash flow gets reported in Corporate and then it gets -- what\u2019s in the U.S. Retail segment is only our share. So that also gives you a little bit of a variability.","Darko Mihelic","I may have to come back to you offline on that one; I don\u2019t want to get too caught up in the nitty-gritty. The question then for Mark Chauvin with respect to the collective allowance. Mark, is there an appropriate way to think of the allowance? When we\u2019re looking at the allowance and trying to judge the appropriateness of it or the coverage of it, we were suggested that one way to look at it would be to take the collective allowance as a multiple of the specific -- or the specific ACLs you have. Do you think that\u2019s a good measure; is that something that we should get comfort from as we look at it that -- if we look at it that way?","Mark Chauvin","That is somewhat of an effective [ph] way of looking at it. In theory, you tend to look at having coverage of 1.5 to 2 times, thinking that would be an appropriate range.","Darko Mihelic","Your seems to be bigger than that but yours is above three?","Mark Chauvin","Well, I mean it\u2019s through the cycle. We are at a fairly strong part of the credit cycle for the majority of the portfolio. So, you\u2019re seeing lower PCL than what you would see at different parts, right? And it tries to be a true to cycle number. So that\u2019s probably one of the problems with that numbers, when you get through these periods, it looks like it\u2019s too large. But, you have to look at more what normal parts [ph] of the cycle would be and kind of basing on that process. Does that make sense?","Darko Mihelic","I\u2019m not sure because you\u2019ve been adding to it, even though you\u2019ve got\u2026","Mark Chauvin","Well, but when you\u2019re adding to -- we\u2019ve been adding to it, driven largely by a sector being oil and gas. So, these are two things that drive change in collective. It would be volume increases, and we\u2019ve seen a bit of that, but the other is, migration in the portfolio or deterioration in credit quality. And the increases that you\u2019ve seen in the last three quarters are really largely driven off of credit deterioration in the oil and gas sector specific in non-retail and then in consumer credit in the impacted provinces.","Darko Mihelic","So, just to wrap up then, when you think about your forward-looking sort of concept of stressed losses, are you encompassing within that some level of collective allowance or are you specifically referring to\u2026","Mark Chauvin","Well, I\u2019m encompassing in that that the collective allowance will transition into specifics at some point.","Darko Mihelic","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mario Mendonca from TD Securities. Please go ahead.","Mario Mendonca","Good afternoon, two quick questions; first, probably for Mark. Could you help understand or break out the oil & gas exposure between oil and gas? And specifically, like I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s best to break it out; I don\u2019t know if you can look at your total loans and say this is amount that\u2019s supported by gas reserves versus oil reserves or whether you could say this is the exposure to gas only means, but is there some way to help clear this up to me?","Mark Chauvin","Yes. So, the way that we look at it is your oil and gas producer will have a blend generally, but we look at what\u2019s predominantly driving that, whether it\u2019s oil or gas. I would say, it\u2019s very -- we would have very few that would be driven predominantly by gas. It\u2019s normally a blend that\u2019s weighted heavier to oil. And I would say the overwhelming majority of our portfolio would be borrowers that are heavier weighted to oil than to gas.","Mario Mendonca","Looking forward, would it be correct to suggest that losses to the extent there are a lot more losses in oil and gas would be weighted toward gas and that\u2019s one of the reasons why you\u2019re not looking for any material increases in TD\u2019s exposures or TD\u2019s losses?","Mark Chauvin","Well, the analysis that we complete, it\u2019s really an account by account analysis that stresses, both the oil content and the gas content. And that\u2019s what has been used to arrive at the kind of my guidance of 5% to 10% or $100 million to $200 million per year for two years. So, that gas factor is already incorporated in that. But, I would say, if you\u2019re asking, what\u2019s driving it more than anything given that the majority of our borrowers are weighted towards oil, I would say it\u2019s more oil.","Mario Mendonca","Quickly over in domestic retail, the earnings growth has not been strong this year, certainly not this quarter, and I am focusing specifically on retail banking. There are some pretty good explanations for why, not the least of which is the higher taxes associated with mortgage insurance. The question is, once we look beyond this year and the obvious headwinds, does this strike you as a kind of business that can go back to growing at 5% or 4%, like inflation plus type growth or is that type of growth environment behind us now that the Canadian consumers over-leverage; what\u2019s your thinking there?","Teri Currie","So, we remain committed to the medium-term guidance that we gave you in our Investor Day. And I\u2019d say for Personal Banking in particular, we have a number of opportunities that we outlined in Investor Day where we are under share with our primary customer base that we are working hard to leverage, so unsecured lending where we\u2019re growing disproportionately within our risk appetite, business credit card, which we outlined again at the Investor Day and mutual fund would be some examples of that. So, we feel quite confidence that the business over the medium term would still be able to meet the kind of goals that we talked about before.","Mario Mendonca","Those goals, just to fresh memory, were 5% plus?","Teri Currie","Yes.","Mario Mendonca","And your referred to personal specific; is commercial would be similar as well?","Teri Currie","Commercial would be similar.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gabriel Dechaine from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Gabriel Dechaine","Good afternoon. Just a follow-up on Darko\u2019s line of questioning; actually you qualified the increases in the collectives as tied primarily to the oil and gas sector. Why -- we had another bank that took sectoral reserves for the oil and gas exposure. If this is so heavily dependent on the trends in that sector, why is it not a sectoral or what\u2019s the difference in perspective I guess?","Mark Chauvin","Well, I guess my view is the collective allowance methodology appropriately captures the risk in the portfolio. And with it, you don\u2019t need a sectoral, would be I guess the short answer.","Bharat Masrani","That\u2019s the way we look at it; it\u2019s our methodology\u2026","Gabriel Dechaine","Are we splitting hairs here or is it really that different?","Riaz Ahmed","Look Gabriel, under IFRS incurred but not identified, it\u2019s a very defined concept that everybody uses. And then that\u2019s the framework that is used in the way we apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. If you want to interpret them as sectorals, well, sectorals are not really an accounting definition; different people can look at it different ways. So, I think it just depends on how you want to characterize what\u2019s a sectoral but IB&I [ph] is a clearly understood framework.","Gabriel Dechaine","Okay. Turning I guess to more of a growth outlook, during the crisis TD stepped on the gas in commercial lending, specifically commercial real estate, which was effective, that was falling out of favor and that helped you go from number five market share to number two or three, depending on whose slides you are looking at, in the commercial lending in Canada. Are you doing anything different or similar story in the oil and gas sector? Maybe that\u2019s for Bob.","Bob Dorrance","Yes, we have added to -- specifically to our U.S. business. We acquired some loan assets of a bank who was exiting their North American business, was primarily an investment grade loan book, but it gave us diversification into larger E&P, into midstream as well as into refinancing. We subsequently thereafter hired a group of people who had relationships with those companies. So, it\u2019s been a meaningful addition to the U.S. energy business. So, we see a good opportunity to grow that to add, both corporate relationships as well as to introduce products over time. We\u2019ll do it with -- in a measured way and within our risk appetite. We weren\u2019t particularly interested in adding to the non-investment grade part of that, because we didn\u2019t really have -- or we don\u2019t really have as many products that we might offer to those types of clients. But, we\u2019re building out of debt capital markets capabilities or derivatives capabilities or hedging capabilities in that market.","So, we\u2019re looking at the U.S. as a meaningful -- U.S. dollar businesses as meaningful business opportunities for where we can grow not just in the corporate space, but also in the government and agency space, as well as in the investment buy side real money space as well. All those are very good opportunities for us. So, I think they\u2019re coming as a function of what\u2019s happening in the markets broadly.","Bharat Masrani","Just to add to that. I mean generally with the Bank -- this is Bharat, we\u2019ve said that, we are a growth Company; we have the capital; we support our clients; and we want to grow our share where we\u2019ve identified opportunities. And we will continue to do that. And if the current situation presents those opportunities, and if it\u2019s within our risk appetite, we\u2019ll aggressively pursue those. So that\u2019s not only in oil and gas, but in every market in which we operate.","Gabriel Dechaine","But this one in particular more of a one-offs where you see good risk-adjusted spreads, maybe not as broad-based as push we saw in commercial lending few years back?","Bharat Masrani","I would say, we see good opportunities to pursue clients where we can have good relationships with clients, and from there good business opportunities will results and we\u2019ll build the franchise. I think that will reflect what we\u2019ve already invested in states and many of other parts of our business.","Gabriel Dechaine","And just my last one, sneak in there, I understand you\u2019re going through the AIRB transition in the U.S. this year. Should I expect much out of that? I know in the past for Canadian banks making transition has resulted in a pretty noticeable improvement in capital ratios through RWA deflation. Should we expect a similar outcome, maybe a lighter version of it in the U.S. this year?","Mark Chauvin","So, it\u2019s Mark, I\u2019ll address that question. There is numerous applications that you can go through. I mean there is AMA which is operational risk for the enterprise and there is -- for the U.S., it would be for the retail portfolio and for the non-retail portfolio. We\u2019re looking to implement two of those in the third quarter, which is AMA, operational risks for the enterprise and the retail for the U.S. The net impact combined is pretty flat, it\u2019s not much of an impact on CET1.","Gabriel Dechaine","So, your retail credit risk-weighted assets would go down but\u2026","Mark Chauvin","They will go down offset by an increase in the AMA. But the net impact is flat.","Operator","And our next question comes from Peter Routledge from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.","Peter Routledge","Just follow-up on the last one. If you got commercial, would you get some -- if you got commercial U.S. loans on AIRB, would you get some RWA relief?","Mark Chauvin","Peter, it\u2019s Mark. It\u2019s difficult. You don\u2019t know the terms of the approval. You have to work through the process. I don\u2019t think \u2013 clearly, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d see an increase. But I really -- it\u2019s difficult to predict whether there would be any meaningful decrease.","Peter Routledge","Okay, thanks. And then, I mean Bharat or Riaz, just a question on capital more broadly. The Canadian banks seem to be settling in around 10% on CET1. And I presume they are able to do that, because the regulators is happy with that level of capital. But I look globally, and I understand TD is not systematically important on a global basis. I see capital ratios at 12%, and I see leverage ratios much higher than your 3.8%. Why will that condition hold? I mean the skeptic in me says, at some point something has to give, and your capital ratios will have to trend up towards global norms. Why is that perception wrong?","Bharat Masrani","Let me give it a shot and then perhaps ask Riaz to add. Peter, capital, it has to have some relationship with the risk and the balance sheet we run in the markets in which we operate. If you look at TD\u2019s mix of businesses, I can talk more about TD, the type of businesses we do, the type of risks that we manage, and the markets in which we operate. And I think when I look at that, I find from TD\u2019s perspective very comfortable with the capital levels that we have. Obviously, there are banks out there, like you said globally that are much higher. But, I think it is important to see their specific business models, the mix they have, the type of risk they are carrying, and the volatility that they are experiencing. And that probably explains some of those differences. Now, is there a chance sometime down the road that capital regimes would change? Yes, I think so. But, I also feel that we are closer to the end rather than the beginning. And there seems to be more certainty around what those capital requirements are. And yes, maybe, there might be movement here or there, but I see that as a minor event and not as a major event. I don\u2019t know Riaz, if you want to add anything to that?","Riaz Ahmed","No, that was spectacular.","Operator","And our last question comes from Sohrab Movahedi from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sohrab Movahedi","I just wanted to clarify, Teri, when you had the Investor Today, you talked about medium-term growth up plus 7%; did you just say 5% or did you say 7% to an earlier question?","Teri Currie","What I just said was I agreed to 5% plus.","Sohrab Movahedi","But, at the Investor Day it was at 7% plus.","Teri Currie","We haven\u2019t changed our prior guidance for wealth and insurance as well, right, as the Canadian retail number.","Sohrab Movahedi","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference call back to Mr. Bharat Masrani for closing remarks.","Bharat Masrani","Thank you, operator. And thanks everyone for joining us. I know it\u2019s been a tough day for you folks with the three banks that announced. And I assume that means a lot of work in one day. So, I really appreciate you\u2019re taking the time and great engagement with the questions that I\u2019ve heard. I would just say, once again, pleased with our numbers. We continue to deliver growth. We are a growth Company. And I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues around the world, 80,000 strong, who delivered for the shareholders once again. So, thanks for that. And we will see you in the next 90 days. Thank you."],"23280":["The Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) Q1 2018 Earnings Call March  1, 2018  1:30 PM ET","Executives","Gillian Manning - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Bharat B.

Welcome to TD Bank Group's First Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Gillian Manning, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gillian Manning - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to TD Bank Group first quarter 2018 investor presentation. My name is Gillian Manning, and I am the Head of Investor Relations at the Bank.","We will begin today's presentation with remarks from Bharat Masrani, the Bank's CEO; after which Riaz Ahmed, the Bank's CFO, will present our first quarter operating results. Ajai Bambawale, Chief Risk Officer, will then offer comments on credit quality, after which we will invite questions from prequalified analysts and investors on the phone. Also, present today to answer your questions are Teri Currie, Group Head, Canadian Personal Banking; Greg Braca, President and CEO, TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank; and Bob Dorrance, Group Head, Wholesale Banking.","Please turn to slide 2. At this time, I would like to caution our listeners that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that there are risks, that actual results could differ materially from what is discussed and that certain material factors or assumptions were applied in making these forward-looking statements.","Any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation represent the views of management and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank's financial position, objectives and priorities, and anticipated financial performance. Forward-looking statements may not be appropriate for other purposes.","I would also like to remind listeners that the Bank uses non-GAAP financial measures to arrive at adjusted results to assess each of its businesses and to measure overall Bank performance. The Bank believes that adjusted results provide readers with a better understanding of how management views the Bank's performance. Bharat will be referring to adjusted results in his remarks. Additional information on items of note, the Bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q1 2018 Report to Shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat.","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Thank you, Gillian. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Q1 was a great quarter for TD and a strong start to 2018. Earnings were up 15% from a year ago to CAD 2.9 billion, and EPS rose 17% to CAD 1.56. All of our businesses performed well as the investments we've made to serve our customers even better drove higher levels of client activity and an improved customer experience. We also continue to benefit from a favorable operating environment.","Our earnings power is evident in our robust balance sheet metrics. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.6%, including 120-basis-point impact from the Basel I floor. We will fully recapture that capital in Q2 when OSFI implement its new transitional floor. The floor is not expected to constrain TD for the foreseeable future. That puts our pro forma CET1 ratio at 11.8%, a level that affords us a considerable flexibility to deploy capital. Our leverage and liquidity ratios also remained strong.","Reflecting these good fundamentals, we declared a CAD 0.07 dividend increase today. This brings our dividend per share to CAD 0.67 a quarter, up 12% or a five-year annual growth rate of 10%. Overall, I'm very pleased with our Q1 results. We delivered double-digit earnings growth and strengthened our capital base, while continuing to invest in our digital transformation. One such investment was our acquisition of Layer 6, which we announced in January.","We are very excited about this acquisition which brings some of the top AI talent in the world to TD and a platform that is globally recognized for its recommendation system. Layer 6's capabilities and know-how will supercharge our ability to embed AI across the Bank, helping us better leverage data to enhance the customer experience, drive better business decisions and improve efficiency. Only two months in, the Layer 6 team and the TD colleagues are working on a number of exciting potential use cases. I look forward to sharing more details in future quarters.","Another notable development this quarter was the passage of comprehensive tax reform in the U.S. This also positions TD very well for continued growth and investment. Reflecting the reduction in the federal statutory corporate tax rate, we recorded a one-time write-down of deferred tax assets and certain other investments which lowered our reported earnings this quarter. We also saw a roughly proportional decline in our U.S. Retail Bank's effective tax rate. Based on our current assessment, we expect this quarter's rate to approximate the run rate for the year in the U.S. Retail Bank.","We also benefit from U.S. tax reform through our ownership stake in TD Ameritrade. On their Q1 analyst call in January, TD Ameritrade raised their guidance for 2018 earnings by about 20% to incorporate the effects of a lower tax rate. All told, the implications of U.S. tax reform are significant for TD and for the customers and communities we serve across our U.S. Retail franchise. We are taking steps to amplify those benefits by reinvesting some of the savings across the Bank.","This could result in an increase of up to 1% in total Bank expense growth on a full year basis. We are making investments in increased pay and benefits for our people, in tools and resources that will enable them to deliver more legendary customer experiences, and in initiatives to support the places where we live and work, because our success is their success. Our purpose is to enrich the lives of our customers, our colleagues, and our communities, and it is at the heart of our vision to be The Better Bank.","I will now turn to our segment results. Q1 was a very strong quarter for Canadian Retail with earnings up 12% on good revenue growth and positive operating leverage. Our flagship retail franchise delivered good results across the board, reflecting the benefits of ongoing investments to optimize our network and product suite and enhance our advisory capabilities. In personal and commercial banking, we had record real estate secured lending originations as we continue to execute on our strategy to grow our FlexLine HELOC book by winning new clients and extending our relationship with existing ones.","And we built on our leadership position in the electronic payment space with strong growth in the number of users and leading market share in our e-transfer feature. This critical functionality will help us widen our lead with active mobile users and demonstrates our success in translating legendary into the digital space. Our wealth business performed very well this quarter as investments we've made in our people and platforms continue to pay dividends.","We generated more than CAD 10 billion in net asset growth and experienced record trading volumes. All of our channels performed well. In direct investing, the trading outages we experienced in early January caused disruption for our customers. This is not the standard of service we aim to deliver, but I'm pleased to say the issue was quickly stabilized and we have since launched a new end-to-end online account opening platform that will enable investors to begin trading within 24 hours, greatly improving the customer experience.","In our advice channels, we continue to take share and are expanding our distribution capabilities with the addition of more private bankers, financial planners and investment advisors. And TD Asset Management maintained its number one position in Benefits Canada's ranking of institutional pension fund managers for the seventh year in a row. In our insurance business, we are reaping the benefits of the investments we made over the past year with the launch of our general insurance platform transformation in Alberta last fall reducing wait times and helping customers get advice and quotes more easily.","Turning to the U.S., our U.S. Retail Bank generated earnings of US$672 million this quarter, up 30% from a year ago. We had double-digit revenue growth and delivered over 400 basis points of operating leverage. With the increased contribution from our investment in TD Ameritrade, U.S. Retail segment earnings climbed 35%, driving our return on equity to 12%.","In Canadian dollar terms, U.S. Retail segment earnings crossed the CAD 1 billion threshold for the first time. Our U.S. Retail business is on a strong footing. We are growing within our risk appetite. We continue to add customers and take share. We are leveraging our scale to deliver efficiencies and we are seizing the opportunities created by a favorable operating environment to accelerate investment.","You will see more of that in the coming quarters as we continue to invest in frontline staff and enhance our digital offerings to provide customers with faster and more seamless interactions. These investments are already bearing fruit with active digital users up 9% and mobile deposits up 26% from a year ago. Rounding out our businesses, our Wholesale Bank performed very well in Q1. Earnings were up 4% on higher corporate lending activity and TD Securities continued its record of leading some of the quarter's most significant transactions.","We advised Thomson Reuters on its announced partnership with the Blackstone Group to advance its Financial & Risk business and drive the growth of Legal, Tax & Accounting and Regulatory business. When closed, the deal will represent the largest corporate carve-out and leveraged buyout in Canadian history. The transaction demonstrates our leadership in the communications, media and technology sector, and is important in building our M&A franchise.","We were joint lead on five sustainability bonds during the quarter with a combined value of over CAD 3.5 billion, including CAD 1 billion Province of Ontario Green Bond and US$750 million BNG Issue. And we won back-to-back mandates from Ford Motor Company, active bookrunner on their US$1.8 billion loan ABS in November and the US$2 billion multi-tranche seven-year offering in January. This speaks to the value of the investments we have made to grow our U.S. dollar business as well as our ability to win clients by leveraging capabilities and partnerships across the entire bank, One TD in action.","One quarter into fiscal 2018, we have much to be pleased about. All of our businesses are performing well. The macro environment in Canada and the U.S. remains supportive. And developments over the past quarter have provided us with additional upside. While there are risks on the horizon, if these positive conditions persist, adjusted earnings growth for the full-year may exceed our medium-term targets.","To wrap up, I'm extremely pleased with our first quarter results. They highlight the power of our diversified model which offers a solid foundation for long-term growth and enables us to thrive through short-term volatility. From this position of strength, we can keep our focus where it belongs, on our customers. It is a privilege to serve them and help them move forward with confidence in their financial lives. I would like to thank our 85,000 employees for their commitment and dedication to this purpose. I look forward to working with you this year as we continue our journey to make TD The Better Bank.","With that, I'll turn it over to Riaz.","Riaz E. Ahmed - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Thank you, Bharat. Please turn to slide 4. This quarter, the Bank reported earnings of CAD 2.4 billion and EPS of CAD 1.24. We incurred a net CAD 453 million charge relating to U.S. tax reform. Excluding this charge and other items, adjusted earnings were CAD 2.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year and adjusted EPS was CAD 1.56, up 17%.","Results were strong across all our businesses. Revenue increased 3% or 4% on an adjusted basis, reflecting volume growth and higher margins in the Canadian and U.S. Retail segments. Credit losses increased 9% year-over-year and this quarter reflect IFRS 9 methodology. This increase was largely in the Corporate segment which holds the retailer program partners' share of PCL for the strategic card portfolio which is offset in corporate non-interest expenses. Expenses were relatively flat in the quarter.","Please turn to slide 5. Canadian Retail segment net income was CAD 1.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth and good operating leverage. Our wealth business performed particularly well this quarter with net income up 27%, driven by growth in wealth assets and higher direct investing trading volumes. Revenue rose 7% on loan and deposit volume growth, rising margins and higher fee-based revenue in the banking and wealth businesses.","Total loan growth was 6% year-over-year with increases in both personal and business lending volumes. And deposits increased by 7%, reflecting growth in the business deposits and core checking and savings accounts. Margin was 2.88%, up 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 6 basis points year-over-year, reflecting rising interest rates.","Credit losses increased 11% quarter-over-quarter. PCL impaired decreased by 3% in personal banking, primarily reflecting a change in policy regarding the timing of loss recognition in the indirect auto portfolio. PCL performing, which was previously recorded in the Corporate segment, was CAD 33 million, primarily due to the impact of forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions under the expected credit loss methodology.","Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.27%, up 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter remaining at cyclical lows. Expenses increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting restructuring costs across a number of businesses, higher employee-related expenses, including revenue-based variable expenses in the wealth business and general business growth.","Please turn to slide 6. U.S. Retail net income was $751 million in U.S. dollars on a reported basis, and $809 million on an adjusted basis, up 35% year-over-year. The U.S. Retail Bank earned $669 million in U.S. dollars on a reported basis, up 29% year-over-year. The strong result was driven by 10% revenue growth, reflecting higher interest rates and volume growth, as well as a lower corporate tax rate.","Average loan volumes increased by 5%, reflecting growth in the personal and business customer segments and deposit growth was 8%, driven by higher personal deposits and a 15% increase in sweep deposits from TD Ameritrade, due mainly to the Scottrade transaction. Net interest margin was 3.19%, up 1 basis point quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher deposit margins and partially offset by lower taxable equivalent revenue due to U.S. tax reform.","NIM has risen 16 basis points year-over-year. PCL increased 20% quarter-over-quarter. PCL \u2013 impaired was US$148 million, down US$12 million, due to lower provisions in the U.S. commercial portfolios. PCL \u2013 performing was US$47 million, up US$44 million, primarily reflecting seasonal trends in the credit card and auto portfolios, elevated by balances migrating to Stage 2 where they're measured based on a lifetime expected credit loss.","This quarter, we have provided a PCL ratio for the U.S. Retail Bank excluding the PCL related to our partner share of the strategic cards portfolio. This ratio was 52 basis points in the first quarter. Expenses increased 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments in business initiatives and employees as well as volume growth, partially offset by productivity savings. The U.S. Retail Bank's effective tax rate this quarter was approximately 11% compared with 18% in the first quarter of 2017, resulting in a US$55 million benefit this quarter.","We expect the tax rate to remain around this level for the balance of 2018 implying a full-year benefit of around US$225 million. The contribution from our investment in TD Ameritrade decreased by US$1 million year-over-year on a reported basis and increased 65% adjusted for TD's share of the charges related to the Scottrade acquisition. Segment ROE was 11.2% on a reported basis and 12% on an adjusted basis, up from 9.1% a year ago. Please turn to slide 7.","Net income for Wholesale was CAD 278 million, reflecting higher revenue and lower expenses, partially offset by a lower net recovery of credit losses. Revenue increased 2%, reflecting higher corporate lending, partially offset by lower equity underwriting. We recorded a net PCL recovery of CAD 7 million in the quarter, due to credit risk improvement in the oil and gas sector, and there was no PCL \u2013 impaired in the quarter. Non-interest expenses were relatively flat for the quarter.","Please turn to slide 8. The Corporate segment reported a net loss of CAD 634 million this quarter. The higher loss is primarily due to the impact of U.S. tax reform in the current quarter and a lower contribution from other items.","Please turn to slide 9. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.6% at the end of the first quarter, down 9 basis points from the fourth quarter. We had strong organic capital generation this quarter, which added 38 basis points to our capital position. This was offset by a decline of approximately 12 basis points as a result of the write-down of our deferred tax assets due to U.S. tax reform and 35 basis points in RWA growth. The increase in risk-weighted assets was driven primarily by the Basel I floor, including 15 basis points due to adoption of IFRS 9, as noted in our Q4 disclosure.","Effective in the second quarter, the Basel I floor will be replaced by a new transitional floor which we do not expect to be binding for TD for some time. Pro forma for such change, the Bank's CET1 capital ratio as of January 31, 2018, would have been 120 basis points higher. Our leverage ratio was 4% and our liquidity coverage ratio was 122%.","I will now turn the call over to Ajai.","Ajai Bambawale - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Thank you, Riaz, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 10. Credit quality remained strong in the first quarter with stable trends across the Bank's credit portfolios. For the quarter, gross impaired loan formations were CAD 1.26 billion or 20 basis points, remaining at cyclically low levels and stable on both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. There were no new formations in the Wholesale portfolio.","Please turn to slide 11. Gross impaired loans ended the quarter at CAD 3 billion, stable at 49 basis points quarter-over-quarter and down 8 basis points year-over-year. Canadian Retail gross impaired loans were stable at 21 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Gross impaired loans in our U.S. Retail portfolio were down CAD 55 million quarter-over-quarter due to a CAD 94 million impact of foreign exchange, offset by an increase due to an IFRS 9 methodology change and seasonal trends.","Please turn to slide 12. As indicated in previous quarters, U.S. strategic cards PCLs are reported on a net basis for segment reporting, including only the Bank's contractual portion of credit losses whereas the partners' share is reported in the Corporate segment. For the purpose of the credit slides, we continue to report gross losses to better reflect portfolio credit quality. PCLs in the quarter was CAD 698 million or 45 basis points, up 6 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 3 basis points year-over-year, aligned with our expectations.","The year-over-year increase in PCL reflects volume growth, seasoning and mix in the U.S. credit card and indirect auto portfolios and a reduction in recoveries in the Wholesale Banking segment. This is offset by a decrease in the Canadian Retail segment as a result of a one-time impact from a change in policy relating to the timing of loss recognition in the indirect auto portfolio and a higher U.S. commercial allowance increase in the prior year.","The quarter-over-quarter increase in PCL is due to usual seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card and auto portfolios where the first quarter typically represents the high watermark, driven by holiday spending, followed by a subsequent decline in the second quarter as customers catch up with their payments, and the introduction of the ECL methodology under IFRS 9 that I'll speak about on the next slide.","Please turn to slide 13. I would now like to take just a moment to discuss the impact of IFRS 9 on the performing portfolio this quarter. Recall that under the IFRS 9 framework, the key drivers of change in an expected loss are volume, credit quality and forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions used in modeling. When credit risk migration occurs from Stage 1 to Stage 2, provisions increase from 12 months to a lifetime expected credit loss.","In this quarter, the $86 million increase in our performing PCL is impacted by increased sensitivity to risk migration relating to seasonality in the U.S. Retail portfolio and forward-looking downside macroeconomic assumptions and the effect on the Canadian Retail portfolio. For the balance of the year and assuming economic conditions remain stable, our expectation is that credit losses will moderate over the next quarter and PCL should remain in the range of 40 basis points to 45 basis points.","Let me conclude my remarks with just a brief summary of my key points. The increase to PCL is in line with our expectations. Credit quality continues to be strong across the Bank's credit portfolios and we remain well-positioned for continued growth.","With that, operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to start with obviously significant capital build as you move to the transitional floor One, I was wondering if you could remind us in terms of what's the target level that you want to operate the Bank sort of in this transitional floor environment relative to the 11.8%. And then in terms of how quickly do you expect to sort of bring that capital ratio lower?","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Yes. So, Ebrahim, this is Bharat. I think we've talked about this previously and I'd say the message is not changed as much. As you know, in our capital deployment framework, we start with what level of capital do we need to support our businesses by way of risk-weight assets, et cetera. We also look at if there are any investments we have to make in order to accelerate some of our capabilities or some gaps that we need to fill. We also look at obviously acquisitions on an ongoing basis. And then if we exhaust all of those items, then obviously we look at perhaps even considering a buyback and we've done that over the past few years a couple of times. So, that's our approach in how we deploy capital, how we think about capital deployment.","On your point on what are we targeting, I mean, we do run, I feel, a low risk strategy generally and, therefore, are always comfortable with the capital levels we run. And that has been the case over many, many years. I think currently there is still some uncertainty. You're looking at Basel III plus, call it 3.5, IV. As to what Canada might do with respect to when those rules may apply, there's some uncertainty around that. So we'll see how this plays out. This Basel I floor arrangement only got announced quite recently. So, we'll sort of work through what makes sense here. But there's lot of uncertainties out there that we want to make sure are taken into account as we think about capital on an ongoing basis.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. And just sort of following up on that, Bharat, you've talked previously about potential for card portfolio acquisitions or a bank acquisition in the Southeast U.S. Just in terms of \u2013 if you could talk about the opportunity set on those both metrics. And particularly as you think about a bank acquisition, what are we sort of waiting for in terms of \u2013 are the valuation mismatch too significant where it's a big hurdle to go through or are we waiting for better regulatory sort of clarity that would allow you to sort of pull the trigger there?","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","So, Ebrahim, as you rightly point out, we have talked about it. There are certain sectors that are more attractive to us from an acquisition perspective. The card side, especially the partnership deals we have, we're very happy as to how they work for us. And if they were the right opportunities within our risk appetite, then, of course, we will look at them seriously. And we continue to do that. There are opportunities out there but we want to make sure they are the right ones for TD. And as a Bank, we want to remain disciplined. Just because we may have capital flexibility that does not mean we will be chasing acquisitions that do not make sense for the Bank.","I think with respect to bank acquisitions, again, yes, the value expectations sometimes don't meet our requirements, but that doesn't mean that we don't look at opportunities right through our footprint. The Southeast is particularly attractive given our aspirations to accelerate our growth in that very attractive market for us. We already have a great franchise in the Southeast of the U.S. It's a growing franchise. But we think we can have more locations, more customers, and we'd like a higher level of scale than what we have today.","So we'll keep on searching, but we want to make sure we do a \u2013 if we go ahead, the acquisition has to make strategic sense, financial sense, and operational sense for us, and culture and risk appetite matter as much as those other metrics. So those are the types of things we look at. And then, of course, there are opportunistic players out there. If things were to present themselves that makes sense for the Bank, then we would look at those very seriously as well.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. It makes sense. Thanks a lot.","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Meny Grauman with Cormark Securities.","Meny Grauman - Cormark Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Bharat, you mentioned that you're going to reinvest some of the tax savings that you're going to benefit from in the U.S. And just a clarification, is that reinvestment already included in the CAD 300 million run rate annual benefit that TD's expected to get?","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","The benefit is before what we spend in expenses and so just to clarify that point. I think the investments we want to make, obviously, is to make sure that we are investing in our people, we are investing in creating capabilities to enhance the customer experience that we would like, and, of course, to accelerate any digital opportunities that may present themselves. So we're working hard to make sure that these investments are accretive to the Bank from an experience, customer perspective as well as for the Bank financially.","Meny Grauman - Cormark Securities, Inc.","So if we think of it on a net basis in terms of dollar value how much of that CAD 300 million do you expect to, I guess, come down to the bottom line once you do that reinvestment?","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","I think in my comments I said we expect our expenses because of this particular initiative to go up by approximately 1%. It's hard to pin down a particular dollar number, Meny, because we are already into Q2. Some of these initiatives do take time. So, we'll see where it comes out. But, overall, we feel good about what the comprehensive tax reform in the U.S. does for us. This provides us with lots of flexibility. And so, we want to make sure that where appropriate we do take advantage of that flexibility.","Meny Grauman - Cormark Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And then just want to ask about the efficiency ratio in U.S. Retail. A very good result, by my numbers, I think, it's even a record. So, just some perspective. Where do you expect that number to be through 2018 and maybe a little bit longer-term target, if you could refresh that?","Gregory B. Braca - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Sure, Meny. This is Greg Braca, so good afternoon. Obviously, we've worked very hard in bringing that number down from the well into the 60s not that long ago. And, obviously, this was a record number from an efficiency standpoint at under 55% and we feel quite good about that. And we've been working awfully hard at this over the last few years and it goes to productivity initiatives, digital initiatives and various end-to-end platforms we've been investing in.","Obviously, from quarter-to-quarter, depending on expenses and programs we're reinvesting in, as you will have seen in 2017 and the previous year, the number will jump around a little bit. But the long-term trend has been downward. And we continue to reinvest and focus on expenses that really do change the Bank and not just running the Bank day-to-day. So, look, our focus very much is on employee investment, digital, new platforms and we think the trend has been quite positive and we'll continue to invest in those.","Meny Grauman - Cormark Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Nick Stogdill with Credit Suisse.","Nick Stogdill - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Hi. Good afternoon. First, another one for Bharat on the capital deployment. We've discussed the opportunities that TD is looking at for, I guess, some time. Is there anything you can add on how the dialog has changed given the certainty we now have around U.S. tax reform? Was that an impediment to acquisitions last year as companies or businesses waited to see how that played out? And anything you can add to how it's going this year?","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Obviously, the economic backdrop is more certain today than perhaps it might have been previously. So, people seem to feel more confident. I think your specific point on tax reform, I mean, that is still very recent. And I wouldn't want to use that to say that discussions have changed in any material way. But we, as a Bank, as you know \u2013 I mean last year when we looked at this opportunity with TD Ameritrade, with Scottrade, we thought it made a lot of sense and obviously acted very quickly because it made sense for TD Ameritrade as well as for TD Bank. So, we are obviously looking at opportunities in the market, but it's hard to pinpoint how the dialogs might have changed over the recent past. It depends on circumstance, depends on the type of business and certainly depends on geography.","Nick Stogdill - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Okay. Thank you. And then for Teri or Riaz, on the HELOC growth in Canada, up 16% from last year, you've talked about the strong take up of the FlexLine product. And my question is on how much of the year-over-year growth of the CAD 10 billion represents the part of the HELOC that has a fixed amortizing component and how much is driven by growth in the revolving piece? And I'm just trying to understand how much of the growth is more mortgage like.","Theresa L. Currie - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Sure. It's Teri. Thanks for the question. So, again, this has been a strategy to really as we've evolved the product and made it more competitive in a credible mortgage substitute to actually offer FlexLine as a mortgage substitute to the right TD customers more flexible and convenient for them, more profitable and stickier for us. To answer your question, if you looked at mortgage plus the amortizing HELOC, the growth of those in combination exceeds the growth of the portfolio on average overall. So, that implies actually that the revolving components of HELOC are declining somewhat in the portfolio.","Nick Stogdill - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Okay. So, the 16% year-over-year HELOC growth, can you be a little more specific maybe on how much is the amortizing piece versus the revolver I guess? Just...","Theresa L. Currie - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","It's pretty much exclusively amortizing is the best way to think about it.","Nick Stogdill - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Exclusively amortizing. Okay. And then of the CAD 76 billion in HELOCs, can you give us a sense on how much would be again amortizing of that part of it?","Theresa L. Currie - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Since we only in 2012 and beyond started to actually improve the product, it will take time for this to work through the portfolio but definitely the lean of the portfolio is going more towards the amortizing portion.","Nick Stogdill - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Okay. Regardless the growth is in amortizing. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gabriel Dechaine with National Bank Financial.","Gabriel Dechaine - National Bank Financial, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. I also have a question on mortgages and HELOCs or this is called RESL I guess. So, you're not the only bank to talk about mortgage growth or the competitive dynamics in mortgage growth being an inhibitor to margin expansion that's eating away a little bit at it. Are you just willing to take that because we're expecting growth to slow down, so might as well get the growth while you can?","Theresa L. Currie - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","I think when we think about the business that we put on the books we are obviously quite conscious of that being accretive and giving us the kind of returns that we're looking for. And so, the competitive nature of pricing has definitely had an impact on margins overall as you mentioned. I think we're feeling very good about the growth of the portfolio overall, about our target of mid-single-digit total proprietary RESL growth going forward and think that that helps us to continue to put good risk adjusted business on the books at the right level for the growth in the economy that we see going forward.","Gabriel Dechaine - National Bank Financial, Inc.","I'm actually looking at this in a positive way. You might take mortgages are now tighter spread but if customers, borrowers are stickier because of B20 a few years from now, you'll only have more pricing power, so we could see a positive margin trend develop. Is that not reasonable?","Theresa L. Currie - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","I think in combination with the comments on HELOC being the sort of where we're going with our growth more strategically, again, good for our customers for flexibility and convenience. That is definitely a stickier product overall. So, in combination with your comment I'd say yes.","Gabriel Dechaine - National Bank Financial, Inc.","Okay. Then my last and also mortgage related. Can you talk \u2013 and this is for Teri and for Bob, separate question, but related. Your participation in the mortgage broker channel, I believe, you've been growing. How do you see that developing over the next few years? Are you emphasizing proprietary channels over the broker channel? How do you view that? And then, Bob, like many other banks like at the mortgage desk you buy mortgages from third-party originators. Is there any change in that activity you're foreseeing?","Theresa L. Currie - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","So I'll kick off. It's Teri. So, we're looking at the channels of choice for our customers going forward. So we've been building our digital mortgage origination capability and we will continue to do that. We've been investing in tools and capabilities for our branch network. We've continued to add to our face-to-face Mobile Mortgage sales force specialist. In fact, we added 95 in the quarter and we're up 185 year-over-year in the quarter. And we continue to do business with brokers that we've on-boarded to our program. As it relates to brokers, there are a segment of customers who choose to go to mortgage brokers. And for the right broker and the right business, we want to do that business for those customers and onboard them to TD as well.","Gabriel Dechaine - National Bank Financial, Inc.","So, if you had to pick one that's...","Bob Dorrance - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Yeah. I would say, Gabriel, that we continue to monitor the third-party originators. And as they went their way through the changes in the marketplace, look at means by which we may continue to help fund them.","Gabriel Dechaine - National Bank Financial, Inc.","No change. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sumit Malhotra with Scotia Capital.","Sumit Malhotra - Scotiabank","Thanks. Good afternoon. First, I wanted to go to Ajai. You list here your provision for credit loss ratio in the quarter at 45 basis points. When you provided a range of 40 basis points to 45 basis points, was that your expectation for the balance of the year or were you talking about Q2 specifically?","Ajai Bambawale - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","That's for the balance of the year. I do expect, as I said in my prepared remarks, that, in Q2, I expect PCLs to go down because of the seasonal element to PCL that we saw in Q1. So I'm saying 40 basis points to 45 basis points for the year.","Sumit Malhotra - Scotiabank","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. I guess a different way to think about it, maybe more to get your perspective on where credit trends stand. Firstly, some of your peers as we've been going through the IFRS 9 disclosure over the last week, some of them have expressed their view that thinking about provisions on specifically for the impaired portfolio which for you guys was around CAD 560 million. So CAD 140 million less is maybe a greater or a better reflection of where underlying credit quality trends stand.","Do you subscribe to that view? Do you think looking at the provisions in the impaired book gives us a better sense of the health of your portfolio? And then, maybe more specifically \u2013 and since I wanted to get your take being relatively new in the position. Especially as you look across your portfolio and some of these areas where you have some seasonal bumps, credit cards and auto, what is your view on the underlying health of these books and are you seeing any credit trends that you're concerned about right now?","Ajai Bambawale - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","So, let me let me answer the first part. I think focusing on impaired and seeing what's happening in impaired is important because it tells you the current state of credit quality. But I won't ignore the performing piece quite frankly. I always think about total PCL and to reflect on what's driving total PCL, because there are different components to the other aspects of PCL which are performing, which include volume, which include credit quality, which now include changes in macroeconomic assumption. So I think impaired is important, but I wouldn't lose focus on total PCL.","And then the second part of your question on credit card and auto, so keep in mind, for the quarter, it is really seasonality. I'll come back to the year, but for the quarter it's seasonality. So what happens with credit cards is the balances go up as customers draw down. You do see some increase in delinquency dollars as well. And then it comes back. In auto, it's less about balances. It's more about delinquencies. And then we do see that delinquencies come off.","But if you look year-over-year and you reflect on some of the comments that Greg has made in the past and Mike, we have indicated that, in auto, we are taking a little more risk. So we are taking a little more near-prime risks. So as we take on that near-prime risk and that book matures, so because of I would say mix and also a seasoning of that book, you are seeing elevated losses in auto. But the issue really is, is it expected or is it unexpected? And my view is whatever is occurring is expected.","And then similarly on credit cards, there is a bit of change in mix occurring primarily because of strategic cards where we have more private label exposures. Private label tends to be higher. So, again, because of mix, we're seeing slightly higher credit losses. Two important points. One is that it is expected. Second, which Riaz pointed out was, we're not taking the entire share of the losses here. We only have a fraction of the share. So, I hope that's helpful.","Sumit Malhotra - Scotiabank","That's very thorough. Thank you for that detail.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Sedran with CIBC Capital (sic) [World] (00:45:33) Markets.","Robert Sedran - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. As thorough as that was, I actually have a follow-up on that, if you don't mind. I'm just wondering, to the extent that some of the increase in Stage 2 is seasonal, when you suggest that provisions are going to be down sequentially, is that because you expect Stage 1, 2 to be basically zero, all else equal, or for there to perhaps be a reversal as some of that seasonal stuff gets cleared up.","Ajai Bambawale - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Yes. I think it's a reversal. So, what's going to happen is the balances will come down. The delinquencies will come down. So, some of that will move back to Stage 1. But there should be a pickup because of the difference effectively going from lifetime back to 12 months.","Robert Sedran - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Understood. Thank you. I have a question for Greg actually. Lots of good things that Riaz and Bharat said about the U.S., so, allow me to ask one that perhaps is not as good. Business loan growth continues to slow. You kind of were bucking the industry trends for a while. And it feels like we're pulling back a little closer to industry growth rates. And business deposits are actually down quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. Can you talk a little bit about the business bank and what some of the trends are? I guess we were perhaps hoping that with tax reform we'd see some acceleration in some of these things, and I'm wondering if you can talk to that a little bit.","Gregory B. Braca - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Sure, Robert. And thanks for the question. Over the last five to six quarters now, we've been decidedly calling out that we've expected \u2013 I'll just start with business loans \u2013 from some of the higher and very lofty growth rates that we would have had back in 2016 and maybe even the early part of 2017. And for a number of years, as we were growing out the corporate and specialty bank in the U.S. and some of the other commercial businesses, we would have talked about it in a way that we weren't really in our natural size of share for a bank of our size and capability and coverage throughout the U.S. And we obviously had very strong double-digit growth in commercial and C&I very broadly over a number of years.","So, first, we've been calling out going back five or six quarters that some of that growth inherently will begin to come down. And then, two, over the last 12 to 15 months, and I know Bob's business has seen it, we've seen it in the U.S., there's been a decided turnoff of M&A activities. All of the banks in the U.S. have become a little bit more cautious this long in the cycle around things like commercial real estate, speculative real estate and even the areas that we play in. We would have seen less deals come to market. And then a few other things over the last year, I think, are awfully important to call out. That our customers are sitting on a lot of cash. And one, we're seeing a pay-down in utilization rates lower than they've been in many years from a drawn revolving credit standpoint; and two, access to capital markets have just been white-hot.","The bond market's been quite vibrant. And in the U.S., there's been a return to commercial paper for short-term fundings. So, there's been a number of things going on. But what I would call out is our commercial growth still generally outpaces many of our peers in the 1% to 2% range. We're still growing 3%-plus a little bit. And over the last quarter, we are seeing signs within the markets that many of our customers are talking about financing activities and the like, and we'll see if this plays out in the balance of 2018. As I move to the deposit piece of it, it really does go to the broader question around betas and how much do you want to chase high-rate investments.","And the beta environment for most banks have been quite benign for the first couple of rate hikes over the last four. Over the last couple, particularly the commercial and corporates have become more keen paying attention to what are we doing with all of this cash and liquidity on our balance sheets and we're obviously seeing that money look for a variety of options. But the key point from things that we look at is while we've seen cash and deposits slow down on the commercial side, we've also seen some strategic views on our end where if folks were looking for very high returns, we weren't going to chase the hot money. And our focus, like it's always been, has been on core DDA and treasury management relationships where we continue to perform quite strong.","Robert Sedran - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","So, the margin outlook therefore given all of that, I guess, relatively stable?","Gregory B. Braca - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Yeah. Given all things and the way we see the environment in the U.S. in particular, it's a stable environment. Obviously, the forecast has been for another few rate hikes. We do think overall for the margin story this bodes well for even somewhat of an increasing margin story.","Robert Sedran - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mario Mendonca with TD Securities.","Mario Mendonca - TD Securities, Inc.","A bit of a technical thing. Greg, if you could go back to the U.S. margin and offer how much was the margin impacted in the quarter from the U.S. tax reform?","Gregory B. Braca - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Yeah. So obviously, as Riaz called out, we were up 1 basis point but there are a number of things, as you know, that go into margin. And I would just call out the reduction in the tax rate hurt us by a couple of points just because of the new value of what tax-exempt loans and securities would be on our book of business. And the other side to that would be we have generally seen a declining value of LPs over the last several months and that would have also hurt the margin story.","Mario Mendonca - TD Securities, Inc.","So, about 2 basis points. And going forward, clearly, the effect is still there but you wouldn't expect the negative effect on margin to become exacerbated next quarter? We'd just continue to see that 2 basis points?","Gregory B. Braca - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","I think that's generally true more or less.","Mario Mendonca - TD Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gregory B. Braca - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","And then obviously there's other things that we've always talked about, what is the mix of the business, loans versus deposits, what's the growth rates. So, obviously there's more to it but generally that's true.","Mario Mendonca - TD Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sohrab Movahedi with BMO Capital Markets.","Sohrab Movahedi - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hey. Thank you. Bharat, you in your comments around your capital levels and the like talked about a variety of uncertainties out there. Are these economic, operational or regulatory type of uncertainties you're talking about?","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Talking more economic and geopolitical type and regulatory. Those would be the ones that I would highlight. I think on the regulatory side, as you know, yes, we got more clarification on the output floors from Basel but there's still some uncertainty around when those rules might be applicable to Canada or what might be Canada's view on timing of some of those floors. Obviously we await that guidance.","I think in the economic side, lots of things at play. We are bankers, Sohrab. We like to be prudent. We've had a long expansionary cycle here. So, I guess, theoretically, we are closer to the downturn than we were a quarter ago. Those would be the type of things you worry about. And then there are lots of uncertainties from a global perspective that has impact on rates, has impact on sentiment and all those put together creates uncertainty of some kind.","Sohrab Movahedi - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","So just to build on that, this uncertainty or the prudence or however you want to think about it, is that impacting risk appetite? I mean I know I hear Greg talking about Bob will go a little bit more near-prime on auto \u2013 for indirect auto or on a risk appetite, generally speaking. I'm just trying to understand. Are you compensating for that prudence and uncertainty just through higher capital levels? Or are you adjusting your risk underwriting standards as well?","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","No. I think on risk appetite, we've been consistent. All our approaches are built to sustain through a cycle. And I think you've heard Mark say previously, we don't like to make bad loans during good times, so that we can make good loans during bad times. And that continues to be the way we operate the Bank from that perspective. I think, I mean some of these uncertainties will impact capital. Some of the regulatory uncertainties will also impact capital. So we'll see how this plays out. I mean some of the positive thing on Basel I floor is a few weeks old. Let's give it a few more weeks to see whether there's more certainty or uncertainty with respect to some of the other rules that are being contemplated.","Sohrab Movahedi - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. So that is \u2013 so the loan growth metrics that we're seeing, let's say, in the U.S. or in Canada, whether it's business or retail is not really being impacted by your uncertainty, kind of, outlook here?","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","No. Our underwriting standards, like I said, Sohrab, we make loans because we think they can \u2013 they're good enough in a downturn. Obviously a bank of our size, if there is a major downturn, we'll have our share of losses but I'd be very surprised if we are a negative outlier because that's not how we operate the Bank. So, that would be a surprise for the Bank. And so, that's the way to look at how we look at underwriting and risk appetite through a cycle.","Sohrab Movahedi - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Theriault with Eight Capital.","Steve Theriault - Eight Capital","Thanks very much. So, for Riaz or Teri to start. You flagged that there is restructuring charges or elevated restructuring charges in Canadian Retail. It doesn't look like expenses to me are all that elevated and you've delivered very robust 3% operating leverage. So, is there anything that I'm missing there \u2013 we're missing there, anything in the revenue line that might be one-time? Are you able to size those restructuring charges? Any help there would be great.","Theresa L. Currie - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Sure. It's Teri. So, we did take advantage of the strong performance in the quarter for Canadian Retail to accelerate some of our strategic investments. They're investments we've talked about in the past digitizing our customer experience, adding client-facing advisors across the business bank, wealth management and the personal bank, streamlining and rationalizing our products and then optimizing our network, really ensuring that our service value proposition aligns with our customer behaviors and expectations. In terms of the numbers, the way to think about it would be ex the acceleration that I talk about. Year-over-year growth would have been 1%.","Steve Theriault - Eight Capital","Okay. And so, I hear you that you're taking advantage of that strong revenue growth but you wouldn't say there's anything unusual in the revenue line item itself. Is that fair?","Theresa L. Currie - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","No. One thing that I would call out is we obviously had very strong direct investing trading volumes in the quarter and that could normalize over the course of the year.","Steve Theriault - Eight Capital","And was it across banking and wealth and insurance in terms of the restructuring or was it mainly focused on the banking component?","Theresa L. Currie - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","There were elements across a few of our businesses in Canadian Retail. It was predominantly the personal bank.","Steve Theriault - Eight Capital","Okay. And then a couple \u2013 thank you for that \u2013 a couple follow-ups for Riaz, I think. Riaz, in your comments, you suggested the new B II floor is not binding for some time. Could this start to creep back in 2019 or is it more of a 2020 and beyond? Is there any visibility you can help us with there?","Riaz E. Ahmed - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Steve, it would obviously depend on the growth of the various products but I would think we're in reasonable shape for a couple of years.","Steve Theriault - Eight Capital","Okay.","Riaz E. Ahmed - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","At least.","Steve Theriault - Eight Capital","And then just \u2013 okay. And then that's helpful. And then lastly, you mentioned lower TEB when you're discussing U.S. Retail division around the tax changes. And in my mind, TEB is \u2013 if not entirely and primarily a function of equity trading and wholesale. So, is some of that TEB tax rate differential and the CAD 105 million of TEB adjustment for the quarter, is some of that mapped to the U.S. division for low income housing tax credits or some sort of tax related or is it really \u2013 vast majority is mapped to Wholesale?","Riaz E. Ahmed - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Yeah. No, some of it would flow to the U.S. segment. As you know, in our corporate loans and securities portfolio, we may have loans to tax-exempt entities, et cetera, that would be eligible for gross-up.","Steve Theriault - Eight Capital","But is it 50%\/50% or is it \u2013 any sense you could give up on mix?","Riaz E. Ahmed - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","I think the Wholesale side would be the more significant component of it.","Steve Theriault - Eight Capital","Thanks for that. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Scott Chan with Canaccord Genuity.","Scott Chan - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Good afternoon. In the interest of time I'll just keep it to one question. Bharat, you've talked explicitly about potential acquisitions in the U.S. and it can be challenging with the valuations. What about in Canada? The valuations are better to home market? Is there anything that might interest you here that you could be looking at?","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Well, in Canada, our home market, we would look at anything and everything that ever comes up. And if it made sense, then we would obviously look at it very seriously.","Scott Chan - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Like would wealth be like a priority here or distribution? Is there something that might be more of a focus than others or is it kind of broad-based?","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","All of the above, Scott. In Canada, lot does not come available. And sometimes when it comes and TD decides not to pursue it is because it doesn't fit some of our criteria such as risk or return or strategic. That's how we look at it. Those things do matter regardless of where the potential acquisition might be domiciled. So, that's how we think of it. But in Canada, unlike the U.S., we said there are specific sectors that we are targeting, whereas in Canada, we would look at anything that made sense for us.","Scott Chan - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Nigel D'Souza with Veritas Investment Research.","Nigel D'Souza - Veritas Investment Research Corp.","Thank you. Good afternoon. So I had a question related to your Corporate segment. I noticed that non-interest income in the quarter was a loss in the quarter and I saw that there was some reclassification of that line item to Wholesale Banking. Is that the only thing driving that loss? Or is there something else related to change of fair value gains and losses under IFRS 9?","Riaz E. Ahmed - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","No, I think \u2013 Nigel, it's Riaz. I don't think that there is anything particularly unique to call out there because the Corporate segment can have lots of puts and takes. And I think if you just look at the adjusted loss and look at the three line items that are there, net corporate expenses would be a little bit lower this quarter, mostly due to timing issues. And then the contribution from Other would be lower because you will remember that in Q1 of last year we had a gain on sale of some securities. And our non-controlling interests are down because we redeemed certain REIT securities. So I think in aggregate when you take all the puts and takes out, it's really those three things that are driving the adjusted loss in the segment.","Nigel D'Souza - Veritas Investment Research Corp.","Okay. Got it. And just another follow up on the Corporate segment as well for the PCLs. I noticed that ticked up as well sequentially. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand there was some reallocation of PCLs from Corporate to your other segments. So what's driving that move higher in Q1 relative to Q4? Is that related entirely to the card relationship?","Riaz E. Ahmed - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","That's exactly right. I think you have to remember that most of those credit losses that reside in the Corporate segment are either retail or share. So, therefore, they're reported under IFRS that way but don't really affect our NIAs (01:02:56). And, as Ajai indicated earlier, under IFRS 9 methodology, you can have a seasonal migration and volumes elevating the performing PCL in the Corporate segment. And so it's a function of that particular portfolio and not really in relation to the economics for TD Bank.","Nigel D'Souza - Veritas Investment Research Corp.","Got you. And last quick question, if I may. I noticed your allowances for credit losses. They're weighted more towards Stage 1 and Stage 2 than I think your peers. So are you just being more conservative? I know you've spoken on this already. But are you just being more conservative in your outlook since we have had some more positive economic outlooks from some of your peers related to Stage 1 and Stage 2?","Ajai Bambawale - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Yeah. I wouldn't say I'm being more conservative. I think we're doing quite frankly whatever's appropriate for our book.","Nigel D'Souza - Veritas Investment Research Corp.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Bharat Masrani for closing remarks.","Bharat B. Masrani - The Toronto-Dominion Bank","Thank you, operator, and thank you to all of you for joining us. I'm very pleased with our quarter. It's great to see all our businesses performing so well which helped us deliver the numbers we did and also very pleased with our announcement of the dividend increase. And, as I've said every quarter, we can only do this with the dedication of our 85,000 colleagues around the world. So I'd like to take this opportunity to again thank them on behalf of yourselves because they continue to deliver for our shareholders. So thanks for joining and we will see you next quarter.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining.

Additional information on items of note, the bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q3 2013 report to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the presentation over to Ed.","W. Edmund Clark","Thank you, Rudy, and welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and recognize it's been a busy time for a lot of you. Colleen is going to be up shortly to review our results in detail, but let me start by sharing my perspective, both on the quarter and the rest of the year.","Our third quarter results reflect very strong performances in our Canadian banking, Wealth and U.S. banking businesses, offset by losses previously announced in our Insurance business. Earnings, including $418 million after tax in insurance charges, were down 13% year-over-year, and earnings per share were down 14% to $1.65. Excluding these charges, earnings per share would have been $2.10 or $0.45 higher.","We are pleased to declare a $0.04 dividend increase today, our second increase this year as we continue to progress towards the midpoint of our 40% to 50% target payout range. This means that our dividends paid would've grown by 12% this year, great news for our investors.","I'm also happy to report that our share buyback scheme, which we announced last quarter, is well under the way. We allocated approximately $1 billion to repurchase 12 million of our common shares. And as of August 23, we'd already acquired more than 7 million shares. And despite the buyback, our Basel III cap remained very strong at 8.9%.","Let me take a minute now to talk about each of our businesses. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking had a very strong quarter, generating just under $1 billion in earnings. Personal lending was solid, but continues to grow at a moderate pace, while business lending expanded at double-digit rates. We held the line in expenses, which resulted in solid operating leverage. And we got some help from credit, with surprise on the upside again.","I'm also very proud to report that TD Canada Trust won the J.D. Power award for highest customer satisfaction levels among the Big Five banks for the eighth year in a row. And we just learned this afternoon that for the ninth year in a row, TD Canada Trust was recognized by Ipsos as the Big Five bank leader in Canada for its customer service excellence, more well-deserved recognition for the tremendous efforts our employees make to deliver on TD's promise of legendary service and convenience.","Our wealth managed business had a very impressive quarter, with earnings up 18% to a new record level. We continue to see strong net asset inflows. And with markets more resilient in July, we also benefited from higher trading volumes. Epoch is already making a contribution to our results, as well as our future growth strategy, with the integration proceeding smoothly and the new team working together cohesively. We also recorded our best efficiency ratio ever. Our Wealth business remains on track to deliver strong results for the year, as long as the capital markets remain healthy.","As I mentioned, Insurance recorded a loss for the quarter, reflecting the flooding in Calgary and Toronto, as well as an increase in claim reserves in our auto insurance business. We discussed these charges on our July call, and I don't have much new information to share. We do believe that the auto business in Ontario can be inherently a good business, but as I said, we do see challenges, we're going to have to make some business changes. As a result of all these factors, we expect a modest decline in insurance earnings from the normalized 2012 level of $600 million.","Our U.S. retail bank had another very good quarter in the third quarter. Earnings growth was a robust 22%, driven by strong organic loan and deposit growth, the first full quarter contribution from the Target credit portfolio, improved credit quality and increased security gains.","Now as you know, over the last few quarters, we have been shortening the duration of our balance sheet to better manage our capital and interest rate exposures. By regularly triggering unrealized gains in our investment portfolio, we locked in the current contribution to capital. This proved to be a prudent move, particularly in the third quarter, when we were able to take advantage of an opportunity in the markets before rates backed up, to sell a portion of our capital-intensive, non-agency CMO portfolio, which resulted in higher security gains for the quarter relative to our prior guidance and gave a nice boost to our Basel III common equity ratio.","With the increase in long rates, we've adjusted our tractor [ph] strategy and have begun to gradually increase our duration. We expect margins to be stable to improving as we move forward, assuming rates stay at current levels. The 80 to 90 basis points backup in long rates that has occurred since May has significantly reduced the remaining unrealized gains in the portfolio, a phenomenon that's been evident across the industry. This means that we have less scope to trigger further gains, reducing what has in recent quarters been an important contributor to earnings.","Fourth quarter earnings will decline due to a drop in security gains below the $60 million to $80 million level per quarter, to which we have previously guided.","Turning to our Wholesale bank, the third quarter was a softer quarter, with earnings down 18% from the previous year due to lower trading revenue and reduced capital market activity. Looking ahead, we continue to expect uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment and the impact of regulatory reform. However, our franchise model is built to withstand fluctuations in sentiment and activity, and we expect Wholesale to deliver our medium-term target of 15% to 20% ROE for this year.","Let me comment on our expense performance. We signaled [ph] last quarter that the rate of expense growth in the third quarter would be elevated, in line with our ongoing efforts to balance initiative and project spend over the full year cycle. While we expect expenses to rise in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we are still targeting expense growth for the year of 3%, excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX. I'm satisfied that we've made good progress in managing our quarterly initiative and project spend in a more disciplined way.","We are very aware that 2014 will likely be another challenging year with respect to revenue. So we are very focused on finding ways to reduce our expense base so we can continue to invest in new initiatives that continue to build great franchises. So to that end, we are looking carefully at everything we do and whether there are changes which will allow us to do it better for less. This includes continued consolidation of our facilities in Canada and the United States.","In sum, very strong underlying results in most of our businesses, offset by our loss in insurance. For 2013, these results unfortunately mean likely little or no EPS growth for the year. But we remain focused on finishing strong, continuing to invest while driving efficiencies and laying the strong foundation for 2014. With our proven strategy, experienced team and long-term vision to build The Better Bank, I'm absolutely confident that we're well-positioned for growth and success next year and in the years to come.","With that, let me hand it over to Colleen.","Colleen M. Johnston","Thanks very much, Ed, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. Adjusted EPS of $1.65 was down 14% year-over-year, and total bank adjusted net income of $1.6 billion was down 13% from last year. Our Q3 results reflect the impact of the severe weather-related events in Alberta and Toronto and increased general insurance claims we preannounced on July 30. The negative impact on adjusted EPS was $0.45 in the quarter.","Our segment results reflect retail adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, down 10% from last year; wholesale net income of $147 million, down 18%; and the corporate segment, which posted a loss of $8 million. However, the underlying results in Canadian banking, Wealth and the U.S. banking businesses were very strong this quarter.","Please turn to Slide 5. This next slide presents our reported and adjusted earnings this quarter, with the difference being 4 items of note. There's one new item this quarter related to loan losses in the real estate secured lending portfolio as a result of the Alberta floods in June. During our investor call on July 30, we indicated that the loss was not expected to exceed $125 million before tax, assuming no recoveries. The final number booked for the quarter was $65 million pretax, which is our best estimate net of recoveries. Mark will provide further insight later on in his remarks.","Please turn to Slide 6. Canadian P&C delivered a very good quarter, with adjusted net income of $997 million, up 12% year-over-year, a new record. Loan and deposit growth were resilient this quarter. Total loan growth was 5% year-over-year, with real estate secured lending volumes up 4% and business lending growth up a strong 13%. Retail deposits increased 3%, and business deposit growth was 8%. Credit performance continues to be strong, with PCL and Personal Banking down $61 million from last year, primarily due to lower bankruptcies, principally in credit cards. Business banking PCLs declined by $11 million.","Adjusted expense growth was 2% year-over-year as volume growth, merit increases and investment in the business were largely offset by broad-based productivity gains. Operating leverage was 140 basis points due to strong expense management. NIM was up 3 basis points sequentially, attributed to seasonal factors in the real estate secured lending portfolio. Over the next year, we expect modest downward pressure on NIMs, with quarterly margins bumping around depending on product mix, seasonal factors or rate moves.","We expect a very good finish to the year with the same fundamentals but a notable decline in expenses from last year due to timing. Overall, a great result.","Please turn to Slide 7. Looking at our Wealth and Insurance segment. Wealth had a record quarter, with earnings up 18% year-over-year due to strong fee-based revenue from growth in client assets and market appreciation, improved trading volumes and a positive contribution from the Epoch acquisition. During the quarter, we sold our Institutional Services Business to National Bank. While the business was performing well, it did not fit our mass-affluent, high-net-worth strategy. We don't expect a material impact to 2014 earnings from this transaction.","Our Insurance business reported a loss of $243 million after tax. The loss reflects charges of $418 million after tax due to increased reserves for general insurance, automobile claims and severe weather-related events in Southern Alberta and the Greater Toronto Area, as previously announced on July 30.","Wealth and Insurance expenses increased from last year, primarily due to the inclusion of Epoch and higher variable compensation, partially offset by decreased expenses from the sale of the U.S. Insurance business.","The contribution from TD Ameritrade was $69 million, up $13 million or 23% from last year due to higher trading activity and fee-based revenue. We expect the Wealth business to have a strong fourth quarter driven by continued client asset growth and good trading volumes. As we released previously, in the medium term, we expect a modest decline in insurance earnings from the normalized 2012 level of $600 million.","Please turn to Slide 8. U.S. P&C results set a new record for earnings and ROE, with adjusted net income of USD 432 million, up 22% from last year, and ROE of 9.1%. The increase was primarily due to strong loan and deposit volume growth, the impact of a full quarter of the Target credit card acquisition, improvement in credit quality and higher gains on security sales, partially offset by lower net interest margins. As reported last quarter, revenue and PCL related to Target are reported on a gross basis on the income statement.","Noninterest expenses include TD's operating expenses related to the business and amounts due to Target under the credit card program agreement.","Revenue increased by 27% year-over-year due to the inclusion of credit card revenue from Target, strong organic loan deposit and fee growth and higher gains on securities sales, partially offset by lower margins. Revenues included $118 million of security gains, including securities classified as loans, versus $80 million last quarter and $23 million last year. The additional gains reflect the sale of $520 million of our non-agency CMO loan portfolio. As we work to optimize the risk return on the overall portfolio, in particular, with the new Basel III rules in place, we had an opportunity to sell securities at an attractive price where we held dollar-for-dollar capital.","Our level of gains this quarter was higher than our $60 million to $80 million targeted range. We expect the Q4 gains to be below this range. But on average, over the second half of the year, we expect to be within our guidance.","Excluding Target, average loans were up 12% year-over-year, with an 18% increase in personal loans and a 7% increase in business loans. Average deposits increased by 11%. Our net interest margin was up 13 basis points sequentially due to the full quarter impact of the Target acquisition. We continue to see core margin compression in our non-Target portfolio, slightly above the 5 to 7 basis points per quarter guidance that we provided in Q2. We did not have positive accounting accretion this quarter like we did in Q2.","We expect our margins, excluding Target and accounting noise, to stabilize and possibly improve if the increase in long-term interest rates holds.","PCL increased by $44 million, due largely to Target-related PCL. Adjusted expenses were up versus last year due to increased expenses related to Target and investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by productivity improvements.","All in, a good result for our U.S. business. However, we don't expect to be able to sustain U.S. P&C earnings at this level. We expect the fourth quarter to be down from Q3, primarily due to a lower level of security gains, as mentioned previously.","Please turn to Slide 9. Net income in our Wholesale business of $147 million was down $33 million or 18% compared to the same period last year due to lower trading-related revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expenses. Revenues were down 12% year-over-year due to lower fixed income and credit rating. Q3 revenues last year included amounts related to a trading position that was previously considered impaired.","Trading revenues in Q3 were $284 million, slightly below our $300 million normalized level. Noninterest expenses were down by 14% compared to last year, mainly due to lower variable compensation reflecting lower expenses and lower legal provisions. Looking ahead, we expect continued market uncertainty due to the macroeconomic environment and the impact of regulatory reform, but we still expect Wholesale to deliver 15% to 20% ROE for this year.","Please turn to Slide 10. The Corporate segment posted an adjusted loss of $8 million in the quarter compared to a net income of $30 million last year. Higher net corporate expenses, driven by increased employee benefit costs and strategic initiatives, accounted for the major changes on a year-over-year basis. Q3 expenses last year were unusually low.","Q3 results also included an incurred but not identified allowance release of $21 million after tax. For the fourth quarter, net corporate expenses are expected to increase over Q3 levels due to higher project spend on growth and productivity initiatives.","Please turn to Slide 11. Core expenses, excluding the impact of FX and acquisitions, were up 5.7% over last year. Growth in core expenses was driven by a combination of higher employee benefit costs, merit increases and the timing of investments in growth initiatives, partially offset by productivity gains. Q3 expenses last year were low, well down from the prior quarter. Whereas this year, Q3 is fairly even with Q2 when you account for the days effect. On a year-to-date basis, core expenses have grown by 4.4%. We expect to achieve our full year target of less than 3% expense growth for 2013.","We are pleased with our progress this year as we've managed our initiative and project spend more evenly over the year. We do expect Q4 core expenses to be elevated versus Q3, but well below the Q4 increase of last year. Our 2014 planning process is well underway, and we continue to target core expense growth in 2014 to be below the 2013 growth rate. We are looking even harder at our expense base to ensure we can drive efficiencies for next year, including continued consolidation of our facilities in Canada and the U.S. and other initiatives.","Please turn to Slide 12. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 8.9% in the third quarter, an increase of 10 basis points over Q2, primarily due to organic growth, the sale of our non-agency CMO portfolio in the U.S., offset partially by our share buyback program and volume growth.","We are pleased to announce a $0.04 dividend increase on top of the $0.04 we announced in Q1. I'm also pleased to report that we've repurchased more than 7 million shares as of August 23, which will help our EPS growth next year. Overall, we continue to remain well-positioned for the evolving regulatory and capital environment.","Let me comment briefly on AOCI under Basel III. Throughout fiscal 2013, TD has called out the potential volatility of AOCI and the related impact on capital. Over the course of this year, we've been actively managing AOCI, and we've put various strategies in place to manage this issue.","With that, I'll turn the presentation over to Mark.","Mark R. Chauvin","Thank you, Colleen, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 13. Credit quality remains strong across all the portfolios, continuing the trend we've seen during the past year. In Canada, credit metrics remain stable with overall loss rates during the quarter reducing to the lowest level experienced in over 5 years.","Turning to the U.S., the performance of the personal and commercial portfolios continued to improve when adjusted for the Target acquisition completed last quarter. Strong, positive momentum was evident throughout the U.S. commercial portfolio as evidenced by quarterly charge-off rates reduced to the lowest level experienced in over 3 years. Both the number and dollar amount of loans moving into our workout group declined, and classified loans continued to reduce.","Before concluding, I'd like to comment briefly on the loan loss provision taken for the Alberta floods. During the pre-released call last month, we indicated that gross loans resulting from the Alberta flood in the real estate secured lending portfolio could be as high as $125 million. Since that time, we have refined our analysis based on greater certainty regarding the support of the Alberta government in available property and default insurance to arrive at a net exposure of $65 million. I am confident that the $65 million provision will cover losses, which ultimately result from a disaster of this magnitude.","Now I'll turn the presentation back to Rudy.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thank you, Mark. We'll now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] For those participating in person, can I ask you to identify your name and firm before asking your question. Before ending the call today, I will ask Ed to offer some final remarks.","Question-and-Answer Session","Rudy J. Sankovic","So why don't we get started in the room, please. Michael?","Michael Goldberg - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division","Michael Goldberg, Desjardins Securities. In your agreement with Aimia, what protection do you have that they won't degrade the value of Aeroplan points like they did with CIBC? And what went wrong in your deal with Aimia that you and\/or they even felt the need to negotiate with CIBC?","W. Edmund Clark","I think we won't -- we will [ph] get into the details of our deal with Aimia since there really are 2 possible outcomes here: one is that we go along with Aimia as per -- and that's the deal that's in a sense in effect; or two, that we do this three-way deal. And when it's clear which one we're talking about, then we'll undoubtedly have some discussion with it and we can answer relevant questions at that time. I guess the way we look at it is that going along with Aimia is a perfectly satisfactory outcome, from our point of view. And we obviously -- and we're excited and delighted by the opportunity to have this card. On the other hand, I think if there's a better deal to be done, you should always do a better deal. And so if there's a possibility of a three-way deal that also works, then we certainly would be taking a look at that. And so, I think we're in the optimal position, is that if we can't get a deal, a three-way deal, we're delighted with the outcome. But if we can get a better deal by doing a three-way deal, we'll do that too.","Michael Goldberg - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division","Do you have any protection though against the value proposition being degraded?","W. Edmund Clark","What I guess I'm saying is I'd just as soon not -- I mean, we can get a dozen questions on this, so I think when we have or are in a position to talk about the full details of the deal, we'll talk about the full details. But we're confident that if we do either one of these deals, we're confident about the value proposition going ahead, if I can answer that question.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thank you, Michael. Next question?","John Reucassel - BMO Capital Markets Canada","John Reucassel from BMO Capital Markets. Just a question for Mark. Thanks for the clarity on the $65 million, but if I look at $65 million relative to your exposure, RESL exposure on the Prairies, it's still roughly averaging 14 basis points on the total amount or 49 basis points on the uninsured portion. Is that fair to look at it that way? And if so, why -- it seems awfully high, but maybe give some color on what this portfolio is? Is it broker-sourced or if you can give us some more detail?","Mark R. Chauvin","Sure. It's as representative as any other part of our RESL portfolio. But let me give you a little background behind the basis of the provision. I mean, we have identified a number of properties that have been severely damaged where we provided loans. And looking at that, like we understand -- although there's certainty, there still is uncertainty, we know that the level of insurance that they have, either through their own insurance or through what they'll be paid under the Alberta recovery will be inadequate to cover the full -- to fully repair those properties. And then we also know that in certain cases, if it's a vacation property or rental property, they aren't eligible under the Alberta recovery. So in going through this, we've just worked out a number that we think is very realistic, but it's probably prone to come down further if further information comes out that says that the level of recovery through Alberta is maybe higher or other things like that. But it's a pretty well-thought-out number based upon what we know is there now. But you really won't know for sure over 3 or 4 quarters.","John Reucassel - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. So are they a mixture of HELOCs and mortgages or...","Mark R. Chauvin","Yes, they're a mixture of HELOCs and mortgages, and they're about roughly 1\/3 uninsured. But otherwise, they're pretty typical of everything else -- well, that is typical.","John Reucassel - BMO Capital Markets Canada","And were they mainly broker-sourced or were they...","Mark R. Chauvin","No. No, they were just generally sourced in their normal sequence. They were just -- their problem is that they were in flood-impacted areas.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Thanks, John. Next question -- any from the room? Operator, why don't we turn to the phones, please?","Operator","Your first question on the phone line comes from Robert Sedran with CIBC.","Robert Sedran - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up question on the U.S. margin, I guess. I can appreciate that the core margin has been tough to forecast lately, but it has been underperforming your expectations of late. So how confident are you in the new margin outlook that you're providing today? And does it feel like your visibility has improved? And is there maybe a specific product or a portfolio that you could call out in terms of benefiting more like, say, the mortgage product or something?","Michael B. Pedersen","So it's Mike. We're fairly comfortable that if the current rate environment continues, that we're looking at stabilizing or improving margins in the U.S. We've obviously been able to tractor and extend duration a bit recently as rates have been backing up. There is some mortgage compression going on in the market, but that's a much, much smaller book for us. So on a net basis, we feel comfortable in the direction we're going, again, provided that rates stay roughly where they are.","Robert Sedran - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","And Mike, is it the activity that you have taken, since rates have risen, that have given you the confidence? Or is it just that's sort of your view now based on where rates are?","Michael B. Pedersen","Yes, it's mostly the activities we've undertaken since the rates have risen.","Operator","Your next question on the line comes from Gabriel Dechaine with Credit Suisse.","Gabriel Dechaine - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm going to take another crack at this Aeroplan, just to clarify something. So you've got one agreement that was put out in July, I think, that was the one-on-one deal with Aimia, then potential three-way. Is it safe to assume that if it is a three-way, the agreement, the first agreement, some of the metrics in there would change, like planned marketing spend, revenue commitments? Or are you still kind of tied to those?","W. Edmund Clark","I think, frankly, we're not really anxious to get into -- we're obviously in the middle of discussions here. So just to be clear, we have an agreement with Aimia. That agreement is in force, it's gone live. And so, we have a deal going forward. And I think with the 2 of us together, our exploring with CIBC is an agreement that's something that would be interesting to the 2 of us to do with CIBC. And when we have something, if we get something, then we'll be able to describe what that would be. And we can't tell you whether we're going to get something or not at this stage.","Gabriel Dechaine - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on Rob's question on the U.S. NIM, so good news\/bad news story. The bad news on the quarter, though, looks like the core was down 20-ish basis points sequentially. What, in particular, drove that big decline? And then looking forward, if you can -- other than the pulling back on investing short and going back out on the -- extending duration again, what other activities were you talking about, Mike, that make you feel more confident about the NIM? Can you maybe give us a bit more context there?","Colleen M. Johnston","Gabriel, it's Colleen. I'll start. I think the point that's been raised, which is a valid one is that, certainly, the U.S. NIMs have proven to be more difficult to predict with accuracy than perhaps other parts of our operation. And I think that just reflects the number of moving parts, in particular, if you think about all of the acquisitions we've made, as well as the pressures on the core margin. So I think it has made it tougher to predict. If you look at the -- you're not that far off in terms of the actual core decline in the quarter. And I think if you look at that number, part of it was just more deposit compression than we have maybe expected in the range we've provided previously. But to the point, we think we are at the inflection point now where things are starting to stabilize and, in fact, possibly improve if rates hold. And why don't I turn it back to Mike then to just maybe expand on the other activities.","Michael B. Pedersen","There really isn't much I can say to expand. I was talking primarily about the treasury tractor activities as a result of the rates rising in the last quarter.","Gabriel Dechaine - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe what was the negative impact of going short? And then, if we can expect that to reverse, what's the delta there, the positive delta?","Colleen M. Johnston","Yes. Gabriel, I don't think we're going to get into all of the specifics, sort of all the moving parts. But needless to say, again, as we've shortened duration, as we've sold securities, that has created that core margin compression. But now, to Ed's earlier points, as we start to lengthen duration, that does get gradually repriced back into the margin and, obviously, that's good news for our U.S. operation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Routledge with National Bank Financial.","Peter D. Routledge - National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division","Mike, a question for you in the U.S. I know you're just there, but you sort of arrived and the long-term rate -- bond rate went up about 120 bps, and that's obviously having an impact, I'm sure, on the rates you're charging borrowers...","W. Edmund Clark","Peter, are you saying that Mike should take credit for the backup of U.S. rates? Is that your point?","Peter D. Routledge - National Bank Financial, Inc., Research Division","No, although if he wants to, he's welcome to. Just wondering, how worried are you about a -- just a pronounced slowdown in lending, either on the commercial or the -- on the residential side? I've seen Fed data, the weekly Fed data that shows kind of a surprising slowdown in July. I don't want to read too much into that, but are you feeling any pressure in your pipeline on either the commercial or residential side?","Michael B. Pedersen","So obviously, you'd rather have solid flows than slowing flows. And just to give you a bit of color, we've been running in the last year on the mortgage side at about 25% growth. But if you break that down, up until Q3, it was about 30% growth, annualized. And in Q3, it was just over 4%, so more like 16%, 17% growth. And the industry slowed down a lot as well. So there's obviously been a significant slowdown in mortgage volumes in the U.S. I guess it's always relative, and we believe that we will continue to outgrow the competition as we have been. We expect to continue to be able to generate double-digit volumes in mortgages. We are under-penetrated in our customer base, given that this is something we've recently started to focus on. We're building capability in this area. We're adding mortgage lenders. We're also fortunate that we have customers who very much like what we do, so when we ask them to speak to us about their mortgage, they're happy to do so. So we think that we'll outperform no matter what the environment. But yes, the volumes are probably going to slow down a little bit. It's the same on the commercial and small business side. We were outperforming in those areas in terms of volumes. They've slowed a little bit, but we're still outperforming and expect to continue to be able to outperform in terms of volumes. I can't predict what the volumes will be.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brad Smith with Stonecap Securities.","J. Bradley Smith - Stonecap Securities Inc., Research Division","Colleen, just with respect to the Target and the way it's being flowed through the segments, I was just curious, the revenues, are they pretty much exclusively being treated as net interest? And are there expenses that are also flowing through the expense lines in the U.S. P&C segment? If you can just give me some sense for that, I'd appreciate it.","Colleen M. Johnston","Yes, sure, Brad. So when it comes to Target, we're including 100% of the revenues and 100% of the PCL. And on the revenue side, it's largely NII, but there also is some other income there. And then what happens when we get -- take us down to our proportionate share of the earnings, that adjustment flows through expenses, and then we do have some of our own direct expenses that we're incurring to oversee the operation and manage risk and all of that. So our expenses are a combination of those 2 items to bring us back to our share and then the incremental expenses to manage the business.","J. Bradley Smith - Stonecap Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So when you talk about the margin, that is the margin net of the minority interest effectively in it, I take it?","Colleen M. Johnston","No, it's not. It's the gross amount, that's why it has such a big effect on the margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Aiken with Barclays Capital.","John Aiken - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I understand, Ed, that you don't want to get into the details of the negotiations, but question for Riaz. In terms of assuming that there is an agreement that's put in place with CIBC and Aimia, what's the timeline that you need for approvals and to be able to transfer over the card balances? I guess what I'm trying to back into is, what exactly is the drop-dead date for these negotiations? And if these carry on too long, when do you walk away?","W. Edmund Clark","Do you think Riaz is an easier hit and that he's going to answer a question that I wouldn't have? Is that what's going on here?","Mark R. Chauvin","Ed, I figure he's newer, so I might be...","Riaz E. Ahmed","I'm not sure that's going to help you much there, John. I'm going to stay with the answer that the discussions will continue until the parties decide that they have something to say and their transactions would be subject to normal regulatory approvals, including competitions approvals. And it's hard exactly to predict when all that would materialize, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sumit Malhotra with Macquarie Capital.","Sumit Malhotra - Macquarie Research","Hopefully 2 quick ones. First one, just to go back to the effect that Target is having on the U.S. results, specifically looking at the PCL line and credit cards. I think in one of your disclosures, we see that U.S. credit card PCLs haven't really changed much since you brought this portfolio on. Just wanted to get some information here. Was this portfolio brought on having been, for lack of a better term, cleaned up, so that you're starting basically -- basically fresh and that's why the level of PCL in the card book has been low? Or is that just an indication of where credit quality is right now? I don't if I'm explaining that well, but I guess my point is, it doesn't look like U.S. credit card PCL have changed too much since Target came on board.","Colleen M. Johnston","So to just -- to sort of back up, so when you bring this on, we're not carrying impaireds, and we have a credit mark when we closed the deal. But then, what you start to see and, in fact, if you've seen our impaired loans notch up a bit this quarter, and that's as we start -- as those impaireds start to move to their sort of normalized level. But on the other hand, so it's not like we're drawing our current losses against the credit mark, we're actually building up a GA. At the same time, the exact same thing happened with MBNA. So you're just -- you're not seeing it in the credit card line per se, you're seeing it in the GA category. So in fact, if you look at our PCLs on a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year basis, they're up in the U.S., but that's entirely due to Target. So there's definitely a large number there for PCL, but the offset is that we have much better underlying credit performance quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year as well.","Sumit Malhotra - Macquarie Research","I think I have this somewhere from Target's disclosure. But what -- could you just refresh me, what's the loss rate in their card portfolio right now? Where are you trending in that book? It's been...","Mark R. Chauvin","It's around 6%.","Sumit Malhotra - Macquarie Research","6%, okay. And my last question was for Tim. Tim, $1 billion in earnings and no question, so I thought I should break the ice. Loan growth is one area, particularly on the consumer side, that, maybe for a couple of reasons, the segment hasn't looked as good as some peers over the last years. So looked like there were some signs of recovery this quarter. I think some of that is seasonal, but I don't want to answer my own question. So I wanted to kind of take your temperature on the loan growth outlook and whether you think...","W. Edmund Clark","No, no, go ahead, help us out here. It'd be great if you could answer the question, then we could compare it to what Tim says.","Sumit Malhotra - Macquarie Research","I tell you what, I'll stop and say I just wanted to take your temperature on whether the churn in loan growth this quarter is the start of maybe a stronger level than we've seen over the last year.","Timothy D. Hockey","I'm tempted to say it's seasonal and end it there. But I think you're right. Actually, last quarter, we suggested that the growth in loans was going to be sort of reaching not just a seasonal loan, but a little bit of a tipping point. We've seen that in Q3. We're probably feeling a little more optimistic right now about the outlook than we would have this time last quarter, seen some green shoots, if you will. But having said that, we still feel that it's going to be not returning to the heyday of consumer lending or real estate secured lending growth that you would have seen a number of years ago, but probably stronger than you would have gotten an answer from me 3 months ago.","Sumit Malhotra - Macquarie Research","More in line with the sector than you have been in the last year, is that a reasonable expectation?","Timothy D. Hockey","Certainly, this current quarter is, and we expect the same going forward.","Operator","Your last question will come from Darko Mihelic with Cormark Securities.","Darko Mihelic - Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division","And I'm going to ask a question I would normally ask, Ed. It's been a long day, and I think I heard a little change in messaging from you, in your opening remarks, and I want to clarify. You mentioned that you're really going to attack -- or control expenses next year, consider changing the way you do business, including perhaps consolidation. Could you maybe expand upon that? By the light of my screen here, I can see that branches is expanding in Canada and the U.S. for a long time now. Do you mean -- what is it exactly that you mean by considering consolidating?","W. Edmund Clark","Yes. I'd say I think it is fair to say there's probably, call it, a slight shift. So I think we're clearly saying to you that even though I think things have improved in the sense that we have -- rates have backed up, that's a material impact. I think in terms of the U.S., you have to recognize that low rates, while a big headwind for us in terms of the value or the deposit business did produce some security gains for us and a refi business in the mortgage business. And so as rates back up, those tailwinds go away. But all in, it's a better world from us. So if interest rates start backing up here, over time, what you're going to see is obviously our deposit, and that's our strength as a company, there's enormous deposit base, is getting revalued upward. But it does take time to roll in. And so we still look, despite the fact that we see, as we've indicated, that we're bottoming out here in terms of rate compression in the United States, and I think we're getting closer and closer to bottoming out in Canada as well, this is -- as the recovery, as rates go up, that takes time to bleed into our results. So we still see 2014 as a top revenue year. And we're saying we just got to go through every part of the company and keep on saying, is there ways that we could do this with less -- for less and actually do it better? And that means that I think -- we have been looking at branches. We've announced already in the United States a significant number, about 33, I think is the number of branches that we are going to merge in the United States. We've always done a bit of weeding and filling in Canada, and we're continuing to do that in Canada. And it means generally when we look at facilities and say, are there things that we could do where we could have either fewer of these, whatever they are, call centers or offices or whatever, that we should just go through the entire portfolio and say, is there a way of changing the cost structure permanently and getting on with this? So yes, there is a slight nuance in the message here.","Rudy J. Sankovic","So I'll turn it over to Ed for final comments.","W. Edmund Clark","Yes. So basically, as I've said, it's a mixed quarter in the sense that obviously, and we regret we did have a significant loss in the Insurance business. That's not a good event from our point of view. We don't want to round that corner. On the other hand, do we believe that we've got ahead of the insurance issue by doing that? Yes, we believe we do. The great thing is that at the same time, if you look at the underlying performance of our business, we really had record performances in the U.S. P&C business, the Canadian P&C business and the Wealth business. So when you put it together, you can feel good about that even if you don't feel so great about others. So -- and then, we'll focus, as I indicated in the longer answer to your question is, our job now is to get the company positioned to have a good 2014 despite the fact that there's still, I think, generally, there's not a booming revenue number that we're going to have to work with.","Rudy J. Sankovic","Good. Thank you very much, Ed. And with that, I will end the meeting, and thank you for joining us today. So have a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude it."]}}
